For some, it is going to university, getting a degree and embarking on a professional career. However, going to university costs money, which is why many kids do not go straight to university after graduation.\nThere is another option available that allows you to get an education without having to sit in a classroom and sit out a strict schedule.\nStudy at home online courses is the ideal solution for those who simply cannot afford to do so.\u00a0If you are working, you can continue to work but you also learn valuable skills that will help you in your job and allow you to advance professionally without having to go to daily classes.\nWhen you take online courses, you have the advantage of not having to go to a physical classroom.\u00a0You can study on your own time and schedule and learn at your own pace.\u00a0The classes that are available for online courses also give you a much more practical advantage in the work place with the variety of classes that are available.\u00a0You can choose diploma course programs, certificate programs such aviation courses, or take short courses for continuous online education.\nSome students who choose to go to university and work at the same time have difficulty in juggling the time constraints that put additional stress on them and so rarely excel. Being physically present, taking tests and preparing for homework and assigned work due with stringent deadlines does not help when working either.\nWith OnlineCoursesAustralia distance learning and online short courses, these stresses are completely eliminated.\u00a0You do not have to sacrifice your work schedule to accommodate a class schedule. Whenever you feel you are refreshed and ready to learn, you can log on to your class and learn the material.\u00a0You can work on your assignments at your leisure and put forth the effort when you are motivated.\nThe biggest advantage to online courses is the knowledge retention.\u00a0When you study comfortably you are more likely to retain what you learned.\u00a0 This can be a significant advantage over traditional studying.\nTo learn more about online courses for distance education, log on to http://www.onlinecoursesaustralia.edu.au/\nWritten by Admin \u00b7 Filed Under Universities\n"}, {"score": 1323.0419, "uuid": "b165fdf3-eebd-5f6f-a8f3-f3b5b336fa54", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0012wb-47-32457", "target_hostname": "www2.careers.govt.nz", "target_uri": "http://www2.careers.govt.nz/educators-practitioners/tools-and-activities/health-physical-education/", "page_rank": 1.414127e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Health and <em>physical</em> education - <em>classroom</em> activities", "snippet": "&gt; Tools and activities &gt; Health and <em>physical</em> education - <em>classroom</em> activities o Health and <em>physical</em> education - <em>classroom</em> activities o Mathematics and statistics - <em>classroom</em> activities Health and <em>physical</em> education - <em>classroom</em> activities Ideas on how to relate health and <em>physical</em> education teaching", "explanation": null, "document": "Health and physical education - classroom activities\nIdeas on how to relate health and physical education teaching to future careers and life beyond school.\nExternal website links\nIn health and physical education, students learn about their own well-being, and\u00a0the well-being of others.\nBy building career-related activities into your curriculum area you are helping your students to develop the understandings, skills and attributes that they need to make positive career decisions throughout their lives.\nAsk students what physical abilities are required for different jobs\nActivities for Year 7 upwards\nDisplay the Where to? posters for your subject area.

Online courses have been becoming more and more popular, and truly are one of the most convenient ways to achieve your educational goals. A huge benefit to continuing your physical therapy education online is that you can complete your courses at a pace that fits your lifestyle. You won't have to worry about a long commute or traffic, nor what to wear, as you'll be in the comfort of your own home. All you have to be sure of is that you have a strong, reliable internet connection, and a strong work ethic on your part. Many people end up being unsuccessful with physical therapy continuing education online because they do not have the drive or dedication to sit themselves down and work on their own. If this sounds like it could be an issue with you, a regular classroom setting where you are held more accountable for your actions could be the right decision for you.\nPhysical therapy is expected to grow at a faster-than-average rate for the population, which helps to ensure that this field will be a worthwhile investment in your future. To further ensure that this is a good step for you, make sure that you research every single program you are interested in. Some physical therapy programs end up essentially being a waste of your time and money as they are not accredited and the 'diploma' you receive is more or less worthless. Taking these steps helps ensure you won't have regrets later on.\nPhysical therapy is a tough job both physically and mentally, and it takes a lot of training and hands on experience to succeed. Those that have empathetic souls will do well in physical therapy, but they also must realize that by pushing their patients hard they are helping them. By choosing physical therapy continuing education online, even those that are already set in their careers as physical therapists can benefit. In many circumstances, lessons that you have completed are able to be viewed for quite a bit of time after you initially enrolled. This is helpful because if after passing a particular course you find yourself fuzzy on the subject, you can quickly and easily look it up and refresh your memory, thereby helping your patients. Physical therapy is a hard field to break into due to all the schooling, tests, and advanced degrees required, but if you push yourself in physical therapy continuing education online, you stand the chance of working a dream job and helping many people.\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Central Library Cooperative of Knowledge\n"}, {"score": 1276.0315, "uuid": "bfdd7a14-5ac6-5088-8679-420350e1a840", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200tw-51-07264", "target_hostname": "www.onlinecollegecourses.com", "target_uri": "http://www.onlinecollegecourses.com/2012/02/15/20-classroom-classics-that-shouldnt-be/", "page_rank": 1.1939887e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "20 <em>Classroom</em> Classics That Shouldn&#x27;t Be - <em>Online</em> College <em>Courses</em>", "snippet": "Usually, <em>classroom</em> classics <em>are</em> classic for a valid reason.", "explanation": null, "document": "February 15th, 2012 by Staff Writers\nUsually, classroom classics are classic for a valid reason. Some, if not most, of the following even qualify under this heading, but that doesn't stop a generous chunk of students, faculty, and professionals from genuinely questioning their inclusion, or at least musing what all the fuss seems to be about. People sometimes take the literary canon's current status way, way too seriously than any healthy individual should. Those who don't should sit back and enjoy a few rounds of sacred cow tipping.\nWuthering Heights by Emily Bronte: Oh, please. If Emily Bronte were alive today, she'd be scripting MTV reality shows about how intimate partner violence is ever so sexy . But because she's all Victorian, she just glides into English classrooms with a calculatingly casual, \"'What's up?\"\nJane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte: Charlotte seems to think of men who lock their mentally ill wives in the attic as raging sex gods, because that is totally mysterious, attractive, and brooding. When Bertha eventually torches Rochester's place down, there's actually a perverse level of vicariously empowering enjoyment happening.\nRomeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare: With so many other provocative, dramatic works in The Bard's oeuvre, why do so many find this tale of whiny, entitled, self-centered teenyboppers so compelling and romantic? He meant it as a cautionary tale, yet far too many teachers, students, and pop culture figures consider the play some Platonic ideal of how love is supposed to be some all-absorbing, all-consuming, blindsiding cancer.\nRobinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe: Nothing embodies Anglocentrism in the literary classroom better than Daniel Defoe's book that could've been titled Adventure Time with Our Superior White Savior. Sure it necessitates discussions about values dissonance and shifts in perspectives over time, but that doesn't inherently bestow classic status.\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen: Mr. Darcy just needs to disappear for a decade or so. He's pretty much the Wolverine of British literature these days, and a little rest would do him and the frothing fangirls good. Of course, they'd probably just turn some other Regency character into the absolute pinnacle of all that is man.\nCatcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger: Like (almost) every book on this list, Catcher in the Rye isn't actually a bad book, and many lessons can be dredged up from its pages \u2014 even if they're just \"probably you shouldn't do this.\" J.D. Salinger's most popular and polarizing read should be completely jettisoned from high school syllabi worldwide for one reason and one reason alone. That one boy or girl who commandeers the entire class period to talk about how Holden Caulfield is so him or her because of the whole \"misunderstood intellectual\" thing \u2014 despite that not really being the author's intent.\nThe Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway: At least \"Hills Like White Elephants\" was about the controversial topic of abortion. What gleefully sadistic teacher wouldn't want to instigate a boiling classroom drama pitting self-righteous right-wing students against self-righteous left-wing students?\nGone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell: If you read between the lines, you might hear Scarlett O'Hara saying, \"Oh, Rhett! Rhett! Rape me and put me in my place when I get too uppity! And I shall pine for the days when women and especially minorities were kept in subjugation and romanticize them at every given opportunity!\"\nA Separate Peace by John Knowles: Put simply, it's a novel summed up in the following mind-stimulating exchange between wealthy white men who have an ever-so-difficult go in life: \"Dude!\" \"Bro!\" \"Dude.\" \"Bro.\" \"Dude?\" \"Bro?\" \"Dude!\" \"Bro!\"\nAbsalom, Absalom by William Faulker: Anyone who says they understand this book completely is a liar. Nobody knows what William Faulkner meant by any of this. Probably not even William Faulkner. Thomas Pynchon might, but that'd be about it.\nOn the Road by Jack Kerouac: This is for the discerning pretentious snot rag who finds Catcher in the Rye too clich\u00e9 and plebeian a condescension tool. This classic (and it actually IS a classic) exists as a favorite of those hyper-conforming nonconformists who love flaunting just how spiritually centered and free of everyone else's bourgeois materialism and expectations they are, man. This is particularly the case for ones who've never actually read it, but think the book looks great in their Expedit book shelf from Ikea. Never mind that Jack Kerouac rather despised the beatniks and all they stood for \u2014 despite being the movement's god.\nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald: Yeah, yeah. Scathing satire about Jazz Age excess and all that. Just because it's necessary doesn't mean it doesn't drag and drag and drag some more until the very, very end when the drama winds up overshadowed by the relief that everything's finally all over.\nThe Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck: John Steinbeck wrote far, far better examples of simultaneously timely and timeless literature than The Grapes of Wrath, yet somehow it stands as his most common classroom exposure. After a while with this frequent snoozer, turtle soup sounds mighty tasty.\nA Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: The greatest literary mystery of all time is why Lucie Manette piques a romantic rivalry between two men despite her utter lack of any interesting or compelling traits beyond being \"totally pretty.\" Oh, and then some stuff in France happens, but nobody cares because they're too busy not caring.\nMoby Dick by Herman Melville: \"Thar she blows\" describes more than just the whales broadcasting their presence. Many a high school student would rather walk the plank than wade through another page and lug this veritable paper boulder to and from class every day.\nCrime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky: Never, for any reason, teach Crime and Punishment at a Catholic school. It would tip the guilt ratio entirely to the point it ensnares humanity into a perpetual continuum of apologizing about everything and inciting disproportionate suffering as redemption. It's a great book, but so intensely depressing it might actually take second place to Kafka.\nThe Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien: Lower those staves, wands, axes, and broadswords, fantasy fans. This isn't an indictment of the genre so much as a critical quip about J.R.R. Tolkien's style. He undeniably excelled at character and world construction thanks to a fertile imagination, but could've used some work in the execution department, because yikes does The Hobbit (and the other Middle Earth reads) crawl thanks to some overly dense description.\nEthan Frome by Edith Wharton: Fun fact time! Even after finishing Ethan Frome, a surprisingly large proportion of otherwise intelligent and astute readers still won't be able to relay what exactly happened because of the whole, \"Wow. This is so dull I think my brain just folded itself in half\" factor. It would be the bran flakes of the literary world if it didn't make bran flakes taste like hot sauce by comparison.\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark: How many times can Muriel Spark cram \"Miss Jean Brodie's in her prime\" or a variant onto one page? HINT: About as many times as she decides to overdose on flash-forwards for absolutely no discernible or compelling reason. English teachers always want to rub this book all over themselves despite the fact that it reads like some hallucinating high school kid spent a little too long staring at PBS.\nAnything and Everything Ayn Rand Ever Scribbled on Paper: Ayn Rand's entire oeuvre ought not be banned or burned or the like, but she certainly pushed some ideologies that aren't merely controversial \u2014 they're downright dangerous and irresponsible. A society completely revolving around lauding selfishness as a virtue will never sustain itself, and likely result in the widespread suffering of innocent people.

With reduced course costs come an increase in the number of courses an inspector can afford to complete each year, with a corresponding rise in the level of inspector competence. Increasing the level of inspector competence is a direct benefit to consumers.\u00a0 Lower-cost education also gives inspectors the opportunity to pass on savings to consumers.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by\u00a0delaying the inspector's professional progress.\nAccessibility: Online courses are available all the time, anytime, from anywhere.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses for the inspection industry are few and far between.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by limiting access to education for inspectors.\nCollaboration in Development: Online course development often includes collaboration\u00a0among many experts and inspectors from around the world. \u00a0For example, it is not unusual for InterNACHI\u0092s online courses to be the product of dozens of contributors.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by often lacking in international collaborative development.\nExpert Instruction: Online course developers can hire many experts to contribute to each course.\u00a0 Often, in online video courses, the instruction is presented by one or more renowned experts.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom instructors, though perhaps competent to teach a particular subject, are rarely international experts.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by denying renowned expertise instruction to inspectors and limiting them to a local pool of talent.\nNumber of Instructors: Online courses often utilize more than one instructor, with more than one area of expertise.\u00a0 In contrast, most classroom courses are taught by only one instructor.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by limiting the number of expert instructors per course.\nAccuracy: Online courses are reviewed for accuracy before being released.\u00a0 Online courses are also subjected to industry-wide peer review forever.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom instruction is rarely reviewed by anyone.\u00a0 \u00a0The author of this article personally knows of a physics professor who had been teaching the use of an incorrect formula for over 30 years before the error was caught.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by failing to correct misinformation\u00a0given to inspectors in a timely fashion.\nCurrent Course Material: Downloadable, printable online course material is reviewed, edited and improved over time.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom texts are less frequently updated.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being less able to provide inspectors with current course material.\nPictures and Video: Online courses contain pictures and on-location video that permit the inspector to virtually accompany the instructors on inspections of many actual structures and components.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses can\u0092t take inspectors into crawlspaces or on roofs.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by failing to provide inspectors with virtual, real-situation training.\nPace: Online courses move at each inspector\u0092s desired pace. \u00a0Online courses can be stopped and re-started.\u00a0 Online video can be paused.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses move at only the instructor\u0092s speed.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to teach at each inspector\u0092s own pace.\nWasted Time: Online courses are edited to cut out set-up time, off-topic discussions, bathroom breaks, lunchtime, etc.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses contain much wasted time.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by diluting the training time with things that don't increase inspector competence.\nSchedule: Online courses are available when each inspector wants to take them.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses have inflexible schedules that require inspectors to attend when it is inconvenient, when the inspector is ill, when the inspector is tired, etc.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by forcing inspectors to study and learn at a preset schedule.\nQuizzes and Exams: Online courses contain numerous short quizzes that assure the inspector has learned each section before moving on to the next.\u00a0 These quizzes are graded instantly, and often alert the inspector to incorrect answers immediately.\u00a0 Some even have built-in intelligence, which recognizes each inspector\u0092s unique areas of weakness, and reviews those areas until the inspector grasps them.\u00a0 Classroom courses typically have fewer quizzes, without instant grading.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being less diligent about assuring that each inspector has learned and understands every concept being taught.\nReview: Online courses permit inspectors to go back and review areas of weakness. \u00a0For example, InterNACHI\u0092s online video courses permit the inspector to rewind and replay them\u00a0over and over.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom\u00a0material is typically\u00a0covered only\u00a0once.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to allow inspectors\u00a0go back and repeat material to strengthen his/her particular areas of weakness.\nRepeat: Online courses permit inspectors to take the course over again.\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses are typically taken only once.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being all but impossible for inspectors to re-take over and over.\nInstant Grading: Online courses contain quizzes and final exams that are graded instantly.\u00a0 Instant grading permits the inspector to be alerted to areas of weakness while still engaged in the course.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses typically don\u0092t grade instantly.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to instantly grade each quiz and exam.\nConsistent Grading: Online courses and quizzes are graded consistently over time and around the world.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses grade easier or harder, depending on where and when\u00a0the inspector\u00a0takes each course.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to grade inspectors consistently.\nAdvanced Courses:\u00a0 It is financially feasible to offer advanced courses online. \u00a0An online course need be developed only once, yet can run for years.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses usually must be of an introductory nature to attract enough students to pay for an instructor each time it is offered.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to financially sustain advanced course offerings.\nSpecialty Courses: It is financially feasible to offer specialty courses online.\u00a0 An online course need be developed only once, yet can run for years.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses usually must\u00a0have a\u00a0common enough appeal of subject matter in order\u00a0to attract enough students to pay for an instructor each time it is offered.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being unable to financially sustain specialty course offerings.\nChoice: Online courses offer inspectors a wide variety of choices in both level and subject matter.\u00a0 In contrast, classroom courses are fewer and farther between.\u00a0 Compared to online courses, classroom courses harm consumers by being less likely to offer the training inspectors need, when and where they need it.\nCommunication: Online courses often provide an Internet forum for all current students, graduates, instructors, experts, developers and interested parties from around the world to interact with each other and discuss the course.\u00a0 These course-specific forums provide continuing education to inspectors long after completing the course.\u00a0 Classroom courses harm consumers by rarely providing such widespread, post-course interaction.\nIn summary, online courses allow inspectors to study and learn at little or no cost, without having to travel or lose business, when and where they want, with well-developed, accurate courses taught by experts, using updated course material, pictures and video, at their own pace and schedule, with the ability to review and repeat, and with the assurance they'll end up with a thorough understanding of the chosen topic.\nHome inspection licensing board members or government bureaucrats who steer inspectors away from online course offerings by rejecting their Continuing Education approval based solely on their method of Internet delivery create a disincentive to inspector skill-set improvement, which ultimately harms consumers.\u00a0 And because much of an inspection report includes safety issues, the harm may also be physical, instead of merely financial.\u00a0 In some cases, the harm may result in the actual death of either the inspector or the\u00a0consumer.\nVisit InterNACHI University\nInterNACHI commends the following fine organizations for their consumer protection policies toward online education of home inspectors: www.nachi.org/education.htm\nBelow are the names, pictures, addresses and phone numbers of home inspection licensing board members and government bureaucrats who summarily withhold Continuing Education approval of online courses and, thus, are responsible for the financial and physical harm, and perhaps even death, of their fellow citizens:\nAs of today, no InterNACHI online course approvals have ever been rejected by anyone.\n"}, {"score": 1156.6257, "uuid": "e51827a5-f939-5e52-b8d0-c8f6ba5ed456", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0205wb-41-17244", "target_hostname":

This program does not require much education and is ideal for people who like sports and physical activities. If you have ever encountered a sports related injury, you should know firsthand how important a physical therapist is in someone\u2019s recovery. An associate\u2019s degree in physical therapy should only take two years to complete and then you can get out into the job force. You can move onto a bachelor\u2019s degree program if you choose to, which will require another two years of training.\nThere are a number of programs to go through to get your associate\u2019s degree in physical therapy, but why not consider getting your degree online? Penn Foster Schools and Stratford Career Institute both offer that option (among others), so you can gain your education right at home if you would like.

(and supplemented by a good instructor\u2019s feedback.)\nDr. Frank Varney\nOctober 6th, 2009 at 12:09 pm\nThe last two comments make some excellent points. Yes, I don\u2019t doubt that there is an \u201cunwillingness to adapt\u201d on the part of some people; can we also agree that there is an excessive eagerness to embrace new technology on the part of some others? And yes, a sucky classroom course is still a crummy course; but it\u2019s far easier to quickly adapt to visual clues from an audience you\u2019re actually in the room with. Think about this; if you\u2019re dealing with someone and need honest input from them, which would your prefer; reading a letter or e-mail from them, or talking to them on the phone? Talking on the phone, or seeing them as you speak to them? A lousy teacher, whether in person or online, is still a lousy teacher. There\u2019s no way online can fix that. But a good teacher will find ways to adapt. It\u2019s simply easier to adapt when you\u2019re actually in direct communication with someone. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, online works fine for some things; it\u2019s the haste to pronounce it wonderful that alarms me, and the concept expounded in the article that it actually is superior to traditional methods.\nAs to Ron\u2019s comments; yes, some people discredit any new approach, and that\u2019s regrettable. And other people rush to jump onboard any new idea, and that can be a problem too. The problem is, as you point out, that those who hasten toward the future sometimes needlessly alienate others by discreditng their perspectives as stodgy or outmoded. That serves neither side. To Ron\u2019s last paragraph; video can easily be incorporated into lectures. I did so this morning. At various points in the video we paused and discussed what we were watching \u2013 and I prepared students to be on the lookout for things that were coming up. Sometimes their comments took us in new and unexpected directions. I personally think it\u2019s harder to have that immediacy online, particularly in non-interactive courses. My point, once again, is not that online can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t work; it\u2019s that no one has really given an example of how it\u2019s superior. Sure, you can imbed a video into an online course; you can also do so in class. You can engage in a message-board debate; you can also have debates in class. And in person, in my humble opinion, is more immediate and easier to respond to. So you don\u2019t have to convince me online can work; I just do not accept the premise that it\u2019s better simply because it\u2019s newer, and that those who are resistant to it are simply unwilling to give up their captive audience, or are resistant to change.\njrb@msu\nOctober 6th, 2009 at 4:14 pm\n@Frank V, RE: \u201cI just do not accept the premise that it\u2019s better simply because it\u2019s newer\u2026\u201d.\nThe study in question (remember the study?) is pretty clear on this point \u2013 it doesn\u2019t say unconditionally \u201conline is better\u201d.\nIt says online is often better because it (again \u2013 when well done), encompasses more things that ultimately make up good teaching and learning \u2013 more time on task, more engagement, more interaction, ability to advantageously utilize different media, etc..\nSee my original Sept 2nd comment.\nFrank Varney\nOctober 6th, 2009 at 4:25 pm\njrb@msu; Please do bear in mind that I am replying, at this point, to previous comments. The discussion has moved beyond the original article. And also bear in mind that my original comments were not bearing on the report, but the article which was published online. That was, after all, what most readers saw; a headline asking if online courses would make traditional courses obsolete.\nAs to your recent comment, I agree; anything, when done well, works better than something not done well. As to the remarks as to why online (when done well) is better; more time on task? Relative to what? Time actually spent in the classroom? Students online take as much time to complete assignments as they need. So do students in the classroom setting, if we are speaking of assignments done outside the classroom. Since online students do pretty much ALL of their work outside the classroom, this is not a valid comparison. More engagement? In what sense? They are unable to effectively engage their professors or classmates in a real-time discussion. Or does \u201cmore engagement\u201d mean a higher degree of committment? How do we quantify that? Do we assume that because grades in online courses tend to be higher, that signifies better student commitment? Might it also not signify the problem of difficulty in grading online courses, or because often are taught by adjuncts, who tend to grade more easily because they are more vulnerable to student dissatisfaction ? More interaction? See my above comment. I do not see how engaging in an exchange of messages online is superior to an exchange of ideas in an open forum where everyone is present. Ability to advantageously utililze different media? In a classroom you can show a video, use a powerpoint presentation, or do anything else you can do online. In fact, a traditional classroom course can have an online component; mine do. But a totally online course does not have the option of having a face-to-face setting.\n"}, {"score": 1123.5281, "uuid": "9f5c5ea6-581a-5164-91e9-d275f7356261", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0108wb-00-12652", "target_hostname": "www.ebc-tefl-course.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ebc-tefl-course.com/online_tefl_courses/accredited_hybrid_tefl_course.htm", "page_rank": 1.3792264e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>online</em> tefl <em>course</em>, <em>online</em> TEFL training <em>course</em>, TEFL jobs, <em>online</em> TEFL", "snippet": "As the world progresses and technology improves, the <em>physical</em> need to be in a <em>classroom</em> with your <em>course</em> trainer for your <em>classroom</em> training becomes less necessary.

The flipped classroom approach offers another option \u2013 essentially flipping the time and location of these activities, so that students view recorded lectures and read course materials outside of class, then meet to engage in problem solving, discussion, and practical application exercises with their instructor.\nThe flipped classroom is a growing trend in the redesign of courses at K-12 and higher education levels. You may have also already encountered similar concepts such as reverse instruction, pre-teaching, and video podcasting (or vodcasting ). There are a range of techniques and strategies that could fall under the term \"flipping a classroom,\" but most involve elements of blended learning with online and offline components. Online video elements are now more readily available than ever. In addition to user-friendly lecture capture applications (e.g., Camtasia , Panopto ) that allow you to record your own presentations, resources such as the Kahn Academy are garnering a lot of attention specifically related to the flipped classroom approach.\nOnline learning environments have already seen implementation of a number of the techniques gaining ground in flipped classrooms, as the need to serve students at a distance required pre-recorded presentations and a wide variety of web-based materials. The goals of the flipped approach include improvements in teaching and learning through the effective use of technology. Many instructors are touting their success with flipped strategies, but there are still issues to be resolved. The flipped classroom approach, while gaining popularity, it not a silver bullet for success and should be tailored for the learning environment, context, and specific learners involved.\nPotential Benefits\nThere is a potential for increased student interaction both with their instructors and with each other through this different use of traditional class time. High school instructors Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams, two of the earliest classroom flippers, report that they are better able to attend to individual student needs, and directly observe where their students need more assistance by working with them in the classroom on learning activities and lab exercises, instead of using that time for lecture-type presentations. Using class time to respond to common questions and review difficult concepts that were covered in the recorded presentations is also a potential benefit of this format as a more direct and immediate response to student questions.\nChallenges Ahead\nBefore moving to a flipped model, it's critical to consider what resources your students have both at home and outside of class (i.e. libraries, student centers) to access web-based materials. There is a question of Internet access as well as of devices to receive the content. While much of the online content described above could be easily posted through a service like YouTube, if students don't have a reliable way to view (i.e. smartphone, tablet, computer) and access the video, this approach may be counterproductive.\nThe flipped classroom as described by many educators continues to rely on a lecture format that many argue are not an effective way to teach. Moving lectures from on-campus to online is not necessarily an improvement. This approach does, however, provide an incentive for instructors to review existing lectures and consider revisions\u00a0or alternative formats for content delivery.\nExamples from the Field\nBergmann and Sams collaborated on their work as chemistry teachers and recorded their class presentations with the use of lecture capture software in order to make the content available to students who frequently missed courses in their rural school district. In a series of articles on TheDailyRiff.com they explained how their role evolved from \"presenter to learning coach\u2026 answering questions, working with small groups, and guiding the learning of each student individually.\"\nLast year Daniel Pink highlighted the work of Karl Fisch, a Colorado high school teacher, in an article for The Telegraph. Fisch recorded his algebra lectures and posted them to YouTube. He asked his students to watch the videos as homework and then worked with them at school to complete related math problems that would traditionally be assigned as \"homework.\" The benefits realized here include the ability of students to review class lectures as they need to, pausing, replaying, etc. and of the instructor to observe and interact with students as they complete learning activities.\nClassroom Salon is a software application that allows for the switch in traditional classroom activities and is currently in use in higher education. This tool builds on digital texts and not only encourages students to read, but also annotate and discuss their reading assignments online, before coming to class. In the classroom, they engage in deeper discussions about what they've read and discussed with their instructor as a guide. Instructors at Carnegie Mellon University, the originating institution for this project, find that their students are better prepared for class discussions and the time they spend in a physical classroom is used more effectively.\nTips for Flipping\nIn another post from TheDailyRiff.com, a group of educators provide their vision of what a good flipped class should look like. This list of characteristics offers solid guidance for moving forward with your own course. The recommendations include fostering student-led discussions, employing real-world scenarios, providing opportunities for spontaneous tutoring and collaborative learning, and encouraging student ownership of the material.\nThe Connected Principles site offers 3 Keys to a Flipped Classroom reminding\u00a0us that it's not just the approach, but also how it's executed that matters. Homework is one consideration and difficult to get students to complete in any form. Flipped methods may or may not be more engaging for your students. Lesson quality is also a critical element of this technique \u2013 sequencing what will be presented, as well as when and how it will be presented, can make a difference in maintaining student interest and attention. Production quality can make or break the online component of your flipped classroom, affecting how this content is received. As these authors state, \"We expect students to produce great work for us, we should do the same for them.\"\nWant to find out more?\nJoin The Flipped Class Network , a Ning community of learning professionals interested in sharing flipping techniques. This group currently has over 2300 members who are actively exchanging information and resources. Review the resources provided online by the University of Northern Colorado on the Vodcasting and the Flipped Classroom site.\u00a0Here you'll find guidelines on creating and posting online videos, a series of blogs written by educators who are using flipping techniques in their classes, and frequently asked questions about the process. Explore a collection of Flipping the Classroom resources on the \"Teaching with TED\" wiki.\u00a0This site includes relevant TED Talks, such as one from Salman Khan of Khan Academy, as well as YouTube videos and SlideShare presentations.\nThe flipped approach continues to evolve as educators explore and experiment with new instructional strategies and technologies. There's no one right way to proceed, and it may not be appropriate in all educational situations, disciplines, and environments. The concept can be interpreted and implemented in different ways for different learning contexts. Have you experienced a flipped classroom as an instructor or student?

On campus, no one ever expects a jock to have an insightful comment or for a geek who sits up front not to have all the right answers. The truth is, it happens; students are human, not stereotypes. But in person, they may feel strong-armed into living up to their often undeserved, set-in-stone reputations.\nFind the right school for you\nDegree:\nSubject:\nProgram:\nAnd it's not just stereotypical jocks and geeks. Gender bias can be alive and well in the traditional college classroom, too. Consider these quick facts about gender inequality in the traditional campus classroom, courtesy of Columbia University:\nMale students speak for longer periods and with more frequency than female students\nFemale students who speak up in class are interrupted more often\nInstructors are more likely to call on male students than female students\nSometimes those types of social dynamics can make a classroom so uncomfortable that students simply give up. What's the point of raising your hand to ask a question when you feel like the aggressive student in the back is going to make a big deal about it the next time you're thrown together for a group activity? Or worse, yet, what if your instructor huffs at being interrupted? And what about the pointing and staring? There's no doubt: classrooms can be uncomfortable at times.\nOnline classrooms encourage communication\nThat's not to say that online classrooms don't create special challenges for instructors, too, or that some of these same biases don't exist, but online classrooms have an advantage because they are still new and evolving. As better technology and online classroom software has emerged, instructors have been able to adapt lessons to incorporate multiple instructional strategies for all types of learners.\nThe Illinois Online Network created by the University of Illinois points out that in the process of adapting lessons for online classrooms, instructors refocus attention on the instructional design of the course. And this refocusing, in many instances, has led to an emphasis on improved communication and interaction as the course is redesigned for an online environment.\nOnline education , then, allows instructors to evaluate their teaching closely, remedy inequalities and bias, and deliver high quality instruction for all types of learners. Online instructors, of necessity, pay especially close attention to the communication process, as it's imperative for online classrooms to work. Instructors usually have very clear communications policies because your learning community depends upon it; the professor expects to get an email from you when you have questions! With that kind of commitment to communication and with a safe online environment in which to participate, you have that golden opportunity to be the successful student you've always wanted to be -- free from any negative in-person, classroom dynamics.\nTips for succeeding in online classrooms\nTo succeed at learning in an online program, you must be comfortable communicating online. Here are some tips that can make your online learning experience everything you expect:\nGet help with the technology if you need to. Nothing will wreck your confidence and keep you from participating if you're not sure how to use the portal, chat rooms or other online classroom tools.\nAsk for examples of great online discussions and other class interactions. It can be helpful to see in detail an example of how successful online classrooms operate and how online students treat one another.\nGive sufficient thought to all your communications. Take your time and choose your words carefully.\nTreat others with respect.\nMake a genuine effort with both your instructor and your classmates and be an active and contributing member of your online class.\nUse common emoticons when appropriate. For online discussions and informal classroom interactions (meaning, not your semester research paper), these additional clues replace physical gestures and reduce the chance that your post could be interpreted as angry. :D\nKeep in mind that if you don't want to participate in a learning community or communicate with your instructor or classmates, you might fare better with an independent learning-style course , of which there are many offered online. With the continued evolution of online education and the careful attention of education professionals, you can have a quality education experience that suits your needs as a student -- with absolutely no pointing and no staring.\n"}, {"score": 1110.073, "uuid": "00d11948-1ace-59ff-851d-df876f3825d5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1412wb-32-07049", "target_hostname": "www.theorganizedclassroomblog.com", "target_uri": "http://www.theorganizedclassroomblog.com/index.php/blog/online-teaching-ideas-a-guide-to-better-knowledge-sharing", "page_rank": 1.2015164e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Online</em> Teaching Ideas - A Guide to <em>Better</em> Knowledge-Sharing - The Organized", "snippet": "Since, they incorporate a touch of flexibility; many <em>online</em> students tend to take the approach lightly.

The habit of offering feedback should be maintained all through the course term for instilling a sense of self-confidence among the learners. Be positive will offering your feedback and let him or her know politely about the areas of improvement that can lead him to be a better learner. Be a friend and guide to the online students rather, than maintaining a strict teacher-like approach.\nBe a master in applying these strategies and you can turn out to be an efficient online instructor, helping your students experience a swift transition into the online learning mode.\nRobert Williams loves to write on various topics related to learning and education.

Which all means that education is a massive industry. Far bigger <em>than</em> the recreational game industry is going to be for the foreseeable future.", "explanation": null, "document": "March 30th, 2009 | Crystal ball , Opinion\n\u201cOh no\u201d I can hear you say, an article about education . Boring. Yet it should be one of the most exciting things you can read about. It is the education industry and their heritage that have made it boring. And if it is boring for us then just imagine how boring it must be for the victims of our current system. Let\u2019s face it, standing a teacher in front of a class must be one of the most inefficient methods of imparting knowledge ever invented.\nWe are massive consumers of education. We start in formal education as toddlers and emerge in our 20s. Often none the wiser. And we learn far more out of school than we do in school. Then we have vocational training, usually continuously in our fast changing world. Plus our hobbies and interests that can often involve absorbing more knowledge than a degree course. Which all means that education is a massive industry. Far bigger than the recreational game industry is going to be for the foreseeable future. Which is very nice for us because gaming is perfectly suited to education. Far more so than the current classroom/teacher system. Our one on one, challenge-reward mechanism is the most perfect way yet of imparting knowledge.\nI have watched our industry try to get into education for thirty years. And failing, continually. Because we try to do learning using games. We try and fit in with the old, inefficient teacher led systems. But we have had successes when we don\u2019t try to fit in. Dr Kawashima\u2019s Brain Training, for instance. And these successes come when there isn\u2019t a teacher in sight, because they are true game based learning. And teachers and true game based education are incompatible. You cannot have them both at the same time.\nTeachers, at best, think that games are chocolate coated broccoli. A way of dressing up knowledge to make it palatable. They are wrong. Gaming is the optimum delivery system for giving the human mind knowledge. Because it is one on one interactive, because it creates exactly the right challenges at exactly the right time, because it can readily mix text with sound with pictures with videos, because it rewards the student properly at exactly the right time, because it is connected to the sum of all human knowledge, because it is non linear thus presenting knowledge in a more natural way, because it progresses the student at exactly the right pace and because it is connected to countless other people.\nWith proper game based learning it is very simple to keep a track of every student\u2019s progress. But more than that it is very easy to see their strengths and weaknesses in all their complexity. The aptitudes of every single student will be plain to see. Which would lead to everyone having the optimum further education and making the right career choices for their abilities. Which would be a massive improvement on the current hit and miss methodology. So students wouldn\u2019t just learn more, with better understanding and more quickly. They would also be learning the right things for them and for their life ahead.\nIt isn\u2019t just goodbye to classrooms and teachers. It is also goodbye to exams and school inspectors. Because any student\u2019s knowledge and capabilities would be there to see in real time on the system. In fact exams are a very bad thing as they hold the majority of students back until everyone has mastered the syllabus to a given point. With game based learning you are going to have a lot of people educated past degree level by the time they are 18.\nBut the people who stand to gain most are those with \u201clearning difficulties\u201d who just cannot get all the attention they need with current learning methods. With game based learning they will have one on one learning that will push their aptitudes and capabilities to the limit resulting in much more fulfilling lives.\nSo what are we going to do with all the teachers? Teach them to stack shelves in Tescos? Nope, there is something far more important for them to do and that is to prepare children for their futures in the real world. Not by teaching, but by mentoring. By guiding every single student, one on one, so each one can get the best out of our society and our society can get the best out of each student.\nSome educationalists who have a grasp of this seem to think that you still need a physical school. That each student has their own workstation. They call it \u201cpodularisation\u201d. And they are wrong. All a student needs is a device connected to the interweb. A home computer, a netbook or even a smartphone . Yes, that\u2019s right, smartphones replacing teachers. And OnLive technology, or something similar, could be harnessed beautifully to deliver it all.\nThe next thing that is going to shock is that much education will end up being free. Once it is all written and on a server the incremental cost for each extra student is zero. And as we have seen with so many things on the interweb there is an inevitable constant downwards price pressure till zero is reached. This will open up and democratise learning like never before. It will be more influential than the invention of the printing press. Anyone, anywhere in the world will be able to consume whatever education they want any time they want, delivered to them in the optimum manner for them to absorb. This will massively advance the whole of humanity.\nI would like to thank Nolan Bushnell and all the other speakers at the Game Based Learning 2009 conference for stimulating my thoughts on this subject.\nRelated stories\n"}, {"score": 1072.5017, "uuid": "2502f4db-f52b-5f47-a4a0-872c5cb99dc9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0307wb-15-26226", "target_hostname": "brookdalecc.edu", "target_uri": "http://brookdalecc.edu/pages/202.asp", "page_rank": 1.1834528e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Online</em> <em>Courses</em>", "snippet": "Many <em>online</em> <em>courses</em> require an initial orientation meeting, and some require proctored testing.

Now that people are finally beginning to realize that treating one another like garbage over petty details might not be the best thing for students, parents and school districts alike are formulating various strategies to put an end to the madness. Some are actually incredibly innovative, although some of the more traditional methods boast their own benefits as well.\nIncorporating babies into the classroom\nInfants, come to find out, can be useful for reasons other than producing poo and barf seemingly on command. Toronto-based Roots of Empathy and similar organizations have started introducing babies into classroom settings with the hopes of encouraging students to build compassion. And so far, it's actually yielded results \u2014 participants tend to loosen up and pay closer attention to lessons and each other, lessening bullying instances in the process.\nComic books\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Stop Bullying initiative printed up comic books to distribute to kids with the hopes of shedding light on a serious issue. Other schools have run with the concept by asking students to write and draw scenes or stories of their own. Visualizing the realities makes it easier for younger kids to recognize the problem and either intervene or fetch a caring adult.\nFilm\nSimilar to the comic book example, some schools have opted to show movies such as The Bullying Project and foster discussions between students, faculty, staff, and parents about the roots and solutions. More resourceful institutions might want to challenge kids \u2014 especially teens \u2014 to shoot short films of their own. Doing so will not only help bring forward real experiences and perceptions, but offer a sort of creative solace to bullying victims as well.\nHave students teach one another\nIf babies are unavailable, try establishing (monitored!) programs where students sit down with one another and simply talk. Areas with very diverse demographics could especially benefit from such exchanges, because cultural misunderstandings and stereotypes do often feed into bullying situations. In addition, this structure can also be adapted into a peer counseling service, nurturing a sense of connection and community dissuading brutality.\nBulletin boards\nYounger children with a preference for bright colors and engaging visuals might benefit greatly from learning about the bullying problem via bulletin boards. Kits are available through various vendors, or teachers can put their design skills to good use with something more original. Involving the students themselves in the creation process will only add to the education factor, encouraging them to speak up while speaking out.\nApps\niPhone users suffering beneath a bully's grip now have the free A Thin Line app at their disposal \u2014 and those who do not own the smartphone enjoy the same perks on the accompanying website. MTV sponsors this digital discussion by allowing kids and teens to share their own experiences with unwanted advances and harassment. For the adults, they post numerous resources and questions to help them combat the serious issue at the authority level.\nPuppet shows\nPacer's KIDS AGAINST BULLYING program hosts puppet shows in schools as a means of teaching the younger set why bullying is unacceptable. Schools without the funding or resources to bring the initiative to their students can stage their very own performances using what's on hand \u2014 or task students with writing their own. Beyond puppetry, the same concept also works when presented as a skit or short play.\nPeer intervention\nTraining students to serve as peer counselors and advocates bridges gaps with the faculty and promotes greater understanding in the classroom. Pacer and other anti-bullying organizations burst with excellent suggestions about the best ways to nurture leadership and empathy skills needed to reach out the bullies and the bullied alike. After all, as the next innovation reveals, sometimes the perpetrators need intervention for more than just their behavior problems.\nTherapy\nMany \u2014 not all \u2014 bullies lash out at their peers because of issues at home or within themselves, and the most effective schools realize they need as much (if not more) counseling than their victims. In Charleston, a partnership between Alice Birney Middle School and Medical University of South Carolina has started providing various psychological services for ill-behaved kids. When combined with a rigorous education regimen, their bullying rate decreased as more and more students received the mental help needed to be a more productive citizen.\nCoordinating with sexual assault awareness, prevention, and crisis organizations\nAnother fruitful partnership that quelled the bullying issue understandably involves anti-violence shelters and schools themselves. In Austin, SafePlace, which serves as a shelter for victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic abuse, and a half-dozen public elementary schools teamed up for a CDC- and University of Texas-sponsored program dubbed Expect Respect. Unlike many other initiatives, it focuses on bullying in its myriad forms, comparing and contrasting instances on and off campus.\nAdult intervention\nNo matter how many peers end up with counseling and advocacy training, it's up to adults to properly discipline kids who bully. Any school hoping to curb instances of harassment, even assault, must absolutely ensure that parents, faculty, and staff all understand the signs of a perpetrator and a victim as well as proper intervention techniques. They also must make sure to always be available when witnesses and the bullied both need immediate assistance.\nInvolve students in policymaking\nIn order to ensure the best possible peer and adult intervention strategies, the best place to turn for advice is the student body itself. Not only will this foster a closer school community by making kids feel appreciated and important, it also means updated information regarding their most pressing concerns. Adults are always inevitably a step or two behind youth culture; putting forth the effort to \"get it\" will make a world of difference.\n\"Character education\"\nThe best educations blend the usual academic subjects with lessons in displaying a strong ethical fiber. Unfortunately, that's not found in many schools. Your Environment Inc., one of many programs addressing this disparity, succeeded by incorporating parents and the surrounding community into the mix. Bullying impacts far, far more than just the kids involved, so making sure the neighborhood understands the details ensures a safer space.\nEncouraging journal keeping\nAsking students to regularly journal their thoughts and experiences will not make bullying disappear, but it can supplement other activities quite adroitly. Ones not meant for peer editing or sharing will especially grant them a relatively comfortable venue through which they can channel their anxieties. Accomplishing this, however, requires a comfortable classroom where students know they might express themselves without negative repercussions.\nPartnering with popular entertainment\nSince so many education experts and parents point their fingers at violence on television as one of the many pop culture phenomena responsible for bullying, it seems almost counterintuitive that they'd voluntarily pair off with an organization they often decry. Creative Coalition, National Education Association, and Health Information hooked up with World Wrestling Entertainment for the Be a STAR program, meant to encourage positivity in the classroom and beyond. Developers believe that delineating between the real and the staged will provide a better point of reference for students hoping to use fists over discussions when solving differences.\nImplementing arts programs\nNot only are creative pursuits excellent strategies for preventing bullying from the top down, it also empowers students to feel more confident and expressive \u2014 tools needed to combat verbal, physical, and sexual violence. In Montgomery County, Maryland, in-school and after-school arts programs are intended to nurture positive traits and, in turn, healthier, happier campuses. Because they launched in the 2011-2012 school year, the actual results have yet to start trickling their way through.\nAssemblies\nOld-fashioned, yes, but still an effective strategy for facilitating discussions about bullying and other serious campus issues. Depending on their needs and resources, schools can either bring in outside presenters or stage their own addressing specific student needs. Just make sure programming doesn't talk down to kids or focus more on \"edginess\" over education.\nMentoring younger students\nMiddle schoolers, for better or worse, do look up to high schoolers for advice and insight about trends and attitudes. Some districts have taken advantage of this natural phenomenon by asking older kids to either mentor or produce materials (such as PSAs) for their eventual successors. Instead of turning toward outside sources, they reinforce their own communities by addressing specific problems and channeling any unique cultural quirks.\nMusic\nStart teaching students about the dangers of bullying earlier through catchy tunes, such as this Pacer Center album with contributions by Blue October and other musicians and poets. Music serves as an excellent mnemonic when learning about the alphabet, shapes, numbers, and other subjects, so it makes perfect sense that elementary school students could soak up social lessons the exact same way. Consider this or other compilations or stoke creativity by challenging kids to pen their own jaunty songs about how to not be horrible to one another.\nEmpathy education\nThe whole \"babies in the classroom\" strategy is only one element in a broader movement toward \"empathy education.\" Similar to character education, these lessons emphasize compassion with the goal of lessening bullying through love and mutual understanding. Such teachings either happen in the classroom, through special sessions, or via after-school programs.\n"}, {"score": 1058.1531, "uuid": "9f44a6a8-7f18-5e98-934f-b4194bb203c3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0805wb-52-10367", "target_hostname": "www.learn2.maine.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.learn2.maine.edu/ispring.asp?ltr=all", "page_rank": 1.5075577e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Spring Semester <em>Online</em> <em>Courses</em>", "snippet": "The rest will be <em>online</em> live classes using Blackboard Collaborate (an advanced virtual <em>classroom</em> technology that allows for synchronous live <em>courses</em> over the Web including audio).

The specific goals of any class, or course, must be clear in the mind of the teacher, as well as the best methods for the type of classroom, and type of content presented.\nTraditional education and online education each have unique advantages. The emotively supportive face-to-face environment of the classroom allows immediate feedback, and an immediate social environment, which has been viewed as essential to a quality educational experience. Facial expressions and body language are vital clues to the level of student understanding and engagement, and fundamental to recognizing those \"teachable moments!\".\nThe traditional classroom usually requires everyone travel to a single location, and there is a fixed amount of time for interaction.\u00a0Larger class sizes limit the opportunity for interaction and the true individual attention students receive. Private interaction between teacher and student is often severely limited in a busy classroom. Due to diversity of background, attitude, and other factors, the ideal of Socratic small group interaction at a high level is often beyond practical attainment in many traditional classrooms.\nThe online classroom can also be emotively supportive, but in a medium that is so new as to be poorly understood - interactive reading and writing. Not all students are equally prepared to function well in the online classroom. An online classroom allows anyone, anywhere, anytime the opportunity to participate, without pressure from limited time or public speaking in front of a group.\nWhile there are too many subtle advantages and disadvantages to list here, the reality is that both the traditional classroom and the online classroom have very real advantages and disadvantages, which require a teacher to think clearly about specific student and curriculum needs and the most effective means for presenting different types of content.\nThe issue becomes: when does use of the online classroom most benefit the student, and when does the traditional classroom most benefit the student? We now have alternatives to the traditional classroom which, when used wisely, benefit students and teachers, alike. As we gain more experience, and confidence, with use of the online classroom, our expectations will become clearer. Most teachers would agree our goal is to teach the love of learning, and to do the very best we can for our students.\nWhether using online activities within a traditional classroom, or as out-of-class \"homework\" activities, combining online activities to create whole online courses presents additional possibilities and issues.\nThe availability of online courses at anytime, from any location, supports the current boom in\u00a0 home-based learning. Home-based Internet access supports ongoing opportunities for lifelong learning, group dialogue, participation in communities of interest, and access to local community and global expertise. At the same time, online courses can be an inferior alternative to the traditional classroom for some students.\nKeeping a Clear View of the Importance of Building Social Skills.\nIf we taught an online course, would we lose the face-to-face emotive support of the classroom, and those near intangible human benefits, that literally define good teachers as role models, listeners, and personal mentors? Not necessarily. This direct student contact is the source of satisfaction that motivated most of us to become teachers in the first place! Is this something that can be replaced by collaborative Internet tools and written interaction?\nWhile we can't look into students' eyes or read their facial expressions and body language, we can read between the lines of their written interaction to a greater degree than most would anticipate. While building students' online reading and writing skills, most teachers are pleasantly surprised by the opportunity for intimacy presented by access to private online communications with students. Many teachers find they get to know students at a much deeper level than the limitations of the traditional classroom previously allowed. Many unique communication capabilities that have never existed in the traditional classroom are now available to teachers and students.\nFor some students, in some content areas, online education might be a very poor substitute for a good teacher and classroom interaction. For other students, in some content areas, online education might be far more motivating, efficient and more in the students' best interests, than the traditional classroom. As teachers, we need to learn how to discern what opportunities are best for individual students. Face-to-face social skills, character development, and learning to be a good citizen are more important today than ever before. Online social skills are increasing in importance as well, for many of the same good reasons. To properly prepare our students, we need to strive to improve social skills in both contexts.\nStudent Prerequisites for Online Learning Outside the Classroom\nStudents must have convenient access to the Internet at home or through school, library, and community computer labs.\nStudents must have basic knowledge of computers, Internet, and typing.\nStudents must have their own email accounts or access to a group conferencing program.\nStudents must demonstrate the maturity to responsibly use the Internet, and their own email accounts, or lose these privileges.\nStudents must be self-motivated to get online and conduct their \"homework\" Internet activities.\nStudents must have the self-confidence and maturity to be engaged in their own learning to the degree they will interact openly and honestly like joining Online Degree Programs\nBlended Learning: Supplementing a Traditional Class with Online Interaction\nNote: Searching for the latest buzz phrase \"blended learning\" will yield many current resources.\nTraditional classroom instruction evolved originally during the industrial age in the context of training future workers to follow instruction for rather rigid work roles. In the information age, the nature of work and the skills needed to be successful, are markedly different. Students must be able to teach themselves whatever they may need to know, at a moment's notice, and also to find highly specific information, quickly in an inquiry-based, self-directed learning context. Students must learn to collaborate effectively around short-term collaborative problem-solving projects, both face-to-face and online. Multiple emerging new Internet communication mediums require building reading, writing, and thinking skills, in preparation for self-publishing, and self-expression, in a multimedia format.\nBeyond supplementing traditional instruction with use of Internet access to additional resources, and project-based learning units, if your students have access to the Internet outside the classroom, the door for extending your classroom beyond its walls and fixed time schedules is opened.\nWith the exception of desktop video conferencing, the online classroom has no immediate verbal exchange, and no visual cues for body language or facial expressions, but it does offer immediate connections to global resources and collaborative tools. Online, using new forms of interactive reading and writing, we listen with our eyes, and speak through our fingers, at anytime convenient, leaving a written record of all interaction available for reflection at any time. This develops reading and writing skills in a new, motivating, social, collaborative context!\nOnline instruction, and opportunities for online interaction, can be available to anyone, anytime, anywhere, given basic literacy, minimal computer literacy, typing skills, and access to a computer with Internet connections. Affordable ongoing education is now becoming feasible for billions who have never before had the opportunity.\nOnline interaction with community members, students and teachers in other classrooms, and experts Internet-wide, becomes conveniently accessible both inside, and outside the traditional classroom.\u00a0 Such \"extension of the classroom\" discussions and activities can begin to replace the national average of six hours per day of passive TV viewing with a far more engaging and educational use of that time.\nSelf-motivated students are likely to excel outside the classroom environment if given the access and skills for self-directed learning via Internet, particularly at home. The reality is students spend 19% of their time in school, of which typically only a tiny fraction is spent on the Internet. The availability and use of Internet in the home will go far to helping the student develop self-directed Internet learning skills and become more self-motivated.\nIt is not inconceivable that SAT verbal and written scores could show a serious improvement in as little as one year using online communications. Most students, and at-risk students in particular, find online communications highly motivating. Not only will they be eager to read and write, but because they are writing for a peer audience they will often be more concerned about spelling and grammar than if they were writing only for the teacher. Your challenge will be to create educational applications for online interaction and to attempt to minimize frivolous, patronizing, and/or inappropriate online communications.\nOnline learning is becoming more and more modularized, similar to the short tutorials listed in the \"help menu\" for virtually all software programs. We can expect to see new, more efficient, models for applying these modularized online learning units for individualizing student instruction. Further, we need to be scouting for these best models as they emerge.\nLess motivated students often require the physical classroom environment for motivation and monitoring of their progress, as well as the emotive encouragement for which individualized face-to-face instruction is best known. Consider the benefits of allowing motivated students the opportunity learning online outside the classroom giving you more time to devote to your students who require more personalized help. Consider having your motivated \"online\" students mentor the initial online learning of your unmotivated students.\nOne possible use for online instruction might be the removal of students with serious behavior problems from the classroom. This does not have to include removing them from their obligations to learn from your online lessons. On the other hand, as stated in the last paragraph, perhaps it is indeed these students who most need direct face-to-face motivation, while the regular students would benefit most from the flexibility inherent in online learning.\nDepending on the level of 'self-directed learning' vast numbers of students could benefit from your online lessons, allowing a teacher to impact more students than the traditional classroom model would ever allow. We're limited only by our imaginations!\nThere are three recent high level studies on the importance of the web for education, listed among top resources for professional development of educators and web-based curriculum resources:\n\"World Class K-12 Web-based Education\"\nKey Advantages of Online Instruction\nThere are real instructional advantages to using the online medium:\n1. Interactive reading and writing can produce twice the memory retention in one quarter the time invested. Educational research suggests 15-25% memory retention from lecture and video presentations vs. 40% memory retention from reading written material. When reading, the student is participating, rather than passively listening and/or viewing. The research suggests written words are symbols concrete enough to readily form permanent memory, where images, and a spoken lecture, can be so fleeting as to leave little permanent impression or memory.\nAnother advantage is that students can read an online lesson at their own speed, often 400-1000 words per minute, rather than to listen to a spoken presentation of 120 words per minute. It can be boring to be presented information at rates slower than one desires to assimilate information. Thus, online instruction may offer twice the retention in one quarter the time compared to a traditional classroom presentation.\nAlso, the amount of time invested in lesson preparation can often reduce the time required for learning by students. Online education has the potential of providing students with learning experiences representing far more preparation time than the traditional teacher can routinely provide.\n2. The depth of student engagement with curricular content is arguably greater when a student must articulate his/her thoughts online, in writing, both to the teacher and, particularly, to other students.\nWritten interaction can require more depth of thought than verbal interaction. Writing for a peer audience is vastly more motivating than writing for the teacher, knowing your words can possibly end up in the waste basket without another person ever seeing them. Interactive reading and writing provides a level of mind-to-mind interaction that is fundamentally different from, and in many ways better than, verbal face-to-face interaction. Ideally, online and face-to-face interaction can be balanced to bring students the best of both mediums.\nAs a teacher, we need to learn what content, in what situations, for which specific students, provides for the best overall learning experience. Students think most when they have to express themselves; when they must rearticulate what they've learned. The written online medium has the potential to require that students concentrate, reflect, and articulate their thoughts and responses to both teacher and fellow students. This higher level of forced reflection requires rational deliberation and builds thinking and expressive skills.\nWhen writing online for a peer audience, students are held accountable to articulate what they've perceived, by virtue of their online writing leaving a written record. Students must regularly USE the information they have read, when interacting online. The online medium is less socially distracted in that it presents an environment for more equitable sharing of ideas from both teacher and students than the time-limited, socially oriented, classroom.\n3. Unique opportunities for individual relationships with students become viable.\nThis is not to say face-to-face interaction in the classroom is not vitally important; it is; but it is inherently limited based on factors of time available, class size, and social inhibitions in front of peers. Online discussions between the teacher and individual students may be the ONLY private communications the student will have with the teacher. The time required for such one-on-one interaction may be restrictive for the teacher, but the depth of intimacy from such \"text-based\" relationships will often be of higher value than the classroom relationships because of this valued private sharing opportunity.\n4.\u00a0The advantage of transcending the limitations of the 50 minute hour comes from adding an online instructional component to your traditional classroom instruction with online discussions and the opportunity to ask, or answer, questions on a 24 hour/day, seven days/week basis. As is especially true with larger class sizes, the level of one-on-one interaction is often minimal. Online interaction, both teacher-to-student and student-to-student, enhances your students' engagement with the curriculum and better prepares them for the next classroom experience. At the same time, their reading, writing and collaborative Internet skills are being developed in a social interaction context!\nUntapped Future Potential: Consider an online discussion in a computer lab setting where students would begin by reading the teachers introductory written comments, and would then write their own ideas, followed by reading the comments from their classmates, and then posting their reactions to these comments? The amount of interaction after a 50 minute hour would be many times that of a traditional verbal discussion. This one example is intended suggest that our current understanding of the educational benefits of online interaction is only the tip of a very big iceberg!\nSince the WWW is so new, we're all kindergartners in the information age and must learn through direct, hands-on exploration, one step at-a-time! Our expectations of what online instruction, and interaction, can bring to the traditional classroom will increase as we gain more hands-on experience. Be patient with yourself!\nOur sense of \"play\" and spirited exploration will be important to\nminimize our anxiety about the newness of these capabilities.\nPainting a Moving Train\nAs of 2007, the proliferation of new free web tools for social collaboration and creating\nweb content has literally exploded.

Anyway, here\u2019s mine.\nI like Dean\u2019s opening point: much classroom-created content (the majority?) suffers from poor design. (Warlick touches on the same idea with his \u201ccompetitive information products,\u201d though the worker-drone connotations of \u201cproducts\u201d still irks me, as it focuses more than I would like on economics and money-making, more than on aesthetics and character, I would argue \u2013 but anyway\u2026.)\nChristian\u2019s interview suffered from poor audio quality, so I couldn\u2019t understand much of it (we\u2019ve all experienced the wrath of the techno gods, so I sympathize). I did catch, though, the exploitation of simple walking distance and space between buildings as a learning opportunity, and that resonated. Our own campus is very restricted by its hilltop, woods-surrounded setting, which is the opposite of the example Christian used of having to walk a mile between buildings: we\u2019re too cramped. But WE DO HAVE THOSE SURROUNDING WOODS. That\u2019s fascinating in this new light. I\u2019m picturing possibilities of assigning students \u2013 in small groups, so the discussions are diluted by too many voices and not enough time \u2013 to take digital voice or video recorders of whatever sort into the woods to record conversations in that setting \u2013 I can\u2019t help but hope that the setting would influence the discussions in interesting and more thoughtful ways. Have them discuss a theme from our reading of King Lear, for example, or whatever topic might benefit from the meditative openness of a wooded setting. Recording these discussions \u2013 video seems more desirable, when I think about it \u2013 would allay most fears of \u201cunsupervised\u201d students in the woods. Take the footage back into the classroom and quick-edit these \u201ccampsite seminars\u201d into short films. I\u2019ll have to try this. It\u2019s literally (shameless blog plug) \u201cBeyond School\u201d (I just migrated to a new, self-hosted URL, by the way, so check out the new WordPress home).\nDr. Schwier: \u201cDoes it work? Is it beautiful? Is it powerful? Is it inspiring?\u201d This is refining my \u201ccampsite seminars\u201d idea above. I said \u201cquick-edit\u201d those seminars just now. Why rush? Why not assign them to be voice-overs for iMovie projects that add BEAUTY and FORCE via film, stills, music, titles? Yes, yes, yes. In fact, I\u2019m seeing now that two or three class sessions of this new mode of \u201cclass discussion\u201d \u2013 sitting on the pine needles under the autumn trees \u2013 might be best, to give students time to adapt to talking in natural surroundings, in \u201cnature\u2019s temple.\u201d Talk about \u201ceducational architecture\u201d \u2013 how about the dome of the sky over a canopy of pine?\n(I\u2019m liking this very much, Dean. Thanks for this very innovative angle. Much of the K12 conference so far has been school-2.0-as-usual, if you get what I mean.)\nAt 12:00 now: Planning. I\u2019ll play along with my Campsite Seminars whim above, and apply the rest of your presentation, when possible, to it. Consider this a \u201cteacher think-aloud.\u201d\nSo the Seminars \u2013 I think they\u2019ll actually work better for something more relevant to my students than Shakespeaere (which they and I love). I think, instead, it will work for the classroom blogging \u201cCapstone Project\u201d I\u2019m currently launching with them.\nThe idea of that project for my high school seniors \u2013 so close to the end of their 12 year sentence of infantilization in schools \u2013 is to help them learn about whatever their passion, and their possible future (a)vocation, is, by reading real-world bloggers who share their passion(s), and writing about what they read on their own blogs.\nThey\u2019ve already created their blogs, and this weekend, are composing their \u201cabout\u201d pages and searching for feeds about their passion(s)/interest(s) on Bloglines (I still haven\u2019t found a better feed-searching engine than Bloglines\u2019). They\u2019ve claimed their blogs on Technorati, embedded Sitemeter and Clustrmaps. Now they\u2019re ready to connect.\nThe problem I think I\u2019m fighting, though, is that they don\u2019t understand the magical potential this project offers them to make connections with people in the world of kindred passions. They\u2019ve never linked to a writer in a blog post, and seen that writer turn up a day or two later in comments.\nThey\u2019ve been too busy writing 5-paragraph essays \u2013 or homework-assignments-as-blog-posts, which is the New Abomination \u2013 about irrelevant subjects to tired teachers all their lives to write about what they love to real-world readers \u2013 so they just don\u2019t get it. They don\u2019t know how to dream; and they don\u2019t know how dreams can become realities through connective writing.\nSo, in short, I\u2019m trying to introduce them to the world beyond school, but they\u2019re so \u201cstudentified\u201d they seem unable to see this as anything but homework because, after all, I\u2019m a \u201cteacher,\u201d and they are \u201cstudents,\u201d and all of this is happening in a \u201cschool.\u201d\nSheesh.\nSo I think these Campsite Seminars are better suited to serving as a \u201cretreat from school\u201d in both the spatial and the psychological senses. I want them to think \u2013 possibly for the first time, since so many of them are so constantly addled by the pressures of \u201cschooliness,\u201d the homework, the SAT\u2019s, the college applications, the school spirit jive, on and on \u2013 about WHAT WORLD THEY WANT TO ENTER WHEN THEY LEAVE SCHOOL FOREVER in seven short months.\nSo back to you, Dean: How do I plan for these 70-minute retreats into the woods to bear fruit? [Clicks \"play\"....]\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose of your movie?\u201d\n\u2013Hm. In an attempted nutshell, to figure out:\n1. What makes you tick.\n2. What you want to become.\n3. Which is what you will read about on blogs and other sites.\n4. And what you will write about\u2026\n5. For an audience you want to attract.\nOkay, that\u2019s about as far as I\u2019m going to take this here. I see Dean asks for feedback on his blog, and on the wiki he made for this, etc, and suddenly feel like my students when they\u2019re dealing with my tendency to have a million sites for classwork\nSo I\u2019m going to copy/paste this on Dean\u2019s blog, and continue the project on mine.\nDean, it was a very valuable presentation. You got beyond the tools and beyond the generic edublog talk.\nThanks.\n"}, {"score": 1046.8876, "uuid": "90c85e2b-3faf-5d73-8a84-95dcc25ff8e3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0007wb-49-25236", "target_hostname": "qpsychics.com", "target_uri": "http://qpsychics.com/aerokinesis-course.html", "page_rank": 1.2153609e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Aerokinesis - Free <em>Online</em> <em>Course</em>", "snippet": "D Study faster, learn <em>better</em>--and get top grades with Schaum&#x27;s Outlines.

If a parent suspects their child is experiencing genuine psychical phenomena, it is best to educated them primarily in the established sciences associated with the specific phenomena. Parents can make learning enjoyable by creating games to maintain psychical stability. Parents should be mindful of terminology and descriptions in relation to psychical phenomena used around the child. Using terms like \u0093psychic\u0094 or \u0093gifted\u0094 can result in the child using these terms in conversations outside of the home.

The assessment of online asynchronous discussion should initially focus on participation and include a social aspect. This allows the student to gain a level of assurance with the technology and reduces the natural anxiety associated with expressing opinions to an expert and peers. Feedback within the discussion forum can then guide students toward resources that help them gain a deeper understanding or expand their points of discussion.\nGrading strategies should also be designed to encourage cooperation between students, but still value independent research. When identifying a grading scheme it is useful to encourage collaborative learning by allowing students to start their own discussions on topics. This is also an excellent way to identify to students\u2019 core areas for discussion (areas that the instructor administers and contributes to heavily) as opposed to non-core areas of interest (areas where the instructor passes administrative responsibility to a learner).\nThe grading scheme below met my requirements for the online discussion forum:\n\u2018Each contribution I believe to be based on a good argument earns you 5 marks. A contribution with reasoned arguments making use of good references (from the internet, New Scientist, a book or preferably a journal article) earns you 8 marks. Starting a new discussion topic altogether to which others contribute and in which you act as discussion leader earns you 20 marks. An amusing contribution (i.e. makes me laugh) earns 10 points. Arguments that are purely philosophical earn you 3 marks. Back of the envelope calculations based on some correct physics earns you 8 marks.\u2019\nInstructor participation\nA key point that needs careful consideration is that the online discussion environment needs to be led by an active online instructor. The online instructor plays a vital role in guiding the discussion. In this context, the instructor provides student motivation, guides collaboration, and navigates discussion away from tangents. In my experience, without significant participation by the course supervisor debates will not move forward successfully because a high-level of expert knowledge is required to focus debate. Responses to discussion items also need to be clear \u2013 in my context if there are good physical reasons against an argument provision of a reference is ideal, and instructor participation therefore needs to provide focused feedback (rationale here not clear).\nSubject matter\nMy initial attempts at using classroom and online discussions occurred in an advanced electronics course focused on Instrumentation (PHYS319). Discussion of issues in class helped with overall understanding, but in general it was difficult to engage students and motivate them to learn more through examination of the literature. In retrospect this partial success was partly due to a lack of imaginative material. For example, perhaps discussion of the vital role of signal processing in robotics or other \u2018exciting\u2019 subject matter should have been used as a focus for online discussion. Currently, I use asynchronous online discussion to focus on issues associated with Climate Change. The breadth of information available on the different aspects of this issue naturally lends itself to online discussion since it is generally possible for learners to find a specific issue that interests them. However, feedback from questionnaires did suggest the instructional strategy was perceived to be of significant value and lent itself to other topics.\nUnderstanding the medium\nOnline debates/discussions are asynchronous and this means discussion momentum needs to be maintained \u2013 and this is one of the key roles of the instructor. In addition, while long, detailed posts and responses clearly demonstrate student understanding, the value of shorter posts with relevant links, images (especially graphs in scientific disciplines), and other media are equally valid and potentially more useful to the collaborative learning experience. The different ways learners assimilate information should be borne in mind and the ability to use different media (video or audio files for example) should be considered.\nUser interface\nMy initial experience of forming online discussion groups was disappointing, and I believe one of the major factors for initial failures was associated with technological issues, the most important being the ease of use and user familiarity with the discussion interface. Initial discussion group forums developed using the University of Canterbury learning management system performed their function adequately, but the interfaces were not intuitive and I felt provided a \u2018false\u2019 environment. After discussion, a colleague suggested a social networking site that allowed the formation of discussion groups might provide better results. Facebook, which is a popular social networking site among students, was selected as an online interface. This had has several benefits. In particular, the majority of students in classes had experience with Facebook and were comfortable with the interface. In addition, their previous experience on this social networking site created an informal environment that helped start-up. As students automatically consider Facebook to be a non-judgemental environment, they were more prepared to express their opinions.\nA distinct benefit of Facebook for the instructor is that initial development of discussion groups is intuitive, includes a range of useful templates, requires no specialist software, and also offers significant potential for the production of instructor-developed content. Facebook group templates generically contain a discussion tool, digital image and video viewers, a news facility, and a message board. The development of a simplistic computer-supported learning environment is therefore easy and potential uptake is extremely high. The ability to write specialist content is also achievable and could provide significant opportunities for more advanced implementations.\nFurther Reference\nGiven that the main novel aspect of this practice is the development of online discussions, it is most natural to find relevant resources on the internet. The following web sites, which I have used in the development of this guide, have proved to be valuable hubs for discussion on online pedagogy:\nThe ERIC (Education Resources Information Centre) web portal: http://www.eric.ed.gov\nThe \"Teach Online\" Pedagogy & Techniques by Michigan State University. http://vudat.msu.edu/pedagogy\nEducational Resources from the Illinois Online Network http://www.ion.uillinois.edu/resources\nThe works by Krantz (2000), Maroulis and Reushle (2005), and Schellens and Valcke (2006) were of considerable value. I also found that the principles of good practice indicated by Chickering and Gamson (1983) were invaluable.\nReferences\nChickering, A.W. & Gamson, Z.F. (1987).

Making discussion participation a graded component of the course pushes the students to make high-quality contributions. Many instructors use rubrics, not only to evaluate student participation consistently, but also to communicate expectations clearly to students.\nWriting Learning Objectives That Help You Teach and Students Learn (Part 1)\nNew and even experienced instructors commonly do not spend sufficient time considering the learning objectives for their courses and this lack of consideration often results in a mismatch between course content, activities, and assessments, as well as less-than-optimal learning, frustrated students, and poor evaluations. In online courses, clarity is even more critical because miscommunication is common and students get frustrated and off track more easily.\nSign up for our free eNewsletter: Faculty Focus\nFaculty Focus publishes articles on effective teaching strategies for the college classroom - both face-to-face and online.\nYou have our promise not to sell or share your email address \u2014 ever!\nCustomer Support\n"}, {"score": 1044.9321, "uuid": "acb6c2f9-c06d-5592-ba76-8d2c6d1057d7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1111wb-41-09796", "target_hostname": "www.knpanima.org", "target_uri": "http://www.knpanima.org/tag/courses/page/3", "page_rank": 1.1913295e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>Courses</em> | <em>Online</em> Education - Part 3", "snippet": "The outdoor education activities, outdoor education <em>courses</em>, outdoor education programs <em>are</em> offered to kids, children, adults by outdoor education schools or outdoor education centers.

The course was structured around a series of asynchronous Blackboard \u2018modules\u2019 (sets of readings, videos, and interactive content, plus discussion and small assessments) plus a series of virtual 2 \u2013 3 hour audio/video discussion sessions using Adobe Connect.\nA screenshot of a typical Blackboard module. Note learning goals and instructions, followed by links and embedded content\nDuring these sessions, students collaborated in group activities using Adobe Connect\u2019s \u2018breakout room\u2019 feature, and then met up again as a full class to continue the discussion. One class session also involved a videoconference between the students at a distance (all participating via Adobe Connect) and a local Duke class led by David Malone. As an aside, Stephens, her TA and Malone reported that the students participating at a distance were far more \u201cengaged\u201d in the discussion than the students in the live, local course.\nA screenshot from an Adobe Connect session. Note that students can enable their own webcams, though they most often would keep them off unless they were presenting or commenting.\nOutcomes\nThis course was deemed a success by both the faculty and students. The combination of technologies selected (primarily Blackboard and Adobe Connect) enabled the faculty member to achieve her learning goals for the students, and she felt that her vision of an interactive, engaging, discussion-based seminar on contemporary issues in education was achieved.\nStephens reported that from her standpoint, the course went very well. The course TA, Lauren Miller, who was heavily engaged in the course planning and delivery, also felt that the course was successful. Feedback from the students submitted via the standard course evaluation process indicated that the students agreed that the course was successful, rating it on average as good or better than other Trinity summer courses according to comparisons made by the Office of Assessment.\nIn addition to the standard set of course evaluation questions, supplementary questions were added regarding the technology used in support of the distance learning needs of the course. Student ratings of the technology indicated that they were comfortable using the technologies selected and that these technologies were effective in promoting and supporting interaction with both the instructor and the other students. \u00a0Comments from students made it clear that in fact the success of the technology exceeded their expectations in terms of reliability and effectiveness. Students unanimously agreed that they would recommend the course in this online format to other students.\nProbably the most significant aspect of the success of this course was the extent to which the faculty member and TA were able to successfully create a course which was highly interactive. The faculty member felt that the students\u2019 participation in online discussions exceeded her expectations, and using the breakout group functionality of Adobe Connect, the course not only included whole class but also small group discussions. As an illustration of this success, the instructor pointed out that when her class remotely joined a campus course taught by another education faculty member, the online students participating remotely appeared to her to be more vocal and engaged in the conversation than the students who were physically located on the Duke campus. The ability of Adobe Connect to allow side conversations (text chat) was noted by both the faculty and students as an enhancement to the class conversations, allowing students to ask side questions of the TA and others without interrupting the flow of the conversation in the online class.\nFactors contributing to course success, as reported by the instructor and students\nThe on campus technology orientation session for the students prior to the start of the course,\nThe nature of the course, including its small size, seminar format, and contemporary issues focus, which was particularly conducive to lively conversation even in the online setting,\nHaving a TA, particularly to help in developing online course modules prior to the start of the course and to assist students during interactive Adobe Connect class sessions with side questions, technical issues, and managing the electronic whiteboard tool (when used) so the instructor could focus on facilitating the discussion,\nThe flexibility of the technologies selected, particularly the various features of the web conferencing software and its relative ease of use for both the students and instructor,\nSetting realistic expectations for the technology up front with students regarding the potential for technology glitches,\nThoughtful advance design and preparation of online learning modules incorporating varied media types and content delivery approaches (rather than simply posting recorded lectures).\nChallenges reported\nThe technology supported most of the activities that the instructor wished to include except one; namely, there was no way to incorporate pre-recorded video segments into the interactive class sessions via Adobe Connect. A reasonable workaround was identified (asking the students to go and watch the video and then return to the web conference for a discussion after a suitable period of time had elapsed).\nStudents experienced some occasional difficulties in their connectivity \u2013 in some cases they worked around these creatively by changing locations during the session (e.g., driving to a coffee shop and then logging back onto the discussion) or by viewing recordings or transcripts later to catch up on anything missed. Overall these issues did not seem to present much of a problem for any of the students.\nStudents had some scheduling difficulties given the wide range of time zones and the fact that some were working or interning during the course; however, the faculty member reported that all students were able to work out these issues and actively participate in the online discussions. It is important to note that all of the students participating were still in the continental US. Any future courses that involved students further abroad would make using synchronous technologies such as Adobe Connect much more difficult logistically.\nThe faculty member and her TA both indicated that the biggest difference in preparing the course was in the amount of advance preparation required, particularly the time spent locating and evaluating content for use in the online modules. Overall the faculty member indicated that she felt the total amount of time required to prepare and deliver the course was comparable to a campus-based course, but that much more of this time was spent on the front end rather than during the course.\nStephens plans to revise the course and teach it again in Summer 2011.\n"}, {"score": 1036.0314, "uuid": "8366ddfa-ef45-541d-bd0c-6c49eb92c46e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-99-16057", "target_hostname": "www.solarenergy.org", "target_uri": "http://www.solarenergy.org/online-courses", "page_rank": 2.3670275e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Online</em> <em>Courses</em> - Solar Energy International", "snippet": "Q Does <em>online</em> learning cost more or less <em>than</em> in-person learning?

Who shouldn\u2019t take online courses?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Just about anyone can take an online course \u2013 from an office worker\u00a0 to an engineer. All you need is time, a computer, a good internet connection, and a desire to learn! We do NOT recommend online learning if you don\u2019t have access to a computer or reliable internet connection, you just really don\u2019t like computers, or if you learn best/only through practical, hands-on activity and practice. If you must touch it to get it, online learning isn\u2019t for you. However we must note, many of our students opt to learn the fundamental concepts online, and then gain practical experience by following up with an in-person hands-on lab workshop.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 What do I need to be able to learn online? What kind of technology do I need?\nA\nLaptop and Desktop Platforms\nPC (Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7)\nIntel-based Mac (OS X 10.4 and later - Power PC Mac has limited support and may have issues displaying the presentations)\nHardware / Internet Requirements\nMinimum screen / monitor resolution is 1280 x 600\n256 MB of RAM, 2 GB of free disk space\nComputer microphone or regular telephone for Webinar or Live Office Hours participation\nBuilt in sound or sound card with speakers\nHigh-speed Internet connection (at least 1MB download speed - click here to check your speed )\nPreferred Internet browsers: latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Safari (be sure to enable cookies, javascript and pop-ups)\nValid email address\nSmart Phone and Tablet Platforms (limited support) including\nApple iOS Devices (iPod touch, iPhone, iPad) and Android Phones and Tablets\nWith smart phones/tablets, you CAN:\nTake lesson quizzes\nDownload and read PDF lesson reading and resources\nParticipate in online forum discussions\nCheck grade book\nWith smart phones/tablets, you CANNOT:\nView presentations and interactive exercises\nRequired Software\nMicrosoft Silverlight (lecture capture video/PowerPoint presentations in some courses)\nAdobe Flash (latest version for presentations & interactive exercises)\nJava plugin (Live Office Hours and Webinars)\nAdobe Acrobat Reader (viewing & printing PDF files)\nOptional but Recommended Software\nOpen Source Office Suite-free (viewing & printing Word, PowerPoint, Excel files)\nQuickTime (viewing QuickTime video in some courses)\niTunes (podcast subscription in some courses)\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 How do I register?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Registering for an online class is simple and easy. You can register online , call (970-963-8855 option 1), or mail in a registration form. Note \u2013 classes fill early; we recommend registering at least a month before the class starts, especially for in-person workshops.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 How does the schedule work?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 The majority of SEI\u2019s online courses are 6 weeks in length and are comprised of around 10-15 lessons. Once you register, you will be sent a confirmation email that you are registered for the course.\u00a0 About 1 to 2 days before the course start date, you will receive an email with instructions of when and how to \u2018login\u2019 to your course. Once the course begins, you can follow the suggested course syllabus and your instructor(s) guidance to stay on track. Each week you can generally expect to work on 1-3 lessons; each with their own required reading assignments and \u2018challenges\u2019 (i.e. exercises, homework, and quizzes).\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Can I work at my own pace, or do I need to login at preset times?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 The majority of SEI\u2019s online courses are completely self-paced and you can work on them as your personal schedule allows. While instructors will be available to answer questions via email and the discussion board M-F, approx. 9-5pm MST, you are welcome to work on the course during nights and weekends too.\u00a0 We also recommend that you try to follow the suggested weekly syllabus as best you can so you don\u2019t fall behind. We also recommend working in chronological order. Course \u2018challenges\u2019 do not have specific due dates but must be submitted to fully complete the course. Challenges should ideally be submitted per the suggested weekly lesson schedule.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 How does testing and evaluation work?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 SEI\u2019s online courses generally consist of three types of assignments that are referred to overall as \u2018Challenges.\u2019 They are: exercises, homeworks and quizzes. All three of these challenges are completed and submitted online, from within the course. Each has its own set of instructions and point value. Typically, you will go through the course materials, readings, presentations, and link first, then practice what you\u2019ve learned with the exercises and homework, and finally take the quiz(zes). Depending on the course, challenges can span a wide variety of formats \u2013 from short essays to calculations, multiple choice to internet research, discussion board posts and more. While some challenges are manually graded by instructors, often times they are automatically graded within the system.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 What if I have questions about the course material? Can I contact the instructor(s) and how?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Yes! SEI\u2019s online instructors strive to be available as much as possible, with ambitious response time goals.\u00a0 Although instructors are not available \u2018on-demand\u2019 or via the phone, they are actively monitoring the course discussion board and email inbox.\u00a0 For all course related questions, you are encouraged to ask your question publically on the discussion board, so that other students will benefit from the interaction.\u00a0 And for all personal issues or grading questions, you can email the instructor directly. You can expect a response to your questions within 24 hours at the absolute longest (excluding weekends), and in fact, many times you will receive a response in 4-8 hrs or less.\u00a0 In addition, if you need help regarding any logistical, login, course format or computer related issues you can email the SEI Online Technical Helpdesk for support!\nQ\u00a0 When will the text book be sent to me, and are course materials available through the online campus?\nA.\nAll materials are provided online, within the course itself\u2014this includes: lesson presentations, readings and resources (articles & web links), exercises, quizzes, links to content specific discussion forums and more.\u00a0 The course textbook is often provided via PDF chapters in each lesson, as well as mailed out as a hard copy. In this manner, you don't need a physical textbook to progress through the course; it is a supplement. Given that the textbook can not be updated as frequently as the curriculum in this online course, it should be considered as supplemental material only.\nHard copies of online course text books are sent by USPS Media Mail. They will usually be sent by 2 weeks prior to the course start date, if not earlier.\u00a0 If you enroll near the start date of an online course, the hard copy of the text book may arrive after the start of the course. All required reading for this course is fully downloadable from within the course, so there is no need to wait for your course materials to arrive in the mail. If you live outside the Continental US, please know that even though SEI sends materials promptly, we have no control over when materials will be delivered.\u00a0 SEI also has no control over Customs Charges for International shipments; Customs charges are the responsibility of the participant.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 How do I submit assignments online?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 While the \u2018challenges\u2019 can vary from one course or one lesson to another, submitting them is easy and straightforward. Generally you will type in your response(s) (i.e. type in your answer with your calculations or, choose from the multiple choice drop down boxes, etc.) and then simply click a \u2018submit\u2019 button and you\u2019re done! On occasion, you may need to submit your answer via a discussion board post or emailed document. But either way, there are always clear instructions provided and help if you need it. There is no mailing or faxing required.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Is there a penalty for late submissions?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Since SEI\u2019s online courses are primarily self-paced, course challenges do not have due dates. However, assignments submitted after the course end date will not be graded and you will not receive a Record of Completion for the course. Other than that, consistent \u2018late\u2019 submissions will only cause more stress and confusion as you fall further behind.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 What is required of me to pass a course?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 There are two main criteria generally required (depends on course) to pass a SEI online course: (a) you must pass the course with a 70% or better cumulative score and (b) you must fully complete ALL course challenges by the course end date (blank submissions don\u2019t count). While \u2018attendance\u2019 is generally not enforced, discussion board participation may be.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 How much time do I need per week to complete an online course?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 While this will vary from course to course and student to student, in general the average weekly time commitment seems to fall in the 10-15 hr range. But remember, this will depend on the specific course and YOU \u2013 your background and existing training, your compatibility with online learning, and your ability to dedicate blocks of time to the course. While some students finish a 6 week course in just one week, others feel they could use another 6 weeks, so it really depends. At a minimum, be sure to budget no less than 10 hrs per week.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Can I interact with other students in the course? How and how often?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Yes, in a number of ways!\u00a0 Each course has a discussion board, or public forum (think online classroom) where students can post their questions and comments.\u00a0 The discussion board is broken down by lesson and category to help keep conversations organized, including both an \u2018open discussion\u2019 and a \u2018introductions\u2019 forum. You are welcome to post your questions, comments and even network with your fellow students here. Instructors actively monitor and facilitate the discussion board. In addition, every student has the option of creating their own personal \u2018homepage\u2019 (similar to Facebook or MySpace pages) where they can share contact info, pictures, and other personal information.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Will I have access to the course material on the online classroom when the course ends?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 After the course end date, you will have two additional weeks for instructorless review-only time.\u00a0 During this time you will not be able to complete any graded activities.\u00a0\u00a0 We strongly recommend saving, printing and bookmarking course materials and your work as you progress through the course. There are no extensions for online courses.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Can I transfer my course if I have a medical emergency, death in the family, etc? How does it work?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Yes. At SEI, we understand that sometimes \u2018life happens.\u2019 If you experience a personal, medical or family emergency and don\u2019t feel you will be able to complete the course in time, contact your course instructor(s) right away \u2013 don\u2019t wait until the last minute. Once you have provided SEI with the proper documentation (i.e. doctor\u2019s note), you will be able to take the same course over again in the near future. This only applies to emergency-type situations however. Regardless of the scenario, you must contact SEI about your situation prior to your course end date. All inquires after your course ends will not be considered.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 What are my options if I am not able to complete the course in time because of a non-emergency based reason?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 For all non-emergency based situations (i.e. personal work load increases, travel delays, car breakdowns, etc.), we have a \"re-take\" option that allows you to re-take the course for 1/2 price within one year of the start date of your original course.\u00a0 All assignments will have to be re-submitted, as the online classroom will not retain or transfer any work from your original course to your re-take course. Regardless of the scenario, please contact SEI about your situation prior to your course end date. For more on SEI's workshop policies please visit http://www.solarenergy.org/workshop-policies .\n\u2022Q \u00a0\u00a0 Do I receive a certification upon completion of an online course?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Upon successful completion of an SEI online course, you will receive an electronic SEI Record of Completion that you can print and save from within the online campus. This is not an industry certification, but formal documentation from SEI (that you can frame!) that you completed a course with SEI. These are helpful documents when applying for a job or for documenting training history.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Does SEI offer the NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practioners) entry-level certificate exam at the end of SEI's photovoltaic related online courses?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 No. The entry level exam is as yet not offered during or after online PV courses.\u00a0 However, upon successfully completing the first level online PV course (PV 101), you are eligible to take this exam.\u00a0 SEI recommends that you also take PV202 and PV203 as well before taking the exam. Please visit http://www.solarenergy.org/nabcep-certification for information on how to sign up.\nQ \u00a0\u00a0 Are there prerequisites to take an \u2018advanced\u2019 level online course?\nA \u00a0\u00a0 Yes.

These character image figures come in hundreds of poses and are easily used with available scenes and props. They are available at truecontent.com.\nTip October 17, 2011: Distributing video across multiple slides\nOne important video feature in Captivate 5.5 is using Slide Video\nThis feature allows you to distribute a video across multiple slides . This allows for sophisticated video interactions that can help make your training video more engaging. The only other way that video can be used is by importing a FLV or F4V file to one slide.\nSteps for using Slide Video:\nFind a series of slides that you would like to place the video. Having\u00c2\u00a0preexisting\u00c2\u00a0slides will make the process easier.\nSelect Insert > Slide Video\u2026\nSelect a video file that is one of the following formats: FLV, F4V, AVI, MP4, MOV, \u00c2\u00a0and 3GP.\nThe Video Import \u00c2\u00a0Options dialog box appears. You have two choices: either match the slide duration with the video\u2019s duration or retain the current slide duration and distribute the video over several slides. Select the retain current slide\u00c2\u00a0duration\u00c2\u00a0and \u00c2\u00a0click the OK button.\nYou now see the video in multiple slides.\nThat's it now you're ready to refine and edit you video.\nTip October 16, 2011: HTML 5 Converter for Adobe Captivate 5\nIntroducing the Adobe HTML 5 Converter for Captivate\nNow you can convert SWFs created by your Captivate 5.5 to HTML5 . This is new from Adobe Labs, and consider somewhat experimental. Once your Captivate SWF is converted through the converter, you can edit it in DreamWeaver, or other HTML Editors. This allows your training content to reach devices that do not support the Adobe Flash\u00ae runtimes,including iOS (iPhone and iPad) devices.\nTip July 13, 2010: What new in Adobe Releases Captivate 5\nNew User Interface for Easier Develop of your Captivate Training\nThe new interface is similar to other Adobe CS4 and CS5 products. You can customize the layout of panels in the Captivate Workspace to suite your training development needs. The Captivate 5 Property Inspector is similar to other Adobe CS4 and CS5 products and it\u2019s extremely helpful when developing your Training content. You can also use the paste board/scratch area and have training content off the screen, or partially on the screen.\nShare your Captivate Training Files and Reviews through Acrobat.com\nAdobe has integration Captivate 5 and Acrobat.com, while now allows you to send Captivate review files to Acrobat.com for a Shared Review. Your Captivate Training files are accessible to team members across the internet, and you will be able to track changes from you remote location.\nAdobe Captivate 5: Animate your Captivate Objects\nYou can now animate your Captivate Training object with the Captivate Effects panel. Adobe Captivate provides pre-built animations that you can use by simply choosing the effect from a menu and setting the timings. You can play multiple effects in your Captivate Training Projects in sequence or play them at the same time.\nAdobe Captivate 5: Open Multiple Projects from the Same Captivate Project\nSimilar to other Adobe CS4 and CS5 products, you can now have multiple projects and Captivate Libraries open at the same time. You can now copy and paste assets between multiple Captivate training projects, and drag and drop library elements from different files.\nNew file extension: \u201c.CPTX\u201d\nObject Styles\nYou can now use styles for your Captivate Training Objects, which speeds up your Captivate Training Development even more. Formatting options of objects include Text Format, Character, Fill & Stoke, and Transition. You can also setup styles for your Quiz question elements and include your progress indicator. After making changes to your Captivate Styles changes will flow throughout your entire Captivate training project. Styles are managed through the Object Styles Manager which is a new feature of Captivate 5.\nUse Acrobat.com to Track & Report your Projects\nYou can now track your Captivate Training courses without a learning management system. Adobe has created the Adobe Captivate Quiz Results Analyzer. Now with your Acrobat.com account you can track and receive reports on your Captivate Training Projects. You can also download a CSV file containing your report data.\nMulti-Video format Support\nYou will now be able to use the following video formats: FLV, F4V, AVI, MP4, MOV and 3GP. We\u2019ll add more about this later.\nMaster Slides\nMaster Slides allow you to set up a layout with all customized elements and create Master slides. You can have multiple master slides in a project and create new slides based on Master slides. When you update a Master slide element, all slides based on that Master slide change. This is a huge advantage when working with Captivate Templates as you have more global control over your project and corporate development.\nVideo can span over multiple slides\nNow video can play over many slides and you can time your video using the Video Timing panel, which gives you control over when your video plays and the timing of other Captivate events. You can also place video on your Table of Contents using the Video Timing Panel. Your Table of Contents slides down to display a video for the slide and then slide back up once the video is complete.\nExpanded Asset Library\nNow you have more options for your training content. You have a larger set of prebuilt widgets, playbars, skins, stock animations, images, text captions, and buttons.\nScreen Recording Workflow\nWhen you start recording your training with Captivate you now have a countdown indicator and an interface to start a recording. Adobe has also improved quality of panning and the quality of your Captivate Recordings have also improved.\nAudio Recording/Editing Workflow\nThere a new Captivate recording window which will help you edit you audio more easily and it will speed up your audio production. You can also work more closely with your closed captioning.\nTip December 16, 2009: Understanding Captivate's Full Motion Recording Option\nWhen you record screen actions using Captivate's automatic modes (Demonstration or one of the Simulations), clicking your mouse or pressing [print screen] on your keyboard results in a screen capture.\nHowever, if you need to capture complex procedures like drawing, moving or resizing an object, you can use Full Motion Recording (FMR). Assuming you have not disabled the FMR mode, and that you are recording a lesson in an automatic recording mode, all you need to do to create an FMR is drag your mouse during the recording process.\nWhen you finish the recording process, any slides containing FMR videos will contain a movie camera icon when viewed on the Edit tab. The FMR will play like an animation within your project-a movie within a movie.\nNote: If you have disabled FMR mode, you can manually create FMRs by pressing [F9] on your keyboard during the recording process and then dragging your mouse. Pressing [Fl0] will stop the FMR recording.\nSetting your Full Motion Recording Options for Captivate Training\n1. Captivate should be running (no projects should be open). In addition, the Recording stage window should be open and contain a folder called New Folder.\nIf the Recording stage window does not have a folder, you can easily create one now by choosing File > New > Folder.\n2. Set the FMR Preferences .\n- using Captivate, choose Edit > Preferences\n- from the Recording category, select Settings\nfrom the Automatically use full motion recording for area at the bottom of the dialog box, select Drag and drop actions and Mouse wheel actions. By selecting Drag and drop actions, dragging your mouse during the recording process will result in an automatic FMR video being recorded for you.\nIn addition, scrolling by using the mouse wheel (if your mouse supports this feature) will automatically result in an FMR.\n- click the FMR settings button. The Full Motion Recording Preferences appear.\n- ensure your options match the picture below\nBy selecting Show mouse, the video you record will include a mouse pointer.\nThe Disable hardware acceleration was left deselected. According to Adobe , leaving this option off will result in a higher FMR quality. You would turn this option on if you were recording videos from media players such as Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or QuickTime to prevent a blank screen from being recorded. when in doubt, leave the option off and test a few FMRs for quality.\nThe SWF Conversion was set to 32 Bit. Most computers have video set to 32 bit, which offers the widest range of colors on the monitor. If you were to select 16 bit, you would end up with a smaller FMR, but a smaller range of colors - and a lower-quality video.\nThe FMR Mode in the picture above was set to Video, which will result in the highest-quality SWF you can get from your FMR (and the largest file size). You could elect to use Application or smaller SWF size, both or which would result in a lower-quality FMR and SWF. When in doubt, you could use Safe mode and captivate would calculate your available system resources and create the best possible FMR.\nTip November 26, 2009: Making the audio volume equal throughout your Captivate Training videos\nIf you use Captivate's slide-by-slide method to record audio for your Captivate Training video, your audio volume may vary. It's difficult to manually equalize the audio level by going to each slide separately and adjust the volume. To make the audio equal throughout your captivate training project, use this technique.\nTo make the audio volume throughout your Captivate Training Video equal:\n1. From your Captivate menu select Audio > Edit > Project. The Edit Audio Timing Dialog appears.\n2. Click inside the audio timing area, and use the \"Ctrl A\" key to select all of the audio throughout your Captivate Training project.\n3. Now select Adjust Audio, check the Normalize checkbox, and click Okay. This will make all of your audio levels equal.\nTip November 24, 2009: Understanding Resolution and Recording Size in your Captivate Training Videos\nAs you develop your Captivate Training video, every click you make with your mouse will result in one screen capture.\nBefore you record, you should be aware of two things that control how sharp and how large your Captivate screen captures will be: display resolution and recording area.\nUnderstanding Screen Resolution in Captivate Training\nA computer monitor is measured in pixels (a pixel is a little square that is the basic component of any computer graphic). If a monitor is set to show more pixels, it is known as increasing the resolution. At a higher resolution, graphics and text will look sharper. but smaller. The fewer pixels you request, the lower the resolution, and larger the-screen elements appear.\nIf your computer is set to a high resolution (such as 1280x1024) when you record your Captivate Training video, a user viewing your published project at a lower display resolution (such as 800 x 600) will have to scroll significantly to see the action you recorded.\nHowever, if your computer is set to a lower display resolution (such as 1024x768) when you record your project, a customer with a higher screen resolution will have no trouble viewing your project. However, if you record your projects at the lower screen resolution, you may not be happy with the appearance of the screen icons and fonts (they may be too big and not as sharp as they would appear at the higher screen resolution).\nUnderstanding Recording Area in Captivate Training\nThe Recording Area is not the same thing as display resolution (although the two settings are constantly confused). The display resolution is set via the Windows Display control panel.\nThe Recording Area is set from within Captivate and is the physical amount of the screen that you will be capturing during the recording process.\nThere are several preset sizes available within Captivate from 220 x270 up to 1024 x 768, and you can specify your own.\nWith so many choices, what should you do? We recommend that you set your display resolution to 1024x768. And we recommend that you set your Captivate recording Area no larger than 800 x 600 if possible.\nNow there are a number of additional concerns that you might would to consider before setting your recording area, but if you're unsure, use a recording area no larger than 800 x 600 pixels. Your Captivate Training viewers will thank you.\nTip November 15, 2009:Determine your Captivate Training Specifications Ahead of Time\nAlthough we believe that Captivate Training Videos should never be a slave to the technology, the reality of our modern workplace is that the IT departments of many companies place stringent restrictions on what you're allowed to do from a technical perspective. You may be forced to present your Captivate Training videos on a particular computer display setting, browser type, or audio environment etc., while abandoning all others. Make sure that you find out the policies of your particular situation so that you can safely work within the confines of those rules.\nKeep in mind that some of these restrictions may not always be explicit, meaning that you're going to have to involve some other people. While some of you may be employed in an academic or small business situation where you're the sole decision maker (at least when it comes to producing video content), chances are that you're creating Captivate Training Videos as part of a larger team effort . Be certain to include the decision makers from IT management, and anyone else who has a stake in the content you're producing. Before recording a single frame of video on a new project, do make sure that you reach a consensus on the following points.\nMethod of deployment for your Captivate Training Videos\nAsk Certain Questions: Will these Captivate Training Videos be posted to your web site? The corporate intranet? Will CD-ROMs be created? What about a DVD for viewing on console televisions? These decisions will affect your video dimensions as well as the output format of your final production. And, whether online or on CD, it's never too early to start planning your menu navigation.\nMaximum file size or bandwidth requirements. It's especially important to clarify this if your organization will be hosting these Captivate Training videos on its servers. If you're deploying on CD-ROM, then you should try to compute how much space, on average, each of your planned Captivate Training Video is allowed.\nCaptivate Training Video dimensions\nSmaller video dimensions generally mean smaller file sizes. Larger video dimensions mean better visibility, but a corresponding high file size, plus the risk of those with smaller monitors not being able to view your creation without scrolling (bad) or scaling your content (even worse).\nWill the Captivate Training videos be narrated? Unnarrated video titles don't necessitate the hassle of setting up audio equipment, but you'll see a corresponding need for captions and text callouts. Narrated videos should ideally have a script in place prior to recording, so that you can appropriately time the recording of your segments. In fact, as you'll see, effective scripting and storyboarding is a good idea regardless of narration.\nWhile Captivate Training Videos are used for all kinds of purposes, training is one purpose that Captivate is very strong in. In the work that we do for our clients, more often than not they engage us to create an online tutorial, knowledge base video , or some other form of training. This can run the gamut from some quickie \"Getting Started\" videos (to give new downloaders a leg up) to a polished, menu-driven CD-ROM, complete with comprehensive tutorials on every aspect of the software, which can then be sold (or given) to those customers who have already made their purchase.\nTip November 14, 2009:Why build Training videos with Captivate\nCaptivate Training videos can serve to augment traditional stand-up training or, in certain instances, replace it entirely. While nothing's as good as being there, Captivate Training Vidoes, with its capacity for video narration (so that you see the face of the trainer, hear the voice, and see the screen simultaneously), actually comes pretty darned close. Captivate Training videos also have the following advantages over traditional stand-up training:\nCaptivate Training Videos never tire of repetition. If users don't understand something, they can always go back and view it again.\nCaptivate Training Videos are scalable. Deploy your training content to 10 people or 10,000, without a lot of extra time, effort, or money.\nCaptivate Training Videos travel better than people do. If you have 20 different people who require training in 20 different locations around the world, there's no need to summon them to one spot in order to deliver training.\nCaptivate Training Videos are always available. Unlike trainers, who have a scheclule to keep, training videos are always at the ready, even at 3 a.m. If the trainees decide they've had enough for the day, they can come back to it the following day (or week) with no worries.\nCaptivate Trainng Videos are hassle-free. Stand-up training involves scheduling, reserving a classroom , and communicating with both the trainer and trainees to make sure everyone shows up at the appointed time. Not to mention the coffee and donuts. The logistics of video deployment are quite a bit simpler. Your Captivate Training Videos can act as a \"front line of defense.\" People in the IT support department love training videos because they know that those users who never read documentation might just take the time to watch a video. In fact, many companies build whole video reference libraries of solutions to common problems. When they receive an e-mail from a frantic customer or colleague, they can simply send a link to the appropriate video along with the tag, \"Contact me again if you have any additional questions.\" Simply Captivate Training Videos can handle the training jobs no one else wants. I've heard of several companies who now use training videos as part of their standard new employee orientation, helping them to teach the more mundane aspects of the job, such as requisitioning office supplies or filling out a timecard. Not placing this training burden on your staff means not having to remove them from their normal duties every time you bring on someone new.\nBut chances are I'm preaching to the choir here - after all, you probably wouldn't have come to Pentext if you didn't already know that Captivate Training video content excels as a training device. So, let's move on to devising the best training program we possibly can. These tips are arranged in no particular order; they're mainly here to get you thinking about your audience and the information you want to convey to them before you sit down to forge your masterpiece.\nPeople understand a Captivate Training video better when words are presented as verbal narration alone, rather than both verbally and as on-screen text (redundancy principle).\nThis should already be familiar to those of you who have had to sit through a dull PowerPoint presentation where the host \"presented\" by reading all the bullet points off the screen. If we replace those bullet points with a chart, an animation, or a screen video, comprehension can be enhanced. Filling up the screen with narration text can waste a good opportunity for engaging the brain with visual media. There are a few exceptions to this principle, such as when introducing unfamiliar terms, or when the audience members are hearing impaired or nonnative speakers of your language. In those cases, you'd want to reinforce narration with text. Fortunately, Captivate Training offers text callouts as well as captioning to address these situations.\nPeople learn better when Captivate Trainings is presented in bite-sized chunks (segmentation principle).\nFor our purposes as video content providers, this principle has a profound impact on how we split up our content . For tutorial videos, I typically find that three to five minutes for each \"chapter\" works best. As you work your way through the book, I'11 show you techniques for dividing your content automatically, and even creating a clickable table of contents, so that your users can seamlessly navigate your segments.\nPeople learn better when Captivate Training is presented using clear outlines and headings (signalling principle).\nWhen utilizing Captivate Training , the signalling principle is instructive in a number of ways. First, it illustrates the importance of using title screens to announce your content. People seem to have an innate need to know what to expect. Title screens help to convey this information.\nThe running time and duration displayed in the Captivate Training video's control bar aid in this as well, by informing the audience how long the video has been playing and, more importantly, how far they have to go. The users can then plan accordingly depending on how much free time they have in their day.\nPeople learn better when Captivate Training is presented in a conversational style rather than a formal one (personalization principle).\nI think most people know this from experience on a conscious level, but I still see countless Captivate Training videos where the narrator is as stiff as a board. It's usually the result of committee review where any shred of the creator's personality is systematically removed for the sake of \"professionalism.\" This is a mistake. When narrating your Captivate Training video segments, you need to stay warm and approachable, which includes both your terminology and your tone. It is possible to be both informal and professional at the same time. It can be a balancing act, of course, but the rewards are great if successfully executed.\nPeople learn better when on-screen text is presented near any corresponding images in your Captivate Training video (spatial contiguity principle).\nThis principle comes into play when placing callouts in your Captivate Training video.\nPeople learn better when any extraneous information is removed (coherence principle). This is definitely something you want to be cognizant of while recording. Remember to keep the focus on the material you want to convey, and eliminate everything else. If your Windows desktop is going to be recorded at any point, change your desktop to a solid color. Move any nonessential icons out of the recording area. Close any renegade windows. You want to make your Captivate Training recordings as clean as possible. In addition to trimming out all the junk mentioned above, take care not to add irrelevant words, sounds, pictures, or music, as these can actually serve to hinder the audience from absorbing the Captivate Training material.\nPeople learn better from animation and narration than animation with explanatory on-screen text (modality principle).\nOf all the human senses, Captivate Training video presentations typically engage two: sight and hearing. These are individual receptors, or pathways into the brain, and the reason that multimedia learning is successful has to do with the brain's efficiency at receiving information from both these pathways at once. But there can be bottlenecks, as the modality principle demonstrates. By presenting animation, and then adding written narration (as opposed to audio) on top of that, you're overloading one of the pathways, while the other one goes completely unused. When crafting your videos, it behooves you to balance the load. People learn better when animation and narration are synchronized than when they're asynchronous (temporal contiguity principle).\nWhen the Captivate Training video and audio are synchronized, the learner tends to more strongly build connections between the words and the picture , thereby improving their ability to form an accurate mental representation of the content you're trying to get across.\nThe design of Captivate Training Video presentations can have different effects on people based on their prior knowledge, visual literacy, and spacial aptitude (individual differences principle). This is a fancy way of saying that everybody's different, particularly in terms of how they experience (and have experienced) the world.\nThere is no \"one-size-fits-all\" Captivate Training video experience that will appeal to eyeryone. But by following some of the principles above, your chances of truly getting the content across to your audience are actually quite good.\nTip November 13, 2009:Recording Techniques your Captivate Training Videos\nHere are a few handy tips for recording your training video once you've moved past preparation and into recording. While these techniques clearly do not fall under the category \"prep-work,\" their use specifically for training merits a spot in this chapter.\nRecording Techniques for your Captivate Training Videos\nCaptivate Training Videos should guide the user through the use of the software with little effort required on their part as possible. Particularly if your Captivate Training video has a lot of mouse movements, or click activity, don't depend on attention-gettings such as mouse highlights, visual clicks, text callouts, and zoom and pan techniques. The key to creating clear Captivate training videos is to keep them short, chunk steps into well organized communication sets (even in the same training video), and create a rhythm that will help to clarify your training information .\nYour Captivate Training Videos Should be short and well paced\nThe pacing of your Captivate Training videos can vary widely depending on its purpose. Unlike marketing video communication, which are fairly fast paced to keep the viewers attention while conveying the core benefits of the product in the 30 seconds to two minute long video clips. Captivate Training Videos need a much more relaxed pace, which would allow your training participants to comprehend your training information When running your audience through the procedural steps of executing a task on the computer, it's remarkably easy to Captivate Training video will be. This is particularly important if you're likely to have non native speakers of your language viewing your training videos. If so you'll want to be especially careful with the pacing and remember to slow down the the pace of your narration as well.\nDon't Get Mired in the Details\nAvoid the temptation to merrily skip from field to field in the program you're recording, explaining every little thing along the way.\nProvided you've done a thorough assessment of your target audience, you probably have a decent sense of their general level of technical savvy as well as their pre-existing knowledge (if any) of the application(s) featured in your video. You can use this information to help you decide how granular you want to be in explaining the different aspects of the software. Rarely will you need to explain every field in every tab of every dialog box, or how to perform basic functions within Windows. For example, even novice computer users know how to close windows, open files, and select icons. If you make a point of tell ing them, \"you'll need to double-click the program's icon in order to open it,\" then you're wasting valuable time, and you risk boring most of your users into exiting the video.\nSet Specific Goals for your Captivate Training Video\nIt is my recommendation, regardless of video type, that you have certain predefined goals outlined before recording or even scripting begins. These goals need to be as specific as possible.\nBad example:\nTo take users through the new features of the software.\nGood examples:\nTo show users how they can draw attention to certain words by utilizing the italic,bold, and underline commands.\nTo Help users to move projects from their desktop to their laptop computers by first exporting a project on one machine, and then importing it on another.\nTip October 5, 2009: Add Efficiency to your Captivate Training Videos by using the Captivate Library\nCaptivate helps you to keep track of your resources or assets in the Library. You can store your audio, images, and FLV files in the Library. You notice that if you're capturing screens as part of your training development, the Library will also store all of the images used as backgrounds to your slides.\nAs a Captivate Training Developer, reusing and efficiently accessing your resources and development assets is key to your rapid development. You can view the library from Library Item in the Window menu. By default the Captivate Library helps you to organize your content in folders name Audio, Background, Images, Media and Presentations. If you would like to customize your library even further, you can\nNow you can easily use the library to import your training resources and assets. This is an easy way to add audio to your slides if you're using audio recording and editing software outside of your Captivate software.\nYou can also use the library from other Captivate Projects, by using the Open Library button and browsing to the Captivate Project with the Library that you want to use. You can also get multiple details about your Captivate library resources, like dates, size, and usage. It's also a good Idea to clean up your resources from time to time by using the \"Select Unused Items\" feature. Using your Captivate Library is an easy way to speedup the development time of your Training Projects.\nTip October 4, 2009: Using Captivate Question Pools in your Captivate Training Project\nWhat are Captivate Questions Pools?\nCaptivate Question Pools allow you to create a pool of questions, which you can categorize and use in your Captivate Training Project . Once you create a pool of questions in your Captivate Question Pool Manager, you can create a random Question Slide in your Captivate Training project that displays one of the question in your Question Pool randomly. Of course with one slide, training users will only see would of your questions during a single sitting. Typically would would want to do some project planning before developing this type of Captivate Quiz scenario.\nCreating Question Pools in your Captivate Training Projects\nIf you create seven question in your Captivate question pool, an you only have one random question slide in your Captivate Training Project, any one of those seven questions can be displayed to a participant viewing your Captivate Training project. If you want training users to complete all seven questions, you must create seven random question slides in your Captivate training project.\nRandom question slides will not repeat the same question in your question pool during a single viewing, and your questions will be displayed randomly during each viewing of your Training Project .\nTip October 3, 2009: Using Variables in your Adobe Captivate Training Videos\nYou can use variables in your Captivate Training modules to act as placeholders for data. When your Captivate Training video plays, or when a user inputs data into your Captivate Training, variables can be associated with this information, collecting or displaying data for further use.\nOnce you have captured user data in your training video, you can provide feedback to the user, create more advanced actions and configure Captivate widgets. All objects in your Captivate Training can use variables. This included text captions, Captivate actions, Widgets, navigation in your Captivate Training videos, and any of your Captivate Training videos that use Javascript. You can create two types of variables in your Captivate Training videos.\nSystem Variables in your Captivate Training\nSystem Variables allow you to capture date from your computer and use it through scripting in your Captivate Training videos. You can use Movie Control Lists variables, MovieInformation Lists variables, MoveMetaData Lists variables, System Information List Variables, and Quizzing Lists variables.\nUser-Defined Variables in your Captivate Training\nUser Defined Variables store data that is used or update in your Captivate Training videos. You simply create a unique name and a unique value corresponding to the text that is stored in it.

Eleven participants selected topics of interest related to teaching about which they would pose a question, research an answer, and develop solutions to improve instruction and learning in their classrooms. I selected inclusion in the LOTE classroom for many reasons, but most importantly because of the current influx of special needs students into LOTE classes. Foreign language teachers struggle to find ways to teach students with special needs so that they can be successful language learners. Furthermore, Texas Education Code 28.025 requires that incoming freshmen of 2004-2005 graduate under the Recommended Program which calls for Levels I and II of a foreign language. This means there will be more special needs students in LOTE classrooms, and teachers will need to be better prepared to develop and carry out these students\u2019 Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). To accomplish this task, teachers will need to be even more highly skilled in their craft and more knowledgeable about special needs students.\nIn this brief, I outline a plan for helping foreign language teachers improve instruction and learning for special needs students. In the process, I discuss changes in the student population of foreign language classrooms and provide background information on the laws that led to the recognition of the rights of students with disabilities and that mandated their mainstreaming into regular education. I share personal reflections and encounters that I have had with special needs students during my teaching career, experiences with which many language teachers will likely identify. I present information gathered from a survey conducted as part of my research project on inclusion and LOTE and discuss the initial steps in a follow-up project begun by participants at the Texas Conference on Coordinating Languages in April 2003. Finally, I outline proposed future projects regarding inclusion in the LOTE classroom. I hope that as language teachers read this issue brief, they become more knowledgeable about inclusion and the laws regarding its implementation, feel better about teaching special needs students, and begin a working relationship with their special education colleagues to help make language learning a goal for all students.\nMeeting Learners\u2019 Special Needs\nLOTE Classrooms: Then and Now. I have been in education for 31 years, and like so many others who have been around this long, I have seen many changes. The field of foreign languages is certainly no exception. Foreign language education has made tremendous advances in all arenas: language instruction, textbooks, materials, name changes (languages other than English), and especially offering foreign languages to all students. Our classes have changed dramatically over the years from enrolling college-bound students with high grade point averages to including all students of diverse abilities in the language classroom. At the state level, LOTE is considered an enrichment content area, but because of the two-year language requirement for the Recommended Program and the three-year language requirement for the Distinguished Achievement Program, school districts often seek to promote foreign language study so that students can graduate with more than the Minimum Program. In reality, LOTE has become the fifth core academic area for many districts along with English Language Arts, Social Studies, Science, and Mathematics.\nWhen I began my teaching career, the situation was quite different. Students could only enroll in a foreign language if they had a grade of B in English and a recommendation from the English teacher or guidance counselor. The language teacher was not even included in the decision-making process. In my classes, I had mostly students who were high academic achievers, and although I do not recall a special education department, I do remember that we received a list from the counselors of those few students in our classes who were considered \u201cslow learners.\u201d We were advised that these students needed more time to do their work, but there was no special staff development for teachers, and there was no meeting between all concerned individuals to discuss the students\u2019 educational plans. Teachers read their lists, made a notation to provide additional assistance, and moved forward.\nDuring my second year of teaching, I had a student who required more attention, more time for daily work and tests, more explanation\u2013more of everything. In addition to regular classroom instruction, the student came to my class almost every day before or after school for additional help. We reviewed the material orally and in writing and used as many hands-on activities as possible. She was a delightful student, and she tried very hard. Her mother wanted her to be a doctor, so she felt more than a bit pressured to be successful in her classes. One day, this student became so frustrated that she put her hands on her head in desperation and said to me, \u201cSra. Trevi\u00f1o, are you sure you know how to teach Spanish?\u201d At first I was speechless but finally said to her, \u201cYes hijita*, I know how to teach Spanish. I just need to find a way to teach you.\u201d She ultimately passed my class with a C+ and was rightfully proud of her grade. I, however, was even more proud of the effort that she had invested to be successful.\ninoculate - graft\nAs a second year teacher, this incident had a profound effect on me; I realized there was a very long road ahead. From that moment, I began to work with the administration and counselors to change the district regulations regarding student enrollment in foreign languages. Languages were not just for those college-bound students with a B in English, and these regulations were keeping many students from studying a foreign language: average students, native Spanish-speakers, and special needs students. This experience helped me to recognize that all students could be successful if given the right opportunities in the classroom to use their unique strengths.\nThirty years later, enrollment in foreign languages has increased to the point that many classes are overflowing, sometimes with 35 students or more. Most classes are heterogeneous, combining gifted and talented, average ability, native-speaking, and special needs students, and teachers are struggling to find the right combination of instructional strategies to help all of them be successful. The Texas Education Agency\u2019s TEA Snapshot for 2002 indicates that there were 339,270 gifted and talented students identified in Texas, or 8.2% of the student population. Special education data shows that 485,010 special needs students were identified in the same year. The high enrollment number in special education clearly indicates a need for specialized training so that teachers can help students with disabilities achieve their educational goals in the LOTE classroom and others. But although Texas Administrative Code 89.2 requires teachers of gifted students to complete 30 hours of special training with six hours of follow-up training each year, no such requirement exists for teachers who must meet the needs of students with disabilities. Teachers must seek out training on their own unless a district has a specific requirement for teachers regarding such staff development.\nLOTE Learners: The Law and Compliance. The education of children with disabilities was first addressed in 1966 with the amendment of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 which provided grants to states to help educate children with disabilities. In 1974, Public Law (PL) 93-380 required states to adopt a goal of providing \u201cfull educational opportunities to all children with disabilities.\u201d In 1975, Congress enacted PL 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act which paved the way for federal funds to be used to ensure that students with disabilities were given equal opportunity to obtain an education. Each act included changes to improve upon previous acts so that special needs students could receive a free and appropriate public education. In addition, Congress addressed special education through the Vocational Education Amendments of 1968, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1972, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, and the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1974 (Turnbull and Turnbull, 1998).\nIn reviewing the list of early laws enacted to help children and adults with disabilities, I am astonished that my colleagues and I did not hear about them as we worked through our undergraduate studies in the 1970s and 1980s. There was no mention of them in our education courses or our student teaching; learning to work with special education students was simply not part of the education curriculum. If ESEA was implemented in 1965, why were prospective teachers not exposed to the law? During my student teaching, I did not encounter any students with special needs in my classes, but I did observe that special education students in this particular district were kept separate from those in regular education\u2013total exclusion. There were no integrated classes, no socializing at lunch among the two student populations. My first shock came when I saw some Spanish-speaking students mixed in with students who had been classified as mentally retarded. I inquired about their situation since the Spanish speakers did not seem to be developmentally delayed and was amazed to learn that they were considered \u201cspecial ed\u201d because they could not speak English! The mere fact that the students could not speak English because they had not been taught English classified them as retarded. The strong wake-up call I experienced upon learning of such policies made me question whether I wanted to pursue a career in teaching. In the long run, however, the experience made me even more passionate about pursuing education and eliminating such treatment of students.\nThe special education program in the school where I began my professional teaching career in 1972 was also totally exclusionary. The special education building was the one farthest from the main campus and, just as I had observed in student teaching, special education students were not allowed to mingle with regular education students. In fact, those students did not know what to make of this isolated group and, in some cases, were actually scared of them. This scenario was, no doubt, repeated throughout Texas and probably the nation. If PL 93-380 and PL 94-142 required states to give equal educational opportunities to handicapped and disabled children, why did we not see their implementation at the district level? I had begun teaching in a poor school district with obviously limited resources, and there were hundreds of districts in the same economic situation\u2013as there are today. But economic difficulties did not excuse districts then\u2013or now\u2013from implementing the law, and there were many court cases to force districts to comply regardless of the funding available to them.\nIn fact, at that time, schools and teachers were not prepared to deal with students with disabilities. Most school districts did not have funding for special programs, nor were they compelled to address full education of special needs students when they were struggling to meet the basic requirements established for the regular education population. Administrators that did attempt to provide an appropriate learning environment for special needs students usually based their programs on conventional practices of the time. But more time and more conventional practice was not an effective prescription for students with various disabilities. What teachers needed, but simply did not have, were the necessary skills to help special needs students be successful in the regular education classroom.\nAs I reflect on my early experiences and look at the dates when many laws were enacted, I ask myself how so little could have happened over time. I was not an administrator having to make day-by-day decisions that affected all aspects of educational practice for hundreds or thousands of students, but I cannot help but wonder how many children fell through the cracks. What could have been done to provide the best possible education for all students? What kind of training would have helped teachers help special needs students succeed? These questions come too late for students that passed through the educational system in the years prior to true mainstreaming, but the answers can now be applied to ensure success for all students.\nLOTE for All: An IDEA Whose Time Has Come. Even today, despite subsequent laws that have passed, students with disabilities continue to face discrimination in education. In an article in Education Life, Tracey Harden, the parent of a child with disabilities, says that \u201cwhile inclusion gets a lot of lip service, it is one thing to say it, another to do it. Schools tend to be more accommodating of obvious physical problems than hidden problems like learning disabilities.\u201d Nevertheless, according to Turnbull and Turnbull (1998), there are several factors that have contributed to positive changes in the education and treatment of students with disabilities. The first was a gradual change in ideology: \u201cless able\u201d no longer meant \u201cless worthy,\u201d a recognition that came about through a combination of legal, political, and human services doctrines. Second, the terminology used to describe those with special needs changed from the negative image evoked by \u201chandicapped\u201d to \u201cpersons with disabilities.\u201d (As language teachers, we recognize that word choice does matter.) Third, scientists were able to show that persons with mental retardation are capable of learning different amounts of information in different ways. Fourth, technology advanced tremendously to allow the use of adaptive devices for disabled persons. Fifth, family leadership came to the forefront as families led the movement for better laws for the disabled. Finally, powerful leaders like President John F. Kennedy, Senator Hubert Humphrey, and Representative James Foggarty became advocates and brought these issues before Congress, helping pave the way for new laws.\nIn response to repeated complaints about discrimination against the disabled, Congress passed several entitlements.* In 1997, PL 105-17, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), was passed providing federal assistance to special needs students. In IDEA, Congress recognized 20 years of research and experience that demonstrates the education of children with disabilities can be more effective if:\nthere are high expectations for these children;\nparents and families have a stronger role in the educational process;\nlocal educational service agencies, state, and federal governments work together for the benefit of the students;\nthese children are provided with the appropriate services and support in the regular classroom;\nthere is intensive professional development for all personnel; and\nthere is a focus on resources for teaching and learning.\nBased on these research findings, the purposes of IDEA are:\n(a) to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment and independent living; (b) to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and (c) to assist States, localities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities;\nto assist States in the implementation of a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;\nto ensure that educators and parents have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities by supporting systemic-change activities; coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services; and\nto assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts to educate children with disabilities.\nFurthermore, IDEA recognized the following categories as eligible for services (definitions from A Guide to the Admission, Review and Dismissal Process, 2002):\na.\u00a0Mental Retardation (Educable Mentally Retarded) \u2013 Significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the development period.\nb. \u00a0Auditory Impairment \u2013 Hearing impairment, permanent or fluctuating, includes any degree of hearing loss ranging from mild to profound resulting in a diagnosis of hard of hearing or deaf.\nc.\u00a0\u00a0Speech or Language Impairment \u2013 Communication disorder, such as stuttering, impaired articulation, and language or voice impairments that adversely affects educational performance.\nd.\u00a0\u00a0Visual Impairment and Blindness \u2013 Visual impairment includes any type of sight problem which, even with correction, adversely affects educational performance.\ne.\u00a0\u00a0Emotional Disturbance \u2013 A diagnosis of emotional disturbance means that the student exhibits one or more of specified characteristics that are not the result of a temporary reaction to home, school, or community situations.\nf. \u00a0Orthopedic Impairment \u2013 A severe orthopedic impairment that adversely affects educational performance, including those caused by congenital anomaly, disease, or other causes.\ng.\u00a0 Autism \u2013 A developmental delay that significantly affects verbal and nonverbal communication and social interaction.\nh.\u00a0 Traumatic Brain Injury \u2013 A sudden injury to the brain caused by an external event, resulting in total or partial functional disability or psychosocial impairment or both that adversely affects the student\u2019s educational performance.\ni. \u00a0Other Health Impaired \u2013 Limited strength, vitality, or alertness, including a heightened alertness to environmental stimuli, that results in limited alertness with respect to the educational environment.\nj. \u00a0Specific Learning Disability \u2013 A disorder in one or more of the processes needed to receive, understand, or express information. The student can have difficulty with basic reading skills, reading comprehension, written expression, mathematics calculation, listening comprehension, and/or oral expression.\nk.\u00a0\u00a0Deaf-Blind \u2013 Combination of hearing and visual impairments that causes severe communication and other developmental and educational problems.\nl.\u00a0 Multiple Impairment \u2013 Multiple disabilities that occur in combination with each other and cause severe educational problems.\nWhen faced with this potential array of disabilities in the classroom, what must go through the minds of teachers as they see the scores of faces looking back at them, many with special needs? Beginning teachers are struggling to learn the school routine and environment, attending required meetings and staff development, and designing lessons that engage all students. How can they manage 35 or more students as well as multiple learner variables? Veteran teachers may rely on instincts developed over years of classroom experience to deal with students with special needs. They may even have participated in some staff development that enriched their knowledge of learning styles, learning disabilities, and teaching strategies. Still, interviews indicate a high level of frustration among foreign language teachers at all levels of experience, and most of this frustration stems from the lack of discipline-specific training in working with special needs students. The challenge facing teachers as they address issues of inclusion is one I recognize and seek to address through the research project discussed below.\nMeeting Teachers\u2019 Special Needs\nStep One: Inclusion Survey. Although school districts have been mainstreaming students for years, many more such placements have occurred since the implementation of IDEA. Districts have become more sensitive to students\u2019 educational and environmental needs, and curriculum specialists are working with teachers to improve overall instruction. Many districts are playing \u201ccatch-up\u201d in providing access to school facilities since many school buildings were built years before accessibility became an issue. Special education funding has helped districts provide better educational opportunities for students with disabilities as they have been mainstreamed into the regular curriculum. But while funds have been used to develop curricula and provide staff development for teachers, it is challenging to meet the specific needs of every discipline. Because they work with limited staff development funds, districts must determine which training model can best be replicated by different disciplines at the campus level. It has been my personal experience and that of many respondents to the survey discussed below that most of the special education staff development is generic and not discipline-specific.\nAlthough special needs students have been enrolled in LOTE classes for years, I wondered how successful we have been in teaching them? How successful have the students been in learning the foreign language of their choice? What can be done to help foreign language teachers meet the demands placed on them and help special needs learners? My first step in answering this question was to gather information on the current state of affairs. To that end, I developed a survey entitled Inclusion in the LOTE Classroom which was published in the LOTE CED Lowdown (Vol. 6.1), a newsletter developed and distributed by the Languages Other Than English Center for Educator Development. The survey was also published in the Texas Foreign Language Association (TFLA) Newsletter and distributed at the TFLA Conference in Fort Worth in the fall of 2002. Teachers were asked to provide information regarding their teaching experience, their experience in teaching special needs students, their involvement in developing IEPs and participating in Admission, Review, and Dismissal meetings (ARDs), formal special education training, and special education staff development specific to LOTE. Teachers were asked to list two or three learning disabilities of students they were currently teaching plus the accommodations and modifications they were using to meet the students\u2019 needs. The following is an overview of findings obtained from the surveys.\nIEPs, ARDs, and Staff Development. The 148 surveys received by the initial deadline included teachers of Spanish, French, German, Latin, Japanese, and Chinese at the middle and high school levels, ranging from first-year teachers to those with over 25 years of classroom experience. Twenty-one of the 148 teachers had formal special education training while 62 teachers had received some staff development related to special needs students in the LOTE classroom; however, the length and depth of the staff development was not included for either category. Ninety-eight teachers indicated they had participated in ARDs, while 50 had not, even though 39 of the 50 had students with IEPs!\nLearning Disabilities. On the survey, teachers listed all of the disability categories addressed by IDEA (see page 4). They mentioned students who were dyslexic/dysgraphic, had hearing, visual, and speech impairments, and were emotionally disturbed. Teachers also indicated they had students with attention deficit disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, muscular dystrophy, and Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Some students were physically handicapped, paraplegic, or had other health impairments. Noted also were students with severe depression; mental retardation; Down syndrome; obsessive/compulsive disorders; and disabilities in auditory processing, reading comprehension, written expression, and cognitive difficulty. Surveys indicated some students had low IQs and still others were performing below grade level and exhibiting low self-esteem. One shocking finding was that two respondents thought that having English as a second language was a disability!\nModifications and Accommodations. It was evident from the findings that teachers are still confused as to the difference between a modification and an accommodation for special needs learners. While it is important to note that these terms are not used consistently throughout Texas or the United States (modifications, accommodations, and adaptations are often used interchangeably), according to the Texas Education Agency\u2019s Special Education Division, a modification is something that a teacher does to modify the content, i.e., a modification of the TEKS as outlined by an IEP. An accommodation is what a teacher does to help the student that changes the learning environment, such as altered seating arrangements, use of large print texts, or administration of oral versions of tests. The respondents\u2019 confusion of the terms was evident in that the same or similar activities were sometimes listed under both categories. Modifications listed included: use notes when taking a test, allow more time to finish work, give preferential seating, give more projects, highlight texts, assign less homework, give oral directions, assign peer tutoring, tape reading assignments, give shorter, modified tests, etc. Sample accommodations listed include: make special handouts, one-to-one instruction, modify tests, give more multiple choice tests, use manipulatives, change seating arrangements, pair reading, divide tasks into smaller segments, etc.\nLegal responsibilities. According to responses on the survey, some teachers were not aware of their legal responsibilities regarding students with disabilities.* Other comments included: \u201cI don\u2019t know the difference between a modification and an accommodation.\u201d \u201cLarge class size hinders special help for any student.\u201d \u201cI often am at a loss. I do not understand what is expected of me for these students. Help me understand!\u201d \u201cI hear teachers saying such things as \u2018but this is a foreign language. If the student can\u2019t perform, he shouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019 We need to know what our legal responsibilities are, and how to fulfill them.\u201d\nConclusions. The variety and quantity of disabilities that teachers see on a daily basis can be overwhelming. Teachers are asked to comply with IEPs based on ARDs into which they have had no input. This is a critical omission because the teacher is ultimately responsible and legally liable for implementing the IEP and, therefore, should contribute to what the IEP outlines for the student in order to ensure his or her success. Obviously, for LOTE teachers to provide meaningful input into the IEP, they need to have discipline-specific training in recognizing appropriate accommodations and modifications for a variety of disabilities. Unfortunately, there are often not enough special education staff members to provide individual assistance to every teacher who has students with IEPs. Foreign language teachers need to initiate contact and should do so for their own benefit, as well as for the students. Jacquelene Turner, Coordinator for Instructional Programs in Corpus Christi ISD, tells teachers that they can find support from occupational therapists, physical therapists, school psychologists, special education teachers, speech and language pathologists, educational diagnosticians, audiologists, and program specialists. Special education staff are not LOTE teachers and LOTE teachers are not special education specialists, so to provide the best possible learning environment for all students, deciding on an appropriate strategy must become a collaborative effort.\nStep Two: Texas Conference on Coordinating Languages. In April 2003, the Texas Association for Language Supervision sponsored the 33rd Annual Texas Conference on Coordinating Languages (TECCL). The focus for this conference was Inclusion in the LOTE Classroom: Promoting Success for Special Needs Students. I had the honor of coordinating the program as an extension of my action research project and continuing the investigation and development of much needed special education materials for LOTE teachers. Ms. Jacquelene Turner graciously accepted an invitation to present a session entitled Special Education in Any Language: Clearly Spoken Here! In addition, Dr. M. K. McChristian, Director for Languages other than English and Mr. Steve Erwin, Director, Technical Assistance & Quality Assurance, Special Education Department, both from the Richardson Independent School District, agreed to present a session on Creating the LD Friendly LOTE Classroom: Strategies for Success. Though participants came to the conference with a range of special education training (or none), both presentations helped lay the groundwork for developing materials to help foreign language teachers work with special needs students. Participants were able to focus on special education issues and consider them from their perspective as LOTE supervisors and teachers.\nThe main purpose of the second day of the conference was to begin the development of a handbook for LOTE teachers to use when developing IEPs and writing their lessons. Participants used a template and worked in groups to develop a list of modifications and accommodations to address different disabilities and different skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) in the LOTE classroom. Eight disability categories were selected based on responses from the aforementioned survey as well as suggestions from the participants: emotional disturbance, autism, visual impairment, hearing impairment, orthopedic impairment, speech/language impairment, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactive disorder. Participants worked feverishly in developing modifications, sometimes pausing and wondering: Is this a modification? Is this an accommodation? Is this strategy appropriate for this category of disability? Jackie Turner continued as our facilitator, working with the groups in this draft development stage which was not an easy one!\nStep Three: Follow-up Meetings. This summer, I plan to meet with a follow-up team of supervisors and teachers to continue developing the handbook. Consideration will be given to its format to ensure that the handbook is user-friendly, and additional disability categories will ultimately be included. Information pages outlining the characteristics of each disability will be followed by pages including appropriate modifications and accommodations for LOTE learners with that disability. Special Education teachers will be part of the group to guide the committee as they continue to write modifications and accommodations for the different learning disability categories. The material developed by the team in addition to the material developed at TECCL will be presented as a session at the TFLA Fall Conference in Austin this coming October. Participants will be asked to evaluate a draft of the handbook and to offer suggestions for additions to it. A final product will be printed and disseminated in the spring of 2004.\nFuture Initiatives. It never hurts to dream! Despite the budget woes that are affecting the state and local districts, it is my wish to continue to work with LOTE district coordinators and teachers to develop specific staff development modules that incorporate training in teaching students with disabilities. The LOTE Center for Educator Development has trained facilitators in various areas relating to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills: curriculum development, performance-based assessment, rubrics, and Spanish for Spanish speakers. Though the LOTE CED will close its doors as of June 30, 2003, I hope that current facilitators and new recruits will carry the torch in providing staff development on teaching students with disabilities in the LOTE classroom. It is important to note that many districts have already begun to address this issue specifically for LOTE instruction and therefore will be able to contribute greatly to this endeavor.\nIn sum, it is clear to me that teachers want to do their job to the best of their ability. I believe milestones in inclusion can be achieved with greater collaboration among special education staff, LOTE educators, and administrators at the district, campus, and state levels. The task is not an easy one, but it can be done. Armed with the facts, discipline-specific training, the necessary strategies, and a positive attitude, LOTE teachers can be successful in teaching languages other than English to all students.\nQuestions for Reflection\nDo I now have additional background that helps me understand mainstreaming of special needs students?\nAm I aware of the laws and my legal responsibilities regarding the instruction of special needs students and implementing their IEPs?\nHave I participated in the ARD for every one of my students for whom I have an IEP?\nDo I know who to contact on my campus or at the district level for instructional assistance for special needs students? (List everyone who can assist you.)\nDo I understand how my district addresses modifications and accommodations and how I should use them in the classroom?\nWhat staff development is available at the campus, district, or regional (service centers) levels to assist me with special needs students?\nReferences\nFierro-Trevi\u00f1o, M.

This article is drawn from the discussions that took place in the group between February and November. Many thanks to all who participated.\nThere is much to consider at the beginning stages of developing an online course. From the outset:\nLearning Management System \u0096 Will I use one? What type of online navigation will it have and what online tools are available?\nContent \u0096 Is the learning content appropriate for an online environment?\nStudents - Who are the learners? Would they benefit from a linear based, selective release pathway where the lecturer controls the learning or the release of all modules at the same time which is more learner controlled?\nSkill Level \u0096 Do your students already have I T skills; do they have access to the appropriate computer hardware and software required? If not how are you going to address those issues?\nCommunication Tools \u0096 How will you communicate with the students? Is there any f2f or is delivery totally online?\nActivities \u0096 What is appropriate, will there be quizzes? How will students be assessed? What feedback mechanisms will be in place?\nW3C Compliance\nThere has been much discussion of late around the flexible delivery table in SA regarding W3C for online content - making websites more accessible for all by taking into account the vast differences in culture, languages, education, ability, material resources, access devices, and physical limitations of users world wide.\nIf you are involved in developing online content have you thought about these particular barriers to learning?\nDo you teach any of the following type of students:\nlearners with literacy needs\nIf you already have online content you are delivering do you have the following:\npictures attached to alternative text\ngood colour contrast\nwritten transcripts as an alternative to audio/video\nlarge icons or text as hyperlinks\nsmall amounts of larger text grouped together with large 'white spaces\nimages not too large for download\nTools\nWhat other tools (open source or at cost) might you use to enhance your online course?\nFor example, CaptureCAM\u0099-PRO is an easy to use full motion, PC Screen and Sound Recording program, that is perfect for online development and learning. At their website ( http://www.capturecampro.com/ ) you can find: user guides (under product features), examples/demos) and online tutorials.\nAlso CamStudio records screen activity from your Windows Desktop into standard AVI movie files. It is an ideal tool for developing videos to demonstrate features of a new software or any other task that requires the capture of desktop activity. You can add screen captions to your desktop while recording. You can also personalize your movie by including a webcam movie of yourself into the AVI.

I feel that a linear form of construction is ideally suited to students who need clear direction in their learning and/or where the content has a specific sequence or prerequisite learning. I must say I have a bent towards collaboration and incorporate it into my online learning courses as a matter of habit. I don\u0092t want the students just talking to me; I want them to talk to each other. Online discussions don\u0092t need to come from talking about student weaknesses or problems; it can revolve around carefully designed discussion topics and activities. Icebreaker activities at the beginning of an online course are great and you might be surprised how some people are freer in their thoughts and ideas when they are online with a degree of anonymity rather than face to face meetings.\u0094 (Judy Fawcett)\nExamples of Nursing Courses in Flexible Mode: (Judy Fawcett \u0096 tafeSA \u0096 Gilles Plains Campus)\nThe first is \u0091Nursing Calculations\u0092, a CDROM based course developed to assist in the learning and assessment of Nurses.

The personal, historical and cultural contexts of major buildings, paintings, sculptures and drawings \u2014 many viewed in person \u2014 Sources and documents, including the artist\u2019s correspondence are analyzed in order to sort out his artistic activities, life and thought. The course is planned as an in-depth look at Michelangelo\u2019s works, life and thought. No city offers a comparable assemblage of works of art from every period in his career, not to mention works that define his cultural and artistic milieu, and even his impact. City walks and museum visits in Florence, and at least one half-day of the Rome class excursion are devoted to direct scrutiny of Michelangelo\u2019s works. The experience of the S. Lorenzo building complex in its urban setting, of the Old Sacristy structure and sculptures, of the gargantuan sculptures in the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia, or of the drawings, early sculptures and celebratory paintings in his house, cannot be simulated. Because of Michelangelo\u2019s universal appeal, the courses\u2019s reference to minor commissions outside of Rome and Florence speaks to the question of local identity in a period before national unity. So does the attention devoted to the artist\u2019s Florentine artistic roots, colleagues, rivals and patrons. The abundance of the artist\u2019s works in Italy is linked in the course to reflections about Italy\u2019s struggles to catalogue, restore, maintain and present its artistic patrimony. (Florence, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itFlorence) TOP\nACCF AHMM 210\nCredits: 3\nDay\nA survey of painting, sculpture, and architecture in 15th and 16th century Italy, with special attention to Florence\u2019s monuments and museums, and major Tuscan artists including Donatello, Botticelli, Leonardo and Michelangelo. Alongside stylistic and typological developments, the course investigates the contexts of Renaissance patronage, biography, culture and society. The course seeks to probe beyond the overview of Italian Renaissance art that many students bring to the program. Works in museums, major and minor, and in churches, streets, tabernacles, and restoration studios are brought into the course. Students are trained to employ a descriptive and theoretical vocabulary appropriate to the period under examination, and to analyze works in terms of style and content. Museum and city visits in the context of the course seek to utilize the rich collections of the city. These include the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia, the Galleria degli Uffizi, the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, the Galleria Palatina, the Medici Chapel, the Museo dell\u2019Opera del Duomo, and San Marco. Current, relevant exhibitions at these museums or elsewhere are incorporated in the course. The goal is to make museum-going and the critical study of artworks a personal pattern. To this end, there is reference to many other collections and places (churches, monuments) in the city, in Tuscany, and Italy. (Florence, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itFlorence) TOP\nACCF FDTC 390\nHistory of 20th Century Fashion\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThis course explores the historical development of fashion in the Twentieth Century. It examines both high and popular fashion, primarily in Europe, placing fashion products and concepts in the contexts of society, culture, and economics. In this introductory course the emphasis is on these interconnections, but some elementary notions of fashion theory, especially with regard to gender and to marketing, are also addressed. The multifaceted cultural phenomenon of haute couture is a leitmotif of the course. The work and impact of notable designers receive special attention. Through them, students also consider the relationship of fashion to urban centers such as Paris, London and Milan. The course is also an extended reflection about the very notion of \u201cfashion.\u201d The main emphasis is on the evolution of garments and accessories. For each period a composite view of fashion esthetics and a range of objects is gathered. As far as possible, trends are gathered by examination of major designers. Connections with the arts, history and social mores are facilitated in this way. The course also brings out a few elementary notions of fashion theory. Visits are arranged to boutiques and couturiers and, when possible, to the Pitti Moda fair events, and to museums (Ferragamo, textile museum in Prato). (Florence, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itFlorence) TOP\nACCR AHMV 310\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThe artworks, monuments and institutions that comprise the Vatican are the basis for a study of the chief trends in Western art from classical times to the Baroque era. Topics include the history of the Vatican and its collections, urban planning (Castel S.Angelo, the Borgo, Bernini\u2019s colonnade, etc.), the arts in Western thought, and major artists (Michelangelo, Bernini). Site visits are an integral component of the course. The course is designed as an introductory art history course centered on the monuments, patronage and collections of the Vatican and the papal hierarchy. The idea is to explore the treasures, assembled in such an exceptional manner, in several reprieves, counter to the compressed visit typical of most student encounters with the Vatican. In this way the fundamentals of art history are conveyed directly by examples of great authority: the Laocoon, Apollo Belvedere, the Stanze of Raphael, the Sistine Ceiling, the Basilica. Although works of art are seen as representative of artistic epochs, medieval and early modern objects are aligned with the culture and personalities of the papal court. A subplot of the course is antiquarianism. (Rome, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itRome) TOP\nACCR AHRB 310\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThe course consists of an examination of two important stylistic phases of Western art in Italy, focusing on works in Rome: Renaissance and Baroque Art. In addition to the oeuvres of major figures (including Michelangelo, Raphael, Caravaggio, Bernini, Borromini), the course follows issues including aesthetics, patronage, ideology. Interrelationships between the arts, between the arts and society and culture, and between Italy and the rest of Europe, are considered. The guiding notion of the course is that the class is on an expedition. Readings and classroom sessions provide a kind of \u201cbriefing\u201d but in large part the course will be taken up by interactive visits in which ideas and theories are tested and tried out. The course offers scope for students to focus on a broad range of themes, developing investigations that take account of the latest research and are enriched by close familiarity with the paintings, sculptures, buildings or other object(s) in question. The course accommodates current exhibitions, beyond numerous visits to major churches, palaces, and collections, as well as meetings with restorers, curators or scholars.

The subjects shown on the buildings could have political and religious messages, promoting ideals of citizenship, Greekness, heroism, and piety. Architectural sculpture could be understood by a large audience, transcending the limits of literacy, and acted as billboards for the religious values and civic responsibilities of cities and sanctuaries in Ancient Greece. This course will offer a careful examination of ancient Greek architectural sculpture, from the Archaic through Hellenistic periods. We will discuss the rise of monumental architecture, the origins of architectural sculpture, painted decoration, and the iconography and meaning of the subjects selected for depiction. We will visit several of the sites and museums most vital to the study of Greek architectural sculpture, including the Acropolis, Agora, and National Museum in Athens, as well as a longer excursion to the sanctuary at Delphi. Each student will master a variety of skills during this course, through a various assignment types and classroom approaches. Learning the material of the course\u2019s subject is only the first step.

(Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/) TOP\nLONS AREU 311\nCredits: 4\nDay\nIn Europe the social and political upheavals of the 19th century gave birth to major innovations in the arts. Especially in France, artists gradually moved away from time-honored classical ideals in order to depict concrete contemporary reality. The crucial changes they introduced in subject matter and technique revolutionized the very nature of what constitutes a work of art and laid the foundations for the development of modern art. This course examines how the politics, literature and philosophy of the period affected the subject matter and techniques of the painters under review. Full advantage is taken of the rich public art collections in London and of any current exhibitions which may be relevant to the course. Topics are chosen from: Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Neo-Classicism, Symbolism, the Court at Versailles, the French Revolution of 1789, the Country and the City in the Nineteenth Century, Photography, Depictions of Women. (London, England, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/gbBritishStudies ) TOP\nLONS ARMO 312\nCredits: 4\nDay\nThis course aims to provide the student with the knowledge and understanding of the main modern art movements. We investigate how the different styles in art reflect the political, the social and the cultural conditions of the society in which the art has been produced. The course will combine a chronological approach starting from the beginning of the twentieth century up to the present day. Movements and themes established in lectures are developed further during tutorials in galleries, museums or special exhibitions. The magnificent collections in London offer a unique opportunity to study the principle ideas put forward by the avant garde artists like Matisse, Picasso, Kandinsky, Dali, Pollock, Warhol, Damien Hirst etc. Topics are chosen from the following: Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, Abstractions, Dada, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and New British Conceptualism. This course will study the main art movements of this century and enable students to develop a critical awareness of visual images. It considers how the differing styles in art reflect the political, social and cultural conditions of the society in which the art has been produced, and it examines how avant-garde artists like Matisse, Picasso and others challenged and rejected the ideals and the tradition which have dominated European art since the Renaissance.

It will be an in-depth study of his drawings, paintings and sculptures, as well as written works, including poetry and letters. Attention will be devoted to establishing Michelangelo\u2019s working procedures, how he designed his masterpieces, his study of antique sculpture, his changing approach to the human nude and why it is central to his art, his stylistic development, and, finally, the nature of the interaction between the various arts in which he excelled. Our study of Michelangelo will be grounded in the cultural, historical, religious, and political climate of his day. Furthermore, we will consider the artistic ambient in Florence at the time of his training, and his profound influence not only upon artists of his generation, but those following. An important component of this course will be the study of Michelangelo\u2019s works on site, providing the opportunity for a greater understanding of the form and function of art and architecture, its relationship to its physical and historical context, and its impact upon the spectator. Therefore, field trips to Florence and Rome will be incorporated into the semester schedule.

Students will become familiar not only with Leonardo\u2019s individual masterpieces, but also with his working methods, interests, inventiveness, and indebtedness to other artist\u2019s works. He/she will also gain insight into the design process of painted works through attentive analysis of the preparatory drawings while considering the practice they reflect in the context of Leonardo\u2019s theories on painting. The course will investigate the meaning of Leonardo\u2019s anatomical and physiognomic studies. In addition, his activity as a sculptor will be studied in relation to his drawings and paintings. Although no undisputed sculpture by Leonardo\u2019s hand is known, his drawings and paintings provide ample evidence for his use of sculptural models for the purpose of study, a practice that was common to Florentine painters of the Renaissance. This course will include field trips to Florence, Vinci and Milan.

Students will learn to use line and gesture, and to model light and dark in order to understand and accurately represent the human form. While the course is based on traditional methods of picture-making, students will be encouraged to experiment and find their own solutions to the problems of representation. Students are exposed to various wet and dry media, such as charcoal, ink wash, and pastel. Critiques will be held regularly in order to familiarize students with the act of criticism and dialogue, both fundamental to the artist. (Perugia, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itUmbraInstitute ) TOP\nUMBR AROP 310\nCredits: 3\nDay\nPainting from direct observation, including from the human figure, is the traditional basis for training the artist\u2019s eye and hand. Students will address the problems of painting by working from direct observation, including the classic genres of still-life, figure study, interior, landscape, and self-portrait. This course explores painting as an integrative process involving aspects of drawing, design, color and image in the organization of a two-dimensional surface. Students learn oil painting techniques and explore how these techniques can be used to create a successful image. Students are encouraged to find their own, individual approaches, and no particular style is promoted. Students are required to keep a sketchbook and to document ideas for paintings in words, found images, and drawings. Students will also view slides of paintings from diverse historical periods and there will be class visits to exhibitions in order to help students familiarize themselves with various painting traditions. Group critiques will also be conducted to help students develop a language for discussing their own paintings and those of others. (Perugia, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itUmbraInstitute ) TOP\nUMBR ARPH 310\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThe course is designed to explore the fundamentals of photography from a unique perspective and within an Italian context. Students will focus on basic concepts, processes and techniques, including camera usage, exposure controls, film development and techniques, and print presentation. The course work will enable students to capture and record their experiences in Perugia and in Italy using their cameras. Students will have the option of making a photo diary of this experience as well. Creative exploration through specific assignments will form the basis for development of aesthetic criteria. Although previous photographic experience is not assumed, students will be expected to reach a sophisticated level of photographic expertise. Students must supply their own cameras. This course will make use of many resources in and around Perugia as well as field trips to nearby sites.

Student-centered classroom strategies and environments have been around for quite awhile, but the new opportunity of implementing and supporting them through technology tools has recently reached what I feel is a tipping point.\nFive major areas influence and support the implementation of this new opportunity. Let us take a closer look at each of these areas and talk about the considerations that should be addressed for each one.\n1. The Physical Learning Space and The Teaching Learning Environment\nThe Physical Learning Space has a strong influence on the teaching and learning environment. The arrangement of student seating implies the type of teaching and learning that will be going on. Desks arranged in rows all facing the same direction suggest that the students will be working as isolated individuals with the teacher giving direct instruction to them as a group. Seats at tables or desks arranged facing one another across the table or desks in groupings of four implies that the students will be engaging each other in collaborative workgroups doing project work, discussion, or research as a team with the teacher facilitating. The latter physical arrangement works best in the digital classroom, allowing students to work independently or collaboratively and encourages the teacher to manage the learning that is going on and facilitate individuals or work groups as needed.\n2. The Wireless Network\nThe wireless network plays an important part. It introduces the mobility capability of using the technology in any location or configuration in the learning space. It is important to consider the simplest implementation of coverage that is an access point on a classroom set cart of mobile devices that provides coverage for an individual classroom. This allows a resource movement from room to room. This model is easily scalable. The best way to implement this environment is to consult outside expertise for advise in the best strategies and decisions regarding installation.\n3. Web 2.0 Access\nWeb 2.0 access brings a whole new scale of exploration, discovery, participation, understanding and communication to a student\u2019s world in the evolving classroom. This digital learning space means the access can happen 24/7 whether at school or home. Education should be teaching the learner how to safely navigate, investigate, evaluate and create with the information and the settings in the Web 2.0 sandbox. The research and reference sites, social sites, podcasts, wikis, blogs, online courses, virtual worlds, and collaborative domains and tools that are available on the Web allows the wide range of learning styles in the evolving classroom to be addressed in an engaging and motivational atmosphere. With assignments that encourage analysis, comparison and discussion in a collaborative workspace a very rigorous, challenging set of expectations for students at all learning levels can be created.\nThese assignments might contain multimedia elements and/or podcasts as part of the research and presentation stages. This can lead to different approaches to evaluate the student\u2019s learning such as formative assessment and a portfolio collection of the student\u2019s work. This evolved assessment focus begins to guide the student toward self-assessment skills and better self-appreciation. Learners exposed to this kind of learning and assessment also do very well in a standardized testing environment.\n4. Digital Content\nDigital Content dramatically changes the reliance on and the role played by textbooks in the evolving classroom. What was analog, static, dated, linear access to information has morphed into a digital, dynamic, multimedia, and multi-directional learning possibility. The teacher and the student can personalize the information and create new ways to explain and present what they have learned. This gives ownership to the learner and a personal investment into what they have learned and/or taught. The learner becomes the teacher and the teacher becomes the learner in this opportunity.\n5. Technology Tools\nThe technology tools that support the evolving classroom are many and varied. Devices such as projectors, document cameras, digital cameras, responders, interactive whiteboards and tablets, laptops, netbooks and mobile devices such as cell phones, iPods, tablets are finding their way into this classroom. They all in various ways aid an in accessing the worlds of Web 2.0 and access and manipulate digital content. These tools aid in learning the skills of researching, communicating, problem solving and collaborating in the type of world into which learners will be graduating.\nWhat must be taken into consideration when adopting the use of these technology tools is that an evolution is rapidly taking place in these as well. The mobile devices listed above have a very powerful computing capability. That is resulting in those devices displaying multiple capabilities that allow them to do the functions the many individual devices have previously been doing. An example would be the new projectors have the interactive whiteboard capabilities built into their function so that the interactive whiteboard on the wall is no longer needed. The tablets coming into the evolving classroom have the capabilities of acting as a camera, camcorder, computer and interactive whiteboard tablet. This device cannot only do all of the listed but is mobile, has an all school day battery life, accesses all of the Web learning opportunities.\nWith the right advice, planning and training a school or school district can begin to explore the implementation of all of these offerings in pilot settings to proof the concept and scalability of this new teaching and learning opportunity. It can be done today with the people and resources you already have. Gather your resources, get support and move ahead into a 21st Century education environment.\nGeorge Luginbill\u00a0recently served as Director of Educational Technology for Clover Park School District in Lakewood, WA.

Researchers have identified failure rates of multi-organizational initiatives in the private sector at around 50%. \u00a0Without comparable research in the community based sector, and with more complex issues it is safe to assume similar or lower rates of success.\u00a0 Anecdotally we hear from our colleagues and students, high rates of dissatisfaction and disillusion with collaborative efforts. \u00a0Social change agents express cynicism with government\u2019s incentives to collaborate while providing little investment in capacity building and vague disclosures of expectations of system rationalization and cost reductions.\u00a0 Yet despite all the barriers communities and organizations are continuing to invest scarce resources jointly to develop innovative approaches to difficult social issues.\nOver time, practitioners like us have developed practical tools and frameworks that help move multi-organizational processes closer to success.\u00a0 We are pioneers exploring new territory. Over time we observed the nature of the terrain and we are now aware of the geography, the hills and valleys of building relationships across organizational boundaries.\u00a0 The 6 step framework is a road map substantiated by research and practical experience of building programs and social change campaigns delivered through collaboration.\nThis course has six modules, one for each step in the collaborative development process. They are described briefly below:\nStep 1\nIdentifying the members- Who should belong?\nStep 4\nStep 6\nEvaluating Effectiveness\nSix Step Development Framework adapted from Joan Roberts, Alliances Coalitions and Partnerships: Building Collaborative Organizations, New Society Publishers,2004.\nA Six Step Development Framework\n1.Step 1- Determining the need for a collaborative and exploring the problem set\nThe first stage begins with the organizing issue.\u00a0 What kind of issues prompt people to look to other organizations for help?\u00a0 Steps 1 and 2 are strategic thinking and planning questions for conveners and members to concise prior to joining or starting a collaborative initiative.\n2. Step 2 -Motivation to Act\nMoving outside one\u2019s organization\u2019s walls can be the beginning of a leadership journey. The roles and skills required are different than the traditional government or NPO workplace. Examining ones own motivation is the foundation for building motivation to collaborate\n3. Step 3 -Identification-Who should belong?\nThis is the member identification and recruitment stage where political dynamics emerge and need to be considered.\n4. Step 4 -Collaborative Planning- Should a collaborative organization be created and if so what is its work?\nThis stage is when the common vision and action strategy is developed.\u00a0 To move diverse organizations and people towards collective action, a participative and inclusive planning process is necessary to build trust and find common ground.\n5. Step 5-Building an Organization- How do we organize the vision and action into structure, leadership, communication, policies, and procedures?\nIt is at this step that the group develops the organizational infrastructure needed to implement the common vision and plan. Internal organizational processes are needed to streamline the ongoing work and decision-making.\nStep 6-Evaluation- Is the collaborative doing its work effectively?\nThe final step is the evaluation phase which can complete the entire process or begin anew in whatever form the members decide.\u00a0 Evaluation of both process and outcomes is needed.\nEach module provides information on what the step entails, how-to tips for most effective implementation of the step, and links to additional supporting resources.\nIn the non-profit and government sector many funding programs demand that social agencies work in partnership because it is seen as way to reform government service delivery. But collaboratives are more complex than a single organization and need to be created from scratch, a very resource heavy process.\u00a0 They should not be created as matter of philosophy but considered carefully.\nSome examples of collaboratives in the Non-Profit Sector include:\nHealth-intersectoral collaboration such as substance abuse prevention projects involving police, educators and service providers.\nEnvironmental collaboration processes- Governments are creating them for more effective land and forest management.\nCommunity economic revitalization processes.\nHuman services delivery partnerships- including services for children, youth and seniors.\nAdvocacy coalitions-Tobacco Control Bylaws\u00a0 came about this way\nDefinitions\nWhen we speak about collaboration there is widespread agreement that the term refers to a group of people working together to reach a common goal. Within this definition, collaboration can describe a group of people working within an organization or external to an organzation. For this course, we are using the term collaboration to refer to inter-organizational collaboration, a coming together of separate organizations although there may be individual members participating on their own behalf.\u00a0 Often the terms partnership, coalition and alliance are used to describe these joined up organizations. The names are often used interchangeably in the NPO sector and can range from more loosely organized to more formal structures.\nThe Collaborative Continuum\nModule 1: Exercise 1 - Matching\nPrint the following page and match the columns exercise link to correct answers.\nDefinition\nALLIANCES (ALSO, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES)\na distinct form of co-operation between autonomous, self-governing organizations who work together in order to achieve a common goal.\nMERGERS\nfacilitate the engagement of diverse sectors to work collaboratively over the long term in order to tackle a wide range of interrelated issues. They encourage partnering and collaborative work, including alliances among disciplines, sectors, and community members that impact whole systems to effect neighborhood and city-wide change processes, often undertaking whole community or inter-sectoral strategic planning.\nCOALITIONS\ninvolves sharing knowledge, expertise, and innovation between organizations in the areas of services and solutions to social problems. This term is used interchangeably to describe a collaborative but is used most often in the private sector\nJOINT VENTURES\nThe combining of two or more organizations into one. In the NPO sector this would involve the union of 2 boards of directors into one and one name for the new legal entity.\nCOLLABORATION\nmost often it is oriented toward advocacy in the public interest, and is especially favoured by health-promoters to achieve community-level interventions in such areas as social marketing or advocacy. Used interchangeably with alliances and partnerships to describe a collaborative.\nPARTNERSHIP\nis a technical term to describe supra-systems that consist of separate autonomous organizations that span organizational boundaries. It functions as more than the sum of its separate constituents by enabling decision-making and task-performance on behalf of member groups, who retain autonomous identities and goals.\nCOMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY INITIATIVES\nis a new entity (trans-organization system) formed between two or more parties to undertake project activity together. These parties agree to jointly contribute resources, and share revenues, expenses, and control, throughout the duration of one specific project only, or as an ongoing relationship. \u00a0The private sector uses this term.\nNETWORK\na term more favored by government and can include loosely organized consultation processes to service delivery collaboratives controlled by contractual agreement. In the business sector, collaborative members often avoid this term because of its legalistic connotations (especially related to liability). The terms alliance and coalition are used interchangeably to describe a collaborative.\nTRANS-ORGANIZATION SYSTEM\nrefers to the structure created by collaboration prior to the creation of a formal inter-organizational structure. Considered an emerging form of collaborative organization.\nModule 1: Exercise 2: Benefits and Challenges to Working Collaboratively\nMost non-profit organizations have concluded that they cannot \u2018go it alone\u2019. They have discovered that they need to establish collaborative relationships in order to stretch their resources further, to create complex strategies to address complicated social issues and to comply with funder expectations. \u00a0Along with many benefits unique challenges to this form of organization emerge.\nIndividual brainstorm:\nUsing your experience or what you have heard or read from others, identify at least 7 benefits and challenges to working collaboratively.\nChallenges\nModule 1 - Resources and Suggested Readings\nElaine Forbes, Cynthia J.

What is driving the movement towards inter-organizational collaboration in government and the non-profit sector?\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Global capitalism which has created huge economic and population shifts. This impacts the NPO sector because whole segments of populations become marginalized and live under the poverty line.A United Way study, called Losing Ground released Nov. 26, 2007, suggests the number of families living in poverty in Toronto is increasing, sharply. The United Way of Greater Toronto says 30 per cent of Toronto families, amounting to about 93,000 households, are living in poverty. A similar study in 1990 showed about 16 per cent of families in the same situation.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0NPOs then try to fill the gaps with programs and services.\u00a0 When gaps emerge that can\u2019t be filled by one organization agencies are motivated to work with others.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Technology makes inter-organizational collaboration easier than ever before. Broadcasting an e-mail to announce a meeting its time and location\u00a0 can take only minutes. Some readers will not know what this means.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Ever increasing societal complexity leads to an Ingenuity Gap ( title of a book by Thomas Homer Dixon) -problems are so complex we\u00a0 need\u00a0 bring in others to\u00a0 problem solve.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Demographic shifts are creating labour shortages. NPOs have to collaborate to recruit necessary workers.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Linear planning does not produce solutions that take into account all the different aspects of a problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Non-linear approaches to planning, are necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 Planning becomes a process of assembling a jigsaw puzzle.\u00a0 When each piece is put in place, a new picture is created that requires a new set of perspectives and resources to figure out the next step.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The search for new possibilities in the current situation is more important than drawing on expert conceptual knowledge.\n2. What problems are unsolvable by a solitary organization?\nRussell Ackoff, one of the originators of systems thinking, calls the intractable problem sets we face in our chaotic environment \u201cMeta Problems and Messes\u201d.\u00a0 Meta Problems are the set of all problems that make up a single problem this doesn\u2019t make sense to me \u2013 are they a set of subproblems that make up a large/complex problem? An example might be useful to help the reader understand-- the one you have to solve.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance the problem of a community that is experiencing a housing shortage\u00a0 can be due to a number of interrelated problems such as a shortage of developable land, the cost of building materials, a strike in a construction trade and\u00a0 and a slow moving approvals process at City Hall.\u00a0 When all of these problems happen at the same time you have a problem set. All the problems within the set of problems have fairly clear solutions Whereas Messes are not - merely problems. Problems have solutions. Messes do not have straightforward solutions.\nSocial messes:\nare more than complicated and complex. They are ambiguous.\ncontain considerable uncertainty \u2013 even as to what the conditions are, let alone what the appropriate actions might be.\nare bounded by great constraints and are tightly interconnected, economically, socially, politically, technologically.\nare seen differently from different points of view, and quite different worldviews.\ncontain many value conflicts.\nare often a-logical or illogical.\nMesses are the meta problems of homelessness, drugs and gangs, ethnic\u00a0 and national conflict and Messes have strong links to i not very well planned government policies,\u00a0 globalization, civil wars, international population shifts and the rapid advance of technology.\u00a0 Homelessness as a social mess, was created by government policies that deinstitutionalized people with mental health issues without an adequate community support system to replace it, by structural economic changes which reduced the number of jobs with decent wages, to the cessation of government housing policies in the early 90\u2019s. To rid our society of homelessness, many different government players need to bring about\u00a0 major policy and program changes.\nTypes of problems: The Nature & Conceptualization of Problems\nBrenda Zimmerman is a complexity researcher at York University. She developed a way of looking at problems. She finds there are basically three types of problems characterized by the nature of the solutions required.\nWhen we apply this conceptual framework to the collaboration field it \u00a0leads us to observe that what Ackoff called Meta problems and Messes and what Zimmerman calls complex problems lead a change agent to\u00a0 look outside outside of one\u2019s own organization for additional resources.\u00a0 Building an understanding of the whole picture in order to mobilize new understanding and additional resources becomes the motivation to collaborate with outside organizations.\nA collaborative may be required when several stakeholders have a vested interest in the problems and are willing to work together to find solutions. A collaborative is even more appropriate if there is a history of incremental or sporadic efforts to deal with the problem set that have not produced satisfactory solutions and the problem seems to be unsolvable or exasperatingly persistent.\nSimple\nSolution example: Following a recipe to bake a cake\nBuilding a rocket to get to the moon\nRaising a child to become an effective a member of society\nThe recipe is essential\nFormulae are critical and necessary\nFormulae have only a limited application\nRecipes are tested to assure replicability of later efforts\nSending one rocket increases assurance that next will be ok\nRaising one child gives no assurance of success with the next\nNo particular expertise; knowing how to cook increases success\nHigh level of expertise in many specialized fields + coordination\nExpertise can help but is not sufficient; relationships are key\nTools\nQuestions that help you determine a mess form a simple problem\nWho are the players?\nWho has responsibility or ownership of the problem?\nWhat are the individual problems?\nWhat are current initiatives to address the problems?\nWhat are the causes of the individual problems?\nWhat are the constraints or barriers to building solutions?\nWhat might be the underlying systemic issues?\nWhat are the values and motivations of the system participants?\nTools to Scope out the Problem:\nAll members of the collaboration eventually need to have the same mental model of the mess. Prior to even asking people to join together, it is prudent to explore the problem set. Problem exploration tools include environmental scanning, scenario building and literature reviews.\nA collaboration may be a good problem solving strategy when several stakeholders have a vested interest in the problems and are willing to work together developing solutions. A collaborative is even more appropriate if there is a history of incremental or sporadic efforts to deal with the problem set that have not produced satisfactory solutions and the problem seems to be unsolvable or exasperatingly persistent.\nEnvironmental Scans\nAn environmental scan is a tool or an approach to determine the trends opportunities and threats that are happening outside of an organization. The environmental focus can be as broad as the what is happening across the entire world to what is happening in the zone just outside of the organization. This area could be limited to the activities of funders, clients and other agencies. Environmental scanning tools can be as simple as a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) exercise to activating a newsbot on the internet to monitor internet traffic and exposure on a trend or topic. Executive Directors and change agents help manage the constant change in the NPO environment by scanning the environment as a day to day activity of the organization. Board members are anther valuable resource to an agency to help keep an eye on the pulse of a community.\nSWOT Analysis\nSWOT analysis is a framework for analyzing your strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats you face in deciding whether a \u00a0\u00a0collaborative is the best route.\nStrengths:\nWhat advantages do you have?\nWhat do you do well?\nWhat relevant resources do you have access to?\nWhat do other people see as your strengths?\nWeaknesses:\nWhat do you do badly?\nWhat should you avoid?\nWhere are the good opportunities facing you?\nWhat are the interesting trends you are aware of?\nUseful opportunities can come from such things as:\nChanges in technology \u00a0on both a broad and narrow scale\nChanges in government policy related to your field\nChanges in social patterns, population profiles, life style changes, etc.\nLocal Events\nWhat obstacles do you face?\nWhat is your competition doing?\nAre the required specifications for your job, products or services changing?\nIs changing technology threatening your position?\nDo you have bad debt or cash-flow problems?\nCould any of your weaknesses seriously threaten your organization?\nScenario Building\nScenario planning is tool whereby the planner connects the dots (pieces of data) gleaned from the external environment and walks through the implications of these dots on the system- be it an organization, sector or community.\u00a0\u00a0 The planner notices a trend and then imagines the impact and possibilities on their organization or an issue. Scenarios are stories rather than a prediction.\u00a0 There are always positive and negative possibilities that can happen so we get the terms worst case and best case scenarios.\nYou never know when opportunity can arise out of a bad situation. To most of us, a forest fire is a pretty bad scenario; but not to certain types of beetles. Some beetles have special infrared receptors that can detect the heat from a forest fire. When they discover the aftermath of a forest fire, they move right in and lay their eggs in the forest. They know that when the eggs hatch, the larvae can feed off of the dead wood.\nIn the world of nature there are countless examples of how good comes from something we perceive as bad. I suppose it is only bad because we want something other than the result we got. When we look at a situation calmly and sum up what is really going on, perhaps there is really some good in it and we can use this to our advantage.\n(Source: Bleckmann, H.J., Schmitz, H. and von der Emde, G., Nature as a model for technical sensors, J. Comp. Physiol. A., 190:971-981, 2004.)\nThinking through possible scenarios by oneself or with others is a key strategic thinking and leadership skill set for finding solutions to complex problems sets. By thinking through scenarios that might emerge for the problem, \u00a0you will surface questions and possible answers to key development questions such as who holds the puzzle pieces needed to explore the problem and who might be good members for a collaborative approach to problem solving.\nPop up\nFor a comprehensive learning guide to scenario building for non-profits download: What if? The art of scenario thinking for non-profits from www.gbn.com/whatif .\nWhat is a literature review?\nNPO practitioners are increasingly planning a new program or intervention with a review of the academic literature.\u00a0 A literature review can also become the knowledge foundation or a jumping off point for a group learning process. If there is a report that scans and presents succinctly the existing knowledge and perspectives already known on a problem set, it can help all the members of a collaborative quickly get up to speed on the topic.\nIt is a way to:\nCompare studies and know \u201cwhat\u2019s out there\u201d on a specific topic\nAnalytically examine existing body of research\nIdentify an article that documents a particular fact\nBring order out of too much information spread across too many places\nWhy do a literature review?\nPut your work in context and know what others \u2018out there\u2019 are doing\nDiscover \u2018best practices\u2019 & \u2018worst nightmares\u2019\nSupport and justify grant proposals, new programs, interventions, evaluations, presentations, staff development\nGive your work credibility\nFulfill intellectual and personal curiosities\nOrientation outside of one\u2019s own organization\nAt some point early on in the process of issue exploration comes the point of acknowledging that one\u2019s own organization does not have the capacity to solve the problem. Whether because of the size, the complexity of the problem or the lack of resources, one understands that one cannot act alone. The knowledge and resources found in a single organization is often inadequate to tackle the problem set.\nThus the intelligence gathering and sharing of many organizations might provide the additional knowledge needed to produce a more effective response to a problem set such as homelessness or poverty.\u00a0 And this awareness leads a change agent and their organization to decide to work outside existing organizational boundaries.\nModule 2 Resources\nResources:\nHomer-Dixon, Thomas, (2000) The Ingenuity Gap, How Can We Solve the Problems of the Future?\u00a0\u00a0 New York, Alfred A Knopf.\nRobert Horn, David and Lucille Packard Foundation July 16, 2001Knowledge Mapping for Complex Social Messes Download at: http://www.stanford.edu/~rhorn/a/recent/spchKnwldgPACKARD.pdf\nMary O'Hara-Devereaux, Navigating the Badlands: Thriving in the Decade of Radical Transformation John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2004.\nFrances Westley, Brenda Zimmerman, and Michael Quinn Patton. 2006.

The good leader is he who the people revere. The great leader is he who the people say, \"We did it ourselves.\"\u00a0 -- Lao Tzu\nMotivation to Collaborate\nCollaborative processes don\u2019t gain momentum unless potential participants see a benefit from the investment of their time and energy.\nIn the Inter-Agency Services Collaboration Project (IASCP), the authors found that the motivation and perception of benefit\u00a0 for many organizations in the NPO sector comes the difficulty of dealing with complex social issues or pressing gaps in service delivery that need to be addressed.\nIn one of the reports, the East Scarborough Storefront Project: A successful inter- organizational service collaboration, the notion of \u201coverwhelming need\u201d motivated \u00a0the initial community agencies and community activists to collaborate.\u00a0\u00a0 A new population consisting of refugees with few supports moved into short term housing in this suburban community and the need for services was so apparent that community members mobilized and invited in existing agencies to collaborate to provide services. \u00a0-\nMotivation to collaborate emerged as critical element in another IASCP project, the Korean Interagency Network (KIN) process. Participants keenly expressed their anxiety over the sustainability of their organizations and concern over their communities to equitable access to public resources in one of the planning sessions. Participants and observers noted that mainstream and larger organizations that were members of KIN did not feel compelled to participate.\u00a0 Many thought that they did not share the same issues that motivated the other participants to collaborate.\nIn another report for the IASCP project: Service Delivery Collaboration in the Toronto NPO Sector A Key Informant Survey by Heather Graham, the respondents reported that mandated collaborations are generally viewed as not sustainable \u2013 but not because of lack of resources so much as the lack of commitment to the issue; they aret seen more as opportunistic than having a genuine committtment to the problem.\u00a0 So when funders build incented partnership programs, the motivation to participate by agencies is to secure the funding rather than deal with a complex problem or mess .\nIn another IASCP report: Service Delivery Collaboration in Nonprofit Health and Community Services What does Government Want, the author Rob Horwath surfaced a widespread view within government circles and documented in public reports, that collaboration is seen as tool to improve service delivery systems. Yet, policy supports to facilitate inter-organization collaboration are few and exist primarily at the municipal level. Most importantly, provincial supports do not exist even though this is the level of government where NPOs receive 80-% of their funding to provide community based health and social services. The preceding paragraph needs tobe re-worded more simply.\nThroughout the IASCP research process, respondents \u00a0in the key informant study and round table reported their suspicion of the motivation of funders when they develop collaboration funding programs.\u00a0 Without support to build the inter-organizational capacity needed to address the complex territory of collaboration and government\u2019s \u00a0veiled efforts to downsize and streamline delivery systems, NPOs and Government funders seemed to be working at cross purposes. I assume this is the repondents\u2019 view \u2013 it should be more clearly stated to reflect the speaker \u2013 this is not OHCC\u2019s position; we have had numerous positive relationships with government funders who were supportive of our collaborative efforts\nThe IASCP project reports documented the commitment to tackling difficult social issues despite the lack of funding for bottom up initiatives and the lack of capacity in the NPO sector. Many NPO organizations and their leadership are continuing to embark on new collaborative ventures to tackle the social messes that they are mandated to address.\nAnd within that commitment, it always takes one person in one organization to say \u201clets step outside of our organizational boundaries and work with others to find a new strategy for this complex problem\u201d.\u00a0 This person if empowered to go forward, assumes the convening role.\nThe Convening Role\nThis role is one of the most difficult roles of an NPO leader.\nOne might be a good manager but a terrible convener. Whereas a manager or a director has the ability to use coercive power to motivate people to assume work tasks, the convener of a collaborative has no formal authority over other members of a collaborative.\u00a0 Influence and persuasion skills are critical and the process of enrolling people to sign onto a new collaborative venture can feel like having one\u2019s teeth pulled. A convener has to summon up the vision and enthusiasm to act as a counterforce to NPO leaders who are overwhelmed with paperwork and need to respond on a moment\u2019s notice to what seem to them, irrational decisions like cutbacks and administrivia requirements\u00a0 by decision makers.\u00a0 A convener\u2019s personal leadership style needs to be more lateral in nature than the leadership style needed in hierarchical organizations\u00a0\u00a0 And yes, most NPOs are still organized hierarchically because their funders require it. However since so much NPO work is focused on building relationships NPO Managers may have a leg up on their private sector counterparts.\nSector managers hail themselves\nBy Andy Ricketts, Third Sector, 20 June 2007\nVoluntary sector managers think they have significantly better political skills, such as developing partnerships and strategy, than private sector leaders.\nA survey of almost 1,500 managers by the Chartered Management Institute revealed that third sector managers rated their skills at building alliances at an average of 4.04 out of five, whereas private sector bosses rated themselves at 3.89. Charity managers gave themselves 4.09 for strategic direction, compared with 3.94 in the private sector.\nMike Petrook, public affairs manager at the institute, said: \"Charity managers have much more exposure to partnership development because it is so important to build up relationships in order to succeed.\"\nStephen Bubb, chief executive of chief executives body Acevo, said other sectors could learn from charity leaders. \"Third sector leaders must have the political acumen to manage negotiations with the board as well as managing staff and public image,\" he said.\nfrom a British study - referred to at\nhttp://www.thirdsector.co.uk/News/DailyBulletin/665423/Sector-managers-hail-themselves/424B2185B2D173B60550B08A8C792A5F/\nThe principal task of a convener is to recruit the members of the potential collaborative. The convener can be one person or can be members of a steering committee.\u00a0 The invitation to participate needs to address the issue of motivation and benefits to collaborating.\u00a0 When enrolling participants conveners need to identify and work with the self interest of their target members.\u00a0 This sets a tone of authenticity and honesty to establish a collaborative of mutual benefit.\u00a0 Since the collaborative has no structure to begin with, the convener and members establish a process of co-creating a new organizational structure (a trans-organizational system).\u00a0 However, self interest does not lead the development of a common purpose for a new collaborative. If the collaborative is formed to seek a funding opportunity as we saw earlier, people will take the money, form a collaboration in name only and go back to what they were doing before. An appeal to higher ideals and the common good is necessary to sustain the work over the long term and develop the complex solutions to social messes that come from commitment and hard work.\nA convener may assume the chairing role once meetings start, but this does not need to happen automatically. \u00a0Someone must assume the co-ordination activities of organizing and scheduling the first meeting so the convener or convening committee usually assumes that responsibility. Whether the convener continues to provide co-ordination or leadership is an issue the group needs to decide early on in the process.\u00a0 Some personality types are really good networkers and are able to bring diverse people and organizations together. However they have poor co-ordination and management skills and thereby fail to undertake the ongoing co-ordination needed to keep up the momentum of an emerging group. Groups are wise to discuss the issue and find ways to complement the skills of its members rather than assume the person who called the initial meeting will do all the support work from them on.\nThe process of identifying and selecting those desired members is explored in Step 3.\nAnother term and role that the convener sometimes assumes \u00a0is champion. \u00a0Many leadership experts see this role or aspect of leadership as necessary to make large system change. \u00a0These experts think that a leader is necessary to develop a vision of a desired future or a solution to the problem, to communicate it in order to inspire others to join in and implement the vision.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Definitely a well communicated problem definition and possibilities for a common strategy is necessary to convince participants to join a collaborative process however if\u00a0 there is no opportunity to explore the problem and discuss strategies and solutions that incorporate members\u2019 perspectives, the collaborative will not survive. A collaborative has the potential to function democratically as each member has one vote or the power to vote with their feet and disengage.\u00a0\u00a0 When pulling people together convenors should champion the collaborative, not their vision. \u00a0There is power in defining the problem and defining the appropriate solutions. When one person\u2019s (or organization\u2019s) interpretation and ideas get all the say, others shy away.\nLubricating the mechanisms of the group mind so that it can think and act brilliantly demands emotional intelligence. Daniel Goleman ( Goleman, p 204)\nReflection Questions for taking on the Convening Role\nDoes addressing the issue fall within the mission and mandate of my agency?\nWhat might be the outcome on our clients?. Would they get better service?\nCan my agency develop a program without the help of other organizations? Do we have the skills and funding?\nIs a collaborative process the best mechanism to formulate a solution to the issue?\nIs there enough good will and trust amongst potential members to overcome the tension of being competitors at times?\nWhat is the likelihood of other organizations getting involved? Do they care about the issue? Do they have a mandate to address it?\u00a0 Is there competition for their time and attention? Is a big event or transition coming up that might deflect time and resources from the focus of the collaborative?\nDo I and or my staff have the time available to devote to this process?\nWill potential funders look upon the collaborative favourably?\nWhat would be the possible interventions that would address the problem set? What combination of agencies/people and skills would be needed to support the possible interventions?\nWhat might be some possible benefits to my organization, my sector and or community? What kinds of challenges might emerge?\nOnce the above questions are answered you will have a better understanding of the likelihood of success. If the answers don\u2019t show overwhelming benefits and possible support from potential members consider alternatives such laying a foundation of trust building or waiting for better conditions to emerge.\nPersonal Commitment\nCollaboratives, because of their potential for power sharing, are a different kind of organization than those of our workplaces.\u00a0 Participating and leading in a collaborative requires different skills and leadership approaches. This is not always apparent to all members and unless there is open and honest communication about expectations around leadership and participation most people revert to what they know. In our\u00a0 society, employees\u00a0 and managers know best how to behave in hierarchical organizations often where the boss is treated as a supreme ruler because of the coercive power and formal authority that come with the position of manager.\nBut in a collaborative, formed on a voluntary basis where no-one has coercive power, when everyone around the table is a volunteer, traditional leadership skills such providing direction and communicating expectations just alienates others.\nA style called Lateral Leadership is needed.\nWhat are the characteristics of Lateral Leadership?\nAnyone with or without a title at any time can provide this kind of leadership, The power sourced with this kind of leadership is usually informal such as the power to influence and persuade. You need to be able to communicate and convince without having coercive power as every participant is free to exercise the power to walk.\nMany of the skills of lateral leadership are synonymous with adult learning principles and many are the skills we associate with organization development or change management. Some of the skills associated with these characteristics are influencing and persuading, critical thinking, effective questioning, and decision making.\nLateral leadership requires a high level of competency of emotional intelligence \u2013 is this the same as emotional literacy. By working with the emotional as well as the rational, a leader (in whatever role) can build trust with others.\nCompetencies for Emotional Intelligence:\nSelf-awareness. Building a vocabulary for feelings; knowing the relationship between thoughts, feelings and reactions; knowing if thought or feeling is ruling an action.\nDecision-making. Examining actions and knowing their consequences; a self-reflective view of what goes into decisions.\nManaging feelings. Monitoring ''self-talk\" to catch negative messages such as internal put-downs; realizing what is behind a feeling (e.g. the hurt that underlies anger).\nSelf-concept. Establishing a firm sense of identity and feeling esteem and acceptance of oneself.\nHandling stress. Learning the value of exercise, guided imagery, and relaxation methods.\nCommunications. Sending \"I\" messages instead of blame; being a good listener.\nGroup dynamics. Cooperation; knowing when and how to lead, when to follow.\nConflict Resolution. How to fight fair and apply the win-win model for negotiating compromise\nAdapted from Daniel Goleman (2000) Working with Emotional Intelligence\nExercise1 : Questions for Personal Reflection\nQuestions for Personal Reflection:\nThink about a time when you faced a stressful situation at work.\u00a0 Record some of the physical symptoms that you experienced.\nWrite down the emotions or behaviors that you normally exhibit when you are faced with a stressful situation (note typical patterns).\nWhat effect, if any, do these outward emotions or behaviors have on your performance?\nWhat effect, if any, do these outward emotions or behaviors have on others?\u00a0 And, how do you know?\nName ONE behavior that you currently exhibit under stress that people around you would notice immediately if you changed it.\nLateral Leadership is also about making space for others to assume their power and voice\nAffirm the ability of those members that may be at risk of marginalization\nProvide those members with opportunities to participate in the work and assume a challenge\nEmphasize that learning comes through on the job learning and that competence increases through doing and trying\nAffirm a sense of belonging\nValue multiple perspectives\nEvoke diverse role models for the entire group\nProvide constructive feedback through questions rather than judgments\n(Roberts, P 170)\nModule 3 Resources\nSharon King and Larry Petersen, (2007) Bridging Boundaries: Lessons from Leaders: Starfield Consulting Download at http://www.starfield.ca/index.php\nDaniel Goleman, (1995) Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.

In the case of a family, the system principle is to provide emotional and financial support and/or raise children. In the case of a non-profit organization, the mission is to provide service or education. In a business, the system principle is the provision of goods or services for profit.\u00a0\u00a0 A collaborative must have a system principle or a purpose too.\n2) Organizations manage knowledge to achieve desired results -- knowledge being a critical mass of information looked at through the lens of experience and critical thinking, which enables us to predict and control something.\u00a0\u00a0 Collaboratives are also a means to assemble knowledge.\n3) Organizations are comprised of knowledge specialists and generalists who manage the interface between knowledge specialties. Bits of knowledge by themselves are sterile. They become productive only if welded together into a useful body of knowledge. To make this transformation of knowledge possible is the central task for the organization.\u00a0 In other words, the work of the organization is to add value to incoming information gleaned from its workers, its customers/clients and its environment, and then transform this into the output of a service or product.\u00a0 If there is not a value added process or transformation, then there is no work and no authentic organization.\u00a0 In the case of a family the transformation of knowledge results in meeting the needs of family members, emotionally as well as financially.\n4) A collaborative (trans-organizational system) manages knowledge too. It must be managed in a similar fashion to any organization comprised of specialists.\u00a0 But with collaboratives, instead of employee specialists, the member organizations are the knowledge specialists. The specialist knowledge is not necessarily the knowledge of an academic discipline but can also be the voice of lived experience by a particular constituency and in the case of an NPO can be their knowledge of service provision to their client base.\u00a0 The knowledge inputs that are needed depends on the analysis assumed of the problem by the process convener and who the convenor (might be a convening committee) identifies as a potential member of the collaborative. Therein lies the fatal flaw of the whole process. For who gets to play in the game determines the eventual direction of the outcome. As computer engineers say \u201cgarbage in and garbage out\u201d (GIGO). The saying is commonly used to describe failures in human decision making due to faulty, incomplete, or imprecise data.\nThe purpose of a collaborative is to create and implement a strategy for a complex problem. The work process is one of continuous decision-making. If the knowledge resources invited to participate in the process provide incomplete or inaccurate data , the decisions and new knowledge (incorporated into a plan) will not be effective.\nGetting the right people in the process - Step 2\n2. What are the criteria for member selection?\nAs a convener you have to decide what factors need to be addressed and are important to potential\u00a0 members.\nSample factors to consider as criteria for member selection:\nDoes the issue affect the population they serve?\nCan the potential organization bring unique knowledge and perspectives towards the problem and possible solutions\nHas the potential partner worked on the issue in our area? Do they see the gap?\nDoes the issue need to be addressed for the potential member organization to maintain credibility and influence with the community and decision makers?\nWhat would motivate them to participate in the collaborative process understanding there are competing demands for everyone\u2019s attention?\nHave we worked with the organization before? If so was the relationship productive?\nDo they have special qualities or resources that can add value to the process?\nCan they help find the resources needed to make a difference to the success of the process?\nStep 2- Exercise\nNot only do organizations have interests but people have self interest too. In one of the literature searches for the IASCP the most substantiated benefit of collaboration found in the literature was the benefit to individual\u2019s careers of participating in a collaborative. People made new contacts and were able to pursue new career opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0 It is individuals that represent the organizational members and bring their gifts needs and talents to the process.\nBrainstorm\nOn a separate sheet of paper brainstorm all the factors that motivate people to volunteer and participate in a new project.\nOnce you have completed your list, check the answer sheet to discover more .\nGetting the right people in the process - Step 3\n3. Reflection Questions for a potential member:\nInvitations to participate in collaborative processes sometimes arrive on daily basis. Many NPOs are participating in too many processes and feel a high level of burnout by taking on too much. On the other hand, the Wellesley institute Report by Heather Graham The State of Service Delivery Collaboration in the Toronto NPO Sector: A Key Informant Study found that most collaboration was only taking place at an informal level. Invitations need to be carefully considered and chosen in order to further the organization\u2019s mission, improve client outcomes and be in line with existing resources.\nQuestions to consider:\nDoes the issue affect a large segment of the population we serve?\nIs anyone else working on the issue in our area? Is there a gap?\nDo we need to participate in order for our group to maintain credibility and influence with the community and decision makers\nDoes the issue build on our previous successes?\nIf we take on the issue can we find the resources to facilitate our organization\u2019s participation?\nDoes the issue align with our organizational weaknesses or strengths?\nDo we have a partnership policy that provides guidance and parameters to the organization members who will participate?\nDoes our organization\u2019s representative to the forming collaborative have the higher level communication, negotiation and political skills to be an effective member?\nExercise: List other criteria can you identify that needs to be considered in the decision-making process?\nPower Issues in Collaboratives\nPower is energy. It is the energy to access resources and influence or make decisions. You source power in various ways. \u00a0Like energy it is neutral in terms of its goodness. Power can foster both positive and negative outcomes but currently in our culture many people think of power as dirty word. However when a collaborative is formed by joining together the power of its individual members, the power of the collaborative is enhanced and there is more energy to tackle complex problems and social messes. Power sources, turf issues and the ability to control resources are constant issues in the day to day functioning of collaboratives.\u00a0 As soon as other organizations and participants join the process, power issues emerge.\u00a0 As you identify potential participants, consider the sources of power they can bring to the process and any political dynamics that might arise.\nSources of Power\nCharisma- a leader can influence through personality and charm\nExpertise-expertise has the power to manipulate and interpret data\nForce/Coercion-compliance is gained through fear of punishment\nInformation-information can be useful to certain people\nNetworks-people with good connections have power to influence\nPositions-formal positions are vested with power and authority by all parties to the relationship. Authority is exercised\nRewards- used for compliance\nAccess to Resources- includes directly controlled pots of funding as well as relationships with funders or decision-makers\nAdapted from C. Bell and W. French, (1999) Organization development and behavioral science interventions for organizational improvement. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall\nQuestions to facilitate a personal reflection or a group discussion about power:\nWhat kinds of power does each organization/person have?\nWhat do I/we know that gives me/us power?\nWhat do I know that no-one else knows?\nWhat would make you eager to share your knowledge?\nWhat would you share and what wouldn\u2019t you share?\nDo you risk anything when you share knowledge?\nWhat level of involvement should each member have especially as to decision-making?\nWhat are the influences on the system? Who has the power to influence what we do?\nWhat are the supports/structure we need to share knowledge, skills processes, motivation/attitudes, environment, opportunity, culture and power?\nKeep in mind Power is not only what you have but what others think you have!\nResources:\nBlake Poland and Heather Graham, (2008), Hospital community collaboration handbook .\nPeter F Drucker,(1993),\u00a0 Post Capitalist Society,\u00a0 New York , Harper Collins\nLynn Eakin, We Can\u2019t Afford to Do Business This\u00a0 Way , (2007) Wellesley Institute\n"}, {"score": 1005.65845, "uuid": "1e9faf35-ec18-51e6-9a2f-0157f3d6e86d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200wb-08-28022", "target_hostname": "www.healtheast.org", "target_uri": "http://www.healtheast.org/maternity/online-childbirth-class.html", "page_rank": 1.1899444e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Preparing for Birth - <em>Online</em> <em>Course</em>", "snippet": "<em>Online</em> childbirth education is a unique alternative to Preparing for Childbirth classes that <em>are</em> held in the <em>classroom</em>.

", "explanation": null, "document": "Thoughts on Recruiting, Learning and Other Things as I Ramble around the World\nWhy People Still Like the Classroom More than e-Learning\nby Kevin Wheeler on December 29, 2009\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I have always found the classroom and the social interaction between a teacher and\u00a0 students a more satisfying experience than the typical e-learning course.\u00a0 And, most people I talk to agree.\u00a0 I enjoyed the physical activity of going to the classroom, chatting with fellow students and anticipating what the teacher would do.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. The classroom can be a boring place. Teachers regularly move at their pace, not that of the student, and present concepts that are either way too simple or way too hard.\u00a0 Some students dominate the classroom or disrupt\u00a0 it.\nEven so, the experience is often better than what is offered in online course\u00a0 These are so well designed and present everything in such a linear way that they become downright boring.\u00a0 A friend of mine equates the classroom to two-lane country roads that offer a feast for the eye \u2013 nice views, villages and farms, crazy turns and twists and lots of excitement.\u00a0 E-learning is more like the interstate highway \u2013 straight and true, passing through often unvaried terrain, and similarly boring.\nYet, I think there are ways to use technology to make course content more exciting and diverse.\u00a0\u00a0 So far, course developers have translated what they think happens in the classroom \u2013 the transfer of information \u2014 into electrons.\u00a0 What they get wrong is what they think happens in the classroom.\u00a0 Not a whole lot of information gets passed along in a classroom \u2013 that happens in the readings, labs and homework. What happens in the class are the social and networking opportunities that are missing from the online learning experience.\u00a0 Teachers answer questions and clarify concepts. If you observe a high school math class, at least half of the time is used in taking roll, opening books, passing homework in to the teacher or back from the teacher, answering questions about homework or in discussion.\u00a0 There are only a few minutes of actual new content presented.\nIs there any way the online environment can duplicate this process or even make it better?\nThe Internet gives us so much power that we are just starting to understand how to use it well for learning applications.\u00a0 And, while we don\u2019t have to duplicate the classroom environment, here are a few things that can be done to most online classes to make them more effective:\nBuild courses within a context.\u00a0 I know I learn best when material is presented within some application that I can relate to and understand.\u00a0 Calculus started to make sense to me when a teacher showed me that I could figure out how much water there was in a butterfly-shaped swimming pool by using some of the concepts derived from calculus.\u00a0 Classes can be built around a scenario or a question that gets the student involved in discovering the answer in an active way.\u00a0 Providing answers is the linear and passive way and rarely leads to real learning.\u00a0 I firmly believe we only really learn when we have to do something that requires some knowledge we don\u2019t have.\u00a0 A few students could be involved in seeking the answer to a question, or each student could have something to find and present to the class to stimulate discussion. Classes could be prefaced with a story that puts the events and learning into a framework.\nUse the power of the Internet to get people involved with each other.\u00a0 Every class should offer a way to network with others taking the same class.\u00a0 There can be instant messaging or there can be a chat room that sits beside the content but is easily accessed.\u00a0 Lack of interaction and the ability to share experiences is most often the reason why people say they don\u2019t like online learning.\u00a0 For most of us, learning takes place in casual conversation, over a coffee or beer or in a meeting.\u00a0 There needs to be a way to give and receive feedback from an instructor or coach.\u00a0 Some classes might find synchronous communication effective and others asynchronous better. The most important thing is to make sure that students get involved with each other and that passive students are asked questions or invited to participate by the class facilitator or instructor.\nLet the student go off on a tangent by building in lots of hyperlinks to things not directly relevant to the main content.\u00a0 For example, in a class on genealogy there could be links to genetics or links to articles about inherited characteristics.\u00a0 With the techniques of windows-in-windows the student could still remain attached to the main content.\u00a0 This ability to go down unusual roads adds richness and diversity to the whole learning experience.\u00a0 And the power of bookmarks and links gives the Internet a unique advantage over any other medium. Most of us want to learn \u2013 not just to digest a bunch of information or data.\u00a0 It seems like most e-learning course builders find it a lot easier to plow straight ahead rather to follow the contour of the material they are presenting.\u00a0 As each student can move through the course at their own pace, taking these side journeys can be rewarding and motivating.\u00a0 Students could be asked to provide summaries of what they learned.\nUse the power of computing and the Internet to engage students in trying out the concepts and ideas presented.\u00a0 Chemistry classes can build-in online labs, electronics classes can build-in circuit simulators, and history classes could let a student play a role in a simulated event.\u00a0 The possibilities here are endless and would truly raise online learning above what can be done in the classroom. The power of simulation is just beginning to become possible on home computers, but the military has been using simulation to teach pilots and submariners for decades.\u00a0 Simulation is probably the most effective way to teach that there is because it is almost identical with actually doing it.\u00a0 Course developers need to focus on adding this, even in bits and pieces, to the classes they develop.\nWhat makes learning effective is involvement and motivation.\u00a0 By adding context and interaction you raise involvement and by using simulations and links you create motivation and excitement. The concepts and ideas I have outlined are far from new or original, but they need to be incorporated into the new classes that are being developed.\n"}, {"score": 983.45294, "uuid": "276071f3-3a6f-5c94-a9de-243e56c9020f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-60-25037", "target_hostname": "www.aot.edu.au", "target_uri": "http://www.aot.edu.au/e-learning.html", "page_rank": 1.611454e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Elearning articles - Elearning - <em>Online</em> <em>Courses</em>", "snippet": "When you take <em>online</em> classes, you have the advantage of not having to go to a <em>physical</em> <em>classroom</em> on a daily basis.

Without time to attend school in this fast-pace world, many people begin to look for credible institutes of knowledge in a place previously thought to contain anything but. With nationally recognised online courses in management, business, human resources, computing, self improvement, HR, and many more, Accredited Online Training is blazing a fiery path to knowledge with their informative, convenient, and, most of all, conversant courses.\nAccredited Online Training (AOT) is a Registered Training Organisation under the Australian Quality Training Framework. What sets them apart from hordes of online institutes less attuned to individual needs is the sheer dedication to the dexterity of teaching AOT supplies. Providing a high-quality, affordable education to people from all walks of life is viewed as an inherent right by AOT; however, isn\u2019t looked upon with the same favorable light by the majority of other establishments.\nAOT uses the latest technological advancements to propel and enhance the learning process. Not only is this vital to an individual\u2019s ability to learn and maintain the knowledge, it also helps them to apply what they\u2019ve learned in real-life settings with regularity and results. New methods of teachings require a greater dedication to the student and it is here that AOT excels in every aspect of online training.\nTeaching the individual, however, can be scrutinized and the results found and taken out of context could be less than flattering to a teacher\u2019s reputation. The difficultly level in teaching an individual rests half in the hands of that individual. To further emphasise the point that their techniques are superior, AOT teaches entire businesses and organisations as well as the individual. In the framework of knowledge, educating the many has always proved a difficult task. With nationally recognised success in this area, AOT proves, again, to be not only credible, but experts in their respective field.\nTheir approach is different from conception, leading to enhanced results upon completion. AOT provides early planning and early staging and writing of course content. This continues through your final training package, training support, and even your assessment if required. Students also have an open line of communication at all times, via phone access, email, and even live online chat. It\u2019s this hand-on approach that lets a student know he or she is never alone in their journey for knowledge. The stigma of taking courses online is removed with extreme prejudice due to AOT\u2019s commitment to higher learning.\nThe courses are developed to be exciting, gripping, and improve a student\u2019s involvement in the material. Courses are also extremely user-friendly, and are available through a CD ROM, face to face, Internet delivery, Mobile device, or any combination of the aforementioned methods. The emphasis is always on learning, and whatever AOT can do to improve your understanding of the material, they show no hesitation in molding their courses around the students. This is yet another reason why Accredited Online Training leads the pack.\nE-Learning in the future\nIs the future actually now? Asking many of the world\u2019s tech-junkies, they all insist that the answer is an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d. With the sheer speed of global technological advancement, it only makes sense that people are not only taught to deal with computers, but also taught by them. No, it\u2019s not like learning to play Oregon Trail on floppy disk, nor is it akin to some exaggerated version of a survey. Electronic learning, or E-Learning, is real knowledge taught to students, but instead of a live, human teacher, the medium of instruction is sophisticated computer technology.\nThe technical types aren\u2019t the only demographic aboard this fast-moving train. Many people seeking to better themselves, to become knowledgeable of this \u201cnew\u201d world, are seeking the help of E-Learning. With hybrid cars that receive 100 miles per gallon, satellites that can see billions of years into the universe\u2019s past, and kitchen appliances that know what you want before you do, it\u2019s only fitting that the next logical step in evolution is to implement an infallible source of teaching.\nThe concept of E-Learning has been around for decades, and by 2006, over 3-million students were participating in E-Learning in the United States alone. However, E-Learning isn\u2019t restricted to \u201cstudents\u201d in the typical sense. Everyone is a student, regardless of age, and if you feel your education needs to be furthered or simply completed, E-Learning is widely available to use at your desire.\nE-Learning is commonly synonymous with flexible learning and distance learning. A broad interpretation is used when describing this teaching technique, with the \u201ce\u201d having meanings such as energetic, extended, enthusiastic, and educational in addition to its original \u201celectronic\u201d identifier. What E-Learning was and what it is now are wholly different; moreover, what it will become in the future is uncertain. But, with other technologies setting the benchmark, E-Learning is expected to follow suit and become even more sophisticated and user-friendly.\nFor the person using E-Learning to further their education, unnecessary and tedious travel, as well as costly courses and institutions \u2013 some of which require acceptance via an unfriendly application process \u2013 become obsolete. To be accepted for a course, all one must do is pay a nominal fee. E-Learning doesn\u2019t judge your past, it doesn\u2019t require your full attention daily, nor do you have to leverage your teacher with an apple or the proverbial brownnosing. As a student, you\u2019re working on your own schedule. You complete studies in the comfort of your own home. Your computer is your classroom, and your teacher is incapable of showing bias or failing to supply you with ample information.\nThe goals of E-Learning, now and in the future, are to broaden the horizons of students and guide them through information in specific tasks. The courses provide base content, and lessons build as your learn. There are no deadlines, no pop-quizzes; the student is free to learn at his or her own pace. The only expectation is that a student becomes more proficient in the selected field.\nE-Learning in the Workplace\nBusiness owners and Human Resources managers understand the value their employees bring to the company.\u00a0 Hiring an employee is an investment in the company and it is wise to cultivate the skills of an employee who is hard working and dedicated.\u00a0 One of the best ways of doing this is with continuing education.\u00a0 An employee can keep abreast of the latest trends and add to their skill set.\u00a0 This not only helps an employee with personal growth but the practical aspects of their learning can be directly and immediately applied to their work which can greatly benefit the company in the form of more efficient and accurate productivity.\nEmployees who are offered continuing education classes have a tendency to be more loyal to the company where they work.\u00a0 They see the company is interested in their personal growth and advancement and they will be more prone too want to utilize their additional skills to the benefit of the company.\u00a0 The classes are an investment and cost money but it is an investment into a valuable resource that will ultimately help grow the company in the form of long term, dedicated, skilled personnel.\nIn a traditional classroom setting, though, there are several disadvantages.\u00a0 First, the employee must be out of the office which can sometimes be detrimental.\u00a0 In order for the employee to get the most out of the class, they can not be disturbed with questions or issues that may arise on a daily basis.\u00a0 Often this means some sacrifice of daily work productivity in order to accommodate the needs of the student.\u00a0 Next, the course work is usually in a condensed form and retention levels are not as high as if they were able to take their time on a more personal basis to absorb the material.\u00a0 Finally, traditional continuing education is generally expensive because of the staffing and equipment needed to accommodate the class.\nE-learning, however, eliminates all these problems and allows a student to learn valuable skills without sacrificing their productivity.\u00a0 E-learning classes are typically less expensive than traditional classes.\u00a0 This is because the school can offer course work without the additional overhead traditional classroom settings require.\u00a0 This savings is then passed on to the customer.\u00a0 From a strictly direct financial point of view, a company saves money on the class.\u00a0 However, the company saves money in other indirect areas as well without sacrificing the quality of the education the employee receives.\nAn employee who is offered E-learning classes has a tendency to retain much more of the knowledge they learn.\u00a0 They are able to work at their own pace and continue on only after they thoroughly grasp the course work.\u00a0 The obvious advantage is when there is a difficult concept, they can review and work on it until they have a clear understanding of it and move on to the next segment.\u00a0 However, there are also those who learn faster or who already have bits of knowledge on a particular subject.\u00a0 When forced to stick to a subject that is already familiar in a traditional class, a student tends to get bored and stops paying attention.\u00a0 This may affect motivation and they may miss valuable pieces of information.\u00a0 However, with E-learning, they can go as fast or as slow as they need to get the complete picture.\nHaving a more in depth knowledge of the course ultimately helps the company and can have an indirect financial impact by allowing the employee to use their newly developed skills to the benefit of the company.\u00a0 When this helps process improvement, efficiency and productivity, you are getting more from your resource than you were previously.\u00a0 In other words, your employee is saving you money by working faster and better.\nAn employee has a job to do.\u00a0 In the daily operations, often questions need to be asked and issues need to be addressed.\u00a0 In a traditional classroom setting the employee can be out of the office for a significant time period.\u00a0 This can affect productivity and stall projects unnecessarily.\u00a0 However, when using E-learning in the workplace, if there is something that needs the immediate attention of the employee, they can simply pause their studies, take care of the issue then return to the class.\u00a0 The normal flow of business is not interrupted and productivity is not halted.\nWith all the advantages of E-learning in the workplace, it is no wonder so many companies are turning to this method of continuing education to benefit their employees.\u00a0 Employees who take continuing education courses are a valuable asset to a company.\u00a0 They can use their increased skill set to benefit the company and increase productivity, accuracy and efficiency.\u00a0 E-learning specifically helps the company financially both directly and indirectly.\u00a0 The employee learns valuable skills, learns more quickly, retains the knowledge and can still be available throughout the day for operational issues.\nMaking money while learning Online\nOnline learning is a great way to achieve your educational and learning goals while saving money and time by avoiding commuting costs and other funds associated with college. It has become an accepted and viable alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar classes on college campuses.\u00a0 For busy professionals and working students who may have tight schedules, it provides the freedom to work a normal job and then have online classes mostly in the evenings and weekends from the comfort of your home without having to make campus visits.\u00a0 It should be noted that online learning does require a lot of responsibility from the student to make time for regular online sessions.\nOne of the many advantages online learning is that it is asynchronous, meaning that in most cases the student can set his or her own study times at any time of the day or night.\u00a0\u00a0 This allows professional students to study at any time that suits their schedule best, whether it\u2019s 10 pm on a Sunday night or 8 am on a Monday morning.\u00a0 Also, most online classes have the course information and materials fully available online and students simply need to log in \u00a0to see the current assignments or subject matter and complete the needed work.\u00a0 In many cases the student can learn and then sit for midterms, exams and tests at their own pace.\nMany working students are opting for online learning in greater numbers because it allows them to attend schools that are out of state or in some cases in foreign countries.\u00a0 Online schools like the University of Phoenix online offer masters and MBA programs for busy workers who have families and a full time job, saving them the added responsibility of campus commutes.\u00a0\u00a0 While some online schools offer a completely online experience, some online school require the student to visit the campus is for orientation and occasion exams.\nBusy young adults with fulltime jobs can also reap the benefits of online learning because they are free to work normal jobs and take online classes once they get off the clock.\u00a0 Even though many students are still able to get scholarships and grants, it is not uncommon for students and their families have to pay for all books and classes if they are unable to secure any school funds.\u00a0\u00a0 In trying economic times, getting school loans becomes much harder, so the option to hold a decent job is necessary to buy text books and classes.\nOnline schools usually have tools like virtual class rooms, online whiteboards, audio and video sessions, email, instant messenger, forums and many other avenues to interact with teachers and other students.\u00a0 If you are a group learner the tools mentioned above allow you to work with your peers and have group study sessions and work on assignments.\u00a0 Loner\u2019s can also benefit from these tools by finding the information they need quickly and effectively and then completing the course work on their own at their preferred pace.\u00a0 All this teaches students how to navigate complex web applications and websites in addition to their normal course work.\nOnline Study for the Next Generation\nFrom the time we are small children through our late teenage years, we are continually in school.\u00a0 After graduation from high school it is time to decide what it is we want to do with the rest of our lives, go to university, get a degree and embark on our professional careers.\u00a0 However, going to university costs money and many kids are not ready to go straight to university after graduation.\u00a0 For those who decide to take some time off before going to university to work and earn some money, there is still an option available that will allow you to get an education without having to sit in a classroom and adhere to a stringent schedule.\nOnline study is the ideal solution for those who do not want to go straight to university.\u00a0 Not only can you continue to work and earn money but you can learn valuable skills that will help you in your job and allow you to advance professionally without having to go to daily classes.\u00a0 In actuality, online classes can benefit a student greatly by allowing them the ability to gain practical work experience coupled with a formal education.\u00a0 This can serve them well once they do decide to go to university or can help them continue their career path with online degree programs where the knowledge they learn can be immediately put to practical use.\nWhen you take online classes, you have the advantage of not having to go to a physical classroom on a daily basis.\u00a0 You can study on your time schedule and learn at your own pace.\u00a0 The classes that are available for online study also give you a much more practical advantage in the work place with the variety of classes that are available.\u00a0 You can choose a diploma program in several areas, a certificate program or you can take short courses for continuing education.\u00a0 All classes are designed so that you can learn and earn at the same time.\nSome students who choose to go to university and work at the same time have a difficult time juggling both.\u00a0 The time constraints can put additional stress on a student and they will find they are not excelling in either endeavor.\u00a0 In a traditional classroom setting there are certain times when you must attend class.\u00a0 This means you have to physically be present, listen to the course material, absorb it and understand it.\u00a0 Additionally, you will have tests to prepare for and homework that is assigned and due with stringent deadlines.\u00a0 Add this to a full work load and it is nearly impossible to get everything done. Even if you can get everything finished and be in class when needed and be on time for work, how much of the course work is actually sinking in?\nWith online study, though, these stresses are completely eliminated.\u00a0 You can study your course work when you have the time.\u00a0 You do not have to sacrifice your work schedule to accommodate a class schedule.\u00a0 So, if you get home from work, relax for awhile and then feel motivated to study, you can do it then.\u00a0 You can take some time on the weekend or in the middle of the night.\u00a0 Whenever you feel you are refreshed and ready to learn, you can log on to your class and learn the material.\u00a0 You can work on your assignments at your leisure and put forth the effort when you are motivated.\nOnline study certainly helps with scheduling conflicts.\u00a0 However, the added advantage to online study is knowledge retention.\u00a0 When you study when you are at your best you are more likely to retain what it is you learned.\u00a0 This can be a significant advantage over traditional university study.\u00a0 Not only that, you have the ability to review and re read your course work until you have a firm grasp of the concepts.\u00a0 When trying to work and continue your education, this can be especially beneficial.\nFor those who wish to take some time off after graduation to earn some money but still want to continue their education, online study offers the ideal solution.\u00a0 It will allow you to learn while you earn without the stresses of a stringent schedule.\u00a0 You can work at your own pace from the comfort of your own home.\u00a0 In addition, you have the potential to retain more of what you learn than if you were in a traditional classroom setting.\u00a0 This will allow you to put your skills to immediate use for advancement within your job and will also give you an advantage once you do decide to go to university by granting you practical work experience along with your education.\n"}, {"score": 979.88446, "uuid": "496631a2-7e70-581f-af27-38fac06641d6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-95-10268", "target_hostname": "www.teflonline.net", "target_uri": "http://www.teflonline.net/tefl-course/", "page_rank": 1.5545404e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "TEFL <em>Course</em> Information | In-Class &amp; <em>Online</em> TEFL <em>Courses</em>", "snippet": "So you can <em>better</em> understand where your students <em>are</em> coming from, we provide trainees with instruction in an unknown language.

Heads of 200 journalism and mass communication programs at member schools of the Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication were surveyed in February 1996. Of the 133 (67%) responding, the average enrollment was 409 students, 368 undergraduates and 41 graduate students, with an average of 16 full-time faculty. Results indicated that access to online resources, including email and the Internet, was provided to professors in 96% of the journalism and mass communication programs, with 87% providing access to the World Wide Web (WWW). Students had access to these resources in 93% of these programs, with 90% giving access to email and the Internet, and 80% to the WWW. Other online services include university library catalogs, registration and class information, and networked software. A home page on the WWW was reported in 71% of the programs and 50% of the professors have WWW pages. Professors used computer online resources in teaching classes in 88% of the schools and 72% communicate with students via email. Online distance education was only offered in 23 of 133 programs (17%) and only 3 met in real-time. Findings revealed, however, that only about 60% of program administrators reported that online resources had substantially changed how these programs were taught. Although online teaching may not be as effective as traditional classroom teaching, respondents suggest that it is a viable distance learning method, reaching students who could not otherwise be reached.\nERIC_NO: ED439873, Designing an Online, Introductory Gifted Education Course. Hull, Debra F.; Bull, Kay S.; Montgomery, Diane; May, James R.; Overton, Robert, 2000\nABSTRACT: Rural teachers are often undertrained in the identification and education of gifted students. This paper describes the principles and development of an online introductory course in gifted education that could meet the need for rural teacher training. Using the philosophy that learners construct their own knowing, the system for developing an online course must be consistent with the idea of authentic problem solving. Learners are then able to transform information into knowledge. To promote active learning, the instructional system contains primary source materials, support, and information to manipulate. Content is presented from diverse perspectives via multiple modes of representation. The teacher coaches and helps students analyze learning and problem-solving strategies. Tasks are accessible to learners when they are ready for them and have patterns that can be transferred to future tasks with scaffolding. The design is holistic and spiral, allowing learners to return to the content at successively higher levels of understanding. E-mail, a listserv, and interactive databases encourage the development of a collaborative learning community; 15 characteristics of such a community are listed. Course development included development of the syllabus, with instructions and links to other course components; a threaded discussion database for asynchronous student interaction; a database of products and projects created as part of course requirements; a multigenerational archive; and the home page.\n3. Action: Asynchronous and Synchronous, Teacher's actions, Student's actions\nThe instructor provides online learning opportunities and organizes all into courses or modules.\nOnline education refers to learning/teaching that takes place via a computer network. It can be a local bulletin board system (BBS), the WWW, a local area network (LAN), or \"computer mediated communication\" (CMC). There is also email and chats.\nERIC_NO: ED439234, Achieving Quality with Online Teaching Technologies, Fahy, Patrick J., 2000\nABSTRACT: Online teaching technologies still have three main disadvantages: cost, complexity, and negative impacts on productivity. In many areas of Canada, cost is still a major factor affecting ownership and use of computers and other new technologies. Until online teaching technologies become as simple to use as telephones and new cars, they will continue to fail to produce productivity increases. The Internet illustrates how online teaching technologies have been a mixed blessing. The Internet's potential advantages as a teaching tool stem from the fact that it is engrossing and inherently interesting, incorporates multi-sensory uses of media, provides enormous numbers of connections to other sources of information and interaction, allows everyone an individualized experience, and can both reflect and be a creation of teachers and learners. However, these same characteristics also account for some of the Internet's major weaknesses as a teaching tool. Any plan to use the Internet and other new technologies as teaching tools must begin with a quality-oriented assessment of the given technology's fitness for use as a teaching tool. Factors to consider include whether the technology is directly related to the learning outcomes of specific audiences of learners, affordable, readily accessible to local users, and durable and long-lasting.\nProblem-based Learning\nCourse Components developed by the teacher:\n1. Objectives: Learner's actions that are observable and measurable. Knowledge (cognitive: identify, select, describe, etc), Skill, Attitude. For each hour of CE learning, 2-3 objectives.\n2. Outline: Based on objectives, I, A, 1, a.\n3. Content: Based on outline. With Introduction (and Assignment, where needed), Part I, II, etc., and Review.\n4. References: Based on outline. (Bibliography, Library): About 8-10 current web-sites, speeches given within 2 years, articles published within 5 years or books produced within the last 10 years.\n5. Test: Multiple choice questions based on objectives, 1-2 per objective. Recall questions, Reasoning questions.\nDiscussion Questions: 1. Where are the students going to get the information they need in obtaining the learning objectives in an online course? 2. Since we cannot see each other, it is hard to tell if you are bashful, bored, or sarcastic. How do you communicate online? 3. Identify some means of measuring learning outcomes. 4. Identify the\u00a0 steps in converting an curriculum to an online curriculum. Why? 5. What value does synchronous learning. Why?\u00a0 6. What value does asynchronous activity have in online learning. Why?\nDiscussion Topics: 1. What is a virtual classroom? How do synchronous and asynchronous learning differ?\u00a0 3. Where can you find online resources for instruction, virtual communities and learning communities, and basic technology tools. 4. Contrast online courses with\u00a0 real-time courses with respect to student needs, interaction, grading, participation, course materials and instructor involvement.\nERIC_NO: ED435301, The Online Teaching Guide: A Handbook of Attitudes, Strategies, and Techniques for the Virtual Classroom. White, Ken W., Ed.; Weight, Bob H., Ed., 2000\nABSTRACT: This book presents 14 papers that offer guidance to college teachers venturing into online instruction. It is based on the experiences and ideas of faculty at the University of Phoenix (Arizona) online campus, which has been offering online courses since 1989. Chapters in the book discuss the importance of interaction and feedback, learner control, access to directions and help, consistency and organization, and assessment and recordkeeping.

Mahesh, Veena; McIsaac, Marina Stock, 1999\nABSTRACT: This qualitative study examined the structure and interaction in an online course from the meaning-perspectives of the actors involved. Participants were a teacher and teaching assistant who taught a graduate course in distance education at Arizona State University, delivered through a computer conferencing system. Data collected included interviews, observations, and messages posted by participants to a virtual classroom environment. Findings suggested that, while teachers conceded that they spent more time teaching an online course than a traditional face-to-face course, they believed the online teaching experience to be a worthwhile endeavor. In the context of an online course, teachers felt that they were more present and available for students than in a traditional course. Results of the study also suggest that students displayed better commitment to their work in an online course than a traditional course, because they have close interaction with the teacher. This close interaction can offset the lack of control the students may feel in a highly structured distance course. The personality, emotions, philosophy, and educational background of the teacher determine the structure and design of an online course, including the amount of interaction and time the teacher spends on online activities.\nERIC_NO: ED418957, Teaching on the Internet. Meeting the Challenges of Electronic Learning. Teeter, Thomas A. 1997\nABSTRACT: This paper examines how the University of Arkansas at Little Rock used Internet resources in an introductory education course, American Education. During the spring semester of 1996 and 1997, educators taught the course both via the Internet and in classrooms. Teaching materials were located on the university's website. The only difference between the online course and the classroom course was the medium of information transmission. Course objectives and assignments were identical. For the online course, students read text and lectures online and participated in listserv discussions. They took examinations in the computer lab and completed online assignments. Students also had to find sites to visit via online contacts and interview classroom teachers. Students had to serve at least 14 hours at the university's neighborhood homework center located near campus, which helps inner city elementary students with their homework. Benefits observed from the online course included higher student motivation, exposure to extended resources, and improved quality of discussion and written assignments. Drawbacks included lack of technical support and extra time required of teachers and students. Students in the online course did equally well to students in the classroom course on four examinations. A list of resources for Web teachers and a list of other resources are included.\nExplore Online Assignments with LearnWell: www.learnwell.org/assignments.htm\n4.

MacDougall, Glenn; Place, Craig; Currie, Duane. 1998\nABSTRACT: Acadia University (Nova Scotia) has completed year two of the Acadia Advantage initiative, which involved 1,500 students and 170 faculty using IBM notebook computers in the curriculum. By year 2000, all 4,000 students at Acadia University will have notebook computers and will be taking part in technology-enhanced courses. To assist faculty, the university developed a modular Automated Courseware Management Environment (ACME) which allows an instructor to easily create online courseware. The Online Testing Module (OTM) is one of the most successful modules, allowing faculty to prepare World Wide Web-based tests that include multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions, incorporating formatted text, images, video, and audio. The module is template-based, and users create tests that can be randomized, graded, and results posted both to the students and instructor. The package has proved so successful that more than 1,000 online tests are taken and marked daily. Students using the testing package for tutorial assessment have responded very favorably to the ease of access and the ability to monitor their own progress. This paper describes access control and security, test taking, creating and editing a test, question types, formatting a test, test management and statistics, and programming.\nTake this course for free.

This unit introduces the challenges for disabled students who may use computers in different ways when taking part in eLearning or may need alternative teaching methods. It covers the technology and techniques used by disabled students, the adjustments to teaching methods that might be reasonable, design decisions which affect the accessibility of eLearning tools and strategies for evaluation.\nAction Research for Personal Change - The Open University\nThis course covers techniques for and critical thinking about the evaluation of changes in educational practices and policies in schools, organizations, and informal contexts. Topics include quantitative and qualitative methods for design and analysis, participatory design of practices and policies, institutional learning, the wider reception or discounting of evaluations, and selected case studies, including those arising from semester-long student projects.\nActive, Healthy Lifestyles - U Mass Boston\nIn this unit, aimed at teachers of Physical Education, we begin by looking at some of the common misconceptions relating to fitness and activity levels together with accepted definitions of these concepts. We consider how active young people should actually be, and discuss how PE teachers can ensure they are making an effective contribution to this area of public health.\nAn Introduction to the Wider Professional Role of the Teacher in England - The Open University\nThis unit is an early study for people wishing to become a secondary teacher using the Open University's highly flexible route for graduates \u2013 known as the flexible PGCE. This unit, which considers the general professional standards and skills of a teacher whatever their secondary subject specialism, is studied following a brief two-week placement in school and prior to a much longer series of full-time school experiences.\nCareers Education and Guidance - University of California\nSuccessful transitions \u2013 whether from lower secondary to upper secondary; at age 16; into work-based training or university; or into work at any age \u2013 are life-enhancing for individuals and crucial to our future social and economic well-being. They are also an indicator of a good school. Careers education and guidance (CEG) is therefore at the heart of a school's personal development programme and all teachers have a role in securing successful transitions for their students.\nChartered Teachers in Scotland - The Open University\nTeachers often have little spare time to reflect on the day's lessons and challenges. However, this evaluation of teaching and learning experiences is vital to their professional development. This unit is an extract from the OU's Chartered Teacher Programme for Scotland and will help teachers to evaluate their practice and development opportunities.\nChildren and Violence: An introductory, International and Interdisciplinary Approach - The Open University\nChildren are subject to many forms of adversity, for example, poverty or ill health. However, a significant form of adversity experienced by children in many different regions of the world is violence. The form of violence against children varies widely and is hugely disparate. In this unit, the focus is on three different environments where children experience violence: at home, among peers at school and in the wider society (in the context of armed conflicts). The text considers the experiences of children both locally and globally.\nConversation on Instructional Design - The Open University\nThis conversation between Dr. Robert Gagn\u00e9, and Dr. M. David Merrill, took place July 10, 1989 before an audience of about 200 at Utah State University. A series of papers based on this discussion later appeared in Educational Technology Magazine. The conversation highlights the main points of Gagne and Merrill's respective learning theories, and a comparison of the events of instruction, and Component Display Theory.\nCreating Interactive Media - Utah State\nThis course will introduce students to some technologies, tools and techniques associated with the creation of interactive multimedia. The focus of the course will be on developing the capacity of professional educators to communicate effectively with professionals who contribute to the design and development of interactive multimedia.

Students need to learn how to use their body in a safe and healthy way, whilst developing a wide-ranging movement vocabulary. The use of different dance techniques can be an effective way of building vocabulary and developing different kinds of skills and abilities. Technical dance skills can form the foundation on which to develop and enhance each individual's performance. As dance teachers, we may have a range of skills, but it isn't always possible to possess expertise in every type of dance style and technique. Having the knowledge and experience to teach African Dance forms, Jazz Dance or Hip Hop to students is a great way of introducing them to a variety of styles and can be a rich and rewarding process. However, many teachers in schools and colleges work within a Contemporary Dance style because it will have been the basis of their education and training; it is also the point of reference for this unit.\nDemocracy? You Think You Know? - The Open University\nParticipating in the democratic processes is seen as being a fundamental aspect of citizenship. All pupils need a broad knowledge and understanding of the rights, responsibilities and duties of citizens, as well as an understanding of forms of government. Notions of citizenship have been forged alongside the expansion of the right to vote and the development of our ideas about democracy. In this unit we explore different interpretations of democracy and strategies for involving pupils in consideration of these issues within the citizenship curriculum.\nEncouraging Book Talk in the School Library - Kaplan University\nAs adults we sometimes struggle to justify our feelings about particular books, but children are quite clear about what they like and don't like. It is possible to get children to discuss why they liked or did not like particular books and to encourage them to think more deeply about the books they read. This unit offers ideas and activities to engage pupils in discussing books. It is aimed at librarians, teaching assistants and other adults working with pupils in school libraries.\nEnhancing Pupil Learning on Museum Visits - The Open University\nMuseums give children experiences above and beyond the everyday \u2013 experiences that enrich and build upon classroom teaching and learning. Taking pupils to a museum, or bringing museum artefacts into school, instantly changes the dynamics of the usual learning environment. It gives you as a teacher the opportunity to start afresh with each child, to reach and engage with pupils in new and different ways. This unit explores practical ways in which you can make the most of the UK's extraordinarily dynamic and diverse museums and galleries; it gives you pathways into museum resources, and shares examples of teachers and museum educators making the most of museum artefacts.\nEvaluating School Classroom Discussion - The Open University\nIt is important to learn from classroom discussions, both for pupils and teachers.

Universities and colleges throughout the U.S. require applicants to take the SAT or ACT as part of their evaluation package. This course will prepare you for both tests. Both the ACT and the SAT contain verbal and math question types. SAT/ACT Preparation Part 2 will give you all the information you need to do well on the math questions of the ACT and the SAT. The ACT math tests your knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and basic statistics. This course provides you with a complete math review of all these subjects. We\u0091ll also show you how to use your time wisely so that you finish as many math questions as possible in the 60 minutes the ACT gives you for the math test. Beginning with the March 2005 exam, the SAT math questions have changed a bit. They eliminated the quantitative comparison questions and added questions on functions and graphing functions. The lessons in this course are designed to prepare you for those changes. In addition to reviewing arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and basic statistics, we'll cover functions and other algebra II subjects now tested on the SAT. In addition to preparing you for specific question types on both exams, this course will give you pointers on time management, anxiety relief, scoring, and general standardized test-taking. Weekly assignments encourage you to work with your fellow classmates and your instructor to maximize your performance on all aspects of the math questions of the ACT and SAT. Taken with Part 1, this course will prepare you to excel in all sections of the undergraduate college entrance exams and provide you with the means to achieve your best potential score!

A music degree program offers several courses in music, dealing in music-related subjects that include (but are not limited to): music theory, music education, music technology, music business, music entertainment, and music production. The bachelor\u2019s program usually lasts from three to five years, depending on the school you choose to enroll in.\nIn North America, a Bachelor of Music degree is considered a professional degree, as well as in most universities in the United Kingdom. However, at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, a music degree is earned as a one-year postgraduate degree that can only be achieved after graduating with honors from an undergraduate music program from the same schools.\nPrerequisites\nMusic degree programs can be quite rigorous in their selection of applicants. Aside written exams and applications, institutions may require students to submit an audio or video portfolio, or any proof of musical ability. Some may even hold auditions for the program, such as the prestigious Julliard School for the Performing Arts. However, not all schools have the same prerequisites, as these may vary from institution to institution.\nAreas of study\nA typical music course used to center on two basic aspects: teaching and performance. Today, however, the program\u2019s subject matter has branched out to cover the constantly evolving forms of music. Recently, universities have begun to incorporate the latest advancements in courses that they offer, such as Music Composition with Technology, which integrates traditional music subjects with in-studio music engineering, as well as orchestrating a full-scale production.\nGenerally, coursework in a music degree program involves classroom-learned areas of study, such as Musical Theory, Music History, Voice and Articulation, and other basic principles in the field. It also requires students to choose a major, as well as gain or enhance proficiency in an instrument of choice. Aside traditional class discussions, the program may involve more hands-on musical training, such as trips to studios and conservatories, or planning full-scale musical productions, with students allowed to compose their own pieces and perform them accordingly.\nPossible career paths\nGiven the intense competition in the current music scene, a degree in music can offer a distinct edge over those who have not undergone formal schooling. There are lucrative job opportunities for degree holders in music in studios, music conservatories, small ensembles, choral groups, or musical theaters. One may also elect to oversee musical productions in the recording industry, or in multimedia associations (radio, television, and motion picture industries). Although not many consider it an option, engaging in higher studies in music is a good move if one plans to enter the academe as a music professor. There are masters and doctorate programs available in varying fields of music study, and generally will require a thesis or dissertation. In any case, the music industry is highly dynamic, and whether one would prefer performing or technically producing music, the career paths are endless.\nOur Featured Education Partners:\nBoston University\nBoston University is regionally accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

Receiving teacher feedback is more personal and less intimidating <em>online</em> <em>than</em> in a <em>classroom</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "decision-making.\nAdvantages of an Online Writing Course\nOf all the subjects taught successfully online, writing is truly a natural fit for distance learning due to the simple fact that online communication relies so heavily on the written word. Every aspect of taking an online writing course builds writing skills, from communication with the teacher to the actual assignments. An online writing course also promotes personal accountability and helps young writers set goals.\u00a0The one-on-one interaction with the instructor motivates students to want to write and complete assignments on time.\nThe nature of teacher feedback is another important difference in online writing courses. Receiving teacher feedback is more personal and less intimidating online than in a classroom. As every writer is sensitive to critique, the privacy of the online setting helps students be receptive to revising their work. In turn, students have a much easier time asking questions about their writing in a virtual learning environment without worrying about how they\u2019ll be perceived by the group. Students also benefit from the undivided attention of the teacher, who isn\u2019t being pulled in all directions simultaneously\u00a0by 30 other students. Online students get the individual writing help they need and their questions and concerns are fully addressed. Writing improvement can usually be seen by the end of one course.\nOnline Courses Are NOT Created Equally\nThe quality of online learning courses and programs can vary a great deal. As in any instructional setting, the effectiveness of distance learning requires an adequate level of the teacher\u2019s involvement. There\u2019s simply no substitute for a highly engaged, certified teacher who is experienced in conducting an online class and understands the needs of the student. Teachers should know how to navigate in the virtual world and manage their time in order to provide frequent communication and timely feedback to students. A great online instructor will create a supportive online presence that makes students feel comfortable and motivated to learn.\nEffectiveness also hinges on how well the online course is organized. Creating an online course isn\u2019t just a matter of putting traditional lesson plans online. An experienced online education provider knows how to construct a web-based course so that it enhances student learning while taking advantage of the technology.\nIs Distance Learning for Everyone?\nWhile some students take to distance learning like a duck to water, others may not adapt as readily. Students who respond best to verbal cues may have trouble initially with online classes. However, even when students need a period of adjustment, they will still learn and benefit a great deal from the experience. While every student has his/her unique learning style, exposure to different teaching methods is an essential ingredient of a well-rounded education. The best strategy is to choose an online course on a subject of interest and jump in with both feet!\nThe Social Side of Online Learning\nParents worried that virtual learning hinders the development of social skills can easily remedy their concerns by involving their children in sports and other social activities. Yet online courses are not unsociable. On the contrary, there is a social component to online study that builds important skills, such as self-expression and self-discipline. Virtual classes require students to communicate by writing and follow through in completing assignments and responding to class-related emails. Like online social networking, students become engaged in the \u201cconversation\u201d with the teacher and the other students online.\nDistance Learning: High School Graduation Requirement\nDistance learning is here to stay. In fact, distance learning has a long history, beginning with the advent of correspondence courses in the 1890s. Courses taught via television date back to the 1950s, and in the mid 1990s, colleges began to offer courses online. While no one believes virtual classrooms will replace the traditional, some experts do predict that within five years, every high school student in the nation will be taking some kind of online course. Already, some states require students to take at least one online course as a high school graduation requirement. Several colleges are also requiring online courses in their curriculum. In the near future, a student entering college without distance learning experience could be at a disadvantage.\nTime4Writing: Designed for Distance Learning\nTime4Writing courses were designed from the ground up for online delivery. Developed by certified teachers with distance learning backgrounds, Time4Writing makes student progress and satisfaction its #1 priority. Time4Writing teachers are not only highly skilled writing instructors, they are also experts in creating positive and successful online learning experiences. Students \u201cgraduate\u201d with improved writing skills and confidence due to the special attention they receive throughout each course.\nTime4Writing online courses offer a highly effective way to build fundamental writing skills and learn how to write the types of essays required for school, standardized tests, and college applications.

While the past two years have provided the Department with extensive experience in delivering courses in an electronic format, there has been limited exposure to online learning in its \"fullest\" sense. Starting this fall, however, this has changed: all first year Hotel and Restaurant Administration and Culinary Arts courses are now delivered via the Internet using the latest version of The Learning Manager. In addition, the Department is currently developing the first year of Culinary Arts for distance education delivery via the Internet. This represents a major investment of resources; however, the Department is anticipating numerous benefits to grow out of this investment.\nImpact on Day Programs\nTo date, the major benefit of having courses online is that it provides our students with 24 hour access to course content and materials. Students are able to utilize a variety of course resources and information not just at the College, but also at home after normal program hours. They are able to check their course outlines for upcoming deadlines, work with course-specific resources that would otherwise require them to be physically present at the College, research, complete, and submit assignments, and contact their instructors via e-mail if questions or concerns arise. Students no longer have numerous photocopied handouts which can be easily misfiled or lost; all resources are kept in an electronic format which students can access at any time, and which can be easily updated by the instructor as required. While this may seem like a minor point, these benefits are part of the fifth principle of the \"Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education\" - good practice emphasizes time on task.\n\"New technologies can dramatically improve time on task for students and faculty members\u0085Technology can also increase time on task by making studying more efficient. Teaching strategies that help students learn at home or work can save hours otherwise spent commuting to and from campus, finding parking places, and so on. Time efficiency also increases when interactions between teacher and students, and among students, fit busy work and home schedules. And students and faculty alike make better use of time when they can get access to important resources for learning without trudging to the library, flipping through card files, scanning microfilm and microfiche, and scrounging the reference room.\"\n[Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever http://www.aahe.org/Bulletin/Implementing%20the%20Seven%20Principles.htm ]\nIt is anticipated that the creation of distance education-specific resources will also have a significant impact on the Department's regular day programs. Students will be able to access digital video files containing instructor lectures, presentations, or demonstrations, which will assist students to catch up on material they missed if they were unable to attend their regularly scheduled classes. Students will also be able to use these same resources to review concepts which they did not fully understand after attending the specific class. The flexibility of video files means that students can review specific parts of an instructor's presentation as many times as they require until they attain an understanding of the concepts being presented. Instructors will also benefit, as they will not have to devote as much time helping a student catch up on what s/he has missed; because the student has reviewed the content, instructors will only have to focus on the specific concepts that the student is having difficulties understanding. Instructors will also be able to adapt and incorporate these new visual resources into their regular lectures and presentations, thereby providing students with a much richer learning experience than previously possible. These benefits form a part of the seventh principle of the \"Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education\" - good practice respects diverse talents and ways of learning.\n\"Technological resources can ask for different methods of learning through powerful visuals and well-organized print; through direct, vicarious, and virtual experiences\u0085Technologies can help students learn in ways they find most effective and broaden their repertoires for learning\u0085Fast, bright students can move quickly through materials they master easily and go on to more difficult tasks; slower students can take more time and get more feedback and direct help from teachers and fellow students.\"\n[Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever http://www.aahe.org/Bulletin/Implementing%20the%20Seven%20Principles.htm ]\nThis particular method of delivery will also provide appropriate levels of flexibility and challenge to the increasingly technologically savvy students enrolling at our College.\n\"Colleges and universities are about to admit to their halls a new generation of learners. They have grown up in a period of collapse for societal structures and of recombinant, interlacing growth in electronic diversion. Theirs is a world of videogames; multi-tasking and attention spans geared to what speaks to them effectively. Many of our most inquisitive learners have been at least supplementing their pre-college studies, utilizing Internet communications technology. Their 'learning diet' has included - in addition to content forays - a hefty dose of 'Internet community-based interactions'.\"\n[Learning from Learners, Internet Style http://www.educause.edu/pub/er/review/reviewarticles/33214.html ]\nThe thought of using Internet resources to research concepts, discuss course material with classmates in chat rooms and listservs, or use e-mail to submit questions as they arise to course instructors will be second nature to these learners. This new cadre of potential students will not only be able to enhance its learning using the Internet as a major resource, it will expect the Internet to be a significant component in all facets of any program of studies.\nLarger Target Audience\nIn addition to enriching existing day programs, online courses will allow the College to draw from a larger customer base. In order to take our current programs, potential students have to dedicate anywhere from 12 to 21 months exclusively to their studies. As well, they must live in Winnipeg for the duration of these programs. These requirements severely limit our pool of prospective clients. Delivering our courses in an online format will allow people who could not enroll in our existing programs due to other commitments or constraints (i.e., working full time, living too far away from Winnipeg) to be able to study at Red River College. Students will be able to study course material, complete assignments, and meet course deadlines according to individual schedules. With online courses, it does not matter when a student works on course material, as long as s/he completes and submits all required work by the deadline. With the advent of Internet technology, it does not matter where the student lives, as long as s/he is connected to the Internet.\nThis flexibility will also help to reduce or eliminate the inconveniences and deterrents experienced by people who require or are interested in taking a limited number of courses. These are individuals who do not need to complete all courses in a specific program or who do not want to enroll in an entire certificate or diploma program. Prior Learning Assessments will also increase the demand for greater program flexibility in order to meet the highly individualized needs of students who, with different backgrounds and experiences, require a unique combination of program courses. Such part-time students usually have commitments that do not allow them to come to the College several times each week in order to attend one or two hours of regularly scheduled classes. The flexibility of on-line courses will provide such learners with incentives to enroll in a College program by diminishing scheduling obstacles and inconveniences, and by addressing perceived redundancies and duplication resulting from being required to complete the full complement of program courses, regardless of the individual's knowledge, skills, and/or experience.\nThe delivery of courses in part or whole using an on-line format also alleviates the pressures to expand infrastructure; as a result, existing classroom space is used more efficiently. Scheduling classroom space just to deliver existing courses can be challenging. The building of additional space is costly and time-consuming. Even delivering a portion of existing courses in an on-line format will help free up classroom space, as students continue to progress in their studies without having to be physically present at the College. Despite the desire to offer more options in existing programs as well as expanding and diversifying College offerings through new programs, the limitations of existing classroom space will hamper such initiatives unless alternative delivery methods are incorporated which lessen the demands on current physical space.\nThe flexibility of on-line learning not only allows the College to better serve the local population base, but also helps it to enter other markets that were inaccessible before the advent of this technology. The development of quality on-line programs that can be offered at competitive prices will allow students from other regions and/or countries the option to enroll at Red River College rather than with their local colleges. Conversely, if we do not take the initiative to develop these types of course offerings, other colleges who do will be able to attract students in our region to enroll in their program as opposed to Red River College.\n\"Calgary's Southern Alberta Institute of Technology is a veteran in the development of online technology, and has ambitious plans for the future\u0085to transform itself into Cyber-SAIT by 2002. The ambitious initiative aims to offer at least 45 per cent of SAIT's courses online and to double the institute's size by attracting another 10,000 full-time students by 2004. \"We asked, 'Do we want to be a world player and move into other folks' backyard, or do we want to sit here and let other people come into our backyard?' \" says Bob Thornborough, SAIT's director of the Centre for Learning Systems. \"You either grab on to this and swing with it, or you end up going the other way.\" \"\n[Back to School Online, Macleans, September 6, 1999 http://xnet.rrc.mb.ca/tltr/report/items/macleans.htm ]\nThe Apprenticeship Factor\nOne area where on-line courses can make a major impact is that of the apprenticeship programs offered at the College. The way these programs are currently structured, apprentices are expected to attend classes over an eight week period of time for each level of apprenticeship that they are required to complete. In addition to the usual time and distance problems or inconveniences that are associated with traditional day program classes, apprentices also face additional scheduling conflicts; these are people who are already \"employed\", yet are expected to spend two months of each year in school. Employers know that apprentices must commit to an in-school component, but once these individuals are working on-site, the employer is often reluctant to release the apprentice for a two month block of time, especially if this falls during a business' traditional busy period.\nOnce apprentices have cleared all of the logistical hurdles and finally arrive at the College, they are faced with the daunting task of absorbing a year's worth of theoretical concepts in two month's time. It is important to note that apprentices have, for whatever reasons, consciously chosen to study their vocation in the field as opposed to \"going to school\". During this time, their only continued exposure to formal classroom education is through an eight week period of highly condensed theory; the possibility of these learners having a positive in-school experience during their apprenticeship seems remote.\n\"\u0085educators have been recognizing the variety of learning styles apprentices bring to their theoretical studies. While some learn best by attending lectures, many learn more effectively when allowed to proceed at their own pace and to work with interactive learning materials. In the absence of such flexible delivery options, some learners have failed to complete their apprenticeships.\" [Cooke, 1999]\nThe delivery of apprenticeship training via on-line courses will not only alleviate distance and scheduling problems, it will also allow for learning to happen at a reasonable pace throughout the year, increasing the likelihood that material learned will actually be retained. The probability of these individuals acquiring useful, life-long learning skills also increases; due to the nature of on-line courses, there will be a greater possibility that apprentices will acquire or improve independent study and research skills. For those apprentices who have had negative experiences in the traditional classroom setting, the myths that \"learning occurs only in the classroom\" and that these experiences are almost always unpleasant will be shattered. Ultimately, in the current knowledge-based economy, it is these independent learning skills that will prove to be of greater benefit to these individuals throughout their careers.\nCaveats (Mostly Money, but Other Concerns Exist Too)\nDevelopment of effective on-line courses takes time and costs money. Courses can be created quickly with a minimal financial investment in the development process; however, this process results in courses that are heavy on text, low on interactivity, and include few features that enhance the motivation of the learner. This could be viewed as the equivalent of a normal day program class where the instructor distributes a text at the beginning of the term, informs the students that the course information can be gained by reading this text, and then leaves the students to their own devices until it is time for a test or an exam. There is a possibility that some of the students in this class would complete the course successfully, however, the entire learning process in this class is left to chance. Are the students motivated enough or need the credit desperately enough to finish? Do these students know how to study independently? Will students know when to ask for help (and whom to ask)?\nGood courses, regardless of whether they are delivered in the traditional classroom or over a medium like the Internet, require an investment of time and finances for front-end development. A variety of materials, which present concepts in an effective and engaging manner, should be included to enhance the learning process. Interactivity, which constitutes a large part of the traditional classroom, needs to be built into assignments and discussions in on-line courses in order to replicate the sense of community, and to help maintain learner interest and motivation.\nThe good news is that while significant investments of time and money are required to create on-line courses, once these courses have been created and learning resources have been converted to digital format, course content can be updated and edited quickly. This means that keeping information current is much easier and less costly. Creating on-line courses needs to be viewed as a long term investment rather than quick return of funds.\nSignificant differences exist between normal classroom delivery and online delivery, and as a result, instructors delivering such programs need to be trained and effectively supported. \"Giving people (only) computers and network connections makes no more sense than giving illiterate people reams of paper and stacks of pens.\" [Technology in Higher Learning: A Third Revolution http://www.tltgroup.org/resources/dthirdrev.html ] If the instructor did not develop the course, s/he should have time to become familiar with content that needs to be delivered and to learn how to effectively develop a schedule that is realistic and achievable when using on-line delivery. As on-line delivery is a faceless medium, and there are no body language cues on which to rely when communicating with students, the instructor needs to be trained to communicate effectively with students, how to gauge if students really understand concepts being presented, and how to maintain student motivation in order to ensure that they complete the course.\nWhile increasing the number of on-line courses means that College infrastructure costs decrease, additional funds will need to be invested in the purchase, maintenance, and upgrading of all technology required in the delivery of these courses. Just as adequate space must be set aside for normal classroom delivered courses, students taking on-line courses must have guaranteed access to the web sites which host their course materials. This may sound like a relatively simple requirement; however, there are numerous complications that could impede students' work. Every time the web site which hosts course information is inaccessible to the student for any reason means that the opportunity for productive work is lost. Time on task (and, arguably, motivation) is also lost if students are forced to wait for extended periods of time while information is being transferred from College fileservers to student computers and vice versa. Because of the flexible, self-paced nature of some on-line courses, access is required 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as each student is working on course material whenever his/her personal schedule allows. Computer hardware and software become, by default, the virtual infrastructure in which the College needs to invest to ensure consistent, seamless program delivery.\nIn addition to fast, reliable hardware and software, on-line programs require competent support personnel who focus on resolving student technical problems as they arise. These human \"links\" will ensure that technology-related problems are solved in a timely fashion and that these problems do not impede students from completing coursework and meeting deadlines set out by their instructors. Efficient and accessible technical support personnel will help to ensure that students do not get bogged down in technical issues, which will ultimately result in a decrease in student frustration.\nThe nature of the Internet community has shown itself to support the maxim: \"People talk\". News of uninspiring course content, poorly trained instructors, limited technical assistance or unreliable web sites spreads quickly and will ultimately sink a program. The ability for learners to take a course or two at one time, rather than enrolling in a program can be considered a \"double-edged sword\". This is definitely beneficial, as it means individuals who would have otherwise not enrolled at the College actually sign up for classes. However, these same individuals are more likely to walk away from the program if they have a negative experience than someone who has enrolled in a full term of day courses. These individuals have invested less time and money, and have not had the opportunity to develop any extensive feelings of \"ownership\" for their program of studies. In addition, for the day student, the negative course is just one exception in a (hopefully) overall positive experience. For the on-line student, however, this may be the only course that s/he has taken at the College, and therefore has no frame of reference as to the overall quality of a program's remaining courses. The only experience at the College has been a negative one, and it is much easier to \"cut one's losses\" and move on in search of a better on-line program at another post-secondary institution.\nThe other important issue to note is that on-line courses are not a panacea for current post-secondary problems and concerns regarding program delivery. Maintaining a balance between classroom and on-line delivery is important because not everyone learns well nor enjoys learning using this delivery method exclusively. Some students still prefer the \"normal\" classroom format as the main setting for their studies, as it provides them with a familiar setting, a well-structured environment, direct contact with the instructor, extensive social interaction with one's peers, etc.\nIt is important to stress, however, that inactivity in terms of incorporating web technology into courses cannot be seen as an acceptable option. On-line delivery does not necessarily have to supplant traditional classroom-based programs, but instead can be used to effectively enhance them. College programs cannot continue to focus solely on the traditional classroom method of delivery and ignore the benefits which can be made possible by incorporating elements of web delivery.\n\"The pace of change has become a common topic of discussion in almost every aspect of our lives. Every day, technology changes our environment, career or world view in major ways. Change is so pervasive that it is difficult to purchase any kind of electronic tool without it becoming obsolete in a matter of months. How we manage to deal with this trend determines what type of person we are. How educators face this challenge today will decide what type of nation we will become. How colleges face this challenge today will determine their very survival. Today's leaps in technology promise to alter the way we teach, learn and interact more profoundly than any other influence in the past one hundred years. The colleges that do not alter their structures to meet new societal needs, those that do not face the challenges change brings head-on, will find their influence in the community diminish in the years to come.\" [Gross, 1998]\nBibliography\nBrodsky, Neal Howard, Learning From Learners, Internet Style, Educom Review, Volume 33, Number 2, March/April 1998\nChickering, Arthur, and Stephen Ehrmann, Implementing the Seven Principles: Technology as Lever, American Association for Higher Education Bulletin, October 1996\nCooke, Linda, Apprenticeship: Enduring, Viable, CVA ACFP, Autumn 1999\nEhrmann, Stephen, Technology in Higher Learning: A Third Revolution (Draft), February 1999\nGross, Rich, New Connections: A Guide to Distance Education, Instructional Telecommunications Council, 1998\nSchofield, John, Back to School Online, Macleans Magazine, September 6, 1999\n"}], [{"score": 951.75507, "uuid": "0ea33a2d-3461-57ab-b855-c1e22020e016", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0400wb-86-30693", "target_hostname": "www.1stdegreepapers.com", "target_uri": "http://www.1stdegreepapers.com/essays.php?paper=Classroom&page=2", "page_rank": 1.3502957e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Classroom</em> Term Papers, Essays on <em>Classroom</em>", "snippet": "A number of theories <em>are</em> cited to explain the evolution of PC&#x27;s popularity.

Students will learn about the strategic waterways, land, and air routes, the Suez Canal, and the nature of war and peace and how the conflicts in the region have affected global peace, stability and security. The course examines the Arab-Israeli conflict, the impact of immigration and migration into the European Union, trade patterns, and cultural, ethnic, religious, and linguistic identities and how they affect regional relations.\nArcadia University Center for Education Abroad International Offerings\n(in addition to these courses, students may choose from an extensive list of pre-approved course offerings at more than seventy program sites in ten different countries that are affiliated with Center for Education Abroad: http://www.arcadia.edu/CEA)\nACCF HSET 330\nCredits: 3\nDay\nA survey of the history, culture, and art of the Etruscans. Rising out of the earliest records of humans in Italy, the Etruscans became the dominators of central Italy under the Romans nearly a millenium later. In this celebration of Etruscology, students retrace the growth and thinking of the field from antiquarian quest to today\u2019s interdisciplinary approach. Basic principles of historical, archaeological and stylistic analysis are developed. This course addresses Florence\u2019s position within a territory that offers stimulating parallels to \u201cHistory of Tuscany\u201d and the discussions of regionalism in \u201cItalian Style.\u201d As such, it offers a place to think about diverse population groups within the peninsula, and about Tuscan identity, indeed supra-regional identity, since a consideration of the Etruscans cannot omit reference to southern Italy and the wider Mediterranean. (Florence, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itFlorence)\nACCF HSTS 330\nCredits: 3\nDay\nPre-requisites: An introductory course in Western civilization; junior standing. The course examines the evolution of Tuscan (and particularly Florentine) political, cultural and social history from the rise of the communes to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (12th-16th centuries). This hugely influential cultural ferment gave us Dante, Leonardo da Vince and Machiavelli. Students make contact with the physical and textual landscape, and the secondary literature, exercising critical thinking and the rudiments of historical method. This course blends close study of the major features of Tuscan and especially Florentine history and society in the Renaissance with a deeper encounter with historical methods and problems than is provided by general survey courses about the Renaissance. Students look at primary and secondary texts, and even early published and manuscript materials, grounding the sources in the social realities of the periods in question and relating selected scholarly studies to broader theoretical frameworks. The course canalizes interest in Tuscany\u2019s history to help develop critical thinking and historical research skills. (Florence, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itFlorence)\nACCR ARAS 310\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThe course integrates an overview of ancient Roman history (especially Republican and Imperial) with intensive on-site study of the monumental remains in Rome and environs. Direct contact with the buildings, sites, infrastructure and artifacts helps to catalyze knowledge acquired from a standard history and from sources. The course offers a primer in the study of ancient Rome and representative archeological sites and monuments. The course combines explanatory lectures with site visits. It is dedicated to a thorough exploration of ancient Rome, especially in the Republican and Imperial periods. The ubiquitous remains are organized by direct study and by studying these as luminous fragments of ancient Roman life, customs, beliefs and history. It includes an overview of classical studies and archaeological methods. Here the material is more compact, with a working knowledge of ancient Rome raised from the physical traces. (Rome, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itRome)\nACCR HSRE 330\nCredits: 3\nDay\nRoman Empire surveyed through chief events, personalities, institutions. Through close analysis of the secondary literature and sources, inquiry focuses on historiography and problems: Rome\u2019s origins real and imagined; socio-political conditions for empire; definitions of imperialism; social change and diversity (status, provenance, employment, gender, family, religion); empire and culture; question of decline. The course lays out a picture of Roman life and customs, a subject of perennial appeal. Although the whole of Roman history is contemplated, the focus on the Empire gives the material shape. The individual achievements and personalities of the Twelve Caesars are examined. Students are asked to rise above biography and chronotaxis in order to frame questions and prepare evidence about problems - such as the transformation of the Principate, shifts in Roman family structure, regional differences in government. Most of the class sessions are lectures with some student presentations and discussion. Site visits and city walks to palaces, the fora and markets, stadia, and roads connect students with the socio-historical reality encountered in the readings. (Rome, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itRome)\nGREA ARMO 310\nPlanning the Myth-Creating a City: Urban Planning & Athenian Lifestyle in History of Modern Athens\nCredits: 4\nDay\nThis interdisciplinary course examines architecture and urban development in the city of Athens since the beginning of the 19th century. How has the city of Athens acquired its present character? What were the main architectural movements which influenced its urban planning? What impact has urban design and civic architecture had on Athenian lifestyles and the national aspirations of the modern Greek state? Students will be led to approach these questions through a systematic study of architecture from a variety of sources observed through the perspectives of urban studies, art, cultural history and sociology. The course is structured around lectures, specific readings and visits to different parts of the city. Assessment is based on class presentations and one research project which is based on fieldwork. (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nGREA HIAN 330\nCredits: 4\nDay\nThe course is intended to familiarize the students with the major sites, chronological periods and forms of art and architecture of prehistoric Greece. It extends from earliest prehistory into the post-Mycenaean Dark Age and presents the historical context within which Greek culture developed and flourished. Furthermore, it presents a critical approach to archaeological practice, as it makes clear that historical reconstructions do not solely depend on the archaeological or documentary evidence but also on the type of questions archaeologists and historians ask and the socio-political environment in which these questions are formed. As the course proceeds, it is intended to help students: 1) acquire broad knowledge of the basics of art and archaeology in Prehistoric Aegean; 2) place developments in Greece in their broader geopolitical and cultural context; 3) move beyond static, compartmentalized understandings of culture toward ones that recognize variation, change and interconnectedness; 4) explore the relationship between archaeological practice and historical reconstructions; 5) enhance their ability to deconstruct various presentations of the Greek past and work toward a critical review of archaeological and historical processes; 6) examine the complex relationship between ancient and modern Greece, as well as various ways this relationship is conceived; and, 7) experience Greek archaeology in a direct and personal manner by visiting many archaeological sites and Museums and interacting with the socio-cultural environments that surround them. (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nGREA HIAN 331\nCredits: 4\nDay\nThis course investigates the sanctuaries of Ancient Greece, with an emphasis on the components of sanctuary space and the religious activities that occurred there. The primary focus of the class is a consideration of the intersection of sanctuary architecture and religious festivals within the sanctuaries. After an introduction to ancient Greek religion, the class turns to several case study sanctuaries in detail. Each case study investigates the primary deity or deities worshipped there, evaluates the foundation myths for the god\u2019s presence at the sanctuary, outlines the sanctuary\u2019s main festivals, and studies the facilities of the sanctuary, such as its altars, temples, stoas, and other buildings. The culmination of each case study is a field trip to that sanctuary, and will include classes in Athens, day trips to Eleusis and Epidauros, and longer trips to Delphi and Olympia. Each student will master a variety of skills during this course, through a various assignment types and classroom approaches. Learning the material of the course\u2019s subject is only the first step. Through a combination of lecture and discussion in the classroom, which is based on required readings, a plurality of perspectives will emerge. Each student will have the opportunity to evaluate readings as well as lecture material, both in oral discussion and in written response papers. Through on-site reports of particular monuments, each student takes responsibility for presenting material to the other students (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nGREA HIAN 332S\nOf Gods and the City: History, Art, and Architecture in Archaic and Classical Greece\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThis course is an intensive investigation of the history and archaeology of Archaic and Classical Greece, with an emphasis on contemporary written sources and the art and architecture for the period in question, 600-350 B.C. This class is site-based, and includes extensive visits to several archaeological sites and museums in Greece, as well as in-classroom and on-site lectures and discussions based on assigned readings. Included are visits in Athens to the Acropolis, Agora, and National Archaeological Museum, as well as longer excursions to Delphi and Olympia. Each student will master a variety of skills during this course, through different types of assignments and classroom approaches. Learning the material of the course\u2019s subject is only the first step. Through a combination of lecture and discussion, which is based on required readings from primary sources, a plurality of perspectives will emerge. Each student will have the opportunity to evaluate readings as well as lecture material, both in oral discussion and in written quizzes. Through individual on-site reports of particular monuments and historical problems, each student takes responsibility for presenting material to the other students. (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nGREA HIBY 330\nBetween Heaven and Earth: Byzantine History and Civilization\nCredits: 4\nDay\nThis course focuses on the Byzantine - or East Roman - Empire. Despite recent promising trends, the Byzantine Empire is still inadequately understood in the West. To many of us, Byzantium evokes an image of exotic medievalism - a chimerical dreamscape, remote in both space and time. A primary goal of the course therefore is to make Byzantium both more real and more accessible. Bearing in mind that the Empire endured for over 1000 years, our voyage back in time will need to be selectively navigated. To this end, the course will focus on the following themes: The Relationship between \u2018Church and State\u2019; The Cult of Images and the Iconoclastic Controversy; Conservatism and Innovation in Byzantine Culture; The Heritage of Classical Civilization; Relations between Byzantium and Western Europe; The Causes and Aftermath of the Crusades; and, The Byzantine Heritage in Modern Greece. The format of the course is devoted to both conventional lectures as well as regular weekly discussion of primary texts. (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nGREA HIBY 331S\nByzantium: Images of a Holy Empire\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThis course focuses on medieval, or Byzantine, Greece. Throughout its thousand-year history, the Byzantine Empire maintained a vital connection with the Greek classical past. Despite this, however, many scholars have been slow to recognize this connection, partly because of a persisting bias which sees all medieval periods as regressive and inherently inferior to their classical predecessors. Accordingly, one of the objectives of the course will be to pay special attention to parallels and deviations between Byzantine culture and the ancient Greek past. Are there cases of continuity? If so, what form do they take, and how can we account for them? Conversely, which factors can be cited as cases of discontinuity or rupture? Finally, and more generally, how are the different historical periods related to one another? Is it even possible to speak of a continuous history of \u2018Greece\u2019? The course consists of lectures, discussions and field trips to the main archeological sites around Greece. The format of the course includes on-site lectures and students presentations. (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nGREA HIMO 330\nRevolution, Catastrophe & Civil War: The Rise of the Modern Greek State\nCredits: 4\nDay\nThis class will explore the history of the modern Greek state from its establishment in the early 19th century to the present. Throughout the semester we will trace the factors that have contributed most significantly to the contemporary identity of the modern Greek state. The course focuses mainly on the determining role of Greek irredentism and the vicissitudes of the parliamentary system. We will also discuss continuities and discontinuities in contemporary Greece; the prevalence of the patronage system; the concept of civic responsibility; attitudes towards state authority and the background of anti-Americanism. ics include: socio-political makeup of independent Greek state; Modernisation vs. Traditionalism (Kapodistrias, Trikoupis, Venizelos); the military in Greek politics; role of foreign powers in Greek politics Part 1 - 19th century - WWII; role of foreign powers in Greek politics Part 2 - post WWII; the Constitutional Issue; the Megali Idea; the consequences of 1922 Catastrophe; and, socio-political aspects of the Civil War; and, New Democracy vs. PaSoK - change & cleanse. By providing historical context, the course aims to foster a better understanding of contemporary Greece - and hopefully explain some of its more baffling manifestations. It also intends to promote a broad acceptance of diversity: it will also encourage discussion on the formation and role of cultural identities in general. At the same time, the combination of lectures with class discussions and on-site visits, as well as the use of cultural sources and of personal observation, aims to encourage a positive and holistic approach to learning. (Athens, Greece, http://www.arcadiacenter.edu.gr/)\nUMBR AHPG 310\nCredits: 3\nDay\nPerugia is Etruscan by origin - it still preserves vestiges of this most important culture before the Roman conquest - and was one of the most powerful communes in Italy between 12th and 16th century. Through extensive on-site experience, this course intends to provide an in-depth insight into the history and art and architecture in Italy through the analysis of the monuments and artworks of the town of Perugia and provide the opportunity for students to study fundamental aspects of a typical Italian town. The course will follow the history of all the civilizations that have shaped the town of Perugia and the development of art from the Etrusco-Roman period through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance and Baroque, setting each historical and artistic event in the broader context of Italian Culture. The analysis will also be focused both on the urban and ographic features to let the students understand the evolution of the settlement over the centuries. This course intends to provide students with a careful historical-artistic overview of the many cultures that have been in this Italian region through the ages, ranging from the ancient Etruscan and Romans to the Counter-Reformation period. By the end of the course students will be able to document and analyze the crucial events that shaped the Italian civilization over time and to apply a critical approach to the ics covered in the course. (Perugia, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itUmbraInstitute)\nUMBR HSAP 382\nAmerican Foreign Policy with Europe since WWII\nCredits: 3\nDay\nStudents studying abroad often have a heightened awareness of the conduct of their own nation in the region they are temporarily living and studying. Headline news and questions about that conduct from local citizens often become ics of conversation with those of the host country. This is a one semester course on the history of American foreign policy from 1945 to the present which is designed in a way to enable that conversation and to equip students studying abroad with the information and analytical tools to do so. Focus will be on US/European relations with a special emphasis on relations between the US and Italy. Its objective is to foster an understanding of the ways in which the US has protected its interests and promoted its values in its selective engagement with the rest of the world. By exploring three paradigms of engagement over time (Realist, Nationalist and Radical) students will have a better understanding of what may lay behind the range of behavior in America\u2019s dealing with the rest of the world. (Perugia, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itUmbraInstitute)\nUMBR HSRE 330\nCredits: 3\nDay\nAncient Rome\u2019s history started already well before 753 BC, the traditional foundation date of the city of Rome, and did not s with the last emperor\u2019s abdication in 476 AD. Following generally the chronological order, the course will focus on selected ics of interest: early Rome, Roman Republic, early Empire of Augustus, High Imperial time, and the decline of the Roman Empire, including Christianity. During the course, students will be introduced to the critical interpretation of ancient texts and the main sources for Roman history, and learn some methods of archaeology, epigraphy and numismatics. A weekend field trip to the ancient city center of Rome and to ancient Rome\u2019s harbor city of Ostia Antica will allow students to have a closer insight into ancient Roman civilization. The course is intended to provide students with: basic knowledge of history; understanding of Roman civilization; understanding of methods and approaches of ancient history and of the supporting sciences; skills in examining complex systems; and, an ability to compare critically separate historical situations, including contemporaneous events. (Perugia, Italy, http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itUmbraInstitute)\nUMBR ITPS 360\nInternational Political Relations of Modern Italy\nCredits: 3\nDay\nThis course offers a survey of the evolution of Italian foreign policy from the reunification of Italy in the Nineteenth century to the recent crisis over the war in Iraq. The course will focus on the role played by Italy in the Nineteenth and Twentieth century international relations and on the main issues of its foreign policy. We will concentrate on Italy\u2019s role in the European politics between the end of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th century, and in particular on its colonial ambitions. Emphasis will be given to Italy\u2019s position in the bipolar system of the Cold War era and, in particular, on the part played by Italy in the establishment of the Atlantic Alliance and of the European Communities. The last part will focus on the post Cold War era, on the current state of Italy\u2019s relations with its neighbors, and with the United States, on the Italian approach to recent major crises - such as the break up of Yugoslavia, the wars in the Middle East and the security issues of the post 9/11 world.

The main areas of focus will be: the difficult struggle for independence and the state building process, the substantial problems the liberal state faced in trying to generate mass loyalty after unification, the rise of fascism after the First World War, and the establishment and consolidation of the fascist state after 1922. Particular attention will be paid to key issues such as the concept of nation, modern political ideologies, Church-State relationships, the North-South divide, the crucial alliance between fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, as well as the emergence of an anti-fascist Resistance Movement. http://www.arcadia.edu/cea/itUmbraInstitute\nUMBR PSIT 351\nHistory and Politics in Modern Italy: From WWII to the Present\nCredits: 3\n"}, {"score": 948.9359, "uuid": "0ce8e52e-da05-55ad-af7d-c5f0c5d436b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-29-10204", "target_hostname": "www.tesolcourse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tesolcourse.com/tesol-articles/classroom-management/", "page_rank": 1.1706207e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "TESOL Articles | <em>Classroom</em> Management", "snippet": "+ 60 and 120-Hour <em>Online</em> TESOL Certification <em>Course</em> with Tutor + 50 and 100-Hour <em>Online</em> TESOL Certification <em>Course</em> without Tutor + 50-Hour Certificate in Teaching Business English: CTBE Combine the flexibility of an <em>online</em> <em>course</em> with the teaching practice of an in-class <em>course</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Expand\nClassroom Management\nThe meaning of classroom management is the skill of organizing and managing a class whilst maintaining a friendly relaxed manner and maintaining discipline.\nI am going to begin by sharing my experiences of being on the receiving end of classroom management and stating what I found effective and what I didn't find effective.\nI think as a teacher you have to adapt to the level and age of the students you are teaching. When I was in first school I was treated very differently to when I was in high school. During middle school and high school especially, we could analyze and estimate what our limits would be with certain teachers. I found that the teachers who maintained discipline from the beginning had a lot more control over a class as opposed to a teacher who didn't. I found that if a teacher made a lesson interesting and kept me captivated it showed in my work. If a teacher was boring and did not maintain discipline I would switch off and start whispering to my friends as I new I could get away with it, this was an ineffective manner to conduct a lesson with.\nI think in high schools especially if you treat your students like adults, inspire confidence in them whilst still maintaining authority you are more likely to get good results from them.\nSome key factors of classroom management are as follows:-\nEye contact - this is an important key because if you don't look the students in the eye when speaking to them, it may show a lack of confidence in yourself hence you are more likely to have problems with discipline. On the other hand if you are glaring at the students all the time it may make them feel uncomfortable, and therefore have an effect on their work if they feel like they are being watched all the time. So as teachers we must maintain a balanced level of eye contact.\nGestures - are good for explaining methods and trying to get a point across. I think the more visual you can be the better it is for maintaining the attention of your students. It can also help with keeping a good pace to lessons.\nVoice - it is important to have variety in the voice when lecturing a class of students, it is more interesting to listen to a teacher who is choral than a teacher who speaks in monotonous form. You can adapt the manner of your voice to suit various factors, for example: ability of the students you are teaching, age of students, to gain control of a class, size of a class etc\u2026 your voice should overall stay natural and approachable.\nClassroom arrangement - is very important in the sense that when you pair students up you may feel it is better to put a weak student with a strong student. You need to be able to use your own judgment in these situations. I think it is also a good idea to keep moving students around so they can interact with different people and not just their best friends.\nOverall, I think as teachers we must be able to differentiate when to be firm and when to leave the students alone, we must be flexible and be able to mould into a role according to the activity and situation without being domineering or leaving the students uncertain.\nLaurie Pollitt\nExpand\nClassroom Management\nTeaching is truly one of the most important of all professions. Educational mentors have the opportunity to bestow knowledge and open young minds. Education and knowledge empower people to improve their surroundings, and quite literally to change the world. Frankly, all teachers have the intrinsic goal to make our earth a better place to live. TESOL teachers are in the fortuitous position to have a profound influence on humanity. English is the most important language in the world since it creates a common tongue for business, technology, research and diplomacy.\nSince most TESOLinstructors will be plying their talents in developing nations, they may be granted the opportunity to share the language of English with less developed people who may then understand technologies that provide improved medical care, clean drinking water, more effective use of tillable lands, better housing, more efficient energy use, and improved international relations. It is conceivable that a TESOL instructor might have in their class a future doctor, engineer, or leader of a country.\nEven though teaching may be fulfilling, it does require much dedication, preparation, and concentration. It may be frustrating to teach students who are not committed to learn. This is why classroom management is so important. A well run class with a caring teacher, interesting lesson plans, engaged students and few disciplinary problems will go a long way toward improving the students academically and creating a satisfying career for the teacher.\nClassroom management is implementing a strategy, which addresses the overall responsibility in promoting student development. The teacher plays the central role in establishing a proper course to follow but the strategy must also involve the school and other faculty, the students, and their parents. A teacher first needs to know what the school expects, and school guidelines for teacher behavior. The teacher will have to know the physical layout of the school, where to find the principal\u2019s office, the school nurse, the school counselor, the library, the cafeteria and restrooms. The teacher will also have to know where to locate the copy machine, overhead projector, television, cassette player and other instructional aids. Then the teacher needs to know what type of students will be in the class, for example, are the students new to each other or have they have prior classes together, and their approximate level of understanding.\nSuccessful classroom management begins with a well-prepared teacher who demonstrates self-control, and applies a consistent fair set of classroom rules. Since students cannot behave properly and misbehave at the same time, it is far easier to foster acceptable student behaviors than to correct misbehavior.\nBefore the first day of school, the teacher must have developed a long-term goal specifically targeted to this class. These long-term goals can then be broken down into daily lesson plans. Starting the first day, the professionally dressed teacher should arrive early and greet each student, and parent if present, at the door. There is never a second chance for a first impression, and an initial warm greeting will set the tone for the rest of the school session. After seating and introductions, the students should complete a questionnaire listing information about themselves. This will allow the teacher insight about the students and create topics for future lesson plans, as well as alert the teacher to any special needs children. Then follow up with a diagnostic test so the teacher can assess the student\u2019s knowledge and further tailor the long-term course of instruction.\nEveryday, before class starts, an interesting assignment relating to that days lesson should be waiting on the student\u2019s desk. A crossword puzzle, a story about a current event with questions, or an art activity for younger students, to establish the idea that learning begins as soon as the student arrives not just when the bell rings.\nIn order to encourage desired student behaviors, the teacher must establish a good rapport with the students. The teacher must smile. Smiles are contagious and brighten a room. Each student\u2019s name needs to be quickly and accurately learned. Using the student\u2019s name correctly will make them feel integrated and important. Within school guidelines, it would be valuable to send home a letter to the parents, in their native language, thanking them for the opportunity to teach their child, and welcoming them to discuss any concerns they may have. It is important to have the parent\u2019s involvement at home.\nIt is essential to establish classroom rules and procedures. This gives definition to acceptable classroom behavior. Class rules should be written and determined as a group, of course, with the teacher leading the discussion. Rules will include both academic, for example, complete all assignments on time, and social, do not talk when another is talking. All members of the class should agree to these rules, as this secures the students acceptance, and makes them feel inclusive of their own class workings. Class procedures are needed to carry out the daily routine and frequently repeated acts. Such things as pencil sharpening, restroom breaks, handling out and collecting papers, fire drills, exiting the class are routine items that need to have a common procedure to complete. Logical rules and procedures will establish consistent good behavior.\nEven after a teacher creates a warm, caring atmosphere, with interesting and challenging course work and engaged students, there still may be disciplinary issues to overcome. In order to have a class that functions effectively, behavior in the classroom needs to be managed for productive learning. Applying positive reinforcement toward appropriate behavior is far more productive than repeated negative attention toward misbehavior. Even still, misbehavior needs to be addressed immediately and consistently. A teacher cannot be too lenient and excuse or ignore misbehavior. Students look to the instructor to be in charge, they expect the offenders to be properly addressed if they are distracting the class. Discipline has many forms and degrees, and since the teacher is regarded as the leader, most times a stern look or moving closer to the offenders will stop inappropriate behavior such as talking. Teachers must remain calm and composed when addressing bad behavior. Discipline should be delivered in the least abrasive manner that will curtail the behavior and addressed in a manner that will produce positive results and not degrade or humiliate the student. If the behavior is intolerable then the principal should be notified.\nClassroom management can be summed up as a system in which a well-prepared teacher promotes positive student behavior by keeping the students interested and involved, and manages unwanted behaviors by using positive intervention, to create a suitable environment in which creative and dynamic learning can occur.\nReferences:\nLong, James D. and Williams, Robert L.

But with the help of some various materials, I think I have come up with some clear, helpful information to avoid discipline problems by using effective classroom management.\nPlan! It is always best for the teacher to over plan than to be under prepared. Plan the lessons as thoroughly as possible, with enough activities to fill in free time. In his/her planning, the teacher needs to factor in any problems that might arise from particular activities and how to deal with them. Is the activity appropriate for the size of the class, or will it be too difficult to maintain with a large class size?\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to get easier\u201d It\u2019s better to start of with strong disciplinary rules and gradually relax them, than it is to start too relaxed and later try to install some discipline! From the very first lesson, the students quickly assess the situation and classroom dynamics and work out what they can get away with.\nMake rules understandable. The teacher needs to be selective in the rules that the students are to follow, so that they are clear and easy to remember. Students should then understand what is and isn\u2019t acceptable, especially if the teacher is consistent with enforcing these rules. If one day the teacher ignores misbehaviour, but the next day becomes angered by the smallest disturbance, the students will loose respect for the teacher.\nBe fair- students of all ages have a sense of what is or isn\u2019t fair, and the teacher needs to maintain respect towards students. Treat all students equally, and in turn the students will respect the firm but fair discipline rules and not become resentful towards the teacher.\nIn the case of a disruption, try to deal with it as quickly as possible so that the class doesn\u2019t loose its momentum and become distracted. If students are talking amongst themselves, ask one of them a question to try and get them to focus on the topic at hand. In fact, if you regularly ask the students random questions, this will keep them on their toes and less likely to lapse into chit-chat with the friend sitting next to them.\nIf a pair of students continues to be disruptive, it\u2019s best to separate them- it will be more difficult for them to continue their antics at when placed at opposite sides of the classroom.\nSometimes a troublesome student is often seeking attention. The teacher should give the student the attention he/she wants by distracting them with a useful task. Ask the student to hand out papers, or write on the board, or become a group leader in an activity.\nIt is best to avoid confrontations in front of students. It is much better for the teacher to talk to the troublesome student alone so that the student is forced to talk one-on-one with the teacher, and not have the opportunity to show-off in front of class members, or be humiliated in front of fellow classmates.\nKeeping students interested by the teacher\u2019s enthusiastic nature will help to prevent boredom and misbehaviour. By maintaining eye contact with students when speaking or listening to them, the teacher is asserting that he/she expects conversation and is interested in what the student is saying. Walking around the room (if possible) is a good way to keep an eye on students, and when at the front of the classroom, the teacher should be visible by everyone.\nStart fresh everyday! Begin each lesson with a positive attitude and a friendly demeanor. Always have the highest expectations of your class, and make it clear that you expect great things from them every lesson. Constantly praise students for their good effort, give every student some attention and opportunity to be involved.\nMaterials used:\nITTT course unit material on \u2018Classroom Management\u2019 and \u2018Lesson Planning\u2019.\n' Top 10 tips for Classroom Management' by Melissa Kelly\n\u2018Classroom Management That Works: Research-based Strategies for Every Teacher\u2019\nR.J.Marzano, J.S.Marzano & D.J.Pickering.\n"}, {"score": 948.80347, "uuid": "60af319c-47aa-5886-a58f-4b0befbfdcc2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1305wb-53-11399", "target_hostname": "www.uma.maine.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.uma.maine.edu/fallminisession2012onlinecourses.html", "page_rank": 1.1717767e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "Fall 2012 <em>Online</em> <em>Courses</em>", "snippet": "<em>Online</em>, in groups, and friends, you <em>are</em> who you know.", "explanation": null, "document": "Business Administration\nBUA 101 Financial Accounting for Management Decision Making\nAn introductory course emphasizing the understanding of financial statements.

", "explanation": null, "document": "5 Tips On Choosing Online Courses\n15 days ago\nComment(s)\nE-learning short courses (Photo credit: London College of Fashion short courses)\nFor whatever reason, you may have decided to complete a course online rather than at a physical college or university.\u00a0 While this means you may not need to buy as many school supplies there are also things to watch out for. Here\u2019s some important tips:\nTip 1: Is the course provider reputable?\nOnline courses and e-learning have sprouted across the web like mushrooms. They can wildly vary from being high standard and academically excellent to being shonky rip off merchants that are only after your credit card details. So you should definitely investigate the course providers\u2019 credentials. For instance: are they affiliated to an actual college or university? Is there a physical way of contacting them on their website? And is their course accredited with the relevant education bodies in your state? Also, if they have testimonials you should certainly check them out. If possible, talk to others who have taken the course to see what their experiences were.\nTip 2: Be sure of your own self discipline\nLearning online requires a lot of concentration and self motivation. Unlike traditional learning in a classroom or a lecture hall, you won\u2019t have other students to inspire or help you. You also won\u2019t have a teacher or a professor giving you deadlines. So you need to know your own capabilities. If you tend to be someone who needs lots of guided teaching or if you prefer social type learning, then an entirely online course may not be for you.\nTip 3: Look at how interactive the course is\nA good online course will allow you to give feedback to the tutors and teachers. Ideally it should have lots of interaction with other students. This may be in the form of an online forum or else a space where students can chat or post up their work for discussion. Just like a normal course, you should expect to have tutors available if you are having difficulties. You don\u2019t want a course where you rarely hear feedback and feel isolated. So make sure this is one of the criteria you investigate.\nTip 4:\u00a0 How flexible is it?\nIn a traditional learning environment courses can be very rigid. One of the benefits of online learning is that they allow the student to cherry pick and tailor a course to his or her needs. This is not just in choosing subjects. It can also mean a mixture of theoretical and practical. Say, for instance, you\u2019re studying hospitality training in Australia. You may want a course that gives you written online assessments but also allows you to go to do practical training in a hotel for a few days. Or perhaps you want a course that lets you change the pace of your commitment. For example, going from full time to part time without any hassle. These are all important things to consider.\nTip 5: How up to date?\nAll the best courses are ones that actively seek to get the latest information and research. We live in a rapidly changing world and learning should reflect that. So you should investigate how recent their source materials are. Also see if they have been running the same course for years without updating it. A simple Google search will help you uncover this. Other areas to look at are if they are using a lot of texts that are more than ten years old and if their teaching reflects changes in news or current affairs.\nRelated Posts\n"}, {"score": 946.2604, "uuid": "e640dbd6-49b2-57fa-86fe-bed6ff086aaf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1311wb-25-28238", "target_hostname": "www.degree.net", "target_uri": "http://www.degree.net/resources/online-learning/virtual-classroom_199911302307.html", "page_rank": 1.1734745e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Virtual <em>Classroom</em>", "snippet": "There is no doubt that the virtual <em>classroom</em> is the wave of the future.", "explanation": null, "document": "by\nNovember 30, 1999\nThere is no doubt that the virtual classroom is the wave of the future. Not only does it remove the aspect of travel from the educational equation - with the possible exception of having to retrieve books from the local public library - but it also saves considerable time for both the student and the instructor. By utilizing online college degree resources and a variety of telecommunications technologies, students are now able to pursue multiple interests while having enough time and attention for each one.\nThe Power of Telecommunications in Online Education\nIn this technological age, applying computer-based knowledge as a way to enhance education is essential if students of the future are going to receive their education while working full time and living their lives. There is no doubt that telecommunications on college campuses will expand at an exponential rate, offering substantial opportunities to enhance one's educational base. In light of this growing reality, it would behoove employeres\u00a0 to gain a better understanding of the entire online degree experience.\u00a0 They would soon realize that this non traditional approach actually provides a much better opportunity for learning.\n\"New technology continues to revolutionize business, education, health care, government operations and social service delivery. Access to technology can determine whether individuals and communities can participate in and fully benefit from the promise of American society in the next century\" (Anonymous, 1997).\nTelecommunications technologies are powerful educational tools, indeed. Their mere existence within an online curriculum can bring about significant changes, even if the particular components of that technology do not have any curricular composition themselves. The concept that must be fully understood, with respect to the overall educational strategies, is the fact that these strategies can greatly inspire or modify the direction of a student's course of study. This is especially pertinent when one is discussing the merits of telecommunications technology, as \"the cumulative effect can be significant and yet still remain invisible\" (Ehrman, 1995, p. 20).\nEarning Your Online Degree\nThe millions of people who seek to earn online degrees clearly illustrate how the entire aspect of education has changed - and will continue to do so - with the inclusion of telecommunications in the virtual academic setting. It has come to the point where students no longer even have to set foot onto a campus in order to reach their educational goals.\u00a0 You can even earn your online high school diploma to get started, and continue on as high as you would like to go. Some employers consider this a positive move toward acquiring the necessary knowledge to further one's career; others look upon online education as wholly inferior to traditional educational methods.\nTechnological Advances Encourage the Convenience of Online Education\nThe convenience of such technology not only enables students to schedule school around their lives - which is just the opposite with traditional methods - but technology also allows more time for the student to digest the information.\u00a0 The student can take more classes than time typically allows when having to attend brick-and-mortar schools. No longer are they forced to abide by the instructor's schedule; rather, they now have the freedom to attend class by video conferencing or via the Internet, when they are fully prepared to pay attention and receive the lesson (Holzberg, 1997).\nWithout question, the student of today has a far greater arsenal of learning tools than the student twenty years ago. The primary benefit from these technological applications is how they remove stagnating boundaries that have always existed with higher education opportunities. It will not be long until each and every person will have access to \"multipoint technology\" (Anonymous, 1997) that will provide a full scope of educational benefits to both the student and employers alike.\nTelecommunications technologies are assisting education in a number of positive ways; not only do they \"promote career advancement [and] continued education\" (Anonymous, 1997, p. D-1), but the various components - including distance learning, video conferencing, Internet access, interactive multimedia and knowledge-based systems - have all come to play an integral role in the educational advancement of students throughout the world. As students continue to reap the multiple benefits of obtaining their degrees online, so too does the rest of the world by having access to a better trained and significantly more astute workforce.\nTop Online Colleges\n"}, {"score": 939.7818, "uuid": "457a292d-2bd3-5c6d-abf8-3a000a29bd72", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0915wb-95-13983", "target_hostname": "www.trainingmag.com", "target_uri": "http://www.trainingmag.com/article/simulation-even-better-real-thing-0", "page_rank": 1.2099242e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Simulation: Even <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> the Real Thing? | trainingmag.com", "snippet": "&quot;If you <em>are</em> able to, identify a vendor that you can build a relationship with.&quot; Training Reveals Rankings for 2011 Top 125 (38,801) Join more <em>than</em> 34,000 training professionals inside Training magazine\u2019s free <em>online</em> community at www.", "explanation": null, "document": "Simulation: Even Better Than the Real Thing?\nSimulations provide a whole new world of training opportunities\nArticle | Thu, 06/01/2006 - 01:00\nThe average age of sales associates at Secaucus, N.J.-based kids' clothier The Children's Place is early 20s, says director of training and development Leslie McCleary, so when it came time to teach them best practices in safety and loss prevention, simulation technology seemed only natural.

With computers accessible in each retail location, and the ability to stop and start the 11 vignettes as needed, employees can complete training without disrupting their work.\nSome vignettes, for instance, cover safety issues such as the proper handling of equipment, including remembering to put potentially dangerous tools back in their respective place. The exercise begins with the ringing of a phone in the middle of the screen. When the associate clicks on it, a recorded facilitator appears, informing him or her through a text-based message that there has been an accident, and the company needs the associate's help to figure out what happened.\nThe learner is instructed to read the \"case file,\" which they get to by clicking on an icon on the phone that brings up a folder containing the facts of the situation, including instructions such as to interview fellow workers on what happened or investigate the scene, looking for clues. In one vignette, for example, there has been a safety-related accident.\nThe simulation allows the associates to take a magnifying glass icon to get a close-up view of the specific elements of the accident scene, while they also can click on icons representing other employees who have information about the problem.\nUsing the \"magnifying glass,\" they see an Exacto knife left haphazardly on top of cartons on a dolly that has been left out. A ladder, in addition to a couple other pieces of equipment also has been left in the middle of the selling floor. The associate is able to jot down notes within the program after getting information from simulated peers and exploring the scene. From there, learners are given a text-based review of the company's safety standards followed by questions on what happened to cause the accident, and how the associate will prevent such accidents in the future.\nThe simulation was completely custom-designed by Root, which has created three other (non-simulation) e-learning programs for The Children's Place since 2003. The design process started in September 2005, and took four to six months to complete, which McCleary says is comparable to the other programs the vendor has created for her company. To ensure the system would appeal to learners, the company rounded up a few associates with a fondness for computer games to share likes and dislikes about such programs. Once developed, the simulation was tested with a small associate focus group.\n\"We wanted to give them an opportunity to feel like they're part of the solution,\" McCleary says of the decision to create a simulation for training, \"that we're not just feeding them what they need to know, and they're just giving it back to us.\"\nKeeping your audience in mind is, indeed, key when developing or purchasing the technology, says Clark Aldrich, co-founder of Norwalk, Conn.-based simulation provider SimuLearn. Branching stories, for example, that function like an electronic form of the old \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books, in which users are given a journey or challenge with choices they must make to determine the outcome, are helpful when working with unenthusiastic learners.\nThey'll come to forks in the road, such as deciding whether or not to do certain tasks, and will be led to a different page in the simulation depending on which option they choose. \"They're really good for reluctant learners and places with high turnover,\" Aldrich says. \"They're really, really bad for high potential or highly creative people, who resent like crazy having to make these forced decisions.\"\nWhile the engaging media of these systems, such as high-quality video, may be just the thing to lure in new bank tellers and discount chain employees, or update the skills of call center reps, they might not be fulfilling for an up-and-coming corporate executive or advertising design wunderkind used to the-sky's-the-limit thinking.\nWhat Aldrich calls \"interactive spreadsheet\" simulations, on the other hand, are more suited to high achievers. These programs feature competing individuals or teams who start out with a set amount of simulated resources, such as a specific amount of money or real estate holdings. From these starting blocks, players must tackle a challenge like growing a business or winning market share.\nThough capable of being played thoroughly online, Aldrich says the game is usually led by a facilitator who meets with players to help guide them through the process, by, for instance, discussing with them possible next moves or team dynamics. \"The output of these kinds of models tend to be graphs and charts, which are really wonky,\" he notes. \"It takes a special kind of person to get really excited about having something go up or down by three or five percent, but it's much more realistic in terms of how a CEO thinks about their own organization.\"\nYou might want to even consider whether your learners are more introverted or extroverted, says Sivasailam Thiagarajan, president and \"resident mad scientist\" of Bloomington, Ind.-based simulation and gaming workshop provider The Thiagi Group. For instance, while salespeople might enjoy simulation-based training delivered in a synchronous, competitive fashion, such as the \"interactive spreadsheet\" model Aldrich cites, accountants may prefer a simulation they can do on their own, maybe even one that allows them to compete with the computer rather than with another individual.\n\"The same simulation can be made to appeal to different types of learning styles,\" he explains. Thiagarajan says the same online role simulation game can be used on a group or individual basis. \"We can create a simulation where I, the single player, have to react, analyze, interpret and respond to whatever the others players are choosing to do,\" he points out, \"and the other players could be live players or it could be a set of pre-arranged, pre-programmed inputs inside the computer.\"\nA blended approach\nAs powerful a learning medium as simulation is, combining it with more traditional methodology will make it that much more effective. At The Children's Place, for instance, after each simulation vignette is completed, the associate will be expected to print out the exercise and review it with a \"learning partner,\" an in-store manager or peer, who will ask the associate to demonstrate in the physical world that he or she understands the concepts presented in the simulation, McCleary says.\nThey might, for instance, have to show the proper way to put away dangerous items, or the learning partner might ask the associate questions about a policy on shoplifting or safety, which the learner has been instructed to print out from the exercise.\nThe blended approach, in which simulation-based training includes physical world practice when necessary, is essential, says Vincent Thomasino, vice president of simulation and training for Somerset, N.J.-based integrated communications agency and simulation provider D2 Creative. Some skills, such as the safe way to lift heavy boxes, or how an emergency worker dressed in bulky protective gear must maneuver his fingers inside thick rubber gloves to operate a technical device, require real-world practice, Thomasino says. Strictly doing such tasks virtually may result in what Thomasino refers to as \"negative training,\" or what occurs when an employee is led to believe a skill is easier than it really is because he has only \"done it\" by pushing buttons on his computer. D2 was faced with just such a challenge when it designed a fully immersive simulation for emergency workers training to conduct rescues following a terrorist attack.\n\"When you're inside these suits with those thick rubber gloves, one of the huge challenges is understanding how to manipulate all the devices you use to do evidence collection,\" he says. \"Those were things that just did not translate to this medium very well, so instead of wasting a lot of time trying to recreate that, we ignored it completely,\" Thomasino explains, \"and we established as part of our blended curriculum not only instruction on how to use those devices, but little stations whereby they could go and practice those skills individually, and master them before they got to simulation.\" The physical requirements of what trainees would be expected to do understood, simulation, he says, could place more emphasis on skills like team building.\nVentilator manufacturer Newport Medical Instruments in Costa Mesa, Calif., had Philadelphia-based simulation provider Equipment Simulations create three interactive virtual representations of its products for customers to train on that also includes three instructional videos. But the company doesn't underestimate the need for hands-on practice, says director of clinical education Cyndy Miller.\n\"This is not a standalone training; it's a training aid,\" she stresses. \"No one is expected to use a piece of life-support equipment on a patient after only practicing with an electronic simulation.\" Trainees should spend time with a person who can serve as a live instructor, she notes, as well as study an in-depth operation manual Newport provides. The company also makes use of the simulation at live training sessions in which the traditional classroom setting is given a boost by students who follow along with the instructor using their interactive virtual ventilators.\nSome companies, like Somerset, N.J.-based outsourced pharmaceutical sales, marketing and compliance solutions provider inVentiv Commercial Services, go a step further, making the technology just one part of a physical simulation. The company uses DialogCoach, a scenario-based sales and call center rep simulation from Coopersburg, Pa.-based training software provider ASERT, to complement physically-based role-playing.\nThe training, which seeks to replicate a day in the life a pharmaceutical sales rep, physically simulates the office or hospital environment these workers make their calls in, says vice president of training and development Peter Marchesini. Mock offices are erected in a ballroom with overhead announcements prompting participants through the process, explains Bryan Horveath, executive director, professional development group. Students come into the \"meeting\" with everything they would typically bring on a call, including promotional materials and background information on the organization.\nPitches are made to live individuals, including actual physicians and other inVentiv employees such as district managers, playing the customer role. \" 'Role-play' is an overused term,\" Marchesini says. \"This is as close to 'real play' as we can get for them prior to sending them out, when they're actually dealing with live customers.\"\nThe software component of inVentiv's simulation program, Dialog Coach, is used as an ongoing training tool that reps access whenever they, or their managers, feel extra practice is necessary. It consists of a series of online, videotaped scenarios with voice-activated microphone, Horveath says. A simulated talking, moving physician in the upper right hand corner of the screen appears, which the rep must have a sales conversation with using their headset microphone. Reps are given immediate feedback on how they're doing. \"If you say the right words, you're able to move on in the call,\" Marchesini says. \"If you're going totally down the wrong way, it'll end the call.\"\nSchneider National, a transportation and transportation-related services company in Green Bay, Wisc., also believes the blended approach is key when using simulations in training. While it has three varieties of truck simulators, including one full-scale model of a truck with motion capacity, live instruction is intertwined throughout.\nIn addition to the presence of an instructor beside students in the simulators, trainees spend two to three weeks on the road with a living, breathing teacher along for the ride. Simulations allow the company to train drivers for such hazards as adverse weather conditions and emergencies such as tire blowouts, but are far from a panacea, says Don Osterberg, vice president of safety and driver training.\n\"Simulation-based training is certainly effective, but it's not a replacement for instructor-led training. The over-the-road component of training with a certified instructor remains critically important, and the technology isn't going to replace that.\"\nVetting vendors\nLike any e-learning technology, all your grand simulation plans will be laid to waste without the right partner to sell you what you need. Once you're sure of who your audience is, what their learning needs are and what mix of technology and classroom-based coursework is necessary to achieve your goals, you can start the vendor selection process.\nWhen you get down to the contenders that seem worth scheduling time to speak with, start with a 10-minute conversation on the project you're considering, says Michael Bean, president of San Francisco-based simulation provider Forio Business Simulations. High points to touch on include the obvious, such as the type of learning material you need to cover and audience characteristics to the perhaps not-so-obvious such as number of learners the system will need to serve, and for how long these pupils will be using it. \"And also blue sky things, ideas you have about the simulation that you think would be neat, but you don't absolutely have to have in there,\" Bean says.\nIf you're still interested, ask the vendor to then show you demos of three projects similar to your own, with emphasis on \"similar.\" In the case of simulations that doesn't mean roughly in the same category; ideally it should mean the same type of program (i.e. multiplayer competitive strategy-oriented fare) as well as the same industry you're in. Though less crucial than making sure the vendor has familiarity with developing the kind of program you have in mind, it might make the process a little easier if they've worked with others in your field, Bean says. \"If you're building a marketing simulation, and your vendor doesn't have any marketing simulations to show you,\" he notes, \"then that is probably a red flag.\"\nAs eager salespeople flash their technologically advanced wares your way, don't get deterred from your mission, says Adam Nelson, vice president of product development for San Francisco-based simulation provider Ninth House.\n\"A big mistake is putting form before function,\" he says, adding many are drawn to the bells and whistles products have. \"It's not clearly analyzing what it is you want to get out of it and pairing the solution with it.\" To sidestep this pitfall, Nelson advises self-discipline and not to be shy about asking the vendor the questions that will keep you on track. \"The primary driver should always be, 'What effect is it [the simulation] going to have on my business and how am I going to measure that?' Ask them for past information, and compare it against what is you want to achieve,\" he says of asking vendors about their record of creating the kind of simulation you want.\nThinking about the vendor's potential to serve as a long-term partner is also important. Malvern, Pa.-based business equipment and supplies provider Ikon Office Solutions, for example, has signed on with Scottsdale, Ariz.-based e-learning vendor NETg for the creation of a new scenario-based simulation program that will most likely launch by summer's end. One of the reasons the company chose to work with the vendor, say Inga Swearengin, manager of learning technologies, and Donna Venable, vice president, human resources and shared services, is the good job it did creating other e-learning courses for Ikon in the past. \"Working with an existing partner allowed us to take advantage of the knowledge we already had of each other,\" Venable says. \"If you are able to, identify a vendor that you can build a relationship with.\"\nSend story comments to edit@trainingmag.com .\nLogin or register to post comments\nMost popular articles...\n"}, {"score": 938.71674, "uuid": "7fe9ddee-85d4-5c0e-8d58-945b224f3caf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-74-20744", "target_hostname": "www.bakersguide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bakersguide.com/Articles/Articles/Asynchronous_Discussion_in_a_Traditional_Classroom/", "page_rank": 1.1748296e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Asynchronous Discussion in a Traditional <em>Classroom</em> - Christian <em>Online</em> Learning", "snippet": "Based on your experiences in this class, <em>are</em> you more comfortable participating in a discussion in the <em>classroom</em> or <em>online</em>? Did the NetForum discussion board make the class more or less enjoyable?", "explanation": null, "document": "Case Study:\nAsynchronous Discussion in a Traditional Classroom\nAs a proponent of distance education, I?ve often wondered how some of this same technology might fit into a more traditional educational setting. I had the opportunity to participate in such an endeavor ? the integration of Web-based conferencing into an undergraduate class at Loyola College in Maryland, to see whether it would enhance or detract from the learning experience. Since Loyola strives to maintain an educational tradition of cura personalis ? educating the whole person ? there has been resistance to any technology which wouldn?t fit into this philosophy. Many instructional technology concepts, such as online and distance education, have been largely rejected because they would fail to deliver a true Loyola education. However, incorporating technology into the traditional classroom is encouraged, and this is where this project fits in.\nInstructional Activity\nIn Fall 1997 Loyola?s Political Science department offered a new course entitled Religion and Politics in America. The professor and I spoke about the possibility of using an asynchronous Web-based conferencing system within the course. We discussed how the conference could be set-up, how he would receive the various administrative privileges necessary to manage the site, and the possible uses of the program. My interest was essentially to see how well an electronic communication forum fares in a traditional undergraduate classroom. More specifically, I was interested in hearing the reactions of the students. Would they feel that it adds or detracts from their learning experience? Would they learn the material better thanks to the Web conferencing? Or is this simply a technology that doesn?t readily apply to the traditional setting?\nThe mechanics of this instructional activity were quite simple. Based on discussions with the professor, he tailored some of the activities for use in an asynchronous mode. Rather than having the students write up short papers and submit them directly to him, the students will post their reports to the asynchronous conference board. Then students will read each others posts and respond accordingly. In order to facilitate interaction, there will be a few mandatory responses. Others would be at the discretion of the students. (There are a total of four mandatory postings.) Originally these same essays were simply going to be submitted to the instructor, so the use of use of an asynchronous discussion board opened up the opportunity for student to student interaction that had not previously been available. To help the students get acclimated with the software, we established areas for students to practice posting and to ask questions of the instructor. We also monitored the conference regularly to ensure that there weren?t any problems.\nAsynchronous Discussion Software\nWe used the NetForum software developed by the University of Wisconsin Biomedical Computing Group. NetForum is a Web-based asynchronous conferencing package which behaves like a computerized bulletin board. Participants post and read messages, which are arranged by topic and time of posting, and can respond as desired. Like physical bulletin boards, the students are free to post messages at any time and all messages remain posted until someone clears the board off. Since NetForum is Web-based, and runs as a server-side CGI script, it can be accessed from any computer on or off campus which has Internet World Wide Web access.\nOne of the strengths of NetForum is its simplicity. When a user approaches a NetForum discussion forum, they have the opportunity to start new discussion threads (if that privilege has been granted to them), add new messages to existing threads, or reply to messages already posted. Since messages can contain HTML tags, they can include formatting such as bold, italic, or bullet lists or they can embed hypertext links to other Web pages. For users who aren?t fluent in HTML, they can request NetForum to automatically translate their text into HTML format. Discussion threads are displayed in an easy-to-read manner and users can expand or compress message listings as desired. NetForum does lacks some of the advanced features found in other conferencing packages. For instance, NetForum does not have a spelling checker built into it. Furthermore posted messages cannot have attachments, such as Excel spreadsheets or PowerPoint slides. Search capability is another feature lacking from NetForum. It would be helpful if one could search through the various posting and find messages by keyword or phrase.\nStudent Audience\nThe student audience was a standard undergraduate class that consists of 27 people, none of whom are freshman. All of the students are political science majors and have thus taken previous courses in their major. Since this is an elective course, it could not necessarily be considered representative of all political science majors, but rather those who are interested in the intersection of religion and politics (or who simply need an elective course in order to graduate). However, there was nothing particularly unusual about this group of students, so informally they could be considered typical undergraduates.\nTeaching Strategy\nThe basic strategy is simple: create the NetForum and require students to use it. On a more philosophical level, the NetForum software was used to supplement and improve the classroom interaction. Traditionally, this class would contain a high level of teacher-student interaction through the class lectures. However, there would be significantly less student-student interaction except as permitted when the lecture ended early. By introducing NetForum, and requiring students to post and respond to various essays, the level of student-student interaction could be increased. Previously, since the essays would have been submitted directly to the instructor, the assignments would have simply resulted in additional teacher-student interaction. But with this new approach, even though it?s asynchronous, the opportunities for student-student interaction are increased. Ideally, the increased student-student interaction would increase comprehension and even enjoyment of the material in this class.\nExpectations and Evaluation\nTo be honest, I wasn?t exactly sure what outcomes to expect. I suspected that many students, especially the introverts, will find the NetForum conference a valuable way to increase interaction and improve their classroom experience. However, I wasn?t sure how students will react to this new technology being thrust into their traditional classroom experience. Perhaps, since it appears that undergraduates generally like the Internet, they would be excited about the \"high-techness\" of the course. When the course was complete, I had the students fill out a brief ten question evaluation of their asynchronous learning experience. Using a combination of multiple choice, Likert-style, and freeform questions I hoped to get a good feel for their learning experience.\nResults: Evaluation Data\nThe overall feeling of the students, based on the evaluations and comments back to the professor, was that the NetForum experience was positive and they felt that it contributed to the learning environment. In order to get more specific feedback from the students, I wrote a brief survey instrument for them to fill out during the last class period. I used a combination of multiple choice, Likert-style, and free-form questions. I attempted to acquire both demographic and result information in hopes of drawing some correlation between the type of student and their response to the Web conferencing software. The survey questions, along with the results (in percentages), are shown below:\nWere you comfortable using the World Wide Web before taking PS 321?\nYes: 81.5%\nDid you find the NetForum conferencing software difficult to use?\nYes: 0.0%\nTwo write in answers: \"Somewhat\" and \"At First\"\nApproximately how many messages did you post to the NetForum conference?\nThis was a write-in question.

But the company doesn't underestimate the need for hands-on practice, says director of clinical education Cyndy Miller.\n\"This is not a standalone training; it's a training aid,\" she stresses. \"No one is expected to use a piece of life-support equipment on a patient after only practicing with an electronic simulation.\" Trainees should spend time with a person who can serve as a live instructor, she notes, as well as study an in-depth operation manual Newport provides. The company also makes use of the simulation at live training sessions in which the traditional classroom setting is given a boost by students who follow along with the instructor using their interactive virtual ventilators.\nSome companies, like Somerset, N.J.-based outsourced pharmaceutical sales, marketing and compliance solutions provider inVentiv Commercial Services, go a step further, making the technology just one part of a physical simulation. The company uses DialogCoach, a scenario-based sales and call center rep simulation from Coopersburg, Pa.-based training software provider ASERT, to complement physically-based role-playing.\nThe training, which seeks to replicate a day in the life a pharmaceutical sales rep, physically simulates the office or hospital environment these workers make their calls in, says vice president of training and development Peter Marchesini. Mock offices are erected in a ballroom with overhead announcements prompting participants through the process, explains Bryan Horveath, executive director, professional development group. Students come into the \"meeting\" with everything they would typically bring on a call, including promotional materials and background information on the organization.\nPitches are made to live individuals, including actual physicians and other inVentiv employees such as district managers, playing the customer role. \" 'Role-play' is an overused term,\" Marchesini says. \"This is as close to 'real play' as we can get for them prior to sending them out, when they're actually dealing with live customers.\"\nThe software component of inVentiv's simulation program, Dialog Coach, is used as an ongoing training tool that reps access whenever they, or their managers, feel extra practice is necessary. It consists of a series of online, videotaped scenarios with voice-activated microphone, Horveath says. A simulated talking, moving physician in the upper right hand corner of the screen appears, which the rep must have a sales conversation with using their headset microphone. Reps are given immediate feedback on how they're doing. \"If you say the right words, you're able to move on in the call,\" Marchesini says. \"If you're going totally down the wrong way, it'll end the call.\"\nSchneider National, a transportation and transportation-related services company in Green Bay, Wisc., also believes the blended approach is key when using simulations in training. While it has three varieties of truck simulators, including one full-scale model of a truck with motion capacity, live instruction is intertwined throughout.\nIn addition to the presence of an instructor beside students in the simulators, trainees spend two to three weeks on the road with a living, breathing teacher along for the ride. Simulations allow the company to train drivers for such hazards as adverse weather conditions and emergencies such as tire blowouts, but are far from a panacea, says Don Osterberg, vice president of safety and driver training.\n\"Simulation-based training is certainly effective, but it's not a replacement for instructor-led training. The over-the-road component of training with a certified instructor remains critically important, and the technology isn't going to replace that.\"\nVetting vendors\nLike any e-learning technology, all your grand simulation plans will be laid to waste without the right partner to sell you what you need. Once you're sure of who your audience is, what their learning needs are and what mix of technology and classroom-based coursework is necessary to achieve your goals, you can start the vendor selection process.\nWhen you get down to the contenders that seem worth scheduling time to speak with, start with a 10-minute conversation on the project you're considering, says Michael Bean, president of San Francisco-based simulation provider Forio Business Simulations. High points to touch on include the obvious, such as the type of learning material you need to cover and audience characteristics to the perhaps not-so-obvious such as number of learners the system will need to serve, and for how long these pupils will be using it. \"And also blue sky things, ideas you have about the simulation that you think would be neat, but you don't absolutely have to have in there,\" Bean says.\nIf you're still interested, ask the vendor to then show you demos of three projects similar to your own, with emphasis on \"similar.\" In the case of simulations that doesn't mean roughly in the same category; ideally it should mean the same type of program (i.e. multiplayer competitive strategy-oriented fare) as well as the same industry you're in. Though less crucial than making sure the vendor has familiarity with developing the kind of program you have in mind, it might make the process a little easier if they've worked with others in your field, Bean says. \"If you're building a marketing simulation, and your vendor doesn't have any marketing simulations to show you,\" he notes, \"then that is probably a red flag.\"\nAs eager salespeople flash their technologically advanced wares your way, don't get deterred from your mission, says Adam Nelson, vice president of product development for San Francisco-based simulation provider Ninth House.\n\"A big mistake is putting form before function,\" he says, adding many are drawn to the bells and whistles products have. \"It's not clearly analyzing what it is you want to get out of it and pairing the solution with it.\" To sidestep this pitfall, Nelson advises self-discipline and not to be shy about asking the vendor the questions that will keep you on track. \"The primary driver should always be, 'What effect is it [the simulation] going to have on my business and how am I going to measure that?' Ask them for past information, and compare it against what is you want to achieve,\" he says of asking vendors about their record of creating the kind of simulation you want.\nThinking about the vendor's potential to serve as a long-term partner is also important. Malvern, Pa.-based business equipment and supplies provider Ikon Office Solutions, for example, has signed on with Scottsdale, Ariz.-based e-learning vendor NETg for the creation of a new scenario-based simulation program that will most likely launch by summer's end. One of the reasons the company chose to work with the vendor, say Inga Swearengin, manager of learning technologies, and Donna Venable, vice president, human resources and shared services, is the good job it did creating other e-learning courses for Ikon in the past. \"Working with an existing partner allowed us to take advantage of the knowledge we already had of each other,\" Venable says. \"If you are able to, identify a vendor that you can build a relationship with.\"\nSend story comments to edit@trainingmag.com .\nLogin or register to post comments\nMost popular articles...\n"}, {"score": 935.21344, "uuid": "8399d16d-6ece-511f-9af4-a0d66f9df4d9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0013wb-72-13536", "target_hostname": "web.cn.edu", "target_uri": "http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/anonymous.debate.html", "page_rank": 1.1836111e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "<em>Online</em> Debate: Anonymity in Computerized <em>Classroom</em> Discussions", "snippet": "The price would be less <em>than</em> what record-companies <em>are</em> charging now, of <em>course</em>, but I suspect the flowering of illegal copies will supersede the sharing model.

Our guests include Kip Wheeler and Darren Reiley , both graduate students at the University of Oregon and teachers of Freshman composition.\nWe also have joining our discussion Dr. Kali Hassensprenger , anarcha-feminist and author of the controversial new book, Outside-In Education: Thus Assessment doth make Asses of us All. Finally we are also honored to have joining us today, the distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philology and Antiquities, Dr. E. M. W. Mustcrotchette .\n[Host]: Now as I understand it, there has been an ongoing debate in English 608 concerning matters of anonymity in electronic classrooms. How exactly would you describe your concerns?\n[Kip]: It's primarily an issue that has arisen between Darren and myself. We both want our students to excel at writing in an on-line environment, and in many classes teachers have their students use \"handles\" or alternate identities in on-line discussions. As an undergraduate myself, I was a student in such a classroom at West Texas State University, using the handle \"Matilda the Hun.\" The idea is that students who would otherwise be too shy to speak in class would feel more comfortable expressing their honest opinions in a real debate if their identity remains concealed. In my experience, both as a student and a teacher, it does seem to have that effect in the short-term, and I understand the value that might bring. Sometimes by wearing masks, we create a space where we feel more free to express ourselves.\n[Mustcrochette]: Like Prince Hal and his cloak in Henry V, I assume?\nAs I understand Darren's position, Darren thinks--\n(mutters) That long-haired neo-hippy.\nI'm sorry, what was that?\n(coughs) Just clearing my throat. Do go on.\nPrecisely.\nMy worry is that, rather than encouraging students to speak for themselves, in the long run we may create the opposite effect. Students may become so used to expressing themselves behind a protective, electronic disguise, that they ultimately feel even more uncomfortable when it comes time to taking a public stand on issues they feel strongly about by joining group debate, or publishing writing, or participating in other forms of discourse. We need to instill in them a habit of attaching their own names to their own thinking. The best way to ensure that people are responsible and honest in their research and publication is to ensure that the writing is linked to a specific name, on whom readers and listeners can appropriately heap credit or blame. That may seem a bit Foucauldian, but it's valuable.\n[Jeerer in the crowd]: 'E called him a right long-'aired 'ippy, 'e did. I 'eard it with me own two ears.\nMy dear sir, you must be mistaken. Do go on, Mr. Wheeler.\nAnd if you've got something to say, Il Duce, either say it to the group or keep it zipped!\nI'm sorry, I've lost my train of thought with these disruptive personas. Maybe I should let Darren speak for himself here. Darren?\n[Darren]: I've got two points to make here Kip, the first of which concerns this issue of students, or writers in general, being held responsible for their work. The second deals with the notion of assessment--and perhaps Dr. Hassesnsprenger would like to respond to that herself--but since Kip and I first crossed foils with the former issue, I'll start there. Partially I agree with you, Kip, at least about the danger of students becoming reliant on electronic masks, as you put it, and then becoming increasingly reluctant to speak out in person. Because of this danger, I would never rely solely on such an approach. Using anonymous or pseudonymous standpoints from which to voice opinions is a tool for empowering students to speak when they might not otherwise, for allowing students the opportunity to try out some of their more fringe ideas without fearing the feeling like they\u0092ll be pounced on for them.\u00a0This is a case in which I think it can be productive to remove the accountability.\u00a0If students have a persona through which they can try out problematic positions, the discourse community (of which the facilitator is an important part) will then offer its responses to that idea and hopefully point out the problems with it.\u00a0 The student will then have been able to see the problems with the argument, without feeling shamed to have said something \u0093stupid.\u0094\u00a0Without that shield, many student think these problematic positions but never voice them out of fear, and therefore never have the opportunity to work them out.\n[Hassensprenger]: I would take that one step further, and challenge this neo-Fascist and extremely phallo-centric ideology that wants to own everything, and that has resulted in a brand of identity politics that insists on identifying Self by distinguishing from Other. This is the basis of a patriarchal system that we're talking about here-- a system that feels that it must maintain an established hierarchy of Grader and Graded, and that is predicated on a Capitalist and elitist need to reward the \"good workers\" [making derisive quotes in the air with her fingers] rather than encouraging people to feel an intrinsic investment in the work they produce.\n[Host]: Well then, what about student collaborative projects? I believe Darren has expressed some interest in such projects?\n[Darren]: I truly believe that this whole insistence on tying an idea to a particular individual is not only conceptually problematic, in a Foucauldian sense, but completely neglects the natural checks that members of a community place upon each other. If students work collaboratively, they will, if properly encouraged, parcel out duties, hold each other to the work and hopefully maintain a dialogue that in effect keeps each individual member responsible for what he or she contributes. If one person is slacking, then the group has the option of expelling that member from the group. In fact, I would contend that collaborative work actually encourages a greater sense of responsibility rather than a lesser: I know for myself that I work harder when a group is depending upon me than if it is only myself that will be called to task.\nIt is true that I may not be giving sufficient credit to the discourse community's ability to check individual members. Richard MacKinnon , who wrote about an act of virtual rape on LambdaMOO, noted that the group collectively came up with a virtual punishment for a deviant member, but questioned whether such self-policing is sufficient or \"mattered\" when only a persona is punished, not the person responsible.\nI think Susan Romano's article dealt particularly well with this issue also.\u00a0 She maintained that giving students the opportunity to challenge their notions of identity can provide a very liberating experience for students and instructors alike. But she also emphasizes the need for what she calls \"rhetorical authority\" which amounts to the kind of monitoring that Kip and I both appear to favor. Though her critique is more focused on the ways in which women's voices become overpowered and suppressed by male privilege even in such pseudonymous virtual settings, I think her argument fits into this context as well. But Kip, you were referring to issues of student self-assessment, right?\nYou're too damn soft Reiley! This fascist is only barely veiling his misogyny. The whole basis for a grading system goes right back to Adam being granted the privilege of naming everything in the world. It is a topdown system of ordering that is held in place to separate drones from soldiers, and workers from worked-for. It is obvious that the Academy's sad dependence on \"evaluating\" students [derisive finger-quotes] is nothing more than a vestige of this androcentric and Christyrannical mythos, and one that has become far more harmful than productive. Its most apparent result is that students are only interested in receiving good grades rather than feeling inherently driven to create good work. They're only secondarily interested in learning new skills or discovering the true process of inquiry; their primary concern is figuring out how to do as little as possible to get a B or-- even more rare-- an A. So I ask you WHY?! Why this insistence on evaluating everything. Why can't the students hold themselves responsible for what they produce, and why can't the teacher's job be to facilitate, not to assess?\nThis is the part of Kali's book that I agree with the most. In my experience, students have developed this Outside-In mentality towards their work. Removing the emphasis on individual performance and extrinsic rewards of that performance can only encourage students to seek a more lasting, intrinsic meaning to their work.\nBut Miss Hassensprenger, why create an artificial division between facilitating learning and assessing it? Assessing learning is a means of facilitating learning, if done appropriately. And how can we be sure that the actual facilitation of learning is going on in the anonymity of the collaborative project? If one student is failing to learn and needs constructive criticism, how will the teacher identify that student and provide the feedback the pupil needs, even desires? He will be lost in the anonymity of a collaborative project.\nI'm not sure all students share your ethical concern for being responsible to their peers. Even if the majority share that sense of responsibility, it only takes one bad apple who fails to contribute to a project to lessen its quality, and thus ruin or diminish the learning experience of all the other students who were relying upon him or her for a share of the work. I've never had a student suggest for himself or herself an average or below-average grade, even when the work was substandard by my judgment. When students evaluate other students on the project, nine times out of ten, they agree that so-and-so did a marvelous or a horrible job. But about one time out of ten, I would receive conflicting evaluations: one student would write \"so-and-so really helped the group with x,\" but another student would write, \"so-and-so missed all our group meetings and didn't contribute anything until the night before the project was due.\" Is it appropriate to trust the first student? The second student? To split the difference and mark the grade as \"C\"? I would fear that (in my own case) the desire to let students assess themselves and each other in an anonymous, collaborative project would be casting aside my responsibilities as a teacher by foisting them on unsuspecting freshman.\nYou said something at the beginning of that last bit there that struck me, Kip: that a \"bad apple\" not contributing as much to the group somehow diminishes the learning experience for the rest of the group.\u00a0 How?\u00a0 Seems to me that such an experience enhances the learning value.\u00a0 It may lessen the final product, but it's the process that's important in group activities anyway-- at least for me.\u00a0 And that seems to get to the heart of the issue in general. A process-oriented pedagogy stresses the road, not the destination.\u00a0 It emphasizes the importance of learning techniques, not figuring out ways to please an authority figure to get a good grade.\u00a0 And since the best thing we can teach our students is how to learn and critique themselves, I find it important to encourage my students to evaluate themselves based on standards that we determine as a group.\u00a0 But, (I see your brow furrowing, Kip) I realize that often we are bound to assign grades authoritatively to our students, as is the case for Composition Instructors at the U of O, when they can't seem to do it responsibly themselves, but I would argue that those cases are rare .\nWhen I have assigned collaborative projects-- with which I've had a great deal of success, I would add-- I make my students turn in a written evaluation of both their own contributions to the projects, and of the contributions of each other member. That keeps it fair\nI would like to know what your secret is, Darren. The few times I've tried collaborative projects, I've also had students turn in written evaluations of their own work and that of their partners. (I must admit I've only tried the process two or three times, then gave it up in disgust; if you've been doing it for awhile, you may have developed some helpful tricks to make it work).\nAs teachers, I know we feel a certain responsibility to make sure that students receive as accurate an evaluation of their work as possible--\nSpeak for yourself Adam! You're so top-heavy I feel like I'm leaning!\nI know that grading carries with it a certain ideological bias. To a degree, it is subjective in nature, I will grant you. I'm not sure that doing away with evaluating the individual and instead evaluating a collective group of students solves that problem. In my past experience, collaborative projects have always been nightmares, both for my students and for me as a grader. It's another form of anonymity because I am often unable to assess fairly who contributed what in the larger project. If an online project includes an extraordinary annotated bibliography, which student did that part? Or did each student contribute one or two articles? Who is responsible for that outstanding collection of slides during the class presentation? That person deserves special commendation. However, what about the student that failed to turn in his share of the work, or the one that ignored his section of the assignment, forcing Susie to do two parts? So much of the work in collaborative assignments takes place out of class, and I cannot observe all that goes into its construction. In our 608 readings, we have an essay written collaboratively by multiple authors under a single pen-name Myka Vielstimmig . In the concluding footnotes, it was clear that the writing group responsible often shifted in its membership from one publication to the next. To me, that creates disturbing possibilities. Suppose the early members of such a collaborative project publish fantastic materials. Later, the group's composition changes. Imagine someone under the group's pen-name then publishes a work with grotesque errors in citation, or makes a claim that turns out to be patently false, and becomes the laughingstock of the academic discourse community. Will that stigma attach itself (unfairly) to those earlier members who published under the same pen-name, but had no part in the later projects? Having your name attached to something keeps you honest. Maybe it's just Foucauldian influences at work, but if our intellectual work can be linked back to us, it may keep us honest, and give us a stake in producing the best intellectual work possible.\nFrom these comments, it sounds like you place a great deal of importance on intellectual property. Is that true?\nYes.\nAnd Darren thinks it would be useful to break that paradigm?\nWell, yes, actually I do, but I'm not wholly committed to the issue. As a writer and poet myself, I have a sort of egoistic desire to be congratulated for my work , to be rewarded for my ideas, as it were. But that's really not where I see the issue that Kip just mentioned: that is, the issue of assessing a collaborative project. I think he makes a good point about the members of the group known collectively as Myka Vielstimmig--that a sloppy member could discredit the name of the whole group, but again, I would stress the importance of the discourse community and the natural checks that members of a community hold each other to. As for assessing a group....\nWhat do you make of the recent court injunction against napster , in which anonymous individuals can go online and download materials protected under copyright?\nI myself am in favor of something like the potential of Napster. Here, we have various forms of art readily available to the public in a way never possible before.\nHorse piddle, I say. You must have hippie leanings also, in spite of your minimal coiffure.\nMr. Mustcrotchette--\nThat's Professor Mustcrotchette!\nDoes nobody in this room have a sense of copyright history ? Shortly before the French Revolution in the late eighteenth-century, the French abolished copyright laws, if you will recall. Their ideals were the same as those discussed here--eliminating the idea of individual intellectual ownership so that the greater community could freely share these materials. It was disastrous! Artists, writers, and musicians often had to drastically cut back their production of literature and art, because it was no longer feasible for them to support themselves through the sale of such items. Imagine Voltaire, if you will, being forced literally to tend his garden in order to avoid starvation! Bootlegged copies of printed materials flooded the market. And fifteen years later, the Republic voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the copyright laws after the disastrous experiment. Those fools like you who lament the loss of Napster and bemoaning the fact the law won't let you commit acts of intellectual piracy at your whim. Taking another work and reproducing it without credit is theft, plain and simple.\n--Professor Mustcrotchette, I don't think the two are comparable. Copyright laws specifically are designed to prevent individuals from selling and making financial profit by reproducing another's work without permission. Yes, Napster might potentially hurt the profits of big record-companies. But it isn't stealing from them. The people using the Napster website before the court injunction weren't taking their copies and selling them on the street for a profit, they were giving them away freely to whoever wanted a copy. Yes, that might have deleterious effects on music sales, but I'm sure giving away free food would also have deleterious effects on restaurants, and that doesn't mean the act should be outlawed.\nBoy that's a great example of an upstanding model to emulate there, Robespierre, the French Revolutionaries! Ha! We all know how dedicated they were to justice and individual rights.\nIf Napster were selling the materials on its website without the permission of the artist or owner, I would agree that the act was piracy. But there is no law against sharing. It's sort of like one person buying a big television set, a DVD player, and Jurassic Park, then inviting eighty or so thousand friends to come over and watch it with him. As long he's not charging them any money, he isn't violating copyright in any way I can see. In the same way, Napster is like an individual purchasing a music CD, burning five-thousand copies, and then giving them away at the corner of the block to whoever wants a copy. There's no law against giving gifts freely, at your own expense. The original donors to Napster all had to legally purchase their first copy before they could alter it to MP3 format. Only then was it possible to place it on the net for others to share. I think its important that the original artist's name be attached to such duplicated files, so individuals do not try to take an Alanis Morisette CD, replace her name with another, and change the title.\nShouldn't we return to classroom discussion? To students?\nBut this event does relate directly to students. Academic equivalents to this newfangled Napster contraption will appear, copies of scholarly works on-line, student essays on-line.\n'Ere now, we already 'ave that, don't we now? It's called the internet, and your students will be a usin' it, and are a usin' it, mark me words, lads.\nThe intelligent thing would be to steer students away from the internet, too, before the ease of accessing materials anonymously and then stamping a name falsely on the first page contributes to the increasingly philistine nature of modern culture. These problems would be greatly lessened if we stuck with time-proven, approved means of publications like books and print.\nNo, we shouldn't try to discourage such new technology. We should instead teach our students to make use of it responsibly. If we don't do that, there are two possible outcomes I can see on a wider social level when it comes to copyright protection. Those government agencies in charge of enforcing copyright laws will undertake a sort of prohibition-style approach. Their attempts will ultimately prove either infeasible or feasible, and either way, the result will be negative.\nSuppose it turns out to be infeasible to completely stop Napster-like groups on-line, but only to nab an occasional offender. What would the result look like? The federales run a few stings to nab the Napsters, but each time they knock down a website of that sort, a Gnutella or Nutunes will pop up to take its place. We'll end up with sporadically enforced crackdowns that will result in occasional arrests, but not prevent the trend. Recording and publishing industries will sue whoever they think they can get money from, and the equivalent of virtual speak-easies will pop up on the net where people using aliases will swap the material as they will. If the music/writing/art swapping movement is forced underground, the odds increase that these sites, forced to swap files at some risk to themselves, will begin to charge users to download such stuff. The price would be less than what record-companies are charging now, of course, but I suspect the flowering of illegal copies will supersede the sharing model. The days of free-exchange, of sharing files, may be over. If users can't legally share your music files on-line in an open manner, we create a profitable niche for music bootleggers to secretly undercut prices. I think human generosity will end at the point people run the risk of fines or prison. The second possibility is even worse, I think. There may be a way to effectively and completely monitor the web for illegal copies that requires very little manpower. That is digital watermarking, a practice some museums and graphic designers are already experimenting with in their online materials. Copyright holders might mark all their files with code that functions like a combination of metatags and cookies. Every month or two, they send out the equivalent of a spider or a 'bot to search the web for copies of that file--perhaps an image of Mickey Mouse, perhaps the Nike swoosh, or an MP3 File of AC/DC's latest song, or a Stephen King novel. Each image or file contains within its coding a hidden virtual watermark. The spider or 'bot then check to see if the copy was legally obtained. If not, the program notes the computer and its unique numeric address. Checking that against registration, the legal copyright owners might then be able to send a bill to that computer's owner, or call the police, or whatnot. That's too Orwellian for my taste, too 1984-ish. But the potential is there. It is being developed. The only way to prevent commercial interests from researching and creating such products is for the internet community to police itself.\nThose writers, artists, scholars, who put a lot of work into a project--in some cases years or even decades--deserve recognition (and yes, maybe even payment) for that work. If we don't instill in our students a strong sense of intellectual property, and a sense of ethics concerning such matters, they will probably continue the cycle of copyright breach. In turn, that will encourage writers, artists, and publishers to use such Draconian, Orewellian measures to monitor computer-users.\nExactly the stance I would expect from a white male doctoral candidate (you can hide behind your green font all you want, but I can see your real color!) Intellectual property rights are there to protect the elite physical property holders, and no one else. Vandana Shiva once told me a story of a graduate student in Chemistry who worked for years with a professor to develop a technique for genetically coding a seed so that it wouldn't reproduce. A procedure invented, by the way, so that farmers would have to buy the seeds every year and become increasingly reliant upon the company that \"owns\" the seed. Anyway, if the seed itself were not sinister enough, the professor insisted on being the primary name under which they published their work-- for better credibility, he claimed. Then, when the graduate student-- who had collaborated on inventing the procedure, mind you-- tried to use the procedure for his own individual work, the professor had him arrested for copyright infringement. There's your recognition, for you. Such laws protect the rich and the privileged; they do not ensure recognition for work. Ask Nicola Tesla about that one.\nI really would like to turn this discussion back to the classroom. What dangers or benefits do you see in the adoption of multiple or imaginary personas?\nOne tendency is that the discussion might tend to wander. Each persona \"wants\" to say something, and that something may or may not be on the topic at hand.\nI see.\nThere is a cure for that though. Bart Beaudin , a Professor of Adult Education at Colorado State University, has proposed a list of techniques to prevent the discussion from wandering. It's not an insurmountable problem.\nAgain, there's also that hurly-burly about a virtual rape in LambdaMOO a few years back. One danger is that personas will get out of control, engage in antisocial or disruptive activities within an electronic environment. Richard MacKinnon at the University of Texas at Austin \"witnessed\" the verbal assault. He noted in his article on the event that \"a persona lacks accountability for its actions\" when \"utility to the user or a 'stake' is absent\" (\" Virtually Unaccountable \").\nEven here at this university, two years ago on an e-mail list, we had such an incident that even made the pages of The Emerald. In that case, it wasn't even a matter of being completely anonymous so much as being in a faceless environment that encouraged a student to make remarks that would never have been tolerated in my classroom.\nI haven't noticed that sort of disruption so much in the classes I have taught myself, but I did notice that as an undergraduate student at another university.\u00a0 In a course on creative writing, the teacher had us post short stories on the Daedalus Exchange, and then in real-time swap feedback with each other. Both the author and the evaluators used pseudonyms. At least one individual used this virtual space as an arena for obnoxious and disruptive behavior. He (or maybe she, but I suspect a he) went by the handle \"Connie Lingus\" in some sessions, or \"Phil Lasheo\" in others. The teacher deliberately set up the system preferences in the beginning of the term so that not even the instructor would ever know who was using which nickname. (The only comment the instructor made to the disruptive student was, \"Phil, your nickname sucks.\") The teacher's philosophy was that the students would police themselves. To a certain extent, we did. We cajoled and insulted Connie/Phil mercilessly whenever he stepped out of line, until eventually the user stopped using those two monikers and appeared with a different handle on the Daedalus Exchange.\nI wonder, however, if you actually did gain something productive from that experience. The class as a whole learned how to shut down a disruptive influence by their collective will, independently from an official authority figure's intervention. Surely that sort of lesson is worthwhile in and of itself?\nPerhaps so. I hadn't really thought of it that way.\nHowever, it took about half the semester for this to occur, and recidivism exploded in the last week of class. We all felt it was really the teacher's job to step in and shut down that sort of disruption, not our job. Over the course of the semester, we must have wasted hours in dealing with Connie/Phil.\nThis is an example of why I think its important for the facilitator to play an active part in these virtual discussion groups. If it had been me running the MOO, I would probably have tried to determine earlier if Phil's participation was offensive to the group, and then intervened if that were the case.\u00a0 Exactly the same as if it were any listserv dialogue.\u00a0 Besides, I think another important element to Freshman Writing courses is encouraging students to find authority in arguments and reasoning, not in some meaningless hierarchy of age or privilege conferred by the Institution.\u00a0 Something I think few graduate student/teachers really consider.\nRubbish. Absolute rubbish. It would have been much faster if the teacher could identify which student was being disruptive and stopped him during the first session. We have authority figures for a reason. Sometimes it is more ethical to silence one student's voice so that others may speak. I'm certain that members of this younger generation of teachers are all too lily-livered to admit the unpleasant fact, but truth is truth. Teachers have the responsibility to give students a timely and efficient education. In this example, out of misplaced desire to decentralize the classroom, the teacher ended up wasting several hours of how many students' time? Twenty? Thirty? All to avoid stepping on one miscreant's ego? All to give this philistine the freedom to be insulting and disruptive? Authority simply won't work unless everyone knows who the authority-figure is.\nWho is the authority-figure in a virtual environment, then? (If we need such a thing.)\nOut of all the speakers here, I think my rank and distinguished publications speak for themselves, as well as my honors from Wittenberg University. The authority-figure certainly isn't you, Mr. Wheeler. Or Mr. Reiley for that matter. The way you are dithering here assures me of that, quite clearly.\nBut in a virtual environment, I don't think it's that clear. For instance, perhaps Darren has logged on as \"Kip\" and is using my name. Or maybe I am using his. Or maybe we are alternating every other message between names. There is no necessary correlation between the name that appears in the discussion list and the writer. In a virtual environment, identities can be always appropriated by others. I could log-on with the handle of \"Anne Laskaya,\" head of the Composition Program, or as John Gage, head of the English Department. It might instill a reticence in the other writers on the discussion list to see a pronouncement from some writer labeled \"jgage.\" In effect, it would be too easy to steal auctoritas from another scholar, or set up straw-men to be knocked down.\n[jgage]: He's absolutely right, but it is still an unethical misappropriation of identity. And the students involved in an on-line debate might choose to play it safe, on the off-chance that the person pretending to be me really is me. How can we form a discourse community, or trace a logical argument to a conclusion unless we have a clear sense of who is in that discourse community?\nYes, How do rhetoricians adapt for an audience when we are uncertain to whom speak? How do we arrive at shared assumptions with individuals who don't really exist? How do we produce a real debate when individuals can shift personas, pretend they hold view they don't, or refuse to take responsibility for something a persona says?\nBut aren't you doing so now? Aren't we producing a debate, even if the audience, and the other writers aren't sure who is really writing what? I've also noted that we have far more speakers here than we have writers, at least according to my roll-sheet. Some of the people speaking here must have adapted personas.\nThat concerns me too\nLook here, Hosty, don't try to play like you're not a fictional character, we all know the greenguy is controlling what you say. But we all know that Derrida has shown exhaustively that all identities are socially constructed fictions anyway, so let's address the real issue of students adapting to an audience. It's not the upper echelons of the rhetorical elite we're here to discuss, now is it?\n'Ere now. Mebee credit's not the point at all, 'ere. Mebee a valid argument's a good argument no matter whare it 'riginally popped out, what? Why does anybody need credit for it at all, now? That's argumentum ad 'ominem, it is.\nMy dear sir, you must be a half-wit. Go and mate with the village idiot, and perhaps your children can achieve full status as complete morons. What would be the point in creating such fictions? If a fictional character makes a subtle or powerful argument, and everyone loves it, how will the real author ever get credit for it? When the publication is complete, who obtains the recognition, the line on the c.v., so to speak?\nBut remember Rob Howard's discussion of the Storm Front website . Recall the exercise in which he showed his class an argumentative essay from this Neo-Nazi website without revealing the source? The essay argued in favor of the formation of white student groups in high schools. The students in Rob's class all agreed with the argument, and then were horrified when Rob showed them the source. Here's a case where the origin of an idea is important, both for understanding an underlying ideological purpose in proposing the argument, and for recognizing the potential for rhetorical damage if a writer were to treat this material with the same amount of credibility we might give a different source. Suppose a student were to repeat that argument while being ignorant of the source. However, some members of his reading audience recognizes its origin. The audience might then equate the student with the Storm Front racial supremacist movement. It's not safe to disregard the source of an idea. That's an important point for students to understand, so they can avoid being manipulated by sources with commercial or political biases.\nTrue, but that student would also be held accountable for those ideas by his or her discourse community after the fact, and the repercussions for recapitulating Storm Front's arguments would very likely teach him or her to look more carefully next time. And that's exactly the point! This entire discussion has been based (I think) on an assumption that the writing class, or the collaborative or anonymous experiment, is a self-contained entity. And we\u0092ve been trying to ferret out all of the political and ideological ramifications within that entity itself--which is important I grant you. But a writing class goes far beyond the ten weeks in which it exists in time, and the most important element to such a class is not the final grade or even the concrete product students turn in at the end, but the rhetorical and critical skill they carry away with them. In the case of the Stormfront essay, Rob\u0092s students learned an invaluable lesson: NOT that intellectual property is important to hold the author responsible, or even that we have to know precisely the origin of an argument (although I would never say that's not important). The lesson is that we must learn to examine the rhetoric of a piece closely, in order to explore all of the implications of an argument in terms of what is being implied and the assumptions upon which it rests. We won\u0092t always be certain of the origin of an argument, or even who crafted it--that is the reality of the internet. But that doesn't mean we should outlaw it, or shrink from creating anonymous for a in which students have to deal with these ramifications. On the contrary, the gradual disappearance of the author is not simply an ideological stance that I\u0092m espousing--it is an inevitable result of the internet--\n--and of the increasing power of a Police State--\n...and it is therefore imperative that we teach our students to look at a text with these critical skills intact.\n[HECKLER] But, Joor just dodgink the issue again, YesNo? Le students need to see le Ouebsite to understand the racisme, eh?\nExactly. In a truly anonymous on-line environment, in which the argument or final-product appears unattached to any organization or name, the students in Rob's class would never be able to make the connection Rob revealed by placing the argument back in authorial context. Without seeing Storm-Front website, the reader would never know she was perpetuating and supporting the arguments of a Neo-Nazi group. The only reason the students would learn the lesson about knowing the source you quote is because Rob took the time to pull away the veil of anonymity and show them the organization responsible behind the essay. The students may be a bit more suspicious about quoting a source without analyzing it first, (which is definitely a good thing), but the reason they are now more suspicious is they have learned the link between argument and author.\nBah, joor just all agreeing with each other now. Pooey!\nWhat about the possibilities of play? It strikes me that creating anonymity via personas has a particular appeal in the imaginative aspect of writing. It creates a space for role-playing even as its members enjoin in intellectual debate.\n(snorts) Like children? We seek to produce intellectually mature adults here, not pander to the adolescent impulse.\nI found the Vielstimmig essay to be loads of fun, and I imagine the authors enjoyed crafting it, and yet, they are all mature adults, and what's more, they used the playfulness to achieve a particularly rhetorical, pseudo-hypertextual, effect.\nRubbish! Horse Hockey!\nYou're skating on thin ice with me, there, CrustMotchette!\nFor me, the aspect of play is the one advantage of anonymity that gives me no moral qualms. As a contributor to this collaborative on-line project, it has been tremendous fun to explore an argument by taking on various personas. I'd consider anonymity in the early stages of an on-line, classroom discussion. Maybe during the first day of debate. But after students have had their fun and games, and tried out various writing styles and authorial voices, I would want the debate eventually to move back into discourse where everyone knows who is speaking. The only disturbing part is that the personas do take on a life of their own, after a while.\nI feel the same way.\nWait a minute--you are the persona, aren't you? And I'm the author?\nPoppycock. I'm as real as you are. Only Ms. Hassensprenger is an artificial construct, as is easily discernible by her ridiculous name. I created her as a composite of the Indian Death Goddess (Kali) and--\nNobody can say I\u00a0didn't warn him. Disparage the Goddess at your own peril, Musketcrotch, your days of flaccid patriarchal privilege are over! [Grips the podium and shatters it over Mustcrotchette's back]\nNote how the Kestrel always shrieks just before it dives for the kill....\nYou want a piece of me too Frenchie LaRouche? I'll be there as soon as I'm done with Crusty! [Takes Mustcrotchette in a headlock]\nI say! Stop that!\nWho's responsible for making them stop?\nI... I'm not sure.\n[sound of sirens and jackboots on pavement]\n[voice via bullhorn]: \"This riot will desist immediately. This is the Reality Police, Verisimilitude Squad. You are under arrest for disorderly conduct in an academic environment.\"\nShow some id first. Who are you?\n\"Lieutenant Tiller. Verisimilitude Squad. You're under arrest also, Hessensprenger, for assaulting an eminent scholar. Come quietly or there will be . . . trouble.\"\n[blubbering]: Officer, it wasn't my fault at all. It was her! She's a madwoman. She doesn't even wear makeup! She--\nTell it to the judge, Mr. Fancy-Tweed-Suit-With-Arm-Patches.\n[sweetly] He prefers Doctor Fancy-Tweed-Suit, actually. I'm sure all of the students who had to drop out of school because of your elitist standards will enjoy seeing you in the joint, you pompous...[BEEP!]\nAnd so concludes our virtual conference. I wish there were time to field questions from the audience, but I'd be afraid who would appear even if we did. Please join us here next month when Doctors Brazen Brackenblood and Stacey Synecdoche will take on poet/activist Briathar Kinesi in a real-time animated presentation entitled \"Sufferin' Semaphore: The Net, The Blob, and the Emptied Signifier\" Thank you...

The days of free-exchange, of sharing files, may be over.", "explanation": null, "document": "A Collaborative Online Discussion:\nAnonymity and Authorial Responsibility in Computerized Classrooms\n[Host:] We begin our discussion today with various individuals who have been invited to this virtual panel to express their views on the question of anonymity in a computerized classroom. Our guests include Kip Wheeler and Darren Reiley , both graduate students at the University of Oregon and teachers of Freshman composition.\nWe also have joining our discussion Dr. Kali Hassensprenger , anarcha-feminist and author of the controversial new book, Outside-In Education: Thus Assessment doth make Asses of us All. Finally we are also honored to have joining us today, the distinguished Professor Emeritus of Philology and Antiquities, Dr. E. M. W. Mustcrotchette .\n[Host]: Now as I understand it, there has been an ongoing debate in English 608 concerning matters of anonymity in electronic classrooms. How exactly would you describe your concerns?\n[Kip]: It's primarily an issue that has arisen between Darren and myself. We both want our students to excel at writing in an on-line environment, and in many classes teachers have their students use \"handles\" or alternate identities in on-line discussions. As an undergraduate myself, I was a student in such a classroom at West Texas State University, using the handle \"Matilda the Hun.\" The idea is that students who would otherwise be too shy to speak in class would feel more comfortable expressing their honest opinions in a real debate if their identity remains concealed. In my experience, both as a student and a teacher, it does seem to have that effect in the short-term, and I understand the value that might bring. Sometimes by wearing masks, we create a space where we feel more free to express ourselves.\n[Mustcrochette]: Like Prince Hal and his cloak in Henry V, I assume?\nAs I understand Darren's position, Darren thinks--\n(mutters) That long-haired neo-hippy.\nI'm sorry, what was that?\n(coughs) Just clearing my throat. Do go on.\nPrecisely.\nMy worry is that, rather than encouraging students to speak for themselves, in the long run we may create the opposite effect. Students may become so used to expressing themselves behind a protective, electronic disguise, that they ultimately feel even more uncomfortable when it comes time to taking a public stand on issues they feel strongly about by joining group debate, or publishing writing, or participating in other forms of discourse. We need to instill in them a habit of attaching their own names to their own thinking. The best way to ensure that people are responsible and honest in their research and publication is to ensure that the writing is linked to a specific name, on whom readers and listeners can appropriately heap credit or blame. That may seem a bit Foucauldian, but it's valuable.\n[Jeerer in the crowd]: 'E called him a right long-'aired 'ippy, 'e did. I 'eard it with me own two ears.\nMy dear sir, you must be mistaken. Do go on, Mr. Wheeler.\nAnd if you've got something to say, Il Duce, either say it to the group or keep it zipped!\nI'm sorry, I've lost my train of thought with these disruptive personas. Maybe I should let Darren speak for himself here. Darren?\n[Darren]: I've got two points to make here Kip, the first of which concerns this issue of students, or writers in general, being held responsible for their work. The second deals with the notion of assessment--and perhaps Dr. Hassesnsprenger would like to respond to that herself--but since Kip and I first crossed foils with the former issue, I'll start there. Partially I agree with you, Kip, at least about the danger of students becoming reliant on electronic masks, as you put it, and then becoming increasingly reluctant to speak out in person. Because of this danger, I would never rely solely on such an approach. Using anonymous or pseudonymous standpoints from which to voice opinions is a tool for empowering students to speak when they might not otherwise, for allowing students the opportunity to try out some of their more fringe ideas without fearing the feeling like they\u0092ll be pounced on for them.\u00a0This is a case in which I think it can be productive to remove the accountability.\u00a0If students have a persona through which they can try out problematic positions, the discourse community (of which the facilitator is an important part) will then offer its responses to that idea and hopefully point out the problems with it.\u00a0 The student will then have been able to see the problems with the argument, without feeling shamed to have said something \u0093stupid.\u0094\u00a0Without that shield, many student think these problematic positions but never voice them out of fear, and therefore never have the opportunity to work them out.\n[Hassensprenger]: I would take that one step further, and challenge this neo-Fascist and extremely phallo-centric ideology that wants to own everything, and that has resulted in a brand of identity politics that insists on identifying Self by distinguishing from Other. This is the basis of a patriarchal system that we're talking about here-- a system that feels that it must maintain an established hierarchy of Grader and Graded, and that is predicated on a Capitalist and elitist need to reward the \"good workers\" [making derisive quotes in the air with her fingers] rather than encouraging people to feel an intrinsic investment in the work they produce.\n[Host]: Well then, what about student collaborative projects? I believe Darren has expressed some interest in such projects?\n[Darren]: I truly believe that this whole insistence on tying an idea to a particular individual is not only conceptually problematic, in a Foucauldian sense, but completely neglects the natural checks that members of a community place upon each other. If students work collaboratively, they will, if properly encouraged, parcel out duties, hold each other to the work and hopefully maintain a dialogue that in effect keeps each individual member responsible for what he or she contributes. If one person is slacking, then the group has the option of expelling that member from the group. In fact, I would contend that collaborative work actually encourages a greater sense of responsibility rather than a lesser: I know for myself that I work harder when a group is depending upon me than if it is only myself that will be called to task.\nIt is true that I may not be giving sufficient credit to the discourse community's ability to check individual members. Richard MacKinnon , who wrote about an act of virtual rape on LambdaMOO, noted that the group collectively came up with a virtual punishment for a deviant member, but questioned whether such self-policing is sufficient or \"mattered\" when only a persona is punished, not the person responsible.\nI think Susan Romano's article dealt particularly well with this issue also.\u00a0 She maintained that giving students the opportunity to challenge their notions of identity can provide a very liberating experience for students and instructors alike. But she also emphasizes the need for what she calls \"rhetorical authority\" which amounts to the kind of monitoring that Kip and I both appear to favor. Though her critique is more focused on the ways in which women's voices become overpowered and suppressed by male privilege even in such pseudonymous virtual settings, I think her argument fits into this context as well. But Kip, you were referring to issues of student self-assessment, right?\nYou're too damn soft Reiley! This fascist is only barely veiling his misogyny. The whole basis for a grading system goes right back to Adam being granted the privilege of naming everything in the world. It is a topdown system of ordering that is held in place to separate drones from soldiers, and workers from worked-for. It is obvious that the Academy's sad dependence on \"evaluating\" students [derisive finger-quotes] is nothing more than a vestige of this androcentric and Christyrannical mythos, and one that has become far more harmful than productive. Its most apparent result is that students are only interested in receiving good grades rather than feeling inherently driven to create good work. They're only secondarily interested in learning new skills or discovering the true process of inquiry; their primary concern is figuring out how to do as little as possible to get a B or-- even more rare-- an A. So I ask you WHY?! Why this insistence on evaluating everything. Why can't the students hold themselves responsible for what they produce, and why can't the teacher's job be to facilitate, not to assess?\nThis is the part of Kali's book that I agree with the most. In my experience, students have developed this Outside-In mentality towards their work. Removing the emphasis on individual performance and extrinsic rewards of that performance can only encourage students to seek a more lasting, intrinsic meaning to their work.\nBut Miss Hassensprenger, why create an artificial division between facilitating learning and assessing it? Assessing learning is a means of facilitating learning, if done appropriately. And how can we be sure that the actual facilitation of learning is going on in the anonymity of the collaborative project? If one student is failing to learn and needs constructive criticism, how will the teacher identify that student and provide the feedback the pupil needs, even desires? He will be lost in the anonymity of a collaborative project.\nI'm not sure all students share your ethical concern for being responsible to their peers. Even if the majority share that sense of responsibility, it only takes one bad apple who fails to contribute to a project to lessen its quality, and thus ruin or diminish the learning experience of all the other students who were relying upon him or her for a share of the work. I've never had a student suggest for himself or herself an average or below-average grade, even when the work was substandard by my judgment. When students evaluate other students on the project, nine times out of ten, they agree that so-and-so did a marvelous or a horrible job. But about one time out of ten, I would receive conflicting evaluations: one student would write \"so-and-so really helped the group with x,\" but another student would write, \"so-and-so missed all our group meetings and didn't contribute anything until the night before the project was due.\" Is it appropriate to trust the first student? The second student? To split the difference and mark the grade as \"C\"? I would fear that (in my own case) the desire to let students assess themselves and each other in an anonymous, collaborative project would be casting aside my responsibilities as a teacher by foisting them on unsuspecting freshman.\nYou said something at the beginning of that last bit there that struck me, Kip: that a \"bad apple\" not contributing as much to the group somehow diminishes the learning experience for the rest of the group.\u00a0 How?\u00a0 Seems to me that such an experience enhances the learning value.\u00a0 It may lessen the final product, but it's the process that's important in group activities anyway-- at least for me.\u00a0 And that seems to get to the heart of the issue in general. A process-oriented pedagogy stresses the road, not the destination.\u00a0 It emphasizes the importance of learning techniques, not figuring out ways to please an authority figure to get a good grade.\u00a0 And since the best thing we can teach our students is how to learn and critique themselves, I find it important to encourage my students to evaluate themselves based on standards that we determine as a group.\u00a0 But, (I see your brow furrowing, Kip) I realize that often we are bound to assign grades authoritatively to our students, as is the case for Composition Instructors at the U of O, when they can't seem to do it responsibly themselves, but I would argue that those cases are rare .\nWhen I have assigned collaborative projects-- with which I've had a great deal of success, I would add-- I make my students turn in a written evaluation of both their own contributions to the projects, and of the contributions of each other member. That keeps it fair\nI would like to know what your secret is, Darren. The few times I've tried collaborative projects, I've also had students turn in written evaluations of their own work and that of their partners. (I must admit I've only tried the process two or three times, then gave it up in disgust; if you've been doing it for awhile, you may have developed some helpful tricks to make it work).\nAs teachers, I know we feel a certain responsibility to make sure that students receive as accurate an evaluation of their work as possible--\nSpeak for yourself Adam! You're so top-heavy I feel like I'm leaning!\nI know that grading carries with it a certain ideological bias. To a degree, it is subjective in nature, I will grant you. I'm not sure that doing away with evaluating the individual and instead evaluating a collective group of students solves that problem. In my past experience, collaborative projects have always been nightmares, both for my students and for me as a grader. It's another form of anonymity because I am often unable to assess fairly who contributed what in the larger project. If an online project includes an extraordinary annotated bibliography, which student did that part? Or did each student contribute one or two articles? Who is responsible for that outstanding collection of slides during the class presentation? That person deserves special commendation. However, what about the student that failed to turn in his share of the work, or the one that ignored his section of the assignment, forcing Susie to do two parts? So much of the work in collaborative assignments takes place out of class, and I cannot observe all that goes into its construction. In our 608 readings, we have an essay written collaboratively by multiple authors under a single pen-name Myka Vielstimmig . In the concluding footnotes, it was clear that the writing group responsible often shifted in its membership from one publication to the next. To me, that creates disturbing possibilities. Suppose the early members of such a collaborative project publish fantastic materials. Later, the group's composition changes. Imagine someone under the group's pen-name then publishes a work with grotesque errors in citation, or makes a claim that turns out to be patently false, and becomes the laughingstock of the academic discourse community. Will that stigma attach itself (unfairly) to those earlier members who published under the same pen-name, but had no part in the later projects? Having your name attached to something keeps you honest. Maybe it's just Foucauldian influences at work, but if our intellectual work can be linked back to us, it may keep us honest, and give us a stake in producing the best intellectual work possible.\nFrom these comments, it sounds like you place a great deal of importance on intellectual property. Is that true?\nYes.\nAnd Darren thinks it would be useful to break that paradigm?\nWell, yes, actually I do, but I'm not wholly committed to the issue. As a writer and poet myself, I have a sort of egoistic desire to be congratulated for my work , to be rewarded for my ideas, as it were. But that's really not where I see the issue that Kip just mentioned: that is, the issue of assessing a collaborative project. I think he makes a good point about the members of the group known collectively as Myka Vielstimmig--that a sloppy member could discredit the name of the whole group, but again, I would stress the importance of the discourse community and the natural checks that members of a community hold each other to. As for assessing a group....\nWhat do you make of the recent court injunction against napster , in which anonymous individuals can go online and download materials protected under copyright?\nI myself am in favor of something like the potential of Napster. Here, we have various forms of art readily available to the public in a way never possible before.\nHorse piddle, I say. You must have hippie leanings also, in spite of your minimal coiffure.\nMr. Mustcrotchette--\nThat's Professor Mustcrotchette!\nDoes nobody in this room have a sense of copyright history ? Shortly before the French Revolution in the late eighteenth-century, the French abolished copyright laws, if you will recall. Their ideals were the same as those discussed here--eliminating the idea of individual intellectual ownership so that the greater community could freely share these materials. It was disastrous! Artists, writers, and musicians often had to drastically cut back their production of literature and art, because it was no longer feasible for them to support themselves through the sale of such items. Imagine Voltaire, if you will, being forced literally to tend his garden in order to avoid starvation! Bootlegged copies of printed materials flooded the market. And fifteen years later, the Republic voted overwhelmingly to reinstate the copyright laws after the disastrous experiment. Those fools like you who lament the loss of Napster and bemoaning the fact the law won't let you commit acts of intellectual piracy at your whim. Taking another work and reproducing it without credit is theft, plain and simple.\n--Professor Mustcrotchette, I don't think the two are comparable. Copyright laws specifically are designed to prevent individuals from selling and making financial profit by reproducing another's work without permission. Yes, Napster might potentially hurt the profits of big record-companies. But it isn't stealing from them. The people using the Napster website before the court injunction weren't taking their copies and selling them on the street for a profit, they were giving them away freely to whoever wanted a copy. Yes, that might have deleterious effects on music sales, but I'm sure giving away free food would also have deleterious effects on restaurants, and that doesn't mean the act should be outlawed.\nBoy that's a great example of an upstanding model to emulate there, Robespierre, the French Revolutionaries! Ha! We all know how dedicated they were to justice and individual rights.\nIf Napster were selling the materials on its website without the permission of the artist or owner, I would agree that the act was piracy. But there is no law against sharing. It's sort of like one person buying a big television set, a DVD player, and Jurassic Park, then inviting eighty or so thousand friends to come over and watch it with him. As long he's not charging them any money, he isn't violating copyright in any way I can see. In the same way, Napster is like an individual purchasing a music CD, burning five-thousand copies, and then giving them away at the corner of the block to whoever wants a copy. There's no law against giving gifts freely, at your own expense. The original donors to Napster all had to legally purchase their first copy before they could alter it to MP3 format. Only then was it possible to place it on the net for others to share. I think its important that the original artist's name be attached to such duplicated files, so individuals do not try to take an Alanis Morisette CD, replace her name with another, and change the title.\nShouldn't we return to classroom discussion? To students?\nBut this event does relate directly to students. Academic equivalents to this newfangled Napster contraption will appear, copies of scholarly works on-line, student essays on-line.\n'Ere now, we already 'ave that, don't we now? It's called the internet, and your students will be a usin' it, and are a usin' it, mark me words, lads.\nThe intelligent thing would be to steer students away from the internet, too, before the ease of accessing materials anonymously and then stamping a name falsely on the first page contributes to the increasingly philistine nature of modern culture. These problems would be greatly lessened if we stuck with time-proven, approved means of publications like books and print.\nNo, we shouldn't try to discourage such new technology. We should instead teach our students to make use of it responsibly. If we don't do that, there are two possible outcomes I can see on a wider social level when it comes to copyright protection. Those government agencies in charge of enforcing copyright laws will undertake a sort of prohibition-style approach. Their attempts will ultimately prove either infeasible or feasible, and either way, the result will be negative.\nSuppose it turns out to be infeasible to completely stop Napster-like groups on-line, but only to nab an occasional offender. What would the result look like? The federales run a few stings to nab the Napsters, but each time they knock down a website of that sort, a Gnutella or Nutunes will pop up to take its place. We'll end up with sporadically enforced crackdowns that will result in occasional arrests, but not prevent the trend. Recording and publishing industries will sue whoever they think they can get money from, and the equivalent of virtual speak-easies will pop up on the net where people using aliases will swap the material as they will. If the music/writing/art swapping movement is forced underground, the odds increase that these sites, forced to swap files at some risk to themselves, will begin to charge users to download such stuff. The price would be less than what record-companies are charging now, of course, but I suspect the flowering of illegal copies will supersede the sharing model. The days of free-exchange, of sharing files, may be over. If users can't legally share your music files on-line in an open manner, we create a profitable niche for music bootleggers to secretly undercut prices. I think human generosity will end at the point people run the risk of fines or prison. The second possibility is even worse, I think. There may be a way to effectively and completely monitor the web for illegal copies that requires very little manpower. That is digital watermarking, a practice some museums and graphic designers are already experimenting with in their online materials. Copyright holders might mark all their files with code that functions like a combination of metatags and cookies. Every month or two, they send out the equivalent of a spider or a 'bot to search the web for copies of that file--perhaps an image of Mickey Mouse, perhaps the Nike swoosh, or an MP3 File of AC/DC's latest song, or a Stephen King novel. Each image or file contains within its coding a hidden virtual watermark. The spider or 'bot then check to see if the copy was legally obtained. If not, the program notes the computer and its unique numeric address. Checking that against registration, the legal copyright owners might then be able to send a bill to that computer's owner, or call the police, or whatnot. That's too Orwellian for my taste, too 1984-ish. But the potential is there. It is being developed. The only way to prevent commercial interests from researching and creating such products is for the internet community to police itself.\nThose writers, artists, scholars, who put a lot of work into a project--in some cases years or even decades--deserve recognition (and yes, maybe even payment) for that work. If we don't instill in our students a strong sense of intellectual property, and a sense of ethics concerning such matters, they will probably continue the cycle of copyright breach. In turn, that will encourage writers, artists, and publishers to use such Draconian, Orewellian measures to monitor computer-users.\nExactly the stance I would expect from a white male doctoral candidate (you can hide behind your green font all you want, but I can see your real color!) Intellectual property rights are there to protect the elite physical property holders, and no one else. Vandana Shiva once told me a story of a graduate student in Chemistry who worked for years with a professor to develop a technique for genetically coding a seed so that it wouldn't reproduce. A procedure invented, by the way, so that farmers would have to buy the seeds every year and become increasingly reliant upon the company that \"owns\" the seed. Anyway, if the seed itself were not sinister enough, the professor insisted on being the primary name under which they published their work-- for better credibility, he claimed. Then, when the graduate student-- who had collaborated on inventing the procedure, mind you-- tried to use the procedure for his own individual work, the professor had him arrested for copyright infringement. There's your recognition, for you. Such laws protect the rich and the privileged; they do not ensure recognition for work. Ask Nicola Tesla about that one.\nI really would like to turn this discussion back to the classroom. What dangers or benefits do you see in the adoption of multiple or imaginary personas?\nOne tendency is that the discussion might tend to wander. Each persona \"wants\" to say something, and that something may or may not be on the topic at hand.\nI see.\nThere is a cure for that though. Bart Beaudin , a Professor of Adult Education at Colorado State University, has proposed a list of techniques to prevent the discussion from wandering. It's not an insurmountable problem.\nAgain, there's also that hurly-burly about a virtual rape in LambdaMOO a few years back. One danger is that personas will get out of control, engage in antisocial or disruptive activities within an electronic environment. Richard MacKinnon at the University of Texas at Austin \"witnessed\" the verbal assault. He noted in his article on the event that \"a persona lacks accountability for its actions\" when \"utility to the user or a 'stake' is absent\" (\" Virtually Unaccountable \").\nEven here at this university, two years ago on an e-mail list, we had such an incident that even made the pages of The Emerald. In that case, it wasn't even a matter of being completely anonymous so much as being in a faceless environment that encouraged a student to make remarks that would never have been tolerated in my classroom.\nI haven't noticed that sort of disruption so much in the classes I have taught myself, but I did notice that as an undergraduate student at another university.\u00a0 In a course on creative writing, the teacher had us post short stories on the Daedalus Exchange, and then in real-time swap feedback with each other. Both the author and the evaluators used pseudonyms. At least one individual used this virtual space as an arena for obnoxious and disruptive behavior. He (or maybe she, but I suspect a he) went by the handle \"Connie Lingus\" in some sessions, or \"Phil Lasheo\" in others. The teacher deliberately set up the system preferences in the beginning of the term so that not even the instructor would ever know who was using which nickname. (The only comment the instructor made to the disruptive student was, \"Phil, your nickname sucks.\") The teacher's philosophy was that the students would police themselves. To a certain extent, we did. We cajoled and insulted Connie/Phil mercilessly whenever he stepped out of line, until eventually the user stopped using those two monikers and appeared with a different handle on the Daedalus Exchange.\nI wonder, however, if you actually did gain something productive from that experience. The class as a whole learned how to shut down a disruptive influence by their collective will, independently from an official authority figure's intervention. Surely that sort of lesson is worthwhile in and of itself?\nPerhaps so. I hadn't really thought of it that way.\nHowever, it took about half the semester for this to occur, and recidivism exploded in the last week of class. We all felt it was really the teacher's job to step in and shut down that sort of disruption, not our job. Over the course of the semester, we must have wasted hours in dealing with Connie/Phil.\nThis is an example of why I think its important for the facilitator to play an active part in these virtual discussion groups. If it had been me running the MOO, I would probably have tried to determine earlier if Phil's participation was offensive to the group, and then intervened if that were the case.\u00a0 Exactly the same as if it were any listserv dialogue.\u00a0 Besides, I think another important element to Freshman Writing courses is encouraging students to find authority in arguments and reasoning, not in some meaningless hierarchy of age or privilege conferred by the Institution.\u00a0 Something I think few graduate student/teachers really consider.\nRubbish. Absolute rubbish. It would have been much faster if the teacher could identify which student was being disruptive and stopped him during the first session. We have authority figures for a reason. Sometimes it is more ethical to silence one student's voice so that others may speak. I'm certain that members of this younger generation of teachers are all too lily-livered to admit the unpleasant fact, but truth is truth. Teachers have the responsibility to give students a timely and efficient education. In this example, out of misplaced desire to decentralize the classroom, the teacher ended up wasting several hours of how many students' time? Twenty? Thirty? All to avoid stepping on one miscreant's ego? All to give this philistine the freedom to be insulting and disruptive? Authority simply won't work unless everyone knows who the authority-figure is.\nWho is the authority-figure in a virtual environment, then? (If we need such a thing.)\nOut of all the speakers here, I think my rank and distinguished publications speak for themselves, as well as my honors from Wittenberg University. The authority-figure certainly isn't you, Mr. Wheeler. Or Mr. Reiley for that matter. The way you are dithering here assures me of that, quite clearly.\nBut in a virtual environment, I don't think it's that clear. For instance, perhaps Darren has logged on as \"Kip\" and is using my name. Or maybe I am using his. Or maybe we are alternating every other message between names. There is no necessary correlation between the name that appears in the discussion list and the writer. In a virtual environment, identities can be always appropriated by others. I could log-on with the handle of \"Anne Laskaya,\" head of the Composition Program, or as John Gage, head of the English Department. It might instill a reticence in the other writers on the discussion list to see a pronouncement from some writer labeled \"jgage.\" In effect, it would be too easy to steal auctoritas from another scholar, or set up straw-men to be knocked down.\n[jgage]: He's absolutely right, but it is still an unethical misappropriation of identity. And the students involved in an on-line debate might choose to play it safe, on the off-chance that the person pretending to be me really is me. How can we form a discourse community, or trace a logical argument to a conclusion unless we have a clear sense of who is in that discourse community?\nYes, How do rhetoricians adapt for an audience when we are uncertain to whom speak? How do we arrive at shared assumptions with individuals who don't really exist? How do we produce a real debate when individuals can shift personas, pretend they hold view they don't, or refuse to take responsibility for something a persona says?\nBut aren't you doing so now? Aren't we producing a debate, even if the audience, and the other writers aren't sure who is really writing what? I've also noted that we have far more speakers here than we have writers, at least according to my roll-sheet. Some of the people speaking here must have adapted personas.\nThat concerns me too\nLook here, Hosty, don't try to play like you're not a fictional character, we all know the greenguy is controlling what you say. But we all know that Derrida has shown exhaustively that all identities are socially constructed fictions anyway, so let's address the real issue of students adapting to an audience. It's not the upper echelons of the rhetorical elite we're here to discuss, now is it?\n'Ere now. Mebee credit's not the point at all, 'ere. Mebee a valid argument's a good argument no matter whare it 'riginally popped out, what? Why does anybody need credit for it at all, now? That's argumentum ad 'ominem, it is.\nMy dear sir, you must be a half-wit. Go and mate with the village idiot, and perhaps your children can achieve full status as complete morons. What would be the point in creating such fictions? If a fictional character makes a subtle or powerful argument, and everyone loves it, how will the real author ever get credit for it? When the publication is complete, who obtains the recognition, the line on the c.v., so to speak?\nBut remember Rob Howard's discussion of the Storm Front website . Recall the exercise in which he showed his class an argumentative essay from this Neo-Nazi website without revealing the source? The essay argued in favor of the formation of white student groups in high schools. The students in Rob's class all agreed with the argument, and then were horrified when Rob showed them the source. Here's a case where the origin of an idea is important, both for understanding an underlying ideological purpose in proposing the argument, and for recognizing the potential for rhetorical damage if a writer were to treat this material with the same amount of credibility we might give a different source. Suppose a student were to repeat that argument while being ignorant of the source. However, some members of his reading audience recognizes its origin. The audience might then equate the student with the Storm Front racial supremacist movement. It's not safe to disregard the source of an idea. That's an important point for students to understand, so they can avoid being manipulated by sources with commercial or political biases.\nTrue, but that student would also be held accountable for those ideas by his or her discourse community after the fact, and the repercussions for recapitulating Storm Front's arguments would very likely teach him or her to look more carefully next time. And that's exactly the point! This entire discussion has been based (I think) on an assumption that the writing class, or the collaborative or anonymous experiment, is a self-contained entity. And we\u0092ve been trying to ferret out all of the political and ideological ramifications within that entity itself--which is important I grant you. But a writing class goes far beyond the ten weeks in which it exists in time, and the most important element to such a class is not the final grade or even the concrete product students turn in at the end, but the rhetorical and critical skill they carry away with them. In the case of the Stormfront essay, Rob\u0092s students learned an invaluable lesson: NOT that intellectual property is important to hold the author responsible, or even that we have to know precisely the origin of an argument (although I would never say that's not important). The lesson is that we must learn to examine the rhetoric of a piece closely, in order to explore all of the implications of an argument in terms of what is being implied and the assumptions upon which it rests. We won\u0092t always be certain of the origin of an argument, or even who crafted it--that is the reality of the internet. But that doesn't mean we should outlaw it, or shrink from creating anonymous for a in which students have to deal with these ramifications. On the contrary, the gradual disappearance of the author is not simply an ideological stance that I\u0092m espousing--it is an inevitable result of the internet--\n--and of the increasing power of a Police State--\n...and it is therefore imperative that we teach our students to look at a text with these critical skills intact.\n[HECKLER] But, Joor just dodgink the issue again, YesNo? Le students need to see le Ouebsite to understand the racisme, eh?\nExactly. In a truly anonymous on-line environment, in which the argument or final-product appears unattached to any organization or name, the students in Rob's class would never be able to make the connection Rob revealed by placing the argument back in authorial context. Without seeing Storm-Front website, the reader would never know she was perpetuating and supporting the arguments of a Neo-Nazi group. The only reason the students would learn the lesson about knowing the source you quote is because Rob took the time to pull away the veil of anonymity and show them the organization responsible behind the essay. The students may be a bit more suspicious about quoting a source without analyzing it first, (which is definitely a good thing), but the reason they are now more suspicious is they have learned the link between argument and author.\nBah, joor just all agreeing with each other now. Pooey!\nWhat about the possibilities of play? It strikes me that creating anonymity via personas has a particular appeal in the imaginative aspect of writing. It creates a space for role-playing even as its members enjoin in intellectual debate.\n(snorts) Like children? We seek to produce intellectually mature adults here, not pander to the adolescent impulse.\nI found the Vielstimmig essay to be loads of fun, and I imagine the authors enjoyed crafting it, and yet, they are all mature adults, and what's more, they used the playfulness to achieve a particularly rhetorical, pseudo-hypertextual, effect.\nRubbish! Horse Hockey!\nYou're skating on thin ice with me, there, CrustMotchette!\nFor me, the aspect of play is the one advantage of anonymity that gives me no moral qualms. As a contributor to this collaborative on-line project, it has been tremendous fun to explore an argument by taking on various personas. I'd consider anonymity in the early stages of an on-line, classroom discussion. Maybe during the first day of debate. But after students have had their fun and games, and tried out various writing styles and authorial voices, I would want the debate eventually to move back into discourse where everyone knows who is speaking. The only disturbing part is that the personas do take on a life of their own, after a while.\nI feel the same way.\nWait a minute--you are the persona, aren't you? And I'm the author?\nPoppycock. I'm as real as you are. Only Ms. Hassensprenger is an artificial construct, as is easily discernible by her ridiculous name. I created her as a composite of the Indian Death Goddess (Kali) and--\nNobody can say I\u00a0didn't warn him. Disparage the Goddess at your own peril, Musketcrotch, your days of flaccid patriarchal privilege are over! [Grips the podium and shatters it over Mustcrotchette's back]\nNote how the Kestrel always shrieks just before it dives for the kill....\nYou want a piece of me too Frenchie LaRouche? I'll be there as soon as I'm done with Crusty! [Takes Mustcrotchette in a headlock]\nI say! Stop that!\nWho's responsible for making them stop?\nI... I'm not sure.\n[sound of sirens and jackboots on pavement]\n[voice via bullhorn]: \"This riot will desist immediately. This is the Reality Police, Verisimilitude Squad. You are under arrest for disorderly conduct in an academic environment.\"\nShow some id first. Who are you?\n\"Lieutenant Tiller. Verisimilitude Squad. You're under arrest also, Hessensprenger, for assaulting an eminent scholar. Come quietly or there will be . . . trouble.\"\n[blubbering]: Officer, it wasn't my fault at all. It was her! She's a madwoman. She doesn't even wear makeup! She--\nTell it to the judge, Mr. Fancy-Tweed-Suit-With-Arm-Patches.\n[sweetly] He prefers Doctor Fancy-Tweed-Suit, actually. I'm sure all of the students who had to drop out of school because of your elitist standards will enjoy seeing you in the joint, you pompous...[BEEP!]\nAnd so concludes our virtual conference. I wish there were time to field questions from the audience, but I'd be afraid who would appear even if we did.

Moreover, collegiate and\r\n     graduate journalism programs have a responsibility\r\n     to equip the nation's next-generation journalists\r\n     with all the tools of the trade, which inevitably\r\n     includes online tools that have become so\r\n     pervasive in today's news rooms and at magazines.\r\n     At Northwestern University, the Medill School of\r\n     Journalism is successfully incorporating the World\r\n     Wide Web into its graduate magazine sequence.  By\r\n     weaving electronic publishing into its Magazine\r\n     Publishing Project, Medill arms graduate students\r\n     with a marketable knowledge of that curious tool\r\n     called the Internet, a necessary complement to the\r\n     fundamental skills of fine journalists.  It is a\r\n     combined knowledge that helps secure jobs in\r\n     the short term, and benefits the journalism\r\n     profession for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n     As traditional journalism continues to embrace\r\nelectronic communication, so too must journalism education.\r\nYet just as journalists struggle to define exactly how\r\nelectronic media such as the Internet can assist in the\r\nresearch, production and packaging of news and information,\r\nso to are journalism schools struggling to incorporate the\r\nInternet into traditional courses in reporting, writing and\r\nediting.  Indeed, many programs are making impressive\r\nstrides in this endeavor thanks to both available funding\r\nand a philosophical recognition by journalism faculty that,\r\nyes, online technology is changing the profession in a way\r\njournalism education cannot ignore.\r\n\r\n     At Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., the\r\nMedill School of Journalism is successfully integrating the\r\nWorld Wide Web into its teaching programs.  Admittedly,\r\nMedill's progress in this area is due in no small part to\r\nthe nature of Northwestern University's rich technological\r\nculture.  Northwestern is one of perhaps a half-dozen\r\nuniversities across the nation that has made an absolute and\r\nsustained commitment to technology on its campus.  The\r\n14,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 1,800\r\nfull-time faculty members throughout the university have\r\nextensive access to hardware and online tools, including\r\nstudent e-mail accounts which are assigned upon\r\nregistration, space on servers to create individual\r\nwebsites, and wide access to multiple LEXIS/NEXIS, Dialog\r\nand other online database services.  In these ways and more,\r\nMedill is blessed with the university's overarching\r\ncommitment and generosity when it comes to technology.  It\r\nis a blessing that extends itself to the students and,\r\nultimately, the greater journalism profession.\r\n\r\n     The application of the World Wide Web in journalism\r\neducation is perhaps most pronounced in Medill's heralded\r\ngraduate Magazine Publishing Project, the premier\r\nprofessional-training course of its kind in the nation in\r\nwhich the students produce both a prototype magazine and a\r\nbusiness plan.[1] As the capstone course in Medill's\r\nmagazine sequence, the Publishing Project goes beyond\r\ntraditional journalism classes and focuses on the publishing\r\nprocess in its entirety, including the crucial\r\ninterrelationships between the editorial, circulation and\r\nadvertising dimensions of the enterprise.  Of particular\r\nimportance to the development of both research and\r\nconceptualizing skills, the class employs the start-up\r\nmethodology, rather than have the students simply produce an\r\nadditional issue of an existing publication.\r\n\r\n     Twice a year at Medill, a class team of 18 graduate\r\nstudents have 12 weeks, or one academic quarter, to\r\nconceive, staff, design and produce an original magazine\r\nconcept, a four-color prototype issue and fully realized\r\nfive-year business plan.  The magazine itself is a\r\nprofessional student-produced editorial product, complete\r\nwith both departmental pieces and feature articles designed\r\nby students using QuarkXpress.  The end-result is a 48-page\r\nprototype, as well as a number of line extension and\r\nancillary products.  Approximately 2,500 copies of the\r\nmagazine are printed and distributed to Medill alumni,\r\nstudents, faculty and friends and to a large number of\r\nprominent editors and publishers in the magazine profession.\r\n\r\n     The business plan projections are derived from\r\n\"real-world\" testing.  These include elements such as the\r\nresults of actually performed market research (focus group\r\nreports, in-depth interviews and a 400-completion\r\nmarket-research survey), an actually mailed circulation test\r\n(typically sent to 2,000 potential subscribers), and a\r\ntelephone advertising sales campaign directed at the 250\r\nadvertising prospects that received Project media kits.[2]\r\n\r\n     In the past seventeen years, the Project has produced\r\nsome 34 consumer and trade magazines, including such titles\r\nas _Armadillo_, _Starting Again_, _Young Executive_,\r\n_Athletic Chicago_, _Promising Child_, _Image Chicago_,\r\n_Renovation Architect_, _Yesterday_, _Arts Chicago_, _City\r\nSpace_, _Rap-Up_, _Exit Chicago_, _Caregiving_, _FIT_.,\r\n_Prospects_, _Facets_, _Chicagoland Teacher_, _Side Street_,\r\n_Home Inc.  _, _1000 Journeys_, _Women's Sports Monthly_,\r\n_Inside Comedy_, _Professional Catering_, _Womens Business\r\nJournal_, _Grounded_, _Basketball Coach_, _Business Link_,\r\n_The Motorcycle Journal_ and _Today's Smart Parent_.\r\nNotably, three of the student prototypes, _Contract Health\r\nCare_, _Camp Management_ and _Raising Teens_ (a publication\r\nto assist baby boomer parents with, as the title aptly\r\nsuggests, raising children during their teenage years), were\r\nall purchased by commercial magazine companies and taken\r\ninto actual publication.\r\n\r\n     The core objective of the program is to emulate the\r\ncomplete magazine publishing experience.  It is an attempt,\r\nfrom concept to delivery, to mirror the professional\r\nrealities wherever possible.  To that end, each member of\r\nthe class assumes a traditional staff role--editor, business\r\nmanager, advertising sales associate--and contributes\r\naccordingly over the course of the Project.  In that same\r\nvein, the hardware and software the Publishing Project uses\r\nare chosen with the intent of duplicating the most widely\r\napplied industry tools.  Each year, Medill's faculty\r\nactively surveys publishing companies throughout the country\r\nto assess what applications and computer systems our\r\nstudents need to be fluent in -- or at the very least\r\nfamiliar with -- in order to enter the job market fully\r\nequipped.  In 1994, for example, we concluded that the\r\nmajority of magazine publishing companies were in the\r\nprocess of switching to Apple Power Macintosh platforms\r\nwhich, we believe, have since become the industry\r\nstandard.[3] Since so much actual magazine reporting,\r\nwriting and designing in the industry takes place in the\r\nQuarkXpress environment, the widespread preference for the\r\nMacintosh operating system (augmented with a DOS emulation\r\nprogram or a DOS card for Windows applications) is certainly\r\nunderstandable.\r\n\r\n     In response, the Magazine Publishing Project has a\r\ndedicated classroom (arranged as a magazine office) equipped\r\nwith 18 Power Macs as well as several high-end design\r\ncomputers.  Each computer has unlimited access to the World\r\nWide Web, and students require little encouragement to dive\r\nin and surf.  Similar to our hardware selection, our\r\nsoftware of choice for Web browsing software also is the\r\ncurrent publishing industry standard, Netscape 2.01.  As of\r\nthis writing, we have no plans for replacing Netscape in\r\nfavor of other options such as Microsoft's Explorer\r\nsoftware, but that, like so much in the world of technology,\r\nmay change.[4] Understandably, the Project is an intense\r\nprocess, as students try to accomplish in 12 weeks what\r\noften takes most start-up publications one or two years.\r\nStudents work eleven or more hours a day, often six days a\r\nweek over the 12-week period.  It follows that, given such a\r\nbrief time, there is every incentive to provide and use\r\nlabor-saving technology.  As a result, the Web fits into\r\nthe program out of necessity as well as on a need-to-know\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n     With each Publishing Project class, the Web proves an\r\never-more-valuable resource for both the business and\r\neditorial aspects of the Project.  In preparing the business\r\nplan, the Web provides instrumental research capabilities\r\nthat help students locate potential advertising prospects\r\n(through proprietary sites), prospective subscribers for the\r\nmagazine (via the sites of third-party list vendors) and,\r\nfor the detailed contents of the five-year business plan,\r\nthe names and numbers of providers of a variety of\r\npublishing services.\r\n\r\n     The Web's other major contribution to the Project is on\r\nthe editorial side.  In addition to their staff\r\nresponsibilities, students are required to propose, research\r\nand write a departmental piece and a feature article for the\r\nProject magazine.  The Web plays a valuable role in this\r\nrespect, and students browse websites for data and sources\r\nin all the ways today's working journalists are learning to\r\ndo.[5] Likewise, the issues students encounter when\r\nconducting Web research reflect the legal and ethical issues\r\nfacing journalism, most critically the accuracy of the\r\ninformation that resides on the Web.[6] In a way, Medill's\r\nfaculty is in a somewhat precarious position -- advising in\r\nthe uncharted territory of Web research.  Students can be\r\nover-eager in their adoption of the Web as a journalistic\r\nsource; the speed and quantity of information available with\r\na few keystrokes is indeed appealing.  The faculty finds\r\nitself curiously shading and positioning its guidance to\r\nstudents, simultaneously encouraging use of electronic\r\ntools such as the Web while reminding students to maintain\r\nthe healthy skepticism that is the backbone of fine\r\nreporting, regardless of the medium or the source.\r\n\r\n     Although each student produces two written pieces, not\r\nall of them appear in the final printed prototype version of\r\nthe Project magazine.  This dilemma -- surely all students\r\ninvolved with the Project should have an opportunity to\r\nshowcase their work -- has also been somewhat solved by the\r\nWeb.  As of Fall 1995, each magazine created by the\r\nPublishing Project has a companion, student-developed\r\nwebsite.  Today, all student work is published on the\r\nwebsite, where space limitations are less restricting than a\r\nprint product (of which more later).\r\n\r\n     When Medill originally introduced the website into the\r\nProject, it posed a prickly question that soon answered\r\nitself.  In short, the faculty was concerned with just how\r\nto teach Web publishing.  Professors debated whether to\r\noffer classes in the use of PageMill or Front Page or raw\r\nHTML, the coding language of Web-page design.  Yet it soon\r\nbecame clear that, in the case of the Publishing Project,\r\nstudents embrace the Web so willingly that they often come\r\nto the Project knowing more than faculty.  For example, many\r\nstudents voluntarily establish their own websites where they\r\npost resumes and writing samples -- a tremendous advantage\r\nduring the job search as students often tell interviewers to\r\nsimply point and click to access their credentials.  For\r\nstudents unfamiliar with the Web, they arrive at the Project\r\nbelieving they will learn it by osmosis from their\r\nclassmates, and they are usually correct.  In effect, they\r\nteach themselves, so little formal training during the\r\nProject is required, although the faculty attempts to\r\nmake it available at the students' request.\r\n\r\n     The result is a somewhat free-form, self-administered\r\nlearning environment, with many faculty tangentially\r\ninvolved but none dedicated solely to Web instruction.  At\r\ntimes, this proved to be a very effective pedagogical\r\nformat; at others, less so.  As Nina Hammerling, the student\r\nresponsible for the creation of the website for _Today's\r\nSmart Parent_, the Spring 1997 Project, recalls:\r\n\r\n        Mostly, I would have to say, we made things up\r\n     as we went along.  We taught ourselves, and\r\n     sometimes we had to make massive errors before we\r\n     learned the right way to do something.  This is,\r\n     of course, a valuable learning tool (failing\r\n     miserably and then picking yourself back up\r\n     again).  On the other hand, given how busy we were\r\n     and how everybody who worked on the site also\r\n     doubled in some other overloaded department, we\r\n     probably would have been well-served by a faculty\r\n     person of our very own who could have paved over\r\n     some of those potholes for us.[7]\r\n\r\n     Despite student enthusiasm for online work, the website\r\ncomponent of the Project is another burden for them to\r\nshoulder in the very limited time frame of the course.  It\r\nis, however, a burden most believe worth bearing.  Without\r\ndoubt, developing a website is an ideal opportunity to learn\r\nby doing, which is particularly important considering that\r\nno true industry standard for Web publishing exists.\r\nStudents are faced with the same problems all magazine\r\neditors and publishers are currently trying to solve.  What\r\ninformation should be posted online?  Complete stories just\r\nas they appeared in print?  Or longer, more in-depth\r\nversions?  Or perhaps just an abstract of the article should\r\nbe on the Web page and in that case, who is responsible for\r\nwriting the abstract?  Tough questions lacking\r\nreceived-wisdom answers, and hence best addressed in a\r\nhands-on, real-world context.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, the students do spend much effort\r\ninsuring that the online version of their Project magazine\r\nboth parallels and complements the print product.  This\r\ntakes a number of forms.  For example, prior to any actual\r\ndesign or coding work, the \"New Media\" team composes a\r\nspecific vision statement for the website which not only\r\nmirrors the vision statement previously created for the\r\nmagazine as a whole, but also outlines those areas where the\r\nonline product will be mindful of the medium's unique\r\nadvantages (e.g. the interactive possibilities of reader\r\nresponses and reader survey forms, almost unlimited archival\r\ncapacity, etc.) and disadvantages (e.g. the\r\n\"two-screen-attention-span\" problem, confusing link\r\nstructures, etc.).  Additionally, a conscious attempt is\r\nmade not to ghetto-ize the new media effort by isolating it\r\nfrom the rest of the class.  Instead, an organizational\r\ntask-force structure of multiple roles for every member of\r\nthe class makes it possible to allow some of the students\r\nwho are designing and editing the print version to be part\r\nof the Web team, thus insuring a certain degree of\r\ncontinuity between the two products.\r\n\r\n     With the cumulative experience of four Project\r\nwebsites, a number of interesting thematic issues have\r\narisen which may illuminate a few broader pedagogical\r\nconsiderations.  These include:\r\n\r\n     a) Strategic Positioning Issues:  The heart of the\r\nmatter concerns the core appropriateness of a Web version of\r\nany particular magazine.  Every magazine prototype class\r\nmust ask itself a difficult question:  Does this particular\r\nreadership's interest in this particular topic lend itself\r\nfor Web dissemination?  Where are the technological\r\nthresholds, and are they sufficiently surpassed?  In the\r\ncase of _Today's Smart Parent_, for example, the market\r\nresearch survey conducted by the students showed that two\r\nthirds of families who make up the magazine's potential\r\nreadership own computers, and that almost half of them are\r\nalready using the Internet -- from which one might\r\nreasonably conclude that a Web version of the magazine was a\r\nviable idea.  Moreover, as the managing editor of the _TSP_\r\nhome page aptly noted:  \"The website was a natural extension\r\nto our print magazine concept, because it fit in so well\r\nwith our vision statement -- parents should know how to use\r\nall the tools available to improve their children's\r\neducation and to learn themselves.\"[8]\r\n\r\n     b) Design Considerations:  The issue here does not seem\r\nto be technologically driven; that is, it is less a matter\r\nof software choices and more a matter of aesthetics.  Given\r\nthe wide range of presentation possibilities available with\r\nall Web-coding software (from stripped-down text-only to the\r\nhopelessly rococo whiz-bang), the issue of design\r\nappropriateness is of ongoing importance.  Rather than\r\nstipulate a certain design genre, however, perhaps the best\r\nguidance to be given to the students is simply to require\r\nthat sufficient time be spent by everyone concerned browsing\r\nthe Web, with particular attention focused on the websites\r\nof competitive publications.\r\n\r\n     c) Editorial Procedures:  From our experience, it is\r\nclear that the editorial processes and procedures used on a\r\nWeb version of a magazine are indistinguishable from those\r\nemployed on print products.  These include matters such as\r\ncopy-flow routines and procedures, fact-checking, assignment\r\nand supervision of both \"idea\" and \"line\" editing of\r\nmanuscripts, final copy-editing, and issues of editorial\r\nmanagement and decision-making.  Hence, the website offers\r\nan additional pedagogical opportunity for both core\r\neditorial instruction and practical application.  Indeed, it\r\nhas always been apparent that website creation is largely an\r\neditorial-driven, rather than technologically driven,\r\nventure.  In our experience, at the start of the process\r\nless technically adept students informally but effectively\r\nlearn Web production coding from those with greater\r\ntechnical expertise, and once they are sufficiently trained,\r\ntheir roles as online editorial decision-makers become\r\nparamount.  One unique c onsideration, however, that we\r\nencounter is derived from the fact that the printed 48-page\r\nprototype does not have room for all the departments and\r\nfeatures which the students propose and write.  As a result,\r\nin the interest of insuring that every student completes the\r\ncourse with at least one \"clip\" for job interviewing\r\npurposes, priority for inclusion on the Project website goes\r\nto those articles which -- for reasons of editorial balance,\r\nnot merit -- are not included in the printed prototype.\r\nHowever, with no \"space\" limitations on the website, in the\r\nend the online version of the magazines also include some\r\narticles which also appear in print.\r\n\r\n     d) Building on the Past:  When Web versions of our\r\nprinted prototypes were first contemplated two or three\r\nyears ago, it was our expectation that each successive\r\nProject would consciously build and expand on the work of\r\nits predecessors.  This has not proven to be the case.  For\r\ninstance, when asked how much she relied on the efforts of\r\nprevious Projects, the _TSP_ webmaster replied:  \"I have to\r\nsay that we did very little of this except that we looked at\r\nthe past Project sites and decided what we did not want to\r\ndo.\"[9] Upon reflection, this is not surprising.  Beyond the\r\ndictates of each Project's explicitly encouraged pride of\r\noriginal authorship, the world of Web conceptualization and\r\nproduction is evolving so quickly that it may be\r\nunreasonable to expect that online efforts completed six\r\nmonths in the past would have a reliable and persuasive\r\nrelevance to the present.\r\n\r\n     As one might imagine, Medill's students and faculty\r\nengage in endless discussions about these and related\r\nissues, and admittedly it is a challenging process.  Yet by\r\naddressing the questions inherent to online journalism,\r\nstudents often enter the work force understanding more about\r\nit than seasoned publishing professionals.  In this way, the\r\nProject once again mirrors the industry, and students are\r\nthat much more valuable to employers.  That knowledge also\r\ntranslates into higher-paying job positions --\r\nonline-related jobs typically command $3,000 to as much as\r\n$10,000 more in annual salary and afford students in-roads\r\nat publications they might not have had.\r\n\r\n     Employment opportunities cannot be overstated in a\r\ndiscussion of integrating the Internet into journalism\r\neducation.  Students come to professional education,\r\nspecifically journalism school at the graduate level, to\r\nsecure jobs.  Undeniably, online jobs in journalism are a\r\ngrowing, albeit new, market niche.  In a survey conducted by\r\nGerald M. Kosicki of Ohio State University and Lee Becker of\r\nthe University of Georgia, for the 1994-1995 academic year,\r\nless than a dozen out of approximately 2,400 journalism\r\nstudent respondents reported they had online jobs.  Yet it\r\nwas just after that graduating class that the online \"wave,\"\r\nas it were, hit the beach, and Web-related career\r\nopportunities became far more apparent in the job market\r\nonce dominated by print and broadcast.  Indeed, the\r\nKosicki-Becker survey for 1995-1996 shows a marked increase\r\nin online job interest and potential.  In this most recent\r\nsurvey, 147 respondents reported seeking online jobs, while\r\n71 actually received online job offers, typically at\r\naverage salaries $3,000 to $5,000 above the prevailing\r\nmedians.[10]\r\n\r\n     The experience at Medill is that between 10 and 20\r\npercent of our most recent graduates secured jobs in new\r\nmedia, working online for publications or in positions with\r\na serious online component.  Starting salaries for graduate\r\nstudents in new media jobs range from $30,000 to $40,000,\r\ncompared to the $25,000 to $35,000 range typical of\r\ntraditional print positions.  These figures suggest just how\r\neager publishing companies are to hire people with\r\nexperience and a facility for online work.  They are perhaps\r\nalso indicative of where the industry is going and where\r\njournalism education must follow.  It is quite possible, for\r\ninstance, that within the next five years Medill's\r\npublishing course will produce a paperless magazine.  The\r\npublication will never be delivered to the printer, but\r\nrather be an online product.\r\n\r\n     All of which seems to be leading to a decidedly\r\nunvicious circle:  Better salaries and positions leading to\r\nmore interest on the part of better students leading to\r\nbetter applicants leading to more offers at better salaries.\r\nAnd it is clearly something to which journalism education\r\nmust respond.  But beyond the vocational aspirations and\r\nprofessional hire-ability of our students, there is a\r\nlarger, perhaps more important dynamic at play here.  When\r\nasked how her online experiences provided her with \"added\r\nvalue,\" Hammerling thoughtfully responds:\r\n\r\n        I came into the Project expecting to learn the\r\n     intimate details of how a magazine is produced\r\n     from start to finish, and I did gain that\r\n     experience.  But I never expected that I would\r\n     work on the website.  As an avid Internet fan and\r\n     an avowed futurist, I always believed that the\r\n     World Wide Web represents some essential element\r\n     to the future of publishing, so when I started\r\n     working as managing editor of _TSP_, I thought it\r\n     would be a good experience, but nothing\r\n     revolutionary for me.  I was wrong:  It was both.\r\n     Not only did I garner skills that are in very high\r\n     demand, such as website design and production,\r\n     editing for online publication, some basic code,\r\n     image manipulation in Photoshop, I also learned\r\n     something that in a way is much more important:  a\r\n     conceptual grasp of online publishing.  I learned\r\n     how to change my \"big-picture\" perspective from\r\n     print terms -- limited space, physical\r\n     restrictions, little opportunity for interactivity\r\n     -- to online terms.  Online, the space an article\r\n     occupies is virtually unlimited, but it's\r\n     important to understand where human limitations\r\n     come into play.  Online, we can add links and\r\n     sounds and animation.  Online, readers can choose\r\n     precisely what they want to read and what they\r\n     want to ignore; they can fill out a survey; they\r\n     can send us e-mail.  Now I can go off into the\r\n     world with the clear understanding of both how a\r\n     prototype magazine and a prototype website are\r\n     produced, both in technical and in conceptual\r\n     terms.[11]\r\n\r\n     In light of the well-reported salary premiums, students\r\nwith Web experience in school will find a growing market for\r\ntheir skills.  There are, however, other issues of concern\r\nthat they foresee having to deal with.  For example,\r\nHammerling is well aware of the possibility of diminished\r\nlong-term job mobility:\r\n\r\n        I am applying to several online publishing\r\n     jobs.  Although I must admit that right now my\r\n     priority is in magazines, because I want to\r\n     establish myself as a consumer magazine person.  I\r\n     do have some worries of being pigeon-holed as an\r\n     online editor, similar to a trade magazine editor.\r\n     Are there difficulties in making the leap from\r\n     online to consumer magazines, as there is\r\n     difficulty in making that leap from trade to\r\n     consumer?  We don't know right now.  It's all\r\n     still too young.  [But] it seems as though many\r\n     well-established publications or media\r\n     conglomerates are very interested in hiring \"kids\"\r\n     who \"know this technology stuff,\" because they're\r\n     afraid of becoming dinosaurs in the race to get\r\n     online.[12]\r\n\r\n     Granted, there remain some students -- indeed, there\r\nare many journalists -- who are hesitant to enter the online\r\narena.  They question the journalistic integrity of online\r\npublishing, particularly at a time when accepted standards\r\nof style, content and ethics are noticeably absent.  Indeed,\r\nthis is a critical discussion, and one of the central roles\r\nof journalism educators will be to attempt to ensure that\r\nthe new electronic media are not abused but rather held to\r\nthe highest principles.  But the undeniable reality remains:\r\nThe industry blinked, and the publishing world changed.\r\nToday's journalism students are a technologically savvy\r\ngeneration, comfortable with new media and all its\r\npotential.  That alone has significant implications for the\r\nfuture of journalism and, thus, of journalism education.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         End Notes:\r\n\r\n     [1] For a summary of the syllabus and organization of\r\nthe Medill Magazine Publishing Project, please see\n[2]] The Medill Magazine Publishing Project advertising\r\nsales campaign is a \"simulated\" one.

The sense of the group is that, over time, it is likely that the percentage of commercial sites will increase in importance and value.

There are many specialties within physical therapy including orthopedics, geriatrics, neurology, pediatrics, sports, and cardiopulmonary physical therapy.\nWashington University\u2019s Degree Program\n3-year Doctor of Physical Therapy Degree\nAfter a 4-year undergraduate program at Washington University or another university\nFocus is on professional education\nPreparation\n2 semesters of physics with labs (8 credits)\n2 semesters of chemistry with labs (8 credits)\n2 semesters of biology/zoology courses for science majors (cell structure and function, introduction to biochemistry, introduction to genetics) (6 credits)\n2 semesters of English to include English Composition (6 credits)\n2 semesters of Psychology to include Abnormal Psychology (6 credits)\nStatistics (3 credits)\nPhysiology (human physiology is preferred) (3 credits)\nTrigonometry or Calculus (3 credits)\nAt least 2 other courses in the humanities and social sciences (either political science, history, speech, literature, sociology, economics, psychology, philosophy or anthropology) (6 credits)\nCompetence in medical terminology\nCentralized Application Service ( www.PTCAS.org ) required\nStandardized Test: GRE preferred ( www.gre.org ),\nMCAT accepted\nStrong GPA in math and sciences courses (minimum of 3.0)\nWritten essays to assess thinking and writing ability\nThree letters of recommendation to assess academic integrity, professionalism, and interpersonal skills (to include an academic instructor)\nInterview is not required\nMost Popular Majors\nMost often, students enter the Program with undergraduate degrees in biology, kinesiology, or psychology, but many other majors are also represented. Some students have majored in engineering, business, athletic training, communication, literature, microbiology, music, and sociology. Regardless of major, students should be able to think critically, and have strong communication and analytical skills.\nLearn from Leaders\nThe Program has 33 core faculty members\u201415 hold Ph.D.\u2019s, 17 hold DPT degrees, 1 holds a doctoral degree in another discipline, and 30 are PT\u2019s. The Program\u2019s faculty members are actively engaged in clinical practice, research, and teaching. They are recognized regionally, nationally, and internationally as leaders in clinical measurement, classification of movement-related problems, and prevention and treatment of movement dysfunction. An open-door policy encourages communication between students and faculty members. The Program\u2019s faculty also includes more than 160 adjunct teachers who bring quality experiences to the classroom.\nWhat is the curriculum like?\nThe curriculum includes three years of combined academic and clinical work that prepares students to pursue rewarding careers in the profession of Physical Therapy. Courses in the foundation sciences, clinical sciences, and professional skills are provided. Content within and between semesters is integrated, so that knowledge and skill build as the student progresses through the curriculum. Hands-on skill laboratories are used extensively, in addition to lecture. Case studies are regularly used to reinforce learning.\nExperience in the Field\nClinical education provides students the opportunity to learn outside the classroom and to expose students to the variety of Physical Therapy practices. The Clinical Education faculty assists students in identifying different locations to better prepare them as general practitioners. Students will have in-patient and out-patient experiences with patients who are of varying ages and who have a variety of musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, or cardiovascular-pulmonary conditions. During the first year, students have an early clinical experience during the first and second semesters. In the Second and Third year of study, students complete 38 weeks of full time clinical experience. Approximately 3/4 of the 400 clinical sites we affiliate with are outside the St. Louis metropolitan area.\nFor Additional Information Contact:\nSarah Rands, Manager, Admissions and Student Affairs\n(314) 286-1402\nAlisa Cooperstein, Manager, Marketing and Student Recruitment\n(314) 495-0504\nThe Program in Physical Therapy\nWashington University School of Medicine\n4444 Forest Park Blvd., Suite 1101\nCampus Box 8502\n"}, {"score": 928.25476, "uuid": "a09f6d89-9ff8-5b39-bde3-34a7856ec3b1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-66-18060", "target_hostname": "blogs.wsj.com", "target_uri": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/04/03/do-french-kids-eat-better-than-american-kids/?mod=e2tw", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Do French Kids Eat <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> American Kids? - Speakeasy - WSJ", "snippet": "So, the bad news is that French kids eat much <em>better</em> <em>than</em> we do.

Don\u2019t worry: until our family moved to France for a year, neither had I. It turns out they\u2019re a toddler-appropriate variety of artichoke, at least according to the Society of French Pediatricians, which also recommends that parents feed their youngsters other equally quirky vegetables, like salsify (Jerusalem star, a vegetable I\u2019d never even seen, much less thought of giving to my kids).\nEarly encounters with exotic foods are one reason that French kids eat everything \u2014 or almost. In surveys, they do actually admit to food dislikes, with oysters, beef tongue, cooked endive, turnip, liver, brain (source unspecified), tripe, creamed chestnuts, and kidney (the organ, not the bean) topping the list. Now, with the possible exception of turnip, many American parents (including me) have not tasted most of these foods, much less attempted to feed them to their children. But most French kids are regularly served all sorts of foods \u2014 and are generally happy to eat them. Don\u2019t get me wrong: French kids love ice cream, pasta, pizza, fries and ketchup. However, those aren\u2019t the only things they eat.\nTake, for example, this preschoolers\u2019 four-course lunch menu from Versailles (home of the chateau, outside of Paris) last January: sliced radish and corn salad with vinaigrette dressing and black olive garnish; roast guinea fowl with sauteed provencal vegetables and wheat berries; Saint Paulin cheese (a semi-soft, buttery cheese originally made by Trappist monks); with vanilla flan and meringue cookies for dessert.\nThis menu is not particularly unusual. Six million French children sit down to similar school lunches every day, happily consuming favorites like beet salad. Admittedly, it helps there is only one tasty menu on offer, vending machines are banned, and packed lunches from home are strongly discouraged. It also helps that teachers in France get the same menu as the kids (perhaps an incentive we could use in our battle for tasty, healthy school lunches). But the real reason French kids eat these things is simple: they like them.\nWe saw this at work in our own family. When we moved to France for a year, my two young daughters were absurdly picky eaters (we counted goldfish crackers as a separate food group). The lessons we learned in French food education (in homes, school, and daycare) had an astounding effect, converting them into happy eaters-of-almost-everything \u2014 from mussels to mackerel, broccoli to beets. But before I allowed myself to be convinced of the French approach, I actually looked up the statistics. Just under half (42%) of French children eat the recommended two-and-a-half cups of fruits and vegetables per day, and many of the rest are pretty close. In contrast, generous estimates suggest that 10% of American children and adolescents meet the recommendations. And keep in mind that just under half of fruit intake in American toddlers is fruit juice, and the most common type of \u201cvegetable\u201d consumed by American kids is the French fry (up to one-half of all vegetables consumed, in some cases).\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. How do French parents actually get their kids to eat all these fruits and vegetables? The answer is tied up with French history and culture, but boils down to a set of culturally codified (yet scientifically-based) strategies that French parents, doctors, and scientists have spent the past 200 years developing. These include \u2018food rules\u2019 which apply to everyone, which are taught at home, and reinforced in school cafeterias and classrooms. This has produced a nation of competent eaters: able to self-regulate consumption, enjoy healthy foods (but also the occasional treat), and accept new foods without fuss (and with a healthy dollop of curiosity), while displaying little of the food extremism \u2014 at both ends of the spectrum \u2014 we see in North America.\nSo, the bad news is that French kids eat much better than we do. Given the effects of poor nutrition on mental and physical health, weight, and even IQ, this is something to be worried about. But the good news is that the French experience can be adapted to North America. Indeed many of their food rules are common sense wisdom that we once used to share, but have somehow forgotten. Examining the French approach might just help us rediscover some of our own (badly needed) traditional food wisdom.\nKaren Le Billon\u2019s new book is \u201c French Kids Eat Everything .\u201d An author and teacher, she is a Rhodes Scholar with a Ph.D from Oxford University.

The reality is that an online course can take as much or more time and effort as a traditional course.\nYou want to learn how to use a computer or surf the web.

While most online instructors will respond to your concerns as soon as possible, you will need to be patient.\nAs you will not be in the classroom, you will need to be much more self-directed than it might seem. In other words, you have to take responsibility for your own learning.\nSome students truly need the face-to-face interaction with instructor and peers.\nOther students find that they lack the high level of responsibility it takes to tackle an online class.\nAt a minimum, an online course requires students to use their time wisely, be organized, be self-directed, and be willing to try new modes of communication and learning.\nSuccessful students often use the weekly assignment sheets to create a course calendar so that they have an overview of all assignments. Good time management and planning are necessary skills.\nStudents who do well are those who are willing to put in the needed time, read the text carefully (even the dull sections), and participate in the discussion boards the best they can.\nYou will be expected to check your e-mail frequently, get all assignments in on time, not allow yourself to fall behind at all, discuss your concerns and questions with instructor and classmates, perhaps arrange to swap e-mail addresses with other students in the class, and participate fully each week.\nThe Best Things about Online Courses: ( back to list )\nFlexibility - for those of you unable to attend a regularly scheduled course, you will not be restricted by time and place - you get to do the weekly coursework when and where you want to do it.\nThe asynchronous discussions allow everyone to have his/her say on the issues, and students can take the time to form thoughtful and clear opinions before sharing them with the rest of the class.\nNo commuting to and from college: while others are driving in inclement weather or running through rain and snow to make it to class, you can be warm and dry working from your home computer.\nNo transportation or parking problems to worry about.\nNo need for childcare.\nWhat Mimimum equipment you will need: ( back to list )\nA Pentium PC, a Power Macintosh, or any similar computer capable of connecting to the Internet.\nA 28.8 modem is the minimum (faster is better)\nAn Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nA graphical Internet browser such as FireFox or Microsoft Internet Explorer .

All computers eventually suffer failures. Have a plan in case yours goes down; know where you can find a back up computer in case of emergency and know how to operate its various programs. Back up or copy your homework onto a disk regularly.\nLogon Frequently. You should try to log on at least once a day (at least five days a week and more often if possible). Develop a logon routine that's comfortable with your schedule. online classes tend to generate a large number of e-mails and web announcements. If you don't logon for a few days you will be overwhelmed and might have trouble catching up.\nRespond promptly to e-mail. In the online environment you are invisible to the rest of the class. If you don't respond, we will think you didn't get the e-mail or don't want to respond. When you respond it's like saying, \"I'm here!\" If you can't respond immediately, at least send a quick note saying \"I received your message and will reply this evening.\"\nInclude the previous message when responding to e-mails. This will help the person receiving your response to refresh his or her memory about the original discussion. (Note: It is appropriate to include only the pertinent portion of the original message).\nDon't change e-mail addresses. Changing or using different e-mail addresses only creates confusion and delays.\nIdentify yourself. Make sure that you sign your e-mail with your full name (first and last). E-mail addresses cannot always be associated with the name of the sender.\nParticipate. You attend the online class by participating. You send messages and complete assignments before the due date; that's how you show that you are \"present.\" If you lurk (remain silent) then you are \"absent.\"\nMake your e-mail subject lines meaningful. Use something in the subject line header that lets the receiver know which task you're submitting for his or her review; the title of the assignment as your subject line is always good. Always identify your class by putting the class number in the e-mail subject line.\nUse .rtf format for attachments. If you send an instructor or classmate an attachment by e-mail, convert it to text rich format (.rft) format before e-mailing.\nAccuracy. Double check e-mail addresses. Sending e-mail to the wrong address will cause the intended receiver to be cut out of the communication loop. If you send a URL make sure you cut and paste it in from the web page. Inaccurate URLs cause others to waste time trying to figure out why they can't get to the web page.\nRead about the COS Library's services for distance students. http://www.siskiyous.edu/library/servicesdistantstudents.htm Then follow the directions to request a library card so that you can access the library's online databases, which includes periodicals, newspapers, electronic books and reference sources. Remember, you can always contact a reference librarian by e-mail or phone for assistance in using the databases or help with research assignments.\nFlexibility and calm. These are the hallmark of successful online classroom experiences. Problems will arise and when they do, the ability to remain calm and be flexible in your thinking will keep them from becoming unmanageable. Don' t panic; if you don't get an answer to your pleas for help right away, remain calm, wait 24 hours and if you still haven't resolved your problem or gotten help, send me a message with the words \"URGENT HELP\" in the subject line. Instructors usually check e-mail each day, but they can also receive several a hundred e-mails in a week, so if your urgent message is not answered within 24-48 hours e-mail your instructor again.\nPay attention to deadlines. When you don't get your assignments in on time it causes other students who need to read and comment on your work to also be late in their work.\nNetiquette. Because the student and instructor can't see each other they lose much of the ability to read between the lines in our online communications. Without facial expressions and body language the written word can easily be misinterpreted. The use of smiley's is a good way to provide insight of your intent when composing e-mails. Look over the suggestions at: Wikipedia - Netiquette and Wikipedia - Emoticon .\nDon't Flame. The purpose of class discussion boards is to learn from one another and hopefully gain an appreciation of another point of view. We all need to show respect for one another's opinions and be sensitive in our comments. If you receive an upsetting message, wait to respond for at least 24 hours. Waiting before responding, will allow everyone to cool off and rethink the wisdom of sending their first response. Verbal attacks (flaming) is not be tolerated. Let your instructor know if you feel you have been verbally abused by a classmate.\nMake meaningful comments. During the semester you will likely be commenting on one another's work. Think of this as a chance to help one another. Meaningful comments will be appreciated by your classmates. Avoid comments like \"Good ideas.\" Instead, list specific points that you thought were good, and suggest ways that the person can improve.\nRead and print out course \"first day\" information. Be sure you understand all course policies, know how you will be graded and are aware of important due dates.\nCollege of the Siskiyous, a public community college with one of the most beautiful campuses in California, is recognized for its excellent academic, vocational and athletic programs.

While arguments have been made over which style is more beneficial, the truth of the matter is it comes down to personal preference. Within a traditional classroom setting, students have a good idea of what to expect. Conversely, with online courses , there can be a lot of variation. The following looks at what professors have observed about students\u2019 learning process in an online environment and how it differs from that of a face-to-face classroom.\nFor any educational platform to succeed, it must present students with the opportunity to communicate. Through the use of chat rooms and discussion boards, online students and instructors are able to socially interact \u2014 a great alternative for students not looking to build on their interpersonal skills, but instead are more focused on a course\u2019s content. In some instances, the anonymity of online communication allows students to experience trust. For example, educators such as Diane Howard, a professor at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor (UMHB), feels that by having the time to make a carefully thought out response, students are able to contribute substantively in online discussions.\nFurther differences between the two modes of learning are the multiple tools offered to students by online programs. Here, professors are able to challenge individuals to use these devices in order to construct their own way of better comprehending information as well as interact. \u201cDistance learning needs to be interactive, as participation in learning is important,\u201d Howard said. She stated that an instructor should not be the center point of e-learning, but that the learning instead always should be. Thus, with recorded lectures, students are able to pause and replay them, which offers a much appreciated break from note-taking. Conversely, in a traditional classroom situation, there is more of an opportunity for roundtable-style discussion, where during any point of a live lecture, students all have the chance to offer their opinion or ask a question. Yet, online learning also offers a chance for students to ask questions, though this will be done in a message board system rather than with a lively face-to-face debate.\nOverall, In the case of writing or language assignments, online learning is more than satisfactory. However, many professors admit that having the ability to physically practice what you are learning can be important. This is particularly true for those who are learning something that must be experienced in addition to being studied out of a textbook, such as chemistry students. In their hands-on science labs, students have the chance to practice an experiment and see the results for themselves, enhancing their understanding of the subject. The same can be said for students studying to become health care professionals.\nAnother difference between campus and online learning is pace. With online courses, students have more of an opportunity to accelerate their education. While traditional courses follow a steady pace, select distance learning programs, such as accelerated programs, can skip the introduction of a topic, allowing students to quickly build on what they are already aware of. As Dr. Jason G. Caudill of the University of Tennessee said, \u201cWhen it works, it really works.\u201d However, it is not the speed that professors hope to see, but rather that their students are able to grasp the content. For Caudill, having students learn how to critically assess things and develop intellectually is all that matters, whether it is online or in a classroom is irrelevant.\nOf course, one of the ways to ensure that students have put forth the time needed to acquire this knowledge is through tests. In a traditional classroom, professors are able to observe their students in person while they complete an exam, whereas online programs do not possess this physical monitoring component. What professors such as Caudill would like to see, as online learning continues to develop , is more accountability. This does not mean sending each student to a monitored facility for every test, but rather that every online institution puts a strong system in place. Whether it is through the use of webcams or audio devices, achieving accountability is the key.\nAll in all, some professors feel comfortable using both modes of learning and are careful not to diminish either one. The reasoning here is that both can offer a different kind of educational experience, presenting more options to students, and allowing everyone to find the best possible method for them. \u201cWhen it comes down to it,\u201d Caudill said, \u201call I want is for my students to develop intellectually.\u201d\nFeatured Schools\n"}, {"score": 924.565, "uuid": "9597684b-c473-5ba4-9dd8-1dab10d10213", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1609wb-54-00488", "target_hostname": "www.bestuniversities.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bestuniversities.com/blog/2009/what-can-i-expect-in-an-online-course/", "page_rank": 1.1725115e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "What Can I Expect in an <em>Online</em> <em>Course</em>? | Best Universities", "snippet": "<em>Online</em> college <em>courses</em> <em>are</em> set up in a way that replicates the <em>classroom</em> experience as best as possible in a virtual setting.

Instead of showing up to a physical classroom, students go online, enter a username and password to access their courses, and then click on the course material. You may recall that in a traditional classroom setting, a professor or instructor hands out a syllabus to his or her entire class and provides an introductory overview of the course on the first day of class. With online classes, students are typically notified via e-mail when classes start, and the syllabus and class description are available online as part of your course material.\nStudents access online instruction differently depending on their college\u2019s course management software, but most courses are very straightforward to navigate. Class lectures are often made available to students in the form of audio and video files and reading material. Other resources your professor might post include links to helpful information, discussion boards to facilitate class participation, and instruction for completing homework assignments. Video files might show your professor at the head of a classroom, writing important information on a white board or through a Power Point presentation, the slides of which are often made available in your online course. Students will be responsible for taking down important information from these lectures in notes, but the good news is you can usually rewind video or audio lecture files if you believe you missed something important.\nOnline classrooms may require you to use an online textbook, or you may need to purchase a physical textbook. You will need to study the assigned reading from these textbooks in the same way you would for a traditional class.\nMany professors wrap up class participation into your overall grade in an online course. To gauge your engagement in an online course, your professor will take note of how often you contribute to discussion board threads and how frequently you log in to your course. The course management software allows professors to see which of their students are \"showing up\" to lectures and which are \"skipping class.\"\nFinally, students can interact with their fellow classmates and their professor via student e-mail and chat functions built into the course management system. Some online professors even have virtual office hours where you can be sure you will catch your professor online to get your questions answered quickly.\nQuick Degree Finder\n"}], [{"score": 924.4088, "uuid": "1a66cdf5-e12d-5f7e-aac7-04b82a309b51", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-56-05969", "target_hostname": "www.readingonline.org", "target_uri": "http://www.readingonline.org/electronic/JAAL/4-00_Column.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "Reading <em>Online</em> - Electronic <em>Classroom</em>: April 2000 Technology Column from", "snippet": "Relation of the <em>online</em> writing center to the <em>classroom</em> What kinds of relations <em>are</em> being shaped with respect to the <em>classroom</em> in <em>online</em> writing centers?

How might we describe these new place-like ensembles? Still more important for our purposes, how do we understand literate practices \u0093situated\u0094 within them? To address the issue of place and literate practices I focus here on the development of online writing centers (often called OWLs, for Online Writing Laboratories). In their multiple relations to cyberspaces and physical places, as well as to institutional and cultural practices, online writing centers offer a unique opportunity to consider the complex knot of place and practice.\nWhile researchers have raised a myriad of issues regarding the management of consultants, schedules, network technologies, and student papers in the development of online writing centers (e.g., Harris & Pemberton, 1995 ; Healy, 1995 ), the concerns voiced in this column are somewhat different. Here, I'll consider online writing centers as a particular case, in order to make some initial observations about the codevelopments of place and literate practices with the developments of new online technologies. What does the development of online writing centers show us about the creation of \u0093new\u0094 spaces for literacy? Here are some interpretations:\nThe proliferation of the online writing center\nAs of mid-September 1999, there were 278 online writing centers linked to the National Writing Centers Association website at http://departments.colgate.edu/diw/NWCA.html . This site catalogues primarily centers based in the U.S. and chiefly those associated with higher education. The proliferation of online writing centers is noteworthy when we consider how they, like the persons and courses of study they serve, are deeply connected with the construction of institutional identity. One can imagine, for instance, that the production of many fewer, yet superior, online writing centers as collaborations across universities, schools, and writing groups of various sorts might be a better use of institutional resources and cyberspace.\nIf the institutional import of having one's own online writing center presence were lessened, perhaps the State University of New York (SUNY) Albany's online writing center and that of Broome Community College (Binghampton, New York) at http://www.sunybroome.edu/~writecenter/ would be \u0093de-centered\u0094 in cyberspace and share an online writing center, rather than being two of nine online writing centers in the SUNY system. Yet, the current development of online writing centers appears to be deeply tied up with the felt need for \u0093presencing\u0094 oneself and one's institution on the Web (as well as with hybrid relations to material centers, discussed later). For institutional visibility, an online writing center is arguably more important than its offline counterpart.\nThe proliferation of online writing centers should not necessarily be taken as an indication of a vast degree of diversity among them. While I will attempt to highlight their diversity, at the same time I am struck by how the online writing center has become stabilized or durable as a cultural form. In what might be called the \u0093genrification\u0094 of the online writing center, a set of common characteristics across writing centers has rapidly developed. Most online writing centers, for instance, have information about their offline counterparts' basic services (e.g., location, scheduling, staffing); most include links to general writing resources such as the Hypertext Webster Gateway for accessing various online dictionaries, Roget's Thesaurus , or the Columbia Guide to Online Style ; many contain \u0093handouts\u0094 of various sorts related to writing and grammar problems and issues; and a growing number include e-mail links that permit students to submit their papers for online tutoring.\nLike personal or university homepages, the online writing center is a text subject to a powerful centripetal pull to become like many others in form, function, and content. This \u0093genrification\u0094 also operates, of course, at the level of hyperlinked resources. As a high value is often placed on writing centers with the largest number of student handouts (e.g., as is evident in Bruce Pegg's [1998] helpful online writing center guide at http://sticky.usu.edu/~usupress/individl/wirech13.pdf ), these centers and their handouts become constructed as more central centers to other more peripheral centers that develop in (linked) relation to them. Nevertheless, it is still possible for student writers to connect to 70 different grammar hotlines by e-mail or telephone across the U.S.\nHybrid relations of online and offline writing centers\nWithin the online writing center based at Salt Lake Community College, Redwood Campus (Salt Lake City, Utah), there is a Webcam that peers into the space of the physical, offline writing center at the same institution. When I clicked on the Webcam, I was a voyeur of room AD 218 and able to watch the back of one student writing at a table; get a silent side profile of two other students talking at another table in the distance; and see someone come from off camera, stage left to stage right, to retrieve something from a filing cabinet. Around the periphery of this cam-view are hyperlinked resources on the Web page. Some resources are based on local activity, such as a schedule of writing advisors at three locations on campus, and many are more distant. I followed a link, for example, to the National Writing Project , where I learned of an online conference with writer and teacher Donald Murray. SLCC's Webcam as an online entree to an offline world, and its textual positioning with respect to a large array of more local and distant activity, is a good metaphor of the hybridization of the writing center across online and offline spaces.\nSuch hybrid relations are ubiquitous. At the Colorado State University Writing Center (Fort Collins) , for instance, a student needing guidance on research may select links to the CSU's Morgan Library, where in mid-September of 1999 a librarian offered a face-to-face workshop in Room 165 on Finding Full Text Articles Fast; he or she may likewise consult an online guide to Using the Library of Congress . It is tempting to consider these hybrid relations as unidirectional, where the online writing center is based upon and extends its offline referent.\nYet, returning to the example of the Webcam at Salt Lake Community College, consider how the presence of an online camera constructs the writing space and activity of the students within the center. How are writing, having conferences, and drafting shaped when they are made more or less visible to a dispersed Internet public? As a more mundane example, how are writing handouts developed when they are produced for mass audiences via online distribution, rather than for more local ones? Finally, how might face-to-face tutoring relations develop when tutors are also working in online communication and hybridizing their practices across this activity?\nThere has been a certain amount of anxiety within the online writing center literature over the threat of physical writing centers being taken over by online centers for reasons of institutional efficiency (e.g., Stuart Blythe's piece in the first issue of Kairos, an online journal for \u0093teachers of writing in webbed environments\u0094). While such anxiety may be warranted, particularly when we consider the market-driven motivations of much of distance education, when we view it from the perspective of the locations writers themselves select, we end up with a form of development that is much more complex than replacement. For instance, the Dakota State University Online Writing Lab (Madison, South Dakota) started as an online center alone, with no offline counterpart, with the expressed purpose of better serving students in remote locations. While a physical writing center does not yet exist at DSU, at the same time writing consultants often meet face to face with formerly online students on campus (E. Johnson, personal communication, September 13, 1999). A similar relation was evident in a distance writing-tutoring project between graduate students at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the Oak Ridge Campus of Roane State Community College in Tennessee. While none of the community college students in the project used the writing center prior to the distance project, following it many of them repositioned themselves in the school's physical writing center for study, including online and offline work on its computers.\nRelation of the online writing center to the classroom\nWhat kinds of relations are being shaped with respect to the classroom in online writing centers? What ought such relations to be? We might expect that \u0093de-centering\u0094 the writing center in cyberspace might make it more inviting to students reluctant to enter an offline, physical space. Conversations within the center might be less directly implicated in institutional hierarchy, as the institution might be backgrounded within these conversations and spaces. Could writing theorist Stephen North's early student-centered vision of the physical writing center be even better realized online: \u0093In short, we are not here to serve, supplement, back up, complement, reinforce, or otherwise be defined by any external curriculum\u0094 (in Healy, 1995 , p. 185)? Might the movement into cyberspace make the writing center somewhat more of a \u0093semiautonomous space\u0094 (Healy, 1995; Kali & Trimbur, 1987 ) with respect to the institution, classrooms, and the curriculum? If so, toward what end?\nThe relation of the offline or online writing center to its institutional home is a pivotal issue for its development. A commonplace positioning of the \u0093center\u0094 is between the student and the classroom. The space of the center permits the student to move toward some better formulation of an \u0093ideal text\u0094 ( Knoblauch & Brannon, 1984 ), mediating for the respective professor and course. However, if the writing center is to provide some kind of leadership in writing practices and theory, if it serves a purpose of helping students not only to engage in disciplinary discourses but also to critique those discourses, and if the center connects students to conversations about writing that extend well beyond particular institutional course structures, then something akin to a more semiautonomous space makes sense. Perhaps at issue is not merely the value of autonomy or agency, but the way in which such autonomy is imagined.\nAs a construct, the semiautonomy of the writing center space and its practices need not be imagined as a semipermeable barrier between the student and the \u0093external curriculum,\u0094 but as \u0093de-centering\u0094 from the institution through powerful connections to other sociocultural spaces and practices extending well beyond it. The center space in this relation has been conceived by Eric Crump as a \u0093technoprovacateur\u0094 whose role is to facilitate student participation in increasingly broad literate networks (with a large dash of fun), rather than simply to permit passage to a designated classroom space.\nIn sum, while it seems like a good thing for the online writing center to have a link that leads a student to the criteria for making a Disease Education Poster in Microbiology 300 , at the same time it is worrisome to imagine that online writing centers could construct themselves as mere clearinghouses for writing assignments constructed by faculty, high-tech mediators of the student dorm space and the classroom space.\nTo get an indication of how current online writing centers are expanding space and practice, consider the meanings of writing within them. Across the vast array of online writing centers, one generally finds that they are primarily engaged with the relatively narrow line of generic practices associated with academic literacies: argumentation and research, a regular but small stream of personal essays, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, cover letters, and the like, and a still smaller trickle of creative writing. Of course, none of this should come as a surprise, and we may well argue that online writing centers would be remiss not to support students with what J. Paul Johnson dubs traditional academic \u0093papertext\u0094 or \u0093a technological-epistemological product which locates the writer as a rational, stable subject and presents the text as a coherent, printed totality\u0094 (see http://www.english.ttu.edu/Kairos/1.1/3.html ). The significant mainstay of writing centers has been to offer sound advice about academic prose with a personal touch:\nA thesis statement is one of the greatest unifying aspects of a paper. It should act as mortar, holding together the various bricks of a paper, summarizing the main point of the paper \u0093in a nutshell,\u0094 and pointing toward the paper's development. Often a thesis statement will be expressed in a sentence or two; be sure to check with your professor for any particular requirements in your class -- some professors prefer a more subtle approach! (See http://www.richmond.edu/~writing/wweb/thesis.html ).\nYet how would writing be conceived, and the writing space of the online center be transformed, if as Johnson suggests we were to disrupt the notion \u0093that the proscenium classroom is the only valid context for writing\u0094? What if online writing centers became academic leaders as spaces for the advancement of multiliteracies ( New London Group, 1996 )? Consider this shift as represented in the publication procedures for the online Journal of Computer Mediated Communication at http://www.ascusc.org/jcmc/submiss.html :\nArticles submitted may be of any length. Articles may be written in any format. Articles may contain any combination of text, tables, graphics, animation, or audio component. JCMC editors will make every possible effort to accommodate presentation formats.\nWere even some writing conceived closer to this formulation of representation, imagine the potential transformations of space and practice both within the online writing center (in terms of resources, expertise, archived media files, technical tools, electronic spaces) and with respect to the cultural networks in which the online center participates.\n"}, {"score": 923.3858, "uuid": "6ae398f2-666e-5b23-923f-15c5e4cd24a2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-45-09484", "target_hostname": "www.readingonline.org", "target_uri": "http://www.readingonline.org/electronic/jaal/4-00_Column.html", "page_rank": 1.221749e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Reading <em>Online</em> - Electronic <em>Classroom</em>: April 2000 Technology Column from", "snippet": "Relation of the <em>online</em> writing center to the <em>classroom</em> What kinds of relations <em>are</em> being shaped with respect to the <em>classroom</em> in <em>online</em> writing centers?

How might we describe these new place-like ensembles? Still more important for our purposes, how do we understand literate practices \u0093situated\u0094 within them? To address the issue of place and literate practices I focus here on the development of online writing centers (often called OWLs, for Online Writing Laboratories). In their multiple relations to cyberspaces and physical places, as well as to institutional and cultural practices, online writing centers offer a unique opportunity to consider the complex knot of place and practice.\nWhile researchers have raised a myriad of issues regarding the management of consultants, schedules, network technologies, and student papers in the development of online writing centers (e.g., Harris & Pemberton, 1995 ; Healy, 1995 ), the concerns voiced in this column are somewhat different. Here, I'll consider online writing centers as a particular case, in order to make some initial observations about the codevelopments of place and literate practices with the developments of new online technologies. What does the development of online writing centers show us about the creation of \u0093new\u0094 spaces for literacy? Here are some interpretations:\nThe proliferation of the online writing center\nAs of mid-September 1999, there were 278 online writing centers linked to the National Writing Centers Association website at http://departments.colgate.edu/diw/NWCA.html . This site catalogues primarily centers based in the U.S. and chiefly those associated with higher education. The proliferation of online writing centers is noteworthy when we consider how they, like the persons and courses of study they serve, are deeply connected with the construction of institutional identity. One can imagine, for instance, that the production of many fewer, yet superior, online writing centers as collaborations across universities, schools, and writing groups of various sorts might be a better use of institutional resources and cyberspace.\nIf the institutional import of having one's own online writing center presence were lessened, perhaps the State University of New York (SUNY) Albany's online writing center and that of Broome Community College (Binghampton, New York) at http://www.sunybroome.edu/~writecenter/ would be \u0093de-centered\u0094 in cyberspace and share an online writing center, rather than being two of nine online writing centers in the SUNY system.

This \u0093genrification\u0094 also operates, of course, at the level of hyperlinked resources. As a high value is often placed on writing centers with the largest number of student handouts (e.g., as is evident in Bruce Pegg's [1998] helpful online writing center guide at http://sticky.usu.edu/~usupress/individl/wirech13.pdf ), these centers and their handouts become constructed as more central centers to other more peripheral centers that develop in (linked) relation to them. Nevertheless, it is still possible for student writers to connect to 70 different grammar hotlines by e-mail or telephone across the U.S.\nHybrid relations of online and offline writing centers\nWithin the online writing center based at Salt Lake Community College, Redwood Campus (Salt Lake City, Utah), there is a Webcam that peers into the space of the physical, offline writing center at the same institution.

Don\u2019t worry: until our family moved to France for a year, neither had I. It turns out they\u2019re a toddler-appropriate variety of artichoke, at least according to the Society of French Pediatricians, which also recommends that parents feed their youngsters other equally quirky vegetables, like salsify (Jerusalem star, a vegetable I\u2019d never even seen, much less thought of giving to my kids).\nEarly encounters with exotic foods are one reason that French kids eat everything \u2014 or almost. In surveys, they do actually admit to food dislikes, with oysters, beef tongue, cooked endive, turnip, liver, brain (source unspecified), tripe, creamed chestnuts, and kidney (the organ, not the bean) topping the list. Now, with the possible exception of turnip, many American parents (including me) have not tasted most of these foods, much less attempted to feed them to their children. But most French kids are regularly served all sorts of foods \u2014 and are generally happy to eat them. Don\u2019t get me wrong: French kids love ice cream, pasta, pizza, fries and ketchup. However, those aren\u2019t the only things they eat.\nTake, for example, this preschoolers\u2019 four-course lunch menu from Versailles (home of the chateau, outside of Paris) last January: sliced radish and corn salad with vinaigrette dressing and black olive garnish; roast guinea fowl with sauteed provencal vegetables and wheat berries; Saint Paulin cheese (a semi-soft, buttery cheese originally made by Trappist monks); with vanilla flan and meringue cookies for dessert.\nThis menu is not particularly unusual. Six million French children sit down to similar school lunches every day, happily consuming favorites like beet salad. Admittedly, it helps there is only one tasty menu on offer, vending machines are banned, and packed lunches from home are strongly discouraged. It also helps that teachers in France get the same menu as the kids (perhaps an incentive we could use in our battle for tasty, healthy school lunches). But the real reason French kids eat these things is simple: they like them.\nWe saw this at work in our own family. When we moved to France for a year, my two young daughters were absurdly picky eaters (we counted goldfish crackers as a separate food group). The lessons we learned in French food education (in homes, school, and daycare) had an astounding effect, converting them into happy eaters-of-almost-everything \u2014 from mussels to mackerel, broccoli to beets. But before I allowed myself to be convinced of the French approach, I actually looked up the statistics. Just under half (42%) of French children eat the recommended two-and-a-half cups of fruits and vegetables per day, and many of the rest are pretty close. In contrast, generous estimates suggest that 10% of American children and adolescents meet the recommendations. And keep in mind that just under half of fruit intake in American toddlers is fruit juice, and the most common type of \u201cvegetable\u201d consumed by American kids is the French fry (up to one-half of all vegetables consumed, in some cases).\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. How do French parents actually get their kids to eat all these fruits and vegetables? The answer is tied up with French history and culture, but boils down to a set of culturally codified (yet scientifically-based) strategies that French parents, doctors, and scientists have spent the past 200 years developing. These include \u2018food rules\u2019 which apply to everyone, which are taught at home, and reinforced in school cafeterias and classrooms. This has produced a nation of competent eaters: able to self-regulate consumption, enjoy healthy foods (but also the occasional treat), and accept new foods without fuss (and with a healthy dollop of curiosity), while displaying little of the food extremism \u2014 at both ends of the spectrum \u2014 we see in North America.\nSo, the bad news is that French kids eat much better than we do. Given the effects of poor nutrition on mental and physical health, weight, and even IQ, this is something to be worried about. But the good news is that the French experience can be adapted to North America. Indeed many of their food rules are common sense wisdom that we once used to share, but have somehow forgotten. Examining the French approach might just help us rediscover some of our own (badly needed) traditional food wisdom.\nKaren Le Billon\u2019s new book is \u201c French Kids Eat Everything .\u201d An author and teacher, she is a Rhodes Scholar with a Ph.D from Oxford University.

It turns out they\u2019re a toddler-appropriate variety of artichoke, at least according to the Society of French Pediatricians, which also recommends that parents feed their youngsters other equally quirky vegetables, like salsify (Jerusalem star, a vegetable I\u2019d never even seen, much less thought of giving to my kids).\nEarly encounters with exotic foods are one reason that French kids eat everything \u2014 or almost. In surveys, they do actually admit to food dislikes, with oysters, beef tongue, cooked endive, turnip, liver, brain (source unspecified), tripe, creamed chestnuts, and kidney (the organ, not the bean) topping the list. Now, with the possible exception of turnip, many American parents (including me) have not tasted most of these foods, much less attempted to feed them to their children. But most French kids are regularly served all sorts of foods \u2014 and are generally happy to eat them. Don\u2019t get me wrong: French kids love ice cream, pasta, pizza, fries and ketchup. However, those aren\u2019t the only things they eat.\nTake, for example, this preschoolers\u2019 four-course lunch menu from Versailles (home of the chateau, outside of Paris) last January: sliced radish and corn salad with vinaigrette dressing and black olive garnish; roast guinea fowl with sauteed provencal vegetables and wheat berries; Saint Paulin cheese (a semi-soft, buttery cheese originally made by Trappist monks); with vanilla flan and meringue cookies for dessert.\nThis menu is not particularly unusual. Six million French children sit down to similar school lunches every day, happily consuming favorites like beet salad. Admittedly, it helps there is only one tasty menu on offer, vending machines are banned, and packed lunches from home are strongly discouraged. It also helps that teachers in France get the same menu as the kids (perhaps an incentive we could use in our battle for tasty, healthy school lunches). But the real reason French kids eat these things is simple: they like them.\nWe saw this at work in our own family. When we moved to France for a year, my two young daughters were absurdly picky eaters (we counted goldfish crackers as a separate food group). The lessons we learned in French food education (in homes, school, and daycare) had an astounding effect, converting them into happy eaters-of-almost-everything \u2014 from mussels to mackerel, broccoli to beets. But before I allowed myself to be convinced of the French approach, I actually looked up the statistics. Just under half (42%) of French children eat the recommended two-and-a-half cups of fruits and vegetables per day, and many of the rest are pretty close. In contrast, generous estimates suggest that 10% of American children and adolescents meet the recommendations. And keep in mind that just under half of fruit intake in American toddlers is fruit juice, and the most common type of \u201cvegetable\u201d consumed by American kids is the French fry (up to one-half of all vegetables consumed, in some cases).\nI know what you\u2019re thinking. How do French parents actually get their kids to eat all these fruits and vegetables? The answer is tied up with French history and culture, but boils down to a set of culturally codified (yet scientifically-based) strategies that French parents, doctors, and scientists have spent the past 200 years developing. These include \u2018food rules\u2019 which apply to everyone, which are taught at home, and reinforced in school cafeterias and classrooms. This has produced a nation of competent eaters: able to self-regulate consumption, enjoy healthy foods (but also the occasional treat), and accept new foods without fuss (and with a healthy dollop of curiosity), while displaying little of the food extremism \u2014 at both ends of the spectrum \u2014 we see in North America.\nSo, the bad news is that French kids eat much better than we do. Given the effects of poor nutrition on mental and physical health, weight, and even IQ, this is something to be worried about. But the good news is that the French experience can be adapted to North America. Indeed many of their food rules are common sense wisdom that we once used to share, but have somehow forgotten. Examining the French approach might just help us rediscover some of our own (badly needed) traditional food wisdom.\nKaren Le Billon\u2019s new book is \u201c French Kids Eat Everything .\u201d An author and teacher, she is a Rhodes Scholar with a Ph.D from Oxford University.

Many teachers do not have the training or knowledge to confront the task, and schools may not have the resources to assist them. This course provides them with the background necessary for meeting the needs of students from different countries and cultures including encouraging intercultural exchanges, information about assessment and the language learning process, cultural awareness, and a wide range of techniques and suggestions for offering a high quality learning experience for ELLs.\nThe course presents and analyzes the foundations of bilingual education for teachers to be able to understand and incorporate the most relevant aspects in their classrooms. As teachers gain expertise in the theory and methods of second language learning in general, they will learn to recognize the real level of ELLs, both in Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP). In addition, becoming familiar with the way English is taught around the world and ways to access their students\u2019 schemas, educators will gain insights into how their ELLs have been exposed to the language previously and how they are accustomed to learning.\nOne of the main points in the course is that good instructional practices for ELLs will benefit all learners. Recommendations for an eclectic approach include assigning buddies, cooperative learning, reading strategies, and incorporating the arts to create a learning environment that will motivate all students to reach their full potential as human beings as well as academically.\nCourse Objectives: Participants will\nunderstand the needs of ELLs to work with them accordingly\nbecome more familiar with the situation of immigrants in the United States\nbecome more culturally aware to create a multicultural classroom environment\nlearn how to sensitize English Only students to be able to help their ELL peers\nunderstand how immigration affects education\nunderstand the principles of bilingual education to apply them in the classroom\nunderstand the process of language acquisition\nlearn techniques and methods for teaching a second language\nassess ELL students in terms of BICS and CALP and first language literacy\nlearn how to individualize instruction for ELLs\nintegrate lessons with creative arts in the regular curriculum\nprepare lessons keeping in mind the schema and particular needs of ELLs\nbe able to accommodate lessons for ELLs with different forms of scaffolding\nencourage ELLs to read extensively in English\nlearn about the specific problems ELLs face in reading in English and helping them overcome them\nlearn different techniques to incorporate in content area lessons\nlearn how to involve the family and the community in the multicultural learning environment\n"}, {"score": 918.2668, "uuid": "1e35aa68-3c2b-5598-a866-aac19f668593", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1810wb-47-16734", "target_hostname": "www.forgiver.net", "target_uri": "http://www.forgiver.net/anger.htm", "page_rank": 1.1831037e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Anger Management: Building <em>Better</em> Relationships.

Assessment of Anger\nFirst determine the level, source, style and target of your anger. A number of anger measurements are useful for that. Anger has at least 4 levels, namely hidden anger, angry expression, angry words, violence. Keep a Hostility Log in which you journal all the hostile situations you initiated in 5 days. Include in it 6 things, namely the date and time, a short description of the incident, your attitude (thoughts or level of mistrust and cynicism), your emotions that lead to the incident, your behavior resulting from the hostility, and the outcome. Here is another anger test: http://members.tripod.com/kanchanD/ANGER.HTM\nAnger is a reaction to an emotion, not a planned action. The feelings underlying the anger make us feel weak. Anger makes us feel in control. Angry is learned and therefore can be unlearned and replaced with healthier coping. Anger can be a reaction to one event or a response after numerous events. To repress anger and not to deal with it is unhealthy and will inevitably carry negative consequences. To change our angry, we need to understand its cause. If we have seen our parents get angry first and resolve an issue after, we are more likely to use a similar approach. Types of anger are learned. We are more likely to get angry if we are frustrated and feel stressed, if we are tired, if we tend to hold our feelings inside rather than talk them out.\nERIC_NO: ED409501 Parental Anger towards Children: Assessment Issues in Child Maltreatment.\nHecht, Debra B.; And Others, 1996\nABSTRACT: As any parent knows, anger towards children is a natural occurrence of parenting. Since it is important to identify and address some of the emotional issues that underlie child abuse, the role of anger in parenting and in child maltreatment is covered in this paper. An ecological analysis of parental anger is presented, with special emphasis on environmental determinants, such as employment and financial situations, the family environment, and individual factors. The link between parental anger and child physical abuse is presented next, along with a discussion of the parallels between frustration and anger. Since parental anger responses may follow or be intensified by child behavior problems, anger specifically related to child behavior should be an assessment priority. Several assessment instruments are profiled. It is suggested that researchers and clinicians should look more at social cognition and its interplay with emotional arousal, regulation, and interpretation of situations in order to lessen the incidence of physical abuse\n2. Causes for Anger\nTo understand anger, you have to understand where anger comes from and what is its nature. Anger is a feeling of great displeasure and hostility. Everybody from time to time will be displeased but most people work out these problems in a peaceful way. But anger that is uncontrolled and expressed in aggression\u00a0 becomes a major problem. The causes of that anger are usually within the angry person, not in the situation that triggers the anger. Explore the Anger Toolkit, the Anger-page .\nERIC_NO: ED039917, Anger in Children: Causes, Characteristics, and Considerations, Sheviakov, George, 1969\nABSTRACT: The author of this booklet discusses reasons for anger and ways of coping with it. When anger erupts in a classroom, it may be the result of cultural conditions that produce frustration and tension or adult-caused frustrations that could be avoided, such as rigid rules or lack of respect for the child. In discussing the characteristics of anger, the author stresses that anger may not be consciously recognized by the sufferer and that anger is cumulative and may suddenly \"explode.\" The degrees of anger are discussed, and descriptions of anger's physiological effects are given. Guidelines are given for teachers and schools to follow in working with troubled children. Included are case descriptions of two children who were severe classroom problems. The point of view emphasized is that the origins of a child's anger must be understood intellectually to effectively plan strategy needed to help the child. A flexible approach to treatment, involving the child on both the cognitive and emotional level, is urged. A nonjudgmental, patient, and humanitarian approach is stressed in handling anger in children.\n3. Avoidance of Anger\nWatch out for anger triggers, wait to cool down and then decide on a course of action. Consider stopping hostile thoughts, feelings and actions when they deserve no further attention and are not effective. Give yourself time off\u00a0 to cool off. Say to yourself STOP. Avoid over-stimulation from caffeine, sweets, and drugs. Check out Managing Anger.\nERIC_NO: ED329847, A Model for Managing Anger and Conflict, Hamilton, Beatrice, 1991\nABSTRACT: Anger is probably the most misunderstood and least expressed feeling. To understand anger, it is necessary to explore the process. Anger usually follows an experience of frustration, unmet expectations, loss of self-respect, and fear. The next stage seems to be anxiety, which may be interpreted as a disappointment, discomfort, or powerlessness. This anxiety is then immediately changed, usually without recognition, into feelings or actions of power and fight. Finally, relief is felt only after release of the negative energy in the body. The constructive way to deal with anger is to confront the situation. Guidelines for fighting fair include the following: (1) establishing the legitimacy of fighting; (2) dealing with one issue at a time; (3) choosing the arena carefully; (4) avoiding reaction to unintentional remarks; (5) avoiding resolutions that come too soon or too easily; (6) avoiding name calling; (7) avoiding cornering an opponent; (8) agreeing to disagree; (9) focusing on what is wanted rather than why it is wanted; and (10) maintaining a sense of humor. If fair or creative fighting is attempted, then three positive outcomes may result: an effective resolution may be found; everyone involved may maintain a clear sense of personal dignity throughout the conflict; or the relationship may be in no way damaged and may even be enhanced.\n4. Positive Anger Management\nShort-lived controlled anger targeted at a specific object or person may be helpful and healthy. But anger that lasts longer than a few hours easily turns into bitterness that can affect every part of a person's live. That type of anger needs management, reduction and control.\nSome tools are distracting yourself (refocusing on something else), asserting yourself peacefully (making a simple request, describe the misbehavior, remind the other of rules, state the consequences), active listening (listening in silence, then repeating what was said, giving your message, checking if you are understood), increasing your empathy (the other's motives may not be evil), raising your tolerance level (allowinging the other some slack), seeking God's help (praying and studying God's word), and laughing at yourself (about the trivial and unreasonable). At times seeking counsel (mediation, and service to others (working it off) may also be helpful. Explore Anger Websites .\nERIC_NO: ED273895 Treatment of Anger: A Review of the Current Literature. Andersen, Carole Lou, 1985\nABSTRACT: Many psychological and physiological disorders may have some etiology in an unconstructive response to anger. Still others may be exacerbated by repressed or suppressed anger. Anger is often a problem for clients seeking therapy, yet psychologists have little research upon which to develop a viable therapeutic approach. While skills in communication appear to be effective in reducing angry feelings to maintain positive physical and mental health and to enhance interpersonal relationships, these skills seem to be difficult to learn. Four self-report measures have been used primarily in the assessment of anger arousal and expression and in the assessment of the effectiveness of anger management techniques. They are the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory, the Reaction Inventory, the Anger Self-Report, and the Anger Inventory. Several promising theoretical positions have been developed for treatment of maladaptive anger in people. Among these are the behavioral approaches of desensitization and social skills training. Cognitive behavioral techniques used involve an emphasis on some kind of restructuring of thoughts, with Rational-Emotive Therapy and stress inoculation training having been used primarily. Research has indicated that any direct intervention for treatment of maladaptive anger expression is better than none, and a multifaceted training program consisting of desensitization or relaxation training, stress inoculation, and social skills or problem solving training is best.\n5. Personal Peace\nThe result of good mental health and effective anger management is personal peace. The hostile act that brought on your anger can be worked through or forgiven (giving up any revenge, going on with your life).\u00a0 Peace comes when you have a positive attitude, an emotional equilibrium, and self-control over your actions.\nSummary: Dealing with anger requires one to admit his or her wrong convictions, to give up the fear and denial of being wrong, and to bind up the anger wounds with good will and forgiveness. http://www.articles911.com/Anger_Management/\n6.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched an OpenCourseWare (OCW) initiative ten years ago and since that time numerous institutions have implemented a similar program by offering their courses online. And there\u2019s no indication that the increased use of OpenCourseWare is going to decline. What OCW courses provide is an alternative means of informal education for those who do not want to attend a class and a supplemental resource for educators and students. Because you are unable to earn a degree or college credits through completion of OCW classes, it has not been a source of competition for online schools; however, that may change with a pending new initiative.\nWhat is MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)? It is a select group of the school\u2019s undergraduate and graduate classes you can access at no cost. This is different than Open Educational Resources , which are materials from classes such as shared textbooks. MIT provides a disclaimer that states: \u201cOCW is not an MIT education, OCW does not grant degrees or certificates, OCW does not provide access to MIT faculty, and materials may not reflect entire content of the course.\u201d It\u2019s estimated that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s \u201cfree course content has reached 100 million people worldwide, and as U.S. campuses experiment with open class material to varying degrees, MIT hopes to increase OpenCourseWare\u2019s reach to 1 billion learners by 2021.\u201d\nThe OpenCourseWare Consortium was formed as \u201ca gateway to OCW projects and courses for the entire OCW community, fostering the success of the OCW movement and articulating its benefits.\u201d It is a \u201cworldwide community of hundreds of higher education institutions and associated organizations committed to advancing OpenCourseWare and its impact on global education.\u201d The consortium defines OCW as \u201c\u2026free and open digital publication of high quality university-level educational materials,\u201d and \u201cthese materials are organized as courses and often include course planning materials and evaluation tools as well as thematic content.\u201d Through the consortium website there is an advanced search feature that allows you to search for courses by subject and/or by the name of consortium members, and all of the courses are free and easily accessible.\nThe following are examples of institutions offering OpenCourseWare classes:\n1. Open Yale Courses : You have access to a \u201cselection of introductory courses taught by distinguished teachers and scholars at Yale University;\u201d however, users will not receive a \u201ccourse credit, degree, or certificate\u201d upon completion of the classes.\n2. Open.Michigan : Through the University of Michigan website you have access to some of the courses taught at the institution that can be freely used \u201cin your own research, teaching or learning experiences.\u201d There is a disclaimer provided on the website that states \u201cOpen.Michigan is not an accrediting body at U-M and does not grant degrees or certificates nor provide access to U-M faculty.\u201d\n3. Saylor.org : This is a non-profit organization that offers free access to over 200 college-level courses for 13 disciplines. A final exam is required for each course and if a passing grade is earned a certificate of completion can be downloaded. The Saylor Foundation reminds potential users that \u201cbecause we are not accredited, you will not earn a college degree; however, our team of experienced college professors has designed each course so you will be able to achieve the same learning objectives as students enrolled in traditional colleges.\u201d\nConsiderations\nDr. Jason G. Caudill of Carson-Newman College, author of Using OpenCourseWare to Enhance On-Campus Educational Programs , advises institutions to use OCW courses as \u201can aid in course planning, not a substitute for original design and careful development by the instructor delivering the material.\u201d I went through the list of OCW courses to see if I could utilize any of the materials for classes I\u2019ve taught online and on-ground \u2013 and there were a limited number of business administration courses available through the OCW course databases. I chose one course to review and overall, it would not be easy to integrate the course into one of my classes because the lecture notes do not match my course objectives and the wording (key terms and phrases) is different than textbooks and resources I\u2019ve utilized. It seemed to me that the author(s) created the courses for a certain audience with a specific set of learning objectives \u2013 and adapting any of these courses would still require an investment of time.\nWhile the courses are free to access and utilize, there are still costs involved for storing and maintaining them. In OpenCourseware Initiatives and the Challenge of Sustainability , an issue related to finances was discussed and it was noted that \u201coften begun in better economic times, and initially funded by foundations committed to the principle of open educational resources, these efforts now risk being seen as luxuries that are no longer affordable in an era of spending cuts.\u201d The host institution or the institutions responsible for housing and providing staff for these OCW projects have annual operating budgets that can run as high as six- to mid-seven-figures.\nAn advantage of an OpenCourseware class is that its \u201cmain appeal rests on the premise that these course materials will be useful to individuals around the world.\u201d The primary disadvantage is that the \u201cMIT OCW staff admits that much of the site may not be suitable for the average learner.\u201d This is an important aspect based upon my observation of some of the available courses. A casual user of the course (someone who is not in a degree program now) could quickly read through the materials and not fully comprehend the information because they have not had an opportunity to interact with it through class discussions or written assignments.\nThe OCW courses felt to me like we\u2019re going back in time to a period when correspondence courses were popular. For example, Saylor.org describes its courses as self-paced and automated. Prior to online schools, students completed correspondence courses by mail that were self-paced. When first introduced, online schools were criticized for giving the appearance of being automated and that prompted development and implementation of interactive tools. The growth of online institutions changed that perception over time by replicating the on-ground or traditional approach to learning \u2013 through inclusion of class discussions, along with personalized feedback and interactions with an instructor.\nUpcoming Development\nMIT is developing a new, interactive online program, called MITx . With this new program students \u201cwill be able to communicate with their peers through student-to-student discussions, allowing them an opportunity to ask questions or simply brainstorm with others, while also being able to access online laboratories and self-assessments.\u201d It is believed that once MITx is launched in the fall of 2012 it may become a direct competitor with online schools, especially for-profit schools \u2013 due to the interactions it will provide. Students will be able to communicate with each other and an instructor.\nBased upon the information that\u2019s available I do not find that MITx or OCW classes in general will be a competitor for online schools simply because of the limited course offerings for some majors and the lack of academic support. Online schools typically offer extensive resources for students, from an online library to writing services. While there is value in having a platform to share course materials among educators, I remain a supporter of structured online degree programs because they are designed with specific learning goals in mind \u2013 and you will likely have support, resources, and instructors available to guide your progress. It is a trend worth watching this year to see how the final MITx program is structured and if it can compete with online schools.\nWould you utilize an OpenCourseware class?

American Intercontinental University offers individual courses in web design, computer information systems, programming and a few other areas.\nIf you are looking for a single class on a narrow, specialized topic you might have better luck consulting large universities\u2019 online services. If you are looking for a comprehensive course of learning about computer science, you can find one at almost any level of concentration and academic achievement. There are online courses for certification in various areas of computer science that take a period of months.\nCollegiate degrees in computer science and related fields are available online at every level, from an IT associate\u2019s to a doctorate level IT degree. Online degrees generally take less time to achieve than their campus-based counterparts: a bachelor\u2019s degree is usually obtainable in two to three years. The length of time required will be dictated to some extent by the number of transferable college credits you\u2019ve earned. However, online degrees are achieved in less time under any circumstance due to the accelerated methods of study that the online colleges have available.\nCourses for certification status in certain aspects of computer science are available from such schools as CDI College. They specialize in this sort of teaching program in that they have nine choices for study in the area of computer networking alone. Topics of specialization include internet security and network administrator. Their training programs lead to certification for specific specialties. They have five options in the programming analyst area, all focused on the web in some fashion. You can also find online certification courses in specific program languages such as C++ or specific server protocols such as Sun\u2019s Solaris.\nBeyond the training programs, there are a wealth of computer science programs that lead to college degrees. Kaplan University has six associate\u2019s degree programs in computer information systems that would probably take eighteen months or less to complete. Areas of specialization include databases, Java programming, the web and wireless networking.\nKaplan has a similar number of bachelor\u2019s programs in information technology. One of the more intriguing choices at Kaplan is the bachelor\u2019s in IT with a specialization in multimedia and animation, which ought to lead to some imaginative opportunities in web page construction.\nComputer science is one of the most popular areas of study online because so many working professionals need additional education in the field in order to advance in their career. You can find the right combination of courses and course programs to fit your needs with some dedicated click work.\n"}, {"score": 910.61176, "uuid": "76fc5d62-daa0-5621-aa18-92063a4956bf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0505wb-68-14963", "target_hostname": "www.degree.net", "target_uri": "http://www.degree.net/diploma-mills/how-to-prepare-for-your-online-course_201001052312.html", "page_rank": 1.1766212e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "How To Prepare For Your <em>Online</em> <em>Course</em>", "snippet": "<em>Online</em> <em>courses</em> offer several advantages to students who enroll; however, the transformation from regular, traditional learning to learning in a virtual <em>classroom</em> is not always easy.

Given below are some suggestions that will help you better prepare for an online course.\nOnline Course Requirements\nAn online course means you will need a computer and some peripherals. Go through the documentation provided in your online school's website or printed material to find out what all you need. Typically you will need the following items in addition to the computer.\nSpeakers or headphones and a microphone.\nSoftware for reading documents (like Adobe PDFreader).\nSoftware for creating documents (like Microsoft Office or Open Office).\nA printer for having hardcopies of important documents\nMost schools do not require more than the above, but with the increasing popularity of video chat facilities, you may wish to acquire a webcam. Some schools also offer their own download section\u00a0 where you can get all the software that you will need for your online course. It is always a good idea to check for software in the download section of your online school/college's website before buying any.\nStudy Space\nYour computer and study space must not be in a general area of your home. Keep them where traffic is minimal and where you can study without being interrupted. Though you will be studying online, you will still be expected to keep track of important paperwork, so make sure there is adequate space to keep folders and books. Set aside some writing space close by with plenty of papers, pens, and highlighters. If you intend to study from multiple locations, like your home and office, then you may wish to get a backpack to carry all important study related accessories with you. Do not maintain two separate sets, as that might cause confusion when you move between locations.\nYour Virtual Campus\nThe website of your school is your virtual campus; therefore, you must know it thoroughly. Explore the website and go through every link and feature included therein. You need to attain a level of comfort that only comes with prolonged familiarity, so start exploring the website as soon as you have your login credentials. Be a proactive online student; do not wait for the course to begin. You may start even before you have your login details, but it is more important to do so after you have them, as the real options are not visible to guest users on the website.\nCourse Material\nAnother important thing to do when you get your login and password is to order all the books that you will need for your online course. The delivery of books can take more than a week, so make sure you order them in time.\nVirtual Universities\nThe website will also have some important links that are not related to study. These include the Help Desk, Business office, Administrative Office, Student Advisory, Faculty and Department that will be teaching you, and finally, the online library. Visit these links and wherever possible, introduce yourself as a new student and collect as much information as you can. Note that just as in real life, you cannot predict where these offices might be located; so it is in virtual universities and schools. Every website will have a unique design and architecture.\u00a0 If you are familiar with one website's structure, then you will need to go through this exercise again when you enroll in a different online degree program. Every service will have an email contact or a phone number; you must know them so that information can be retrieved quickly when you need it.\nPassword And Login\nThe login and password for your school and class may or may not be the same. Always log in to your class when you receive login credentials to make sure you can enter both. This depends on the Internet security policy implemented by the school. If the login credentials for your class are different, then get them quickly or you will not be able to submit assignments when the time arrives.\nVirtual Classroom\nAs with the general layout of the school website, you will also need to know the layout of your virtual classroom. There will be many links and sections leading to various activities and you must explore them. There will be an email system, discussion board, assignments page, and so on. If there is a link you can click, then click on it and check where it goes and what it does. All online courses are built on what are called Course Management Systems. There is industry standardized software and there is proprietary software, but the core concepts are always the same. What you need to do is understand what to do when a class activity demands it. \"Submit an assignment\" sounds quite straightforward but you should still go through the act of submitting one.\nGet A Copy Of The Syllabus\nYou might already have a copy of the syllabus; if not then get one before classes begin. Know what you are going to be studying for the duration of the course and start getting ready before classes begin. Understand the topics that will be covered, what sort of assignments you will have to do, and what sort of activities you may expect. You will not feel so overwhelmed when you know what is coming next.\nDiscussion Board\nThe discussion board is another place you must visit once you have your login credentials. This is where you may post your introduction and begin acquainting yourself with your classmates and discussing other topics. Through these discussions you will meet other interesting people and make friends. Discussion forums are a great way to get to know the school and your classmates. You can even discuss the syllabus or assignments and help each other out. By staying active in discussion forums you will never feel alone during your online degree experience.\nConclusion\nThis is a new experience so take it easy and give yourself time. The whole point of an online course is to let you study without pressure so there is no point in getting worked up over it. If you have questions then there are always student counselors or professors willing to help you.\nTop Online Colleges\n"}, {"score": 909.81744, "uuid": "f60b5c65-90b7-5c18-aa4a-45d55a4bf09b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1021wb-00-02734", "target_hostname": "www.learnwell.org", "target_uri": "http://www.learnwell.org/anger.htm", "page_rank": 1.2570591e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Anger Management: Building <em>Better</em> Relationships.

Assessment of Anger\nFirst determine the level, source, style and target of your anger. A number of anger measurements are useful for that. Anger has at least 4 levels, namely hidden anger, angry expression, angry words, violence. Keep a Hostility Log in which you journal all the hostile situations you initiated in 5 days. Include in it 6 things, namely the date and time, a short description of the incident, your attitude (thoughts or level of mistrust and cynicism), your emotions that lead to the incident, your behavior resulting from the hostility, and the outcome. Here is another anger test: http://members.tripod.com/kanchanD/ANGER.HTM\nAnger is a reaction to an emotion, not a planned action. The feelings underlying the anger make us feel weak. Anger makes us feel in control. Angry is learned and therefore can be unlearned and replaced with healthier coping. Anger can be a reaction to one event or a response after numerous events. To repress anger and not to deal with it is unhealthy and will inevitably carry negative consequences. To change our angry, we need to understand its cause. If we have seen our parents get angry first and resolve an issue after, we are more likely to use a similar approach. Types of anger are learned. We are more likely to get angry if we are frustrated and feel stressed, if we are tired, if we tend to hold our feelings inside rather than talk them out.\nERIC_NO: ED409501 Parental Anger towards Children: Assessment Issues in Child Maltreatment.\nHecht, Debra B.; And Others, 1996\nABSTRACT: As any parent knows, anger towards children is a natural occurrence of parenting. Since it is important to identify and address some of the emotional issues that underlie child abuse, the role of anger in parenting and in child maltreatment is covered in this paper. An ecological analysis of parental anger is presented, with special emphasis on environmental determinants, such as employment and financial situations, the family environment, and individual factors. The link between parental anger and child physical abuse is presented next, along with a discussion of the parallels between frustration and anger. Since parental anger responses may follow or be intensified by child behavior problems, anger specifically related to child behavior should be an assessment priority. Several assessment instruments are profiled. It is suggested that researchers and clinicians should look more at social cognition and its interplay with emotional arousal, regulation, and interpretation of situations in order to lessen the incidence of physical abuse\n"}, {"score": 909.76154, "uuid": "d9572b00-884b-5100-8281-6521d181a3ac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-00-24503", "target_hostname": "www.annandale.k12.mn.us", "target_uri": "http://www.annandale.k12.mn.us/ittrium/visit/A1x13cfx1x82y1x2300x1x7fy1x2bb6x1x68y1x2bbbx1x68y1x2bbcx1x68y1x2bc8x1x68y1x2d07x1x68", "page_rank": 1.1730393e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Classroom</em> Information", "snippet": "Please let me know if you <em>are</em> interested in volunteering in the <em>classroom</em> or stopping in to be a \u201cmystery\u201d guest reader.

Through this approach, the students will help formulate our classroom rules in hopes they will take ownership for their own rules. When the rules are not followed, the child will \u201ctake a break\u201d as a consequence. If the behaviors were to continue then we will work together to find a logical consequence for that behavior. We will start each day with \u201cMorning Meeting\u201d where the students greet one another, share a message, and participate in a group activity. This is an important time to build trust and friendships\nClassroom Helpers:\nWe will have helpers in our room everyday! We will have a Foster Grandma, Grandma Diane, and Brenda Gregg as our Title one assistant. They will be here to help us out and give extra personal and academic support to the boys and girls. We are so fortunate to have extra help each day!\nCurriculum:\nHoughton-Mifflin Reading: A series with 10 themes focusing on alphabet, letters, sounds/phonics and concepts about print through stories. We will have a list of 18 STAR words that students will need to know by the end of the year and will work with several word families as we visit our 10 themes.\nIn addition to the curriculum we will also have small, flexible and leveled guided reading groups as we get on in the year. We will be doing this during Reader\u2019s Workshop. This will be a time of learning to focus around a mini-lesson.\nWe will be doing a Writer\u2019s Workshop each day as well. I will do a mini-lesson on elements of writing and then students will have an opportunity to apply that skill at their own developmental level.\nTo continue to reinforce our literacy skills, students will participate in center activities most days. These will be hands on literacy activities to be completed individually while working in small groups.\nEveryday Math: Focus is on counting, clocks, measurement, teen numbers, and calculators. Our math time will consist of a lesson and activity and followed most days with an opportunity to do center activities that pertain to kindergarten math concepts.\nThe Great Body Shop: Five Senses, food, family, play and getting sick our health themes.\nNystrom Exploring Where and Why: Me, Family, Friends, on the farm, in town, and animals around the world.\nFoss Science Kits: Trees (weather, seasons)\nSpecialists:\nAll day kindergartens will be going to Art, Music and Phy. Ed. We will be on a 3-day rotation and will rotate through each one. Please make sure that your child wears tennis shoes on our Phy. ed days. Wearing sandals, flip-flops, etc. will make it difficult to participate.\nLibrary:\nOur class will visit the library every Wednesday at 9:45. This year we will be going to the library for a story and library skills with Mrs. O\u2019Brien! Each kinder will be allowed to check out one book each week. You must return your library book in order to check out a new book. Please make sure that your child brings their book back to school by Wednesday each week.\nCommunity Supplies:\nTo help build community, the students will share most of their school supplies instead of having individual supplies. This has been the most effective way of using materials. All students will have access to the same materials. Students\u2019 notebooks, markers and folders will be kept separate for individual use.\nLunch:\nWe will go to lunch around 11:30 this year. Students have approximately 20 minutes to eat. Please take time to explain what the difference is between lunch and snack to your child. This seems silly but is a bit confusing when they are eating both at school. Make sure your child knows that they have a snack and a cold lunch or that they just will have hot lunch. This may ease any anxieties and confusion during the first few days. Lunch account questions should be directed to the school office.\nNoon Play:\nThe children will have noon play each day for 30 minutes after lunch. Please make sure to dress your child according to the weather so that they are comfortable outside for noon play. We go outside daily unless it is raining or below 0 wind chill.\nSnack:\nWe will have a snack break each day. I ask that you send a HEALTHY snack with your child each day. Fruits, vegetables, cheese, granola, crackers or dry cereal are all good options. Small portions work best as we are little and just as excited to play when we are done, as we are to eat. Do not send in candy, as it does not give your child the energy and nutrition needed during the school day. The school provides milk for your child each day at no charge to you. What works best is to send in a bag of snacks labeled snack bag that your child can keep in his/her locker and choose from each day! Let them know to bring you the bag home when it is empty so you can fill in and send it back.\nBirthdays:\nWe will celebrate your child\u2019s birthday or half-birthday during the school year. Your child can bring in a snack to share if they want. Grandma Diane makes special birthday crowns for our celebration. We have 21 students and 3 adults in our room.\nBefore and After School Routines:\nWhen students arrive at school, they will wait on the rug in the front entry. At 8:00 they will be dismissed to the classroom. Please do not drop your child off before 7:50, as there is no supervision before that time. If your child is going to do something other than the usual routine after school, you must send a note with them. Please make sure your child gives me these notes right away in the morning. Without any notification from the parents, I will follow your scheduled daily routine as per the school handbook.\nAbsence/Late Arrival:\nStudents arriving after 8:15 must go to the office and be signed in by a parent. If you are picking your child up at any time except the end of the day, you must come in to the office and sign him or her out with the secretaries. In your child is gone for any reason, please send me a note, email or call the school right away in the morning. Without proper notification, your child\u2019s absence/tardy will be marked unexcused. If you do not let the school know about your child\u2019s absence you will receive a phone call from the school secretary. Be sure to read the student handbook on absences and tardies.\nContact/Email:\nMy email is a little different from the majority of the school because it starts with \u2018nj\u2019 instead of just \u2018n\u2019. njsmith@annandale.k12.mn.us\nFeel free to contact me using email at any time. I check email at school and at home. I will get back to you as quickly as possible, if you don\u2019t hear back from me and you needed to make a pickup change or something like that for the same day, please contact the office. Feel free to call too, you can reach me at 320-274-8218 ext. 1230.\nParent Volunteers:\nPlease let me know if you are interested in volunteering in the classroom or stopping in to be a \u201cmystery\u201d guest reader. We would love your help. I will have a better idea of what our class needs in October once we have been able to establish routines in our classroom.\nHome Connections:\nEach Friday, your child will bring home a Friday Folder with a weekly newsletter and any pertinent information for parents. This folder may also contain practice pages for students to use at home throughout the week. These pages do not need to be returned, but please return the folder on the first day of school the following week. Please check your child\u2019s backpack daily for any time sensitive materials or completed work.\nRazzle Dazzle Reader:\nWe at Bendix Elementary believe that reading is the most important key to success. Therefore we have an at home razzle dazzle reading program in place for all students at Bendix. Each grade level has a different goal to meet for this program. Our goal in kindergarten is that each child will read (be read to at first) 10 books each week. That means that your child needs to read 1.5 books a day to make this goal. A new Razzle Dazzle record sheet will come home each Friday in the Friday Folder. You will use that to record your child\u2019s reading for the following week. Please return completed forms on Monday after each finished week. This starts at the end of September.\nTuition Payments:\nAll payments are handled through the Bendix office. Please see Christy, Anne or Terry during school business hours.\nIf you think that your child may be someone that may need a change of clothes (for accidents) please feel free to send the clothes in a bag labeled with their name or the clothing can stay in the school bag, too.\n\u00a9 2011 - all rights reserved\n"}, {"score": 909.5489, "uuid": "a12e986b-dd14-5806-844b-f049d951f9f7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1106wb-31-19353", "target_hostname": "www.onlineuniversities.com", "target_uri": "http://www.onlineuniversities.com/blog/2011/09/using-social-media-in-the-higher-education-classroom/", "page_rank": 1.2493149e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Using Social Media in the Higher Education <em>Classroom</em> | <em>Online</em> Universities", "snippet": "Social arrangements <em>are</em> made via Facebook and Twitter and parents and friends from home <em>are</em> kept up-to-date on all the college happenings via the same channels.

It is a natural fit for online education , which relies on the use of advanced communication technology to connect instructors and learners. The basic use of these tools can range from simply establishing a Facebook page for the class and posting the course syllabus and assignments, to taking attendance through mandatory, topically-related tweets. On the other hand, it can be as complicated as conducting an entire course via these channels and requiring and facilitating full participation in ways that more closely emulate the types of rich interactions possible in a F2F classroom. Some of the best tools to facilitate classroom communication are:\nNurph \u2013 This tool allows Twitter users to come together for a more formal conversation in a hosted chat room.\nPresent Online Now! \u2013 This site provides a free webinar interface to present any type of content.\nBackNoise \u2013 This back channel tool allows conversations to take place while students are engaged with other tasks.\nLivestream \u2013 This tool allows the creation of live video streams of classroom events with embedded chat features.\nEdmodo \u2013 This site lets users establish a class microblogging network for students where they can post, share and critique each other\u2019s ideas.\nConnecting Beyond the Campus\nWhile a connection between instructor and other students is nice, it does not really take advantage of the power of the World Wide Web. The Internet provides ready access to other learners, experts, and real-world experiences that an individual teacher cannot match. Using Web 2.0 capabilities to connect your students to others who can spark conversation, provide additional insights, or alternative points of view is a great way to engage students at a much deeper level with course content. Some of the tools available to connect your students to the world beyond the classroom are:\nBrainify \u2013 This is a collaborative learning space for college students to share and create their own knowledge built around a library of academically-focused websites.\nClassroom 2.0 \u2013 A site devoted to learning about the use of social media in education. Discuss the topic with practitioners and researchers.\nThe Global Collaborative \u2013 A network of socially-conscious individuals established to understand and solve global problems.\nWetoku \u2013 This online tool allows students to create and share interviews with people from around the world. A great way to meet experts and gain knowledge directly from them.\nBrowzmi \u2013 A collaborative Web browsing tool that utilizes AIM to link learners together in their Internet surfing experiences.\nepals -\u00a0 This site features a \u00a0global community of connected learners. Students can connect with others to share perspectives on a wide variety of issues.\nAs a Research Site\nSocial media is a new and important development in human society and one that is currently wide-open for new research. Engaging students in conducting research in any capacity is both rewarding and educationally speaking, extremely beneficial. Students can undertake their own investigation or collaborate on an instructor led inquiry about the use of social media in society. This type of research may seem best suited to sociology courses, but the proliferation of social networks means that there is a potential research site available for almost any topic: politics, religion, education, medicine, gaming, journalism, etc. There is a social network or social media-related function for groups interested in almost any area students may be interested in. Take advantage of these open avenues for students to conduct research and communicate with real members of a community they are interested in studying. The following tools can be used to find people, rank influencers, locate conversations and themes, assess buzz, and to track changes in online communities:\nGoogle Insights \u2013 This Google function allows researchers to compare search volume patterns by region, category, time and other properties.\nTwellow \u2013 This social site allows Twitter users to search for other users based on topic or interests.\nSamepoint \u2013 This search engine allows researchers to sift through online conversations and track the buzz around topics.\ndelicious \u2013 Built in functions of this popular service allow users to sort bookmarks by popularity.\nSocial Mention \u2013 This social media search engine looks at user-generated content from blogs, comments, news, videos and tweets.\nTechnorati \u2013 A search engine which looks at user-generated media and checks their popularity indices.\nCreating and Sharing Media\nOne serious underrepresentation of social media use in universities, according to the Pearson survey , is that instructors do not require students to use social avenues to create and share their own media or critique that of others. This is a powerful tool and one of the best ways to have students participate in their own knowledge production . Using social media tools such as YouTube, Wikipedia, and blogs to synthesize knowledge and explore their intellectual voices engages students not only with the current topic they are studying, but also helps them to establish lifelong patterns of inquiry and scholarly communication. Some of the multitude of tools available for media production and sharing in the virtual social sphere are:\nWordPress or Blogger \u2013 Use classroom blogs to encourage students to synthesize their knowledge and share it with their peers and the world.\nWikispaces \u2013 A free wiki tool ideally suited for students to create their own entries.\nPodBean or MyPodcast \u2013 These sites provide free capture and hosting services for creating and sharing podcasts on any topic.\nYouTube or Vimeo \u2013 These and other online video hosting sites allow users to capture, edit, publish, comment on, and share videos with the world.\nThese are just a few of the many, many options available to incorporate social media into your classroom. As an online instructor the choices are always at your fingertips and are just a quick search and click away from becoming a significant part of your teaching.\nFacebook Comments\n"}, {"score": 909.29565, "uuid": "fa210429-b0b4-585d-a6ab-873f73edf61b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-05-10260", "target_hostname": "www.onlinedegrees.org", "target_uri": "http://www.onlinedegrees.org/10-reasons-why-online-education-is-better/", "page_rank": 1.1899338e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "10 Reasons Why <em>Online</em> Education is <em>Better</em>", "snippet": "Thinking about an <em>online</em> program to get your degree \u2014 either as a new or a returning student \u2014 but still need some convincing?

Online \u201clectures\u201d often include written notes or video podcasts that you can read or watch on your own time frame during the week \u2014 when you\u2019re really ready for them.\n7. You can take tests in front of the T.V. Or participate in discussion or read lecture notes or study. Wherever your laptop can go, your class can go.\n8. You can \u201cattend\u201d class when you\u2019re ready. Most online courses require students to contribute to participatory discussions or to turn in assignments by a specific deadline (usually weekly), but when you complete the requirements during the week is up to you. So you don\u2019t have to worry about being in class from 10 to 11 a.m. every Monday, for example, but rather, you can have class at any time of the day during the week that suits your schedule. That means greater flexibility for your social life or anything else you want to do.\n9. You can work while you attend school. And we don\u2019t mean a part-time job at the Burger Master that you squeeze in between classes. You can hold a full-time, professional position on any shift. Because of the flexibility of the classes, you can work any time you like and take classes any time you like. Who says you have to be a broke student?\n10. If you have a family, you don\u2019t need to worry about hiring a babysitter. The flexibility of class scheduling allows you to either schedule classes at a time when your child is in school or can spend time with other family members, or allows you to stay home with your child while you study. No need to worry about irresponsible and unreliable sitters anymore.\nIf you haven\u2019t been back to school for a while, you may enjoy these back to school resources as a refresher.\nAll images are courtesy of Chris Magher .\nPosted on 18/03/11 | by maria magher | in Degrees , Education | No Comments \u00bb\nLeave a Reply\nMail (will not be published) (required)\nWebsite\n"}, {"score": 909.0216, "uuid": "869e2a41-da2e-5c9d-ad15-11435ff32fc3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1010wb-24-00140", "target_hostname": "www.onlinecourses.net", "target_uri": "http://www.onlinecourses.net/architecture", "page_rank": 1.2727817e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Free <em>Online</em> Architecture <em>Courses</em> | OnlineCourses.net", "snippet": "This <em>course</em> focuses on development of <em>online</em> spaces as part of an interdependent human environment, including <em>physical</em> architectures, mapped work processes and social&#x2F;political dimensions.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nFree Online Architecture Courses\nGet a headstart in anything from basic theories to niche applications to the history that informs today's designs.\nIf you have any questions about online courses, ask us on our Facebook page.\nAdvanced Seminar: Urban Nature and City Design - MIT\nThis course explores the urban environment as a natural phenomenon, human habitat, medium of expression, and forum for action. The course has several major themes: how ideas of nature influence the way cities are perceived, designed, built, and managed; how natural processes and urban form interact and the consequences for human health and welfare; how planners and designers can shape the urban natural environment. Each student researches and presents a case, either historical or an example of contemporary theory and practice.\nArchitectural Construction and Computation - MIT\nThis class investigates the use of computers in architectural design and construction. It begins with a pre-prepared design computer model, which is used for testing and process investigation in construction. It then explores the process of construction from all sides of the practice: detail design, structural design, and both legal and computational issues.\nArchitectural Design Workshop: Collage - Method and Form - MIT\nThis class investigates the theory, method, and form of collage. It studies not only the historical precedents for collage and their physical attributes, but the psychology and process that plays a part in the making of them. The class was broken into three parts, changing scales and methods each time, to introduce and study the rigor by which decisions were made in relation to the collage. The class was less about the making of art than the study of the processes by which art is made.\nArchitectural Design Workshops: Computational Design for Housing - MIT\nAn intensive nine day remote collaborative workshop involving MIT and Miyagi University in Japan. The objective is to develop a small housing project using shape computation as a design methodology. Students will use and test new interactive software for designing, sharing applications with overseas partners, presenting projects on an Internet workspace, and critiquing design proposals through the web and other advanced digital technologies. Students will be expected to do most of their work in class.\nArchitectural Design, Level I: Perceptions and Processes - MIT\nThis studio explores the notion of in-between by engaging several relationships; the relationship between intervention and perception, between representation and notation and between the fixed and the temporal. Mediating between collective desire and territorial surface, maps filter, create, frame, scale, orient, and project. A map has agency. It is not merely representational but operational, the experience and discursive potential of this process lies in the reciprocity between the representation and the real. It is in-between these specific sets of relationships that this studio positions itself.\nArchitecture Design, Level II: Cuba Studio - MIT\nThis architectural studio will have one main project for the semester: to explore the issues surrounding the redesign of an area in Havana, Cuba. It is a typical area about the size of a Law of Indies block that presently has a mix of housing, work, and shopping, in buildings that need to be replaced and others that need to be rehabilitated. There is also vacant land, and buildings that are unused. Part of the blocks front on the Malecon, the street next to the water. The other edge fronts onto a typical neighborhood. The intention is to study the culture through an understanding of one area of Havana and then design an \"echo\" in architectural form. The design will include public space as well as a mix of buildings: some new, some rehabilitated.\nArchitectural Design, Level II: Material and Tectonic Transformations - MIT\nThis studio is about land, water, and wind and the search for expressing materially and tectonically the relationships between these principle conditions. That is, where the land is primarily about stasis (docking, anchoring and referencing our locus), water's fluidity holds the latent promise of movement and freedom. Movement is activated by wind, allowing for negotiating the relationship between water and land.\nArchitectural Design, Level II: Material Essence - MIT\nThe theme that unites the Level II studios in the fall semester is a focus upon the 'making of architecture and built form' as a tectonic, technical and materially driven endeavor. It is a design investigation that is rooted in a larger culture of materiality and the associated phenomena, but a study of the language and production of built form as an integrated response to the conceptual proposition of the project. The studio will look to works of architecture where the material tectonic and its resultant technology or fabrication become instrumental to the realization of the ideas, in whatever form they may take.\nArchitectural Design, Level II: New Orleans Studio - MIT\nThe project for this studio is to design a demonstration project for a site near the French Quarter in New Orleans. The objectives of the project are the following: to design more intense housing, community, educational and commercial facilities in four to six story buildings, to explore the \"space between\" buildings as a way of designing and shaping objects, to design at three scales - dwelling, cluster and overall, to design dwellings where the owners may be able to help build and gain a skill for employment, and to provide/design facilities that can help the residents to gain education and skills.\nArchitectural Design, Level III: A Student Center for MIT - MIT\nThis studio will investigate the social, programmatic, tectonic and phenomenological performance and character of a student gathering place on the MIT campus. Whether it is simply for socializing or for more specific events, the student gathering place will serve as a refuge from the vigorous educational environment of the Institute, and it will reinforce a critical sense of \"place\" through the almost logical organization of its program. The place will foster a casual discovery of \"being\": a reflection upon the student's own existence based upon participation in group events and an intellectual attitude toward acting. To create a space that inspires, rather than imposes: such a discovery is the foremost challenge of this studio.\nArchitectural Design: Intentions - MIT\nThis is the second undergraduate design studio. It introduces a full range of architectural ideas and issues through drawing exercises, analyses of precedents, and explored design methods. Students will develop design skills by conceptualizing and representing architectural ideas and making aesthetic judgments about building design. Discussions regarding architecture's role in mediating culture, nature and technology will help develop the students' architectural vocabulary.\nArchitecture Studio: Building in Landscapes - MIT\nThis subject introduces skills needed to build within a landscape establishing continuities between the built and natural world. Students learn to build appropriately through analysis of landscape and climate for a chosen site, and to conceptualize design decisions through drawings and models.\nArchitecture Studio: Intentions - MIT\nThis is the second undergraduate design studio. It introduces a full range of architectural ideas and issues through drawing exercises, analyses of precedents, and explored design methods. Students will develop design skills by conceptualizing and representing architectural ideas and making aesthetic judgments about building design. Discussions regarding architecture's role in mediating culture, nature and technology will help develop the students' architectural vocabulary.\nBasic Structural Design - MIT\nThis course provides students with a basic knowledge of structural analysis and design for buildings, bridges and other structures. The course emphasizes the historical development of structural form and the evolution of structural design knowledge, from Gothic cathedrals to long span suspension bridges. Students will investigate the behavior of structural systems and elements through design exercises, case studies, and load testing of models. Students will design structures using timber, masonry, steel, and concrete and will gain an appreciation of the importance of structural design today, with an emphasis on environmental impact of large scale construction.\nBeijing Urban Design Studio - MIT\nThis is the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Urban Design Studio, which is a joint program between the MIT and Tsinghua University Schools of Architecture and Planning. The goal of the studio is to foster international cooperation through the undertaking of a joint urban design and planning initiative in the city of Beijing involving important, often controversial, sites and projects. Since 1995, almost 250 MIT and Tsinghua University students and faculty have participated in this annual studio, making it one of the most successful and enduring international academic programs between China and the U.S.\nBSAD Foundations in the Visual Arts - MIT\nThis class offers a foundation in the visual art practice and its critical analysis for beginning architecture students. Emphasis is on long-range artistic development and its analogies to architectural thinking and practice. Students will learn to communicate ideas and experiences through various two-dimensional, and three-dimensional, and time-based media, including installations, performance and video. Lectures, visiting artist presentations, field trips, and readings supplement studio practice.\nBuilding Technology I: Materials and Construction - MIT\nThis course offers an introduction to the history, theory, and construction of basic structural systems as well as an introduction to energy issues in buildings. It emphasizes basic systematic and elemental behavior, principles of structural behavior, and analysis of individual structural elements and strategies for load carrying. The course also introduces fundamental energy topics including thermodynamics, psychrometrics, and comfort.\nBuilding Technology III: Building Structural Systems - MIT\nThis course addresses advanced structures, exterior envelopes and contemporary production technologies. It continues the exploration of structural elements and systems, and expands to include more complex determinate, indeterminate, long-span and high-rise systems. It covers topics such as reinforced concrete, steel and engineered wood design, and provides an introduction to tensile systems. Lectures also address the contemporary exterior envelope with an emphasis on their performance attributes and advanced manufacturing technologies.\nBuilding Technologies III: Building Structural Systems II - MIT\nThis course addresses advanced topics in structures, exterior envelopes and contemporary production technologies. It continues the exploration of structural elements and systems; expanding to include more complex determinant, indeterminate, long-span and high-rise systems. Some of the topics covered include reinforced concrete, steel and engineered wood design, and an introduction to tensile systems. The contemporary exterior envelope is discussed with an emphasis on the classification of systems, their performance attributes and advanced manufacturing technologies.\nBuilding Technology Laboratory - MIT\nIn this class, concepts of building technology and experimental methods are studied, in class and in lab assignments. Projects vary yearly and have included design and testing of strategies for daylighting, passive heating and cooling, and improved indoor air quality via natural ventilation. Experimental methods focus on measurement and analysis of thermally driven and wind-driven airflows, lighting intensity and glare, and heat flow and thermal storage. Experiments are conducted at model and full scale and are often motivated by ongoing field work in developing countries.\nCase Studies in City Form - MIT\nThis course serves as an introduction to urban form and design, focusing on the physical, historical, and social form of cities. Selected cities are analyzed, drawn, and compared, to develop a working understanding of urban and architectural form. The development of map making and urban representation is discussed, and use of the computer is required. A special focus is placed on the historical development of the selected cities, especially mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth century periods of expansion.\nCityScope: New Orleans - MIT\nDo you want to think about ways to help solve New Orleans' problems? CityScope is a project-based introduction to the contemporary city. \"Problem solving in complex (urban) environments\" is different than \"solving complex problems.\" As a member of a team, you will learn to assess scenarios for the purpose of formulating social, economic and design strategies to provide humane and sustainable solutions.\nComputational Design I: Theory and Applications - MIT\nThis class introduces design as a computational enterprise in which rules are developed to compose and describe architectural and other designs. The class covers topics such as shapes, shape arithmetic, symmetry, spatial relations, shape computations, and shape grammars. It focuses on the application of shape grammars in creative design, and teaches shape grammar fundamentals through in-class, hands-on exercises with abstract shape grammars. The class discusses issues related to practical applications of shape grammars.\nContemporary Architecture and Critical Debate - MIT\nThis class, required of all Master of Architecture students, presents a critical review of works, theories, and polemics in architecture in the aftermath of World War II. The aim is to present a historical understanding of the period, and to develop a meaningful framework to assess contemporary issues in architecture. Special attention will be paid to historiographic questions of how architects construe the terms of their \"present.\"\nDaylighting - MIT\nThis class provides the tools necessary for an efficient integration of daylighting issues in the overall design of a building. The fundamentals of daylighting and electric lighting are introduced and their relevance to design decisions emphasized: benefits and availability of daylight, solar radiation and sun course, photometry, vision and color perception, daylighting metrics, visual and thermal comfort, electric lighting.\nDialogue in Art, Architecture, and Urbanism - MIT\nn this class we will examine how the idea of the city has been \"translated\" by artists, architects, and other diverse disciplines. We will consider how collaborations between artists and architects might provide opportunities for rethinking / redesigning urban spaces. The class will look specifically at planned cities like Brasilia, Las Vegas, Canberra, and Celebration and compare such tabula rasa designs with the redesign of recyclable urban spaces demonstrated in projects such as Ground Zero, Barcelona 2004, and Boston's Rose Kennedy Greenway.\nDigital Design Fabrication - MIT\nThis course will guide graduate students through the process of using rapid prototyping and CAD/CAM devices in a studio environment. The class has a theoretical focus on machine use within the process of design. Each student is expected to have completed one graduate level of design computing with a full understanding of solid modeling in CAD. Students are also expected to have completed at least one graduate design studio.\nDigital Mock-Up Workshop - MIT\nThis is an advanced subject in computer modeling and CAD CAM fabrication, with a focus on building large-scale prototypes and digital mock-ups within a classroom setting. Prototypes and mock-ups are developed with the aid of outside designers, consultants, and fabricators. Field trips and in-depth relationships with building fabricators demonstrate new methods for building design. The class analyzes complex shapes, shape relationships, and curved surfaces fabrication at a macro scale leading to new architectural languages, based on methods of construction.\nDrawings & Numbers: Five Centuries of Digital Design - MIT\nThe aim of this course is to highlight some technical aspects of the classical tradition in architecture that have so far received only sporadic attention. It is well known that quantification has always been an essential component of classical design: proportional systems in particular have been keenly investigated. But the actual technical tools whereby quantitative precision was conceived, represented, transmitted, and implemented in pre-modern architecture remain mostly unexplored. By showing that a dialectical relationship between architectural theory and data-processing technologies was as crucial in the past as it is today, this course hopes to promote a more historically aware understanding of the current computer-induced transformations in architectural design.\nEcologies of Construction - MIT\nEcologies of Construction examines the resource requirements for the making and maintenance of the contemporary built environment. This course introduces the field of industrial ecology as a primary source of concepts and methods in the mapping of material and energy expenditures dedicated to construction activities.\nEcuador Workshop - MIT\nThis is a project to assist in the design, drawing, modeling and hopefully constructing of a small Community Children's Center near Guayaquil, Ecuador. For the last year, Nicki Lehrer, from MIT's Aero/Astro Department, has been organizing efforts to build the project. The goal of the workshop is to provide her with a full fleshed out design for the community center so it can be built in the summer of 2007.\nEmergent Materials II - MIT\nThis course will focus on providing students with the tools needed to practice responsible architecture in a contemporary context. It will familiarize students with the materials currently used in responsible practice, as well as the material properties most relevant to assembly. The course will also introduce students to materials that are untested but hold promise for future usage. Finally, the course will challenge students to refine their understanding of responsible or sustainable design practice by looking at the evolution of those ideas within the field of architecture.\nExperiencing Architecture Studio - MIT\nThis course uses scale models to design environments that orchestrate contrasting material properties and conventional constructional systems to create places that foster specific ways of inhabiting space. It also demonstrates how architecture differs from other forms of design. Intended for students to test aptitude for architectural design and to experience an unfamiliar mode of thought, it's conducted in a studio format, with lectures on architectural theory and history, and structured for students with no previous experience in design.\nForm-Finding and Structural Optimization: Gaudi Workshop - MIT\nInspired by the work of the architect Antoni Gaudi, this research workshop will explore three-dimensional problems in the static equilibrium of structural systems. Through an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and architecture, we will develop design tools for determining the form of three-dimensional structural systems under a variety of loads. The goal of the workshop is to develop real-time design and analysis tools which will be useful to architects and engineers in the form-finding of efficient three-dimensional structural systems.\nFundamentals of Energy in Buildings - MIT\nFundamentals of Energy in Buildings, is an undergraduate class offered in the Department of Architecture, and jointly in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. It provides a first course in thermo-sciences for students primarily interested in architecture and building technology. Throughout the course, the fundamentals important to energy, ventilation, air conditioning and comfort in buildings are introduced.\nFurniture Making - MIT\nFurniture making is in many ways like bridge building, connections holding posts apart with spans to support a deck. Many architects have tried their hand at furniture design, Wright, Mies Van Der Rohe, Aalto, Saarinen, Le Corbusier, and Gerhy. Students will learn traditional woodworking techniques beginning with the use of hand tools, power tools and finally woodworking machines.\nImmaterial Limits: Process and Duration - MIT\nThis studio proposes to engage tectonics as a material process. By exploring transformation, indeterminacy and mutability inherent in material and landscape processes, students will be challenged to engage notions of duration as a design strategy for architecture and urbanism. While the second law of thermodynamics states that the material universe tends toward a state of increasing disorder, architects build and construct in opposition to these forces. Attempting to delay the processes of disorder, decay and collapse, tectonics is often seen as the embodied expression of an arrested moment the finite resolution of the building process. Yet the processes that enable and disable architecture extend beyond any arrested moment.\nInquiry into Computation and Design - MIT\nThis subject explores the varied nature and practice of computation in design. We will view computation and design broadly. Computation will include both work done on the computer (digital computing) and by-hand. Design will include both the process of making designs and artifacts, as well as the designs and artifacts themselves. The aim of the course is to develop a view of computation and design beyond the specifics of techniques and tools, and a critical, self-awareness of our own approaches and metaphors for computation and design.\nInterrogative Design Workshop - MIT\n\"Parrhesia\" was an Athenian right to frank and open speaking, the right that, like the First Amendment, demands a \"fearless speaker\" who must challenge political powers with criticism and unsolicited advice. Can designer and artist respond today to such a democratic call and demand? Is it possible to do so despite the (increasing) restrictions imposed on our liberties today? Can the designer or public artist operate as a proactive \"parrhesiatic\" agent and contribute to the protection, development and dissemination of \"fearless speaking\" in Public Space?\nIntroduction to Building Technology - MIT\nThe course aims at providing a fundamental understanding of the physics related to buildings and to propose an overview of the various issues that have to be adequately combined to offer the occupants a physical, functional and psychological well-being. Students will be guided through the different components, constraints and systems of a work of architecture. These will be examined both independently and in the manner in which they interact and affect one another.\nIntroduction to Design Computing - MIT\nThis course will introduce students to architectural design and computation through the use of computer modeling, rendering and digital fabrication. The course focuses on teaching architectural design with CAD drawing, 3-D modeling, rendering and rapid prototyping. Students will be required to build computer models that will lead to a full package of architectural explorations with computers. Each semester we will explore the design process of a particular building type and building material.\nIntroduction to Design Inquiry - MIT\nWe see design as processes located in individuals and groups, shaped by the formation and experience of each individual and by the characteristics of the groups that play a role in the design process. People construct the worlds they inhabit out of what they know and have experienced. So also does the designer, but the designer\u2019s worlds must be possible for others to inhabit and, therefore, to construct. Indeed the success of a design depends in large part on the degree to which these constructive processes yield similar results.\nIntroduction to Integrated Design - MIT\nDuring this course, we will be exploring basic questions of architecture through several short design exercises. Working with many different media, students will discover the interrelationship of architecture and its related disciplines, such as structures, sustainability, architectural history and the visual arts. Each problem will focus on one of these disciplines and one exploration and presentation technique.\nIntroduction to Urban Design and Development - MIT\nThis course examines the evolving structure of cities and the way that cities, suburbs, and metropolitan areas can be designed and developed. Boston and other American cities are studied to see how physical, social, political and economic forces interact to shape and reshape cities over time.\nMedia Technology and City Design and Development - MIT\nThis workshop explores the potential of media technology and the Internet to enhance communication and transform city design and community development in inner-city neighborhoods. The class introduces a variety of methods for describing or representing a place and its residents, for simulating actions and changes, for presenting visions of the future, and for engaging multiple actors in the process of envisioning change and guiding action.\nNatural Light in Design - MIT\nToday, computer-based simulations are becoming increasingly popular, especially when daylighting and energy conservation are amongst the key goals for a project. This two-week workshop will expose participants to the current daylighting simulation models and beyond, by introducing realistic and dynamic assessment methods through hands-on exercises and application to a design project.\nPower of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development - MIT\nThis workshop provides an introduction to urban environmental design and explores the potential of information technology and the Internet to transform public education, city design, and community development in inner-city neighborhoods. Integration of comprehensive (\"top-down\") and grassroots (\"bottom-up\") approaches to design and planning is a major theme.\nProperty Rights in Transition - MIT\nThis course examines the theories and policy debates over who can own real property, how to communicate and enforce property rights, and the range of liberties that they confer. It explores alternative economic, political, and sociological perspectives of property rights and their policy and planning implications.\nReligious Architecture and Islamic Cultures - MIT\nThis course introduces the history of Islamic cultures through their most vibrant material signs: the religious architecture that spans fourteen centuries and three continents \u2014 Asia, Africa, and Europe. The course presents Islamic architecture both as a historical tradition and as a cultural catalyst that influenced and was influenced by the civilizations with which it came in contact.\nResearch Topics in Architecture: Citizen-Centered Design of Open Governance Systems - MIT\nIn this seminar, students will design and perfect a digital environment to house the activities of large-scale organizations of people making bottom-up decisions, such as with citizen-government affairs, voting corporate shareholders or voting members of global non-profits and labor unions. A working Open Source prototype created last semester will be used as the starting point, featuring collaborative filtering and electronic agent technology pioneered at the Media Lab. This course focuses on development of online spaces as part of an interdependent human environment, including physical architectures, mapped work processes and social/political dimensions.\nSelected Topics in Architecture: Architecture from 1750 to the Present - MIT\nThis class is a general study of modern architecture as a response to important technological, cultural, environmental, aesthetic, and theoretical challenges after the European Enlightenment. It focuses on the theoretical, historiographic, and design approaches to architectural problems encountered in the age of industrial and post-industrial expansion across the globe, with specific attention to the dominance of European modernism in setting the agenda for the discourse of a global modernity at large. It explores modern architectural history through thematic exposition rather than as a simple chronological succession of ideas.\nSite and Infrastructure Systems Planning - MIT\nThis class is a general study of modern architecture as a response to important technological, cultural, environmental, aesthetic, and theoretical challenges after the European Enlightenment. It focuses on the theoretical, historiographic, and design approaches to architectural problems encountered in the age of industrial and post-industrial expansion across the globe, with specific attention to the dominance of European modernism in setting the agenda for the discourse of a global modernity at large. It explores modern architectural history through thematic exposition rather than as a simple chronological succession of ideas.\nSpecial Problems in Architectural Design - MIT\nThis class focuses on representation tools used by architects during the design process and attempts to discuss the relationship they develop with the object of design. Representation plays a key role in architectural design, not only as a medium of conveying and narrating a determined meaning or a preconceived idea, but also as a code of creating new meaning, while the medium seeks to establish a relationship with itself. In this sense, mediums of representation, as external parameters to the design process, are not neutral tools of translating an idea into its concrete form. They are neither authentic means of creativity, nor vapid carriers of an idea. Therefore, an important aspect in issues of meaning is how the architect manipulates the play of translating a concept to its concrete version, through the use of a medium of representation.\nSpecial Problems in Architectural Studies - MIT\nThe course investigates e-Learning systems from a business, policy, technical and legal perspective. The issues presented will be tackled by discussion of the design and structure of the various example systems. The connection between information architectures and the physical workplace of the users will also be examined. The course will be comprised of readings, discussions, guest speakers and group design sessions. Laboratory sessions will be focused on implementation tools and opportunities to create one's own working prototypes. Students will learn to describe information architectures using the Unified Modeling Language (used to specify, design and structure web applications) and XML (to designate meaningful content).\nSustainable Design and Technology Research Workshop - MIT\nThis workshop investigates the current state of sustainability in regards to architecture, from the level of the tectonic detail to the urban environment. Current research and case studies will be investigated, and students will propose their own solutions as part of the final project.\nThe Architecture of Cairo - MIT\nCairo is the quintessential Islamic city. Founded in 634 at the strategic head of the Nile Delta, the city evolved from an Islamic military outpost to the seat of the ambitious Fatimid caliphate which flourished between the 10th and 12th century. Its most spectacular age, however, was the Mamluk period (1250-1517), when it became the uncontested center of a resurgent Islam and acquired an architectural character that symbolized the image of the Islamic city for centuries to come.\nThe Once and Future City - MIT\nWhat is a city? What shapes it? How does its history influence future development? How do physical form and institutions vary from city to city and how are these differences significant? How are cities changing and what is their future? This course will explore these and other questions, with emphasis upon twentieth-century American cities. A major focus will be on the physical form of cities - from downtown and inner-city to suburb and edge city - and the processes that shape them.\nThe Production of Space: Art, Architecture and Urbanism in Dialogue - MIT\nThis seminar engages in the notion of space from various points of departure. The goal is first of all to engage in the term and secondly to examine possibilities of art, architecture within urban settings in order to produce what is your interpretation of space.\nThe Space Between Workshop - MIT\nThis workshop explores how designers might become as sensitive to space as they are to objects. Through a number of projects and precedent studies, architectural design is studied in relation to the Space Between. The design process is studied in reverse, considering space first and objects second. This is not to imply that objects are not important, but rather that space is equally important.\nTheory and Method in the Study of Architecture and Art - MIT\nThe discipline of art history periodically surges into \"crisis.\" The demise of formalism as a guiding tenet, or connoisseurial appreciation as a general guide, plunged the field into confusion during the 1970s when the battle raged over \"social histories of art\" or \"revisionism;\" in the late 1990s the debate was staged between \"visual studies\" versus \"normative art history.\" The course takes this confusion as itself worthy of study, and seeks to make available some of the new methodologies that have emerged over the past two decades. The ultimate goal is to bring students closer to discovering their own individual methods and voices as writers of art historical prose.\nTheory of City Form - MIT\nTheories about cities and the form that settlements should take will be discussed. Attempts will be made at a distinction between descriptive and normative theory, by examining examples of various theories of city form over time. The class will concentrate on the origins of the modern city and theories about its emerging form, including the transformation of the nineteenth-century city and its organization. It analyzes current issues of city form in relation to city making, social structure, and physical design.\nThinking About Architecture: In History and at Present - MIT\nThe course will portray the history of theory neither as the history of architectural theory exclusively, nor as a series of prepackaged static pronouncements, but as part of a broader set of issues with an active history that must be continually probed and queried. The sequence of topics will not be absolutely predetermined, but some of the primary issues that will be addressed are: pedagogy, professionalism, nature, modernity and the Enlightenment. Classroom discussions and debates are intended to demonstrate differences of opinion and enhance awareness of the consequences that these differences had in specific historical contexts.\nUrban Design Policy and Action - MIT\nGovernments at every level assume a measure of responsibility for seeking good design. Some of that responsibility is exercised directly\u2014through the design and construction of government buildings, for example. But most changes to our environments are neither designed nor built by governments. Rather, they are the result of the actions and investments of private individuals, institutions, corporations, joint ventures, or private/public collaborations. Yet, the actions of all of these actors are affected by the design policies of government and the interventions that are undertaken to implement those policies. In this advanced graduate-level seminar we will explore new ways of thinking about urban design policy in an attempt to better understand just what government does\u2014and what it can do effectively\u2014in the realm of design policy.\nUrban Design Politics - MIT\nThis is a seminar about the ways that urban design contributes to the distribution of political power and resources in cities. \"Design,\" in this view, is not some value-neutral aesthetic applied to efforts at urban development but is, instead, an integral part of the motives driving that development. The class investigates the nature of the relations between built form and political purposes through close examination of a wide variety of situations where public and private sector design commissions and planning processes have been clearly motivated by political pressures, as well as situations where the political assumptions have remained more tacit. We will explore cases from both developed and developing countries.\nUrban Design Skills: Observing, Interpreting, and Representing the City - MIT\nThe course is designed to be an introduction to methods of analyzing, evaluating, and recording the urban environment first hand.

If a student would like to take an eighth course they may request to take an elective course via the FCPS Online Campus at their own expense. All requests must be pre-approved by the Director of Student Services .\nWhere can I find information about math or computer science placement testing?\nFor information about the placement testing for math and computer science courses, please visit the Math/CS website or contact the Math/CS Division Manager .\nWhat are the humanities options for rising 12th graders?\nClick here to learn more about the humanities options for rising 12th graders\nWhy do 9th graders not take a social studies course?\nStudents at Thomas Jefferson do not take a required history course in their freshman year, since they are required to take a technology course as part of IBET in the slot usually reserved for social studies. As a result, students have the opportunity to choose two semester electives over the course of their TJ education to complete their fourth required social studies credit. Students fare better in these courses after they have some exposure to the skills and rigor required for a high school-level survey social studies course. Therefore, students begin taking these courses either concurrently with World History and Geography 2 in sophomore year, or once that course has been completed.\nWhat are the curricular requirements for students to participate in Marching Band (aka Marching Colonials)?\nTo participate in TJMC you must be a member of the curricular instrumental program (this may include orchestra students at the director's discretion). The exceptions to this rule are as follows:\nColor Guard members do not need to be a member of the curricular program at any time.\nNon-curricular instruments (bass guitar, synthesizer, etc - may be from outside the program at the directors discretion)\nOnce you have completed one year of curricular band (whether you marched that year or not) you are allowed one season of TJMC where you are not in the curricular band.\nNo instrumental member may be in TJMC if they have not previously been in a curricular program, or are not currently enrolled.\nComputer Science (click to expand/collapse)\n"}]]}
