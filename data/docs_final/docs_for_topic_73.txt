This is an extremely simple process. \"Regular coffee\" usually means an 8 ounce cup of American coffee with a teaspoon of sugar, and a small amount of milk or cream mixed in.\nEspresso can be made with the same coffee beans, and they can be roasted in the same way as for American coffee, although sometimes superior coffee blends - mostly Arabica - are used (because the resulting drink is more concentrated, and the flavor of inferior coffee will be harder to ignore), and sometimes darker roasts are used in espresso for a more intense flavor.\nBut espresso can be made using the very same coffee and the very same roast. However for espresso, the coffee must be ground finer than what is necessary for American coffee. This is because of the brewing technique. What makes the beverage an \"espresso\" is the special brewing technique. And the special brewing technique is why we require a special \"espresso machine.\" Although (arguably) espresso can be made in a pot on the stove, the result is inferior, and is not recommended.\nFor espresso, the coffee grounds are compressed into a dense \"puck\" of coffee, and hot water (about 195-200 degrees Fahrenheit, but not boiling) is forced through the puck under high pressure (between 9 and 15 bars), to produce an extraction which we call \"espresso.\" The extraction should take at least 25 seconds (to allow sufficient time for the water to be in contact with the coffee), but it should not take more than 30 seconds. The grind needs to be fine enough to create a dense puck so that the pressure can be maintained during the extraction. An espresso machine maintains the water at the right temperature, and controls the pressure and the duration of the extraction. This cannot be accomplished on the stove.\nThe resulting extraction, espresso, has a much more intense flavor than regular coffee. This is why espresso cups are tiny. The normal serving of espresso is about an ounce and a half - the same as a shot. A 2.5 ounce serving is called a double serving, or a doppio (which is Italian for \"double\"). Milk or cream is never poured into espresso (except when making other drinks, which are no longer called \"espresso\"), although espresso can be sweetened with sugar if desired.\nCappuccino and Latte are drinks made with espresso and milk. The distinction is that in cappuccino, the milk is \"frothed\" (using the steam wand that is part of any espresso machine) into a \"microfoam\" that is about twice the volume of the original milk. In latte, the milk is merely \"steamed\" (heated, with the result being hot milk with a small head of froth) using the same steam wand, but a different technique. For frothing, the milk is converted to a \"microfoam.\" The microbubbles in the foam are formed by forcing hot air into the tightly-knit \"fabric\" created by the protein molecules in milk. So ironically, skim milk, being higher in protein, will produce a more voluminous foam than whole milk. For latte, the goal is not to create that much foam, so any type of milk works.\nFor cappuccino, we start with equal portions of espresso and milk. The milk is then \"frothed\" (in a special frothing pitcher) into a microfoam that is roughly double the original volume of the milk. The microfoam is then poured over the espresso. (If the espresso is poured into the microfoam, then the drink is called a \"latte macchiato.\")\nFor latte, we start with twice as much milk as espresso. The milk is then heated (but not frothed) to 150-160 degrees Fahrenheit (but not hotter) using the steam wand. The hot milk and espresso are then poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam had formed in the steaming process is poured over the top of the latte. Sometimes, the foam is poured artistically to create fancy designs on top of the drink.\nOptionally, powdered or shaved chocolate and/or cinnamon can be sprinkled on top of either drink.

The high pressure and the short brewing time prevent the extraction of bitter oils and release less caffeine than other brewing methods. The perfect temperature for brewing espresso is between 190\u00b0F to 195\u00b0F with an extraction time of 25-30 seconds.\nWhen the grinding, the tamping and the pressure brewing all come together in the right combination your espresso will always feature a foamy layer on top, called \"crema\". The crema traps the fine aromatics and the light gaseous flavors that register on the palate. It keeps the flavors, which would otherwise escape, locked in. The crema is the hallmark of a well prepared espresso.\nOften people are confused about the differences between espresso, cappuccino and latte. Espresso is the base for most specialty caf\u00e9 beverages. Frothed milk is added to espresso to make a cappuccino and steamed milk is added to espresso to make a latte. Various other flavorings can be added to customize these beverages into a wide variety of your favorite coffeehouse drinks. Click here to learn how to prepare your favorite gourmet coffee beverages: Espresso Based Beverage Recipes (PDF)\nIntroduction to Espresso Machines\nCapresso offers two different brewing methods for espresso; steam and pump.\nSteam espresso machines boil the water until steam is produced. The steam creates pressure to force the very hot water through the coffee grounds. Even though some pressure is produced using a steam espresso machine, the pressure is not high enough nor is it consistent enough to produce a true crema like you achieve with pump espresso machines. Although the crema is not favorable on steam espresso machines, the fact that they come equipped with steam wands makes them perfect for preparing cappuccinos and lattes where the espresso?s taste is softened with milk. The main benefit of a steam espresso machine is they are affordable and great for beginners to espresso.\nPump espresso machines use a more precise heating system called a thermoblock to heat the water to the exact temperature for perfect espresso extraction which is between 190\u00b0F to 195\u00b0F. The internal pump forces water through the thermoblock at high pressure. While traveling through the thermoblock the water is heated to the proper espresso brewing temperature. The high pressure forced through the tightly packed coffee is what produces the crema on top of the espresso. To produce a lasting crema on top of your espresso the water should pass through the coffee at approximately 7 to 9 bars of pressure. All Capresso pump espresso machines have a capacity of 15 or more bars of pressure which indicates the overall capacity of pressure, not the actual brewing pressure.\nTo learn more about espresso and espresso machines click here: Espresso Facts (PDF)\n"}, {"score": 1543.3695, "uuid": "9cc3b334-4200-5149-9d7a-6ce30ea464da", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1117wb-30-20999", "target_hostname": "www.2basnob.com", "target_uri": "http://www.2basnob.com/coffee-home.html", "page_rank": 2.0525093e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>Coffee</em> <em>and</em> <em>Espresso</em> Guide Explaining How to be a Gourmet <em>Coffee</em>", "snippet": "Never go to Starbucks again <em>and</em> just order <em>the</em> same old thing because you&#x27;re not sure of <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> a <em>cappuccino</em> <em>and</em> a <em>latte</em> (not to mention a macchiato or an Americano).

People want to taste coffee in different ways, but not all are aware of the various brewing techniques of preparing this mysterious beverage. It is just a matter of educating people to realise that culinarywise, coffee is up there in terms of food.\" As our fascination and understanding of coffee ascends, experts are looking for new ways to excite and enhance the consumer experience with this intense brown fluid.\nKnow your coffees\nIt can be daunting to walk into a cafe and pick from the long list of coffees on the menu.\nWe tell you the difference between a latte and an au lait, and how a cappuccino differs from an Americano.\nAmericano: A single shot of espresso with about 30 ml of hot water added to the mix. The name for this coffee drink stemmed from an insult to 'uncouth' Americans, who weren't up to drinking full espressos.\nEspresso: Strong black coffee made by forcing steam through ground coffee beans.\nBlack coffee: A drip brew, percolated or French press style coffee served straight, with no milk.\nCafe latte: Essentially, a single shot of espresso in steamed (not frothed) milk. The ratio of milk to coffee should be about 3:1\nCafe au lait: Similar to Caffe Latte, except that an au lait is made with brewed coffee instead of espresso. Additionally, the ratio of milk to coffee is 1:1, making for a much less intense taste.\nCappuccino : Usually equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and frothed milk, often with cinnamon or flaked chocolate sprinkled on top.\nDry cappuccino: A regular cappuccino, only with a smaller amount of foam, and no steamed milk at all.\nCafe macchiato: A shot of espresso with steamed milk added. The ratio of coffee to milk is approximately 4:1.\nHammerhead: A real caffeine fix, this drink consists of a shot of espresso in a regular-sized coffee cup, which is then filled with drip coffee. Also known as a 'shot in the dark'.\nDouble or double shot: Just as it sounds, this is two shots of espresso mixed in with the regular amount of additional ingredients. So, for example, if you were going to make a double hammerhead, you would put two shots of espresso into a coffee cup, and fill it with the drip blend, rather than the usual single espresso shot.\nEspresso con panna: Your basic standard espresso with a shot of whipped cream on top.\nFrappe: Originally a cold espresso, it has more recently been prepared putting 1-2 teaspoons of instant coffee with sugar, water and ice. The brew is placed in a long glass with ice, and milk if you like, turning it into a big coffee milkshake.\nIndian (Madras) filter coffee: Indian filter coffee is made from rough ground, dark-roasted coffee Arabica or Peaberry beans. It's drip-brewed for several hours in a traditional metal coffee filter before being served. The ratio of coffee to milk is usually 3:1.\nInstant coffee: These grounds have usually been freeze-dried and turned into soluble powder or coffee granules. Irish coffee: A coffee spiked with Irish whiskey, with cream on top. Cafe mocha: This popular drink is basically a cappuccino or latte with chocolate syrup added to the mix.\nRecipe: Mixed mocha\nHave your classic mocha and white chocolate too. This recipe mixes white and regular chocolate to create a creamy, chocolaty treat.\nIngredients:\n1/2 tbsp white chocolate syrup\n1/2 tbsp chocolate syrup\n1 tbsp whipped cream (optional)\nDirections:\n- Pour milk into a steaming pitcher and heat to 65 to 70 degrees Celsius using the steaming wand.\n- Measure the white chocolate and chocolate syrup into a large coffee mug.\n- Brew espresso then add to mug.\n- Pour the steamed milk into the mug, using a spoon to hold back the foam.\n- Top with whipped cream.\nBrew the perfect cup\n- Buy coffee in whole bean form when you can and keep it in an airtight container. Buying a one-week supply is ideal. Contrary to popular belief, coffee beans and grounds should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature to maintain their best flavour.\n- To brew coffee, use fresh water free of any odd tastes or odours. It's 98 per cent of every cup of coffee, you know.\n- Ideally, grind your coffee beans just before brewing. If you're using pre-ground, that's okay, too. The faster your brew cycle, the finer you should grind the beans. A good rule of thumb is to use a fine grind (20-25 seconds in a blade grinder) for vacuum pots and one-cup cones, a drip grind (15 seconds) for most drip brewers and a coarse grind (10 seconds) for plunger pots and cold water extractors.\n- Use about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for each \u00be cup of water that will be poured through them, no matter how much you're brewing.\n- For the best flavour, drink coffee within about 30 minutes of brewing.\nHi !\n"}, {"score": 1493.9491, "uuid": "2e011657-0e81-5da4-9891-128fb3c1c522", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1312wb-78-00541", "target_hostname": "www.coffee-machine-reviews.com", "target_uri": "http://www.coffee-machine-reviews.com/721/mr-coffee-ecm21-4-shot-espresso-machine-and-8-cup-coffeemaker-combo-black/", "page_rank": 1.185082e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Coffee</em> ECM21 4-Shot <em>Espresso</em> Machine <em>and</em> 8-Cup Coffeemaker Combo, Black", "snippet": "You can have fun serving <em>Espresso</em>, <em>Cappuccinos</em> <em>and</em> <em>Lattes</em> to your guest while conveniently being able to also make regular black <em>coffee</em>.

Perhaps something I say here will provide some clues that will be of assistance. And, if anyone has any additional clues for me, feel free to email me (mike at this domain).\nThis is my first espresso-brewing work area. The countertop is granite, and the espresso machine sat out far enough that steam wasn't really a problem for the cabinets above it. I kept all my little tools, as well as the roasted and unroasted coffee beans, in the drawers below. I've moved twice since that photo was taken, but all of my setups have been similarly laid out.\nMy main equipment consists of the Rancilio Rocky grinder, the Rancilio Silvia espresso machine, and the Hearthware iRoast 2 roaster. The iRoast 2 is new, as of May 2008 (replacing the 2.5-year-old iRoast 1, mainly to get the ability to retain programs through power outages). I bought the Rocky and Silvia back in December 2000, based on the recommendation of Mark Prince, and I've never regretted buying either.\nI purchased the Rocky, the Silvia, and my first two roasters, from 1st Line Equipment, LLC , and have received excellent technical support on the few occassions when I needed it. I bought the iRoast 2 from Sweet Maria's . Sweet Maria's has already provided wonderful support for that product.\nThere has been a lot to learn, but the results are well worth the effort. I started out with a couple of inexpensive espresso machines and matching grinders, purchasing roasted beans at the grocery store. With that setup, I never did figure out how to steam milk, so I ended up just heating my milk in the microwave. Although I used at least enough milk for the result to qualify as a latte, the coffee was bitter enought that I used at least eight level teaspoons of sugar per cup.\nAfter \"meeting\" Mark Prince on the rec.photo.digital newsgroup, I started reading everything on his CoffeeKid Web site. It took about a year to convince myself that I should spend the big bucks and go for espresso ecstacy. Mark's site really is the place to go to get lots of details and learn the vocabulary. One of the articles on this site that I strongly recommend is the one on \" The Basics of Ethical Coffees \", by Becky Herndon. I feel that those of us who enjoy coffee enough to spend hundreds of dollars on equipment should not hesitate to support both deserving coffee growers and the ecologies of the countries in which coffee is grown.\nMark also hosts the CoffeeGeek site, which includes detailed user reviews of coffees and equipment (espresso machines, coffee brewers of all kinds, grinders, even tampers), as well as a variety of articles on related subjects.\nIn addition to depending on Mark's guidance, I purchased David C. Schomer's Espresso Coffee: Professional Techniques, which provided a tremendous amount of detail about how to produce a great cup of espresso. Even though the book is directed at professionals, it contains lots of useful info, including a detailed analysis of how the whole process works. Schomer runs the informative Lucidcaf\u00e9 Web site, as well.\nAll my espresso-making techniques come from Prince and Schomer, so I haven't tried to repeat all the details that they provide. I just want to give some other details that might help another beginner.\nMy main goal has been to get a cappuccino with no detectable bitterness. At first, I didn't really think that it was possible, but now I succeed at least 85-percent of the time. As a result, I've also reduced the amount of sugar to two level teaspoons per cup, and am on the verge of reducing that even further.\nOne somewhat unfortunate result of my success is that I often have trouble enjoying a cappuccino at a restaurant, because they just don't come up to my new standards. But I guess I can live with that.\nBack to top.\n..........\nAbove are a couple of brushes that I use, a tamper, a holder for the portafilter, and a little sliver of wood, carved from a wooden chopstick, that I use to get the ground coffee out of the grooves in the filter after the first tamping.\nThe portafilter holder is actually a little tartar sauce dish that my granddaughter stole from some fast food joint. I use it because my portafilter has a single spout, so it won't sit flat for tamping. The picture on the right shows how I use it. You can see that I used to use the doser lid under my original double-spout portafilter, to keep it off the granite, and it has become scatched up, and actually has coffee embedded in it.\nI prefer the single-spout portafilter. I seem to get a better result with it--and it's absolutely necessary for pulling a single straight espresso. I combine it with a La Marzocco double-shot filter, rather than the original Rancilio filter. I'm told that the La Marzocco filter holds about two grams more than the Rancilio filter.\nI bought the larger brush; the tamper; a steaming pitcher; a thermometer; espresso, cappuccino, and latte cups and saucers; and shot glasses from Espresso Supply, Inc .\nBack to top.\nThis is the scale that I use to weigh my coffee beans both for roasting and for grinding, the A&D HL-400 from Precision Weighing Balances .\nIt measures in tenths of a gram, which seems to be the average weight of a single roasted bean. I notice that lots of folks use scales that measure in grams, which could lead to a difference of as many as ten beans from one batch to the next of roasted coffee. That seems like a lot to me. This particular scale is not cheap, but it seemed silly to spend something like US$750 on the other equipment, and then balk at $110 (including shipping) for an accurate scale.\n..........\nHere are some beans (Moka Kadir blend, from Sweet Maria's ), being weighed for roasting. I always roast 140.0 grams of beans (just under a cup). Post-roast weight may be from 10% to 15% lighter. That may not seem like a very large fluctuation, but it does seem to have a practical effect on how much coffee is needed for brewing. It may be that the difference in the degree of roasting also affects how finely the beans grind at the same setting--and thus how tightly they tamp. I also like Sweet Maria's Espresso Monkey blend, but not as much as the Moka Kadir. Espresso Monkey seems to produce a more consistent roast from bean to bean, and to require a somewhat shorter roasting time than Moka Kadir. (The beans in the bag appear much darker than than they really were, by the way.)\u00a0 Sweet Maria's has a vast selection of green beans, and Tom's descriptions are extremely thorough. I've never needed to look anywhere else for my green beans.\nThe Sweet Maria's site is also a good place to find lots of info about coffee and coffee roasting . The folks who run this site are very nice people, by the way, and they care a lot about the small coffee producers all over the world.\nI have used anywhere from 17.0 to 19.5 grams of beans in the La Marzocco double-shot filter, depending on the degree of roast. The longer the beans are roasted, the lighter (in weight, not color) they get--due to water loss, I presume. This means that the darker roasts produce a slightly larger volume of ground coffee per gram. I'm still experimenting to find what works best for different degrees of roast, but when in doubt I just go with 18.2 grams.\nBack to top.\n..........\nWhen I lived in Salinas, CA, I did my roasting out on the patio whenever the weather permitted--which was most of the time. The above photo shows my first roaster, the Hearthware Precision, which began acting up after 4.5 years and went to a friend.\nIn Califonia and, later, Texas, I had ranges with exhaust fans, so I was able to roast on my stove top, stacking a couple of pots to get the top of the roaster as close to the exhaust fan as possible. My North Carolina home doesn't include an exhaust fan, so I'm roasting out in the garage at present.\nI try to follow the degree-of-roast recommendations that come with all of the green beans from Sweet Maria's. I've recently added a thermocouple and digital thermometer combo to the iRoast 2. I hope to get pictures up some day, but you can see the gadgets at Sweet Maria's . It's a fairly easy process, and I've been very happy with the results, so far. Frankly, I've never had much success hearing the first and second cracks. The Hearthwares have all been much too loud. Also, color can vary a lot among coffee varieties. So, the thermometer seems to add a degree of consistency to my roasting experiments that they never had before.\nThe iRoast cooling cycle does a good enough job that I no longer dump the beans into a colander for additional cooling, as I did with the Precision. I just pour them out onto a kitchen countertop, fan them a bit, and bag them up.\nI store the roasted beans in a Ziploc bag. By shaking the beans to the bottom and rolling the bag up before sealing it, I find that I can squeeze out as much air as is possible without using a vacuum device of some kind.\nI'm the only cappuccino drinker in my family, and very few of my friends drink coffee at all, so I normally roast once every two or three days, and drink anywhere from one to three cups a day.\nLike the Precision, the iRoast is somewhat sensitive both to the line voltage and to the ambient temperature. I once made the mistake of plugging the Precision into a very long extension cord and, instead of the normal 8 min. to 8 min. 45 sec. at a setting of about 5.5, it took over 10 min. 30 sec. to get even close to the color I like, and the result tasted terrible. I've also had very different roast times with the roaster in the kitchen or in my Salinas garage office. With my current setup, in my North Carolina garage, the ambient temperature varies quite a bit between winter and summer. I'm strongly considering building an exhaust hood indoors to help reduce that factor.\nBack to top.\n..........\nI removed the aluminum cover from the doser blades in the Rocky. Frankly, the doser seems completely worthless. This is especially true because I grind just enough for a single cup, so the doser doesn't fill up. Also, the vanes leave quite a bit of coffee behind.\n..........\nThe channel between the bean hopper and the doser is normally full of grounds after I finish grinding. First I scrape out what I can, using the little wooden chopstick sliver, then I use a Japanese paint brush with a cut-off handle to get out the rest of the grounds.\nI use a larger brush to actually move the grounds around to where they fall into the portafilter. I normally move the contents of the first two divisions first, smooth them out a bit with my finger, and then move the rest out. When I'm finished, there are no grounds left in the doser. My goal is to grind a precise amount of coffee, and to use every bit of it. I feel that this produces the most consistent results.\nMy constant use of the brush to move the doser vanes around seems to have caused the doser lever to become disconnected, as it no longer works.\nBack to top.\n..........\nOn the left, the pour is just starting. On the right, it's well underway. I seem to get a pretty good amount of crema with my current combination of techniques.\nI try for the ideal of having the coffee start coming out of the spout about 8 seconds after I flip the switch, and having it go on for about another 16 seconds. However, I have gotten to the point that I can judge the amount in the cup pretty accurately, so I'm not so dependent on my stopwatch as I used to be. After leaving the Rocky set to 0 for well over a year, I've finally started setting it to -1 for darker roasts and to -2 for lighter roasts, and I'm very happy with the results. The area I live in doesn't seem to produce enough of a variety in the atmospheric humidity to require constantly readjusting the grind.\nThe worst results come when the grind and tamp haven't worked together, and the coffee comes streaming out within four or five seconds. This tends to happen when I don't grind quite enough beans for a particular roast, so that the tamper hits the inside of the filter before the coffee is thoroughly packed.\nAnother factor with the Silivia is that the water temperature doesn't seem to get quite hot enough, even after being left on for over 30 minutes. For a while, I turned on the steam switch just before I started weighing out the beans. By the time they were ground and tamped, the temperature was much closer to what's needed for the best results. However, I decided to experiment with timing, and believe that I get a better result if I wait until just before start brushing the ground coffee into the filter. If I get distracted and forget to do this pre-heating, the coffee seems to flow through more quickly, the color is lighter, and the flavor seems weaker. However, the amount of crema produced seems to be inversely proportional to the length of time the steam switch is turned on before pulling the shot--the hotter the water, the less crema. I'm sure there's a happy middle ground, somewhere.\nBack to top.\n..........\nI use a small (16 oz.) stainless steel pitcher for steaming. I fill it about halfway--to just above the bottom of the spout.\n..........\nFirst, I bleed the steam boiler into a large cup, getting the steam fairly dry.\nNext, I steam until the milk almost doubles in volume. These photos were all taken holding the camera in my right hand, which is the one I normally use to do everything, so the pictures are not quite accurate.\nThe ideal result is bubbles that are really too small to be seen. The attainability of this ideal varies with the milk. I use regular vitamin D milk, but as the only serious milk user in my family, I find that as I approach the end of a gallon bottle, it gets harder and harder to get that really fine foam. Forgetting to turn on the steam switch early enough can also cause a problem with just not having a strong enough stream of steam.\nBack to top.\n..........\nAs soon as I finish steaming, I pour the milk into the cappuccino cup, and I then immediately clean off the steamer wand. First I use a wet, but not dripping, sponge cloth to get off all the drying milk. Then, I run some steam into a cup to ensure that there is no milk clogging the wand. Finally, I give it another quick wipe. The cup already has a little water in it, as I always use it to bleed the boiler before steaming.\nBecause the steam valve is metal, it expands when hot and shrinks when cold. As a result, it may drip a bit after cooling off, so I leave the cup sitting under it all the time, and try to remember to tighten it up a bit later--at least when I turn on the machine again.\nNext, I run steam into the large cup for a quick count of ten. The cup is large enough that it fits right under the opening and catches all the steam, so I haven't scalded myself--yet. This cleans off some of the loose grounds that have gotten on the shower head. All this cleaning takes no more than half a minute, but it makes cleaning up later much easier.\nI go ahead and drink my cappuccino before doing a more thorough clean-up.\nBack to top.\n..........\nOn the left, most of the steamed milk has been poured into the espresso. I like to put my sugar into the cup before pulling the shot, then stir a bit as I pour in the steamed milk, so that the sugar is completely dissolved by the time the cup is full.\nOn the right, a few dollops of white foam have been spooned out of what's left in the steaming pitcher, and dropped onto the top of the cappuccino.\n..........\nOn the left is the result of dragging the handle of a spoon through the foam to create a leaf-like pattern.\nOn the right is a different pattern, created by dropping the white foam in the center, then dragging out three spiral arms.\nThe decorations don't add anything to the taste, but they do give you something to look at as you drink. (By the way, I really hate an over-filled cup, because I don't like coffee in my saucer.)\nBack to top.\nCOFFEE ROCKS!!!\nUnfortunately, in this case \"rocks\" is a noun. After more than 20 months without noting any problems in this area, I got a 20-pound bag of Moka Kadir that contained a few bean-sized rock chips. Fortunately, I normally sit and watch my coffee as it roasts, so\u00a0 during the first roasting from this batch, as the beans darkened, I noticed that there seemed to be a bean that was whiter than any of the others. When the roasting was complete, I watched the beans carefully as I poured them into the collander. Sure enough, there was a little chip of grayish rock. I looked carefully, but didn't find any more. However, I was even more attentive (paranoid) during the next roasting, and found two more little pebbles. These were a bit darker, and I might easily have missed them if I hadn't already had the experience of spotting that first light-colored one.\nI have also found pebbles in some Yemeni Mocca Raimi beans. What I suspect is that the Yemeni coffees have so many irregular beans that it's more difficult for the processors to catch all the rock chips--Moka Kadir does contain some Yemeni beans. Now I check before and after roasting each batch, looking especially for unusually dark objects before roasting and for unusually light objects after roasting, and I also look carefully after weighing a batch of beans for grinding. I don't think the Rocky would like those little rocks. So far, I have not found any rocks in any non-Yemeni coffees.\nBelow are some typical green coffee beans from Monkey blend. Note that they are all pretty regular in shape, and look obviously bean-like.\nBelow are some odd-shaped beans picked out from a batch of Yemeni Mocca Raimi. You can see that many aren't readily identifiable as coffee beans at all. Often, I can only be sure that one of these little bean chips is coffee by feeling it (green beans have a sort of waxy feel), or by rubbing it on a plate to see if it is abrasive.\nBelow are some rock chips that I have removed from Moka Kadir and Yemeni Mocca Raimi beans over a couple of months--usually a couple per roaster-load.\nIt's not hard to see why the occasional pebble gets through in a batch of Yemeni beans. (Remember that these shots are blown up quite large, so the details of the rocks are much more visible than they would be in real life.) The Sweet Maria's site on Yemeni coffees explains the cause of this small problem.\nIt's a bit of a hassle to check for rocks every time, but I really like the taste that's added by the Yemeni beans, so I'm willing to put up with it. What I do now is:\n1. Spread the green beens on a kitchen counter and rake a dozen or so into a container, scanning for angular shapes and for darker-than-normal objects.\n2. After roasting, I repeat the process, but concentrate on lighter-than-normal objects, since beans will darken when roasted, but rocks will not.\nBack to top.\nIn order to keep track of some of the variables involved in the roasting/dosing/brewing process, I began keeping a coffee log. It includes information on the blend, roasting time, pre-roasting weight, post-roasting weight, weight of ground beans, grinder setting, and results. I use iDataTM 3 , a little database application that I wrote, to keep the log. Here's a sample record from the Mac version. (This shows the Mac version. An older, simpler version is also available for Windows.)\n"}, {"score": 1245.9392, "uuid": "6ed6e0b7-f013-5dcb-b33f-4e9603981305", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000tw-35-21135", "target_hostname": "theshot.coffeeratings.com", "target_uri": "http://theshot.coffeeratings.com/2010/07/", "page_rank": 1.5255222e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "2010 July | <em>Espresso</em> News <em>and</em> Reviews - TheShot.coffeeratings.com", "snippet": "A good place to go for a shot, <em>and</em> even a pretty good <em>cappuccino</em> (which is more like a caff\u00e8 <em>latte</em>) \u2014 but not too much else.

Located inside the newly-art-conscious Old Biscuit Mill , this small space is a pristine, stark black-&-white-themed coffee lab that exudes meticulous organization. The Old Biscuit Mill is known in town for Cape Town\u2019s original gourmet food market (and hipster Mecca) that it hosts each Saturday \u2014 giving Espresso Lab Microroasters a little bit of the small-operation, gourmet-public-market-based origins familiar to the Bay Area\u2019s Blue Bottle Coffee .\nThe periodic table of the chemical elements features heavily in the highly consistent theme of this roaster/caf\u00e9. It shows in the elemental-looking coffee drink menu printed on the white tile walls (those \u201catomic weights\u201d in the photo are actually prices in South African Rands), through to the labeled chem-lab-looking buckets of unroasted green beans, and all the way to the company T-shirts packaged in silver ziploc bags labeled with the \u201celement\u201d Ts for T-shirt.\nOpening a little over a year ago, they have three internal benches for seating plus a couple of outdoor patio tables. In back is a black & white Diedrich IR-7 roaster. In front they offer Hario Buono kettle/V60 drip coffee \u2014 their \u201cArtisinal Brew\u201d (Ab). Renato, co-owner with Helene, noted how the locals still haven\u2019t made a leap to filter coffee just yet . However, he is assisting in the opening of a pour-over bar (with Espresso Lab Microroasters\u2019 coffee ) in Stellenbosch \u2014 part of Cape Town\u2019s famed nearby winelands and their associated fine dining establishments. (Stellenbosch is very much akin to the Napa Valley when compared to Cape Town\u2019s San Francisco.)\nAlthough the pour-over uptake may be slow at this location, there\u2019s plenty of espresso to be had from their two-group La Marzocco GB/5, where you have the choice of an espresso blend or (on the day\u2019s visit) a single-origin Kenya. The Kenya, Gichatha-ini from the Gikanda Farmers Co-Operative Society, won the SCAA\u2019s Best of Kenya. Cup of Excellence still doesn\u2019t exist in Africa outside of Rwanda.\nTheir Esp008 espresso blend (rated here) uses 40% Serra do Bon\u00e9 Brazil as a base, 40% Puente Ecol\u00f3gico Tarraz\u00fa Costa Rica for the midrange, and 20% Guji Ethiopia for brightness and \u201cwildness\u201d. Their espresso blends vary mostly by different African varietals for that last 20%, and they emphasize changes in blending ratios \u2014 rather than using additional microlot farms or roasting the coffees differently for different blends or uses.\nThe Esp008 espresso blend shot (R14, or about $2 US) is dense without being too syrupy \u2014 with a textured dark-to-medium-brown crema and an upfront sweetness that\u2019s not too off-putting. Still, its citric bite on top of an herbal background makes for a uniquely layered espresso flavor \u2014 one that Renato says is influenced by the lighter roasts of his Oslo, Norway coffee upbringing combined with his Portuguese roots and what Africa adds to the cup. Renato\u2019s Norwegian influences include former WBC champ, Tim Wendelboe , and it shows in the lighter roasting styles and the feel of this space.\nTheir shot of single-origin Kenya (also used for their \u201cArtisinal Brew\u201d pour-over) was super bright with a pleasant floral and citric base \u2014 but without being a brightness bomb. They also offer something they call a cortado, which is pretty much the same as an American Gilbraltar out of a Gibraltar glass. And for milk-frothing, they produce rather exquisite latte art with fine surface bubbles. This is a fine and somewhat unique example of what South African espresso has to offer.\n"}, {"score": 1186.7177, "uuid": "b6b190aa-f9ac-5de5-9b6a-c7cee0e12cf1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000tw-35-21108", "target_hostname": "theshot.coffeeratings.com", "target_uri": "http://theshot.coffeeratings.com/2007/03/", "page_rank": 1.525322e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "2007 March | <em>Espresso</em> News <em>and</em> Reviews - TheShot.coffeeratings.com", "snippet": "<em>And</em> yet despite <em>the</em> world of <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> fresh <em>coffee</em> beans <em>and</em> not, Consumer Reports concluded with much love for <em>the</em> Nespresso.

The place carries a bicycling theme, which suits the many bicyclists who pass along Arguello on a daily basis. It\u2019s also reflected in the bicycle-themed artwork on their red walls.

It has the potent flavor of some smoke and herbal pungency with a strong sweetness at the bottom of the cup.\nFor milk-based drinks, their microfoaming techinique is good \u2014 producing decent microfoam heart latte art.

Tipping is not expected when you buy a cup of coffee (whether standing at the bar, or sitting at a table). If it\u2019s the proprietor who is serving you, which is often the case in small cafes it can also be taken as an insult.\ncasalba\u2019s last blog post.. Tavignano\nI\u2019ve never been told it\u2019s offensive (some places actually do have tip jars that I\u2019ve seen), but no, I don\u2019t tip either.\nSusan & GG\n02.20.2009\nOh my Lord I hope not. Have been watching this the last few years from afar in DC. I worked briefly at my corner Starbucks in January 2000. I had to go to their coffee college (sigh\u2026except I did met some really nice people) & they were talking about Italy. I was the only one in the regional office for the training that had any Italian experience beyond going to Rome for a week. I really did laugh out loud when they talked about their planned expansion. They might get the UK, I said, but Italy? I really didn\u2019t think the Italians would give in, especially with the Slow Food movement so strong. I do know that not one of my many Italian friends & acquaintances will give in, no matter what. They are adamant & I believe them. As for me, Starbucks is on the corner & the other places that are independents are just \u201cthat much\u201d too far for a quick cup. But really, I only drop in to get the New York Times when it\u2019s been swiped (again). And to say hi to some really great people who\u2019ve helped me with Darfur events. (They work there.) I make my coffee at home, on the top of the stove, just like I was taught in Naples:)\nhave a great weekend, all\nciao-meow, Susan & Giulia, la gattina\nSusan & GG\u2019s last blog post.. Marrakesh Tea Time\nSounds like you have a nice mix of things going on there; I have to admit, I still rather enjoy big ole cups of coffee too; needless to say I make them at home\nGennaro @ Enduring Wanderlust\n02.20.2009\nLove the Italian cafe experience. Especially the cafes filled with locals of a smaller town chatting away. It was a visit to an Italian cafe by Howard Schultz that, apparently, started Starbucks.\nGennaro @ Enduring Wanderlust\u2019s last blog post.. Venice Carnival: Masks And Malvasia\nSo funny that Starbucks emerged from an Italian bar\u2026wow, huh?!\nKim B.\n02.20.2009\nRagazza and Gennaro are right, Schultz was inspired by caf\u00e9 in Italy. And yes Starbucks has made big inroads here in France (46 shops at last count, I believe). But, as someone else pointed out, that\u2019s because the French don\u2019t make good coffee (as my Italian husband will attest).\nI work with a sometimes REALLY cranky Irish lady at a bookstore here in Paris. Inevitably, tourists come in to ask us where is the Louvre, where is the nearest internet caf\u00e9, where is the nearest Starbucks. One day someone came in looking for Starbucks and my colleague just started fuming. WHY do these people come to Paris and go to Starbucks?!! The shame, the shame, etc. I pointed out that most of the clients in my neighborhood Starbucks are the local (French) teenagers, and the place is always packed, and that while we Anglo-Saxons may love France for its caf\u00e9 *culture*, French *coffee* itself is nothing to write home about!!!\nSo, I can\u2019t imagine Starbucks in Italy, but I think it\u2019s here to stay in France. And not just for American tourists. (For the record, I\u2019m not a coffee drinker and maybe get one of those frou frou coffee drinks 2 or 3 times a year, so it\u2019s not really my thing.)\nI also like how in Italy (and in France) at the bar they automatically give you the little glass of water to accompany your coffee.\nKim B.\u2019s last blog post.. Cooking Up A Project\nThanks for the description of coffee in France\u2026your coworker (and job!) sounds fun\nHere we don\u2019t automatically get water everywhere, but it is quite common\u2013and very much appreciated!\nanna l'americana\n02.21.2009\nOMG Arlene, there is a Pizza Hut in Rome? I thought armageddon had arrived the day they opened that first McDs at Piazza di Spagna (the one at the Pantheon almost put me in my grave!) but PIZZA HUT?\n(See Shelley\u2019s At Home in Rome \u2013 reallyrome.com \u2013 post the other day on the new Pizza Hut ad where I was absolutely sure that no Italian had ever heard of Pizza Hut)\nSay it ain\u2019t so! You must go there immediately and report back on your blog (see, free topic!).\nAs to Starbucks, Michelle. I don\u2019t know. After my last trip to Rome where I saw heat-\u2019n-eat frozen pre-sauced spaghetti carbonara at a supermarket off of Largo Argentina, I knew that all the old standards were gone and Italy is now raising a generation of kids that will be grow up on fast food and won\u2019t remember nonna\u2019s cooking. Just like us. So why wouldn\u2019t a Starbucks succeed in a gastronomic void such as the one now being created in Italy?\nanna l\u2019americana\u2019s last blog post.. Cryptic Missives\u2026\u2026\nDefinitely more ready made stuff even in small town Italy, although I have to say the quality is rather excellent in the stuff I\u2019ve tried\u2026although we haven\u2019t tried any pre-made pasta.

Blech!\nIce Tea For Me\n02.21.2009\nI\u2019ll admit it I\u2019m a huge Starbuck\u2019s drinker, all my friends know they can\u2019t go wrong giving me a Starbuck\u2019s Gift Card.\nThat being said I am totally against Starbuck\u2019s being in Italy nor would I enter one. Having a caffe\u2019 in Italy isn\u2019t just about the steamy liquid gold but the experience, history, and passion Italians have for their beloved bean. Anyone visitng Italy would be crazy not to embrace the culture and caffe\u2019 and step up to the bar to order and drink a cup, Italian style.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, that will be me in line at the first Starbuck\u2019s on my trip home.\nHi Michelle, stop by my blog and enter my drawing celebrating my blogs 1st anniversary and 100th post.\nIce Tea For Me\u2019s last blog post.. celebrate & giveaway\nWill do!

Never will. But then I don\u2019t get Cafe Americana or percolated coffee either. Why would you want to burn coffee???? Only the Italians really know how to do coffee best. And then anyone who mimics the Italian style. After that my preference is Turkish/Greek/Arabic coffee \u2013 completely different of course, but boy does it have some kick! And then there\u2019s the Arabic coffee with cardomom and cloves, and Indian Chai\u2026 the authentic stuff! So why, with so many wonderful ways to drink coffee around the world \u2013 all of them easy to learn how to make \u2013 would people buy Starbucks? I really don\u2019t get it.\nlara dunston\u2019s last blog post..

There is no coffee like Italian coffee. Punto.\nI am sure if Starbucks would come, just like McDonalds, they would have a degree of success. Not because of their taste, but because of the culture they bring with them.\nSad cheap Americanism.\nPeter\u2019s last blog post.. Turning CO2 pollution into fuel\nIndeed, Peter\njmisgro\n02.22.2009\nLast time I went to Starbucks (I have gone maybe 3 times) the coffee was cold! Yuck! I don\u2019t even buy their beans.

For me, when I am sipping my espresso or cappaccino I like to have a few moments to just relax and chat with a friend, and use a ceramic mug instead of a to go cup. Our world is too busy as it is \u2013 but I don\u2019t budge on this daily necessity for myself.

Thanks for stopping by\nJean-Pierre\n02.22.2009\nI love Italian style coffee (being that I am Italian), and I love Canadian/American style drip coffee with cream (being that I am Canadian).

We hope the following information and guidance will help you decide on the best coffee machine solution for you:\nThe Traditional Way\nThe 2 Step Way\nThe Fully Automatic Way\nThis requires know-how as this method of preparation is entirely handmade. It takes all the barista\u2019s skills to transform the Espresso and the milk/milk foam into a coffee speciality. Leaving plenty of scope for versatility and creativity. This method makes a better Cappuccino/Latte after a little practice.\nHere the coffee and the Espresso are prepared fully automatically at the touch of a button, guaranteeing consistent quality. The milk for it's part is prepared separately, either by hand or by using an Autosteam wand. So even the less proficient can achieve that special barista effect of handmade quality.\nHere everything is fully automatic: the grinding, the extraction and the dispensing. At the single touch of a button the machine whisks up a speciality drink from freshly ground coffee beans, with a choice of milk/milk foam, chocolate or flavouring.\nWhat's the difference between a Traditional Coffee Machine\u00a0and a\u00a0Bean to Cup Coffee Machine?\nTraditional Espresso Machines\nAvailable in 1, 2, 3 and 4 group machines options\u00a0(a group is the number of\u00a0group handles in which coffee is dispensed). A group handle can be a single or double dispense, which enables you to\u00a0make either one or two shots of coffee dependent on the amount of coffee placed into the handle (usually around 7 or 14 grams).\u00a0 Semi and fully automatic (semi-automatic is where you control the dose of coffee and turn it off when you have enough, fully automatic means that the buttons have a pre-set and the machine stops by itself). These machines usually feature either one or two steam arms for frothing/steaming milk, and one or two hot water outlets. Automatic machines are much more popular.\nWhen you purchase a traditional machine package, they\u00a0will usually consist of the following:\n\u2022 A coffee grinder\n\u2022 Knock-out drawer or box, enabling you to \u201cknock-out\u201d the used extracted coffee grounds.\n\u2022 Barista kit which includes items such as a frothing jug, thermometer, pallet knife, chocolate shaker and an espresso shot glass etc.\n\u2022 Water filter kit\u00a0which is connected to a mains cold water feed to prevent build up of lime scale inside the boiler and on the element. This is important!\nIdeally, you will also need to provide a mains waste connection. The size of machine depends on the size of establishment or how busy you think you will be. The most common one by far is a 2 group fully automatic machine, but some smaller sites will have 1 and larger establishments may have 3 or 4.\nThese machines are very much about theatre and indeed they are for show as making coffee is very much an art and good barista training is extremely important and becoming skilled at understanding and making good coffee takes time and practice as it is very easy to make a bad coffee. Prices can vary from around \u00a31,000 to \u00a37,000. Make sure that the machine you choose is new and fully warranted, including barista training\u00a0on installation\u00a0and a good support service. The great thing about traditional machines is that there are no major moving parts so less to go wrong.\nBean to Cup Machines\nA bean to cup machine does exactly what it says! The fresh coffee beans are placed inside the machine and on the press of a button the machine automatically grinds the beans and pours both coffee and milk into your cup.\nBean to cup machines, such as Jura and Franke\u00a0coffee machines, are quick and easy, and make quality fresh coffee at the touch of a button. What you need to remember with this type of system is that there are a lot of moving parts so more to potentially go wrong and there is need for daily cleaning which has to be adhered to otherwise your great coffee won\u2019t be so great the following day!\nThis type of system is ideal for a pub restaurant where staff training can sometimes be a problem; it is also great for convenience stores or petrol stations where a take away coffee station may be required. Some smaller machines require very little installation or training and can be tank fed, so no need for plumbing. These machines will also usually feature some form of de-scale cycle instead of a water filter to prevent scale build-up. It usually takes between 30 and 50 seconds from pressing the button to filling the cup, depending on the cup size and type of drink selection. Some of the higher volume machines can produce two milk based drinks at once, while most will make two black coffees at once, an essential feature for some very busy sites.\nAs time has passed, even the bean to cup machine has developed, and can now be found to use various combinations which feature fresh beans, fresh milk or an instant/granulated milk, instant hot chocolate and instant coffee.\nThese various machines are designed to produce anything from 50 cups per day to over 500 per day. The cost of these can vary from under \u00a31500 to well over \u00a310000, so it is important you make the correct choice.\nIn Summary \u2013 Traditional Espresso Machines versus Bean to Cup\nThe traditional espresso machine without doubt are for those who want the theatricality of coffee making. The advantage is that they make great coffee, so long as those making it are fully trained. A combination of machine and thorough training can produce the true Italian coffee experience.\nBean to cup machines are quick, easy and require very little staff training. The machines will roughly produce the same coffee each and every time the buttons are pressed, whether it be\u00a0twice or\u00a0100 times, but remember, they have to be looked after and cleaned on a daily basis or problems will arise very quickly.\nBean to Cup Coffee Machines :\nEasy to use, one touch, push button cappuccino coffee machines using fresh milk and espresso coffee beans.\nOur product range includes Jura Impressa, Franke and Gaggia coffee machines and we supply both commercial systems and domestic coffee makers.

(At least before sampling it.) Given the thousands of good, bad, and mediocre espresso shots we\u2019ve reviewed over the years, we have definitely noticed some patterns worth sharing.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve recognized the value of shorthand rules. Back in the 1980s, I once (famously, in my circles) observed that the ghetto status of your neighborhood can be surmised by the fast food chicken chain nearby. (In short, Church\u2019s Chicken = \u201cwear Kevlar\u201d.) Earlier this month, there were a couple of coffee-related posts from coffee professionals that inspired us to dust off this idea:\nDetecting a Great Coffee Shop with the CoffeeMeister \u2013 Slashfood\nBut while coffee professionals know their establishments and their industry favorites best, few have subjected themselves to the horrors of many a bad espresso bar from a consumer perspective. Not that we at CoffeeRatings.com have a taste-bud death wish. But we\u2019ve developed a sort of sixth sense about what to expect just by walking into a coffeehouse and having a look around. This post is an attempt to articulate both the positive and negative cues we get when entering a new establishment.\nSome suggested rules are more obvious \u2014 like the wine enthusiast\u2019s equivalent of \u201cavoid wine that comes in a box.\u201d Other rules are more subtle or outright unusual. For example, as a news story today had it, if the aroma from the coffee machine forces your plane to make an emergency landing , you might consider tea.\nEncouraging signs of decent coffee ahead\nIn no particular order\u2026\nThey roast their own. Score extra points if they date-stamp their roasted beans for retail sale.\nThey bother with latte art. Latte art is more gimmick than a sign of quality per se (sorry, Aussies). But it\u2019s almost unheard of to find a place that bothers with latte art and yet makes a lousy cappuccino.\nA La Marzocco machine. Oh, sure, there are plenty of other great espresso machines out there. And there are places that can make great espresso from the most modest equipment choices. But shelling out the bucks for a La Marzocco is typically reserved for those who believe it will actually make a difference for them.\nThey offer more than one kind of bean for espresso. This is a rare find. But when they do, they expect you to notice that the espresso there isn\u2019t just some generic, nameless commodity shot out of a soda gun. Many other establishments think more like Homer Simpson\u2019s tour of the Duff Beer factory , where a single spigot fills Duff, Duff Light, and Duff Dry.\nThey serve a glass of water on the side. Despite the American obsession with the Big Gulp\n, espresso should not quench your thirst. Better espresso can often be found at places that don\u2019t expect it to.\nThey take time to make it. You could have a really new, or really slow, barista. Or they could be a little bit of a perfectionist about what they\u2019re doing. We never encourage our baristi to rush the job.\nCleanliness is next to decent espresso. If the staff keeps their work areas clean, there are better chances that they clean their equipment of rancid coffee oil build-up \u2014 and that they keep their equipment properly tuned and maintained.\nSigns of when to run \u2014 don\u2019t walk \u2014 away\nNow for the cues when you know things are about to get ugly. Call it coffee\u2019s homage to Waiter Rant\u2019s \u201cSigns An Establishment Isn\u2019t Going to Deliver the Service You Expect\u201d .\nThe roar and/or whine of poorly steamed milk. This is one of those cases where their handling of milk can translate to their handling of coffee. And milk that is steamed in the pitcher to the scalding sounds of a 747 takeoff or the squeal of a dentist\u2019s drill is a major red flag.\nA superautomatic espresso machine. Superautomatic machines almost never produce an espresso better than \u201cpalatable\u201d. Hello, Starbucks .\nThe barista is wearing a company-issue hat or cap. One sure-fire way to non-verbally tell a customer, \u201cHow may I massacre your order?\u201d is to require them to dress like fast food employees.\nThey use a two-group La Spaziale 3000 espresso machine. Ouch. Do we really have that much against La Spaziale ? They honestly make some good equipment, and a few caf\u00e9s are quite capable with them. But in the Bay Area, the two-group La Spaziale 3000 is the machine of choice (namely: they\u2019re inexpensive) among caf\u00e9s looking to skimp and save a few bucks.\nAmerica\u2019s Best Coffee. Or Peerless coffee, should they admit it. The most common combination of the cheap-and-careless caf\u00e9 is the two-group La Spaziale 3000 with America\u2019s Best Coffee beans. A close second is Peerless coffee \u2014 which we\u2019ve also found to be the coffee most likely for employees to say it\u2019s Illy in an attempt to make up something that sounds better. Of course, almost as bad (it varies) is the caf\u00e9 where the employees have no idea whose beans they serve. But the pattern here seems to be this: the more self-aggrandizing the coffee brand name, the worse the coffee.\nPortafilter handles are left cooling on the drip tray. This is often the kiss of death: a caf\u00e9 that knows nothing about the importance of stable temperature control, and they could care less.\nServed with a lemon rind on the side. You\u2019d be surprised how many restaurants still do this. Why? We don\u2019t know, because it\u2019s like a neon sign that says, \u201cPrepare to spew.\u201d\nPaper cups are the only option. There are times where even we want a coffee \u201cto go\u201d. But those conditions are so sub-par. For a caf\u00e9 to serve their espresso only in paper cups, you may as well be greeted by a fiberglass clown head with a speakerphone in his throat at the drive-thru entrance. If someone\u2019s idea of quality and class is the stemware at a four-year-old\u2019s birthday party, we emphasize the \u201cgo\u201d part of \u201cto go\u201d.\nFlavored coffees on the menu. Or the word \u201cgourmet\u201d. In some parts of the country, and rare corners of the Bay Area, the 1980s are still alive and well and some people are still selling chocolate macadamia nut flavored coffee. If a caf\u00e9 sells coffee that sounds more like a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s , you\u2019d be better off looking for ice cream. Same goes if they use the word \u201cgourmet\u201d in their branding \u2014 a word that has since become affiliated only with the mass-produced packaged foods that line the aisles of Wal-Mart, marked for quick sale to their morbidly obese loyal customers.\nWe really need to stop here before we are overcome with snarkiness poisoning.\n"}, {"score": 1121.3582, "uuid": "837afac3-409f-56a1-9891-9acc85006de1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1902wb-85-10415", "target_hostname": "theshot.coffeeratings.com", "target_uri": "http://theshot.coffeeratings.com/category/fair-trade/", "page_rank": 1.669489e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Fair Trade | <em>Espresso</em> News <em>and</em> Reviews - TheShot.coffeeratings.com", "snippet": "Not to mention cost of living <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> caf\u00e9 locations.

The panel included James Freeman , of Blue Bottle Coffee , Eileen Hassi, of Ritual Coffee Roasters , and an unusually quiet Jeremy Tooker, of Four Barrel Coffee .\nMuch like the title of its associated Web page, the radio program played out like your typical coffee innovator/\u201d third wave \u201c/bleeding-edge routine that we\u2019ve become accustomed to over the past decade. While a bit heavy on the Coffee 101 \u2014 particularly when callers asked common FAQ-type questions that have been answered on the Internet 20,000 times over already \u2014 KQED produced a good program overall.\nSome of the more interesting comments included Eileen Hassi stating that \u201cSan Francisco has better coffee than any other city in the world\u201d \u2014 with the only potential exception being Oslo, Norway. We\u2019d like to think so, and there\u2019s a bit of evidence to back that up.\nJames Freeman noted Italy\u2019s \u201cindustrialized system of near-universal adequacy,\u201d which is a different but accurate way of summing up our long-held beliefs that outstanding coffee in Italy is almost as hard to find as unacceptable coffee. Other covered topics included coffeehouses eliminating WiFi , Berkeley\u2019s Caffe Mediterraneum inventing the latte , the Gibraltar , and even James Freeman designating home roasting as coffee\u2019s \u201cgeeky lunatic fringe.\u201d\nThe rumors of home coffee roasting\u2019s meteoric rise have been greatly exaggerated\u2026\nWhile it\u2019s worth noting that Mr. Freeman started as a home roaster, recent media coverage of home roasting has been a bit bizarre. To read it in the press these days, you\u2019d think home roasting were at its apex rather than continuing its gradual decline towards its nadir. This despite numerous media stories covering it over five years ago as some hot new trend.\nAt the 2006 WRBC, we were perplexed by the complete lack of home roaster representation among the event\u2019s attendees. (Namely, any home roaster worth his weight in greens would have been giddy over the reappearance of the Maui Moka bean. Nobody there even noticed.) And yet by 2009 we noted a real decline in online home roasting community activity, and we wrote about some of the underlying reasons for it.\nSouth India coffee\nCuriously enough, the first caller to the radio program (at 12\u201912\u2033 in) mentions a recent trip to South India and his interest in South Indian coffee. I\u2019m posting this from South India \u2014 Bengaluru (n\u00e9e Bangalore), to be precise. And I have to say, I\u2019ve become quite fond of both South Indian coffee and the South Indian coffee culture.\nSure, they prefer it sweetened and with hot milk (that often has a skin still on it). The coffee is often cut with cheaper chicory and is brewed with a two-chambered cylindrical metal drip brewer \u2014 not unlike a Vietnamese brewer or an upside-down version of a Neapolitan flip coffee pot . But damn, if this stuff isn\u2019t good. Even better, there\u2019s a culture of regular coffee breaks that would be familiar to many Mediterraneans.\nWe\u2019ve reported from India before, but only from the North \u2014 which isn\u2019t known for a strong coffee culture beyond young people frequenting chains that emulate the West. Bengaluru is home to the Coffee Board of India , and this weekend I hope to head out across its state of Karnataka to visit origin at the Kodagu district . Also known as Coorg, this district grows a good amount of India\u2019s good coffee. (Yes, they even grow really good robusta there. Just ask Tom Owens of Sweet Maria.)

What exactly is a latt\u00e9, and how does it differ from a cappuccino? The following primer will give you a good understanding of basic espresso bar beverages and make you a pro when ordering\u0096even in Italy!\nThe Straight Shot\nThe straight shot is the foundation of every espresso beverage, and it is the most commonly consumed coffee beverage in Italy. The straight shot is the only true way to judge the quality and consistency of a blend of espresso coffee. A good coffee, when extracted as a straight shot, will produce a smooth yet complex taste, providing a satisfying experience. The volume, extraction time, and golden crema (a dense golden brown layer of frothed coffee oils that float on top of a properly extracted espresso) are the keys to good espresso.\nThe two variations of the straight shot are the long shot or lungo, extracted to a volume of one and one-half ounces, and the short shot or ristretto (which means restricted), extracted to a volume of three-quarters of an ounce. The short restricted pour magnifies the essence of the coffee, and the ristretto is the manner in which a shot of espresso is usually served in Europe. Also, because less water has passed through the coffee grounds, the chance of any bitter elements being extracted is minimized.\nThe straight shot you order should be extracted directly into a warmed demitasse cup and served immediately. The demitasse cup should be pre-heated on top of the espresso machine or filled with hot water to keep the straight shot warm and prolong the crema. A straight shot in a \"to-go\" cup will cool quickly and should be drunk immediately.\nThe Espresso Macchiato\nThe Espresso Macchiato starts with a shot of espresso and is also served in a demitasse. The only difference between a straight shot and an Espresso Macchiato is a small amount of foamed milk spooned over the shot (typically one heaping teaspoon). Macchiato in Italian means \"marked,\" which describes this beverage\u0096espresso marked with foam.\nThe Espresso Con Panna\nThis is a variation of the macchiato substituting whipped cream in place of the foamed milk. Translated, con panna means \"with cream.\"\nThe Caff\u00e9 Americano\nThe Caff\u00e9 Americano is a single or double shot of espresso combined with hot water out of the espresso machine to produce a drink similar to American brewed coffee. This method produces a smoother and fresher cup of coffee than conventional brewing. Because this cup of coffee is served immediately after brewing, it may be much hotter than brewed coffee that has been poured into a thermal pot, or placed on a warming burner. Be sure to ask for a double paper cup to prevent your hands for being burned by the hot coffee prepared using this method.\nThe Cappuccino\nMost cappuccinos in Italy are consumed primarily in the morning. In the United States, it is a popular drink at all times of the day. Rumor has it that the name cappuccino was derived from the chocolate brown color of the Capuchin monks\u0092 robes.\nThe cappuccino is without a doubt the most difficult drink to prepare properly. Cold milk is essential, as is expertise in the foaming process. What is often served in the United States is an espresso with dry, tasteless foam spooned on top. These misprepared beverages will often look as if they have a column of meringue floating on top. Properly prepared, authentic cappuccino is produced with a velvety, wet foam, mixed with the coffee upon the pour to create a harmony of the two flavors. Because of the larger volume of foam, it will be a lighter weight drink than the latt\u00e9, which we will discuss next. Contrary to many products being marketed presently, there is no such thing as an iced cappuccino. Foam is the essential element of this beverage, and it is impossible to produce iced foam. In reality these drinks are iced latt\u00e9s.\nThe Caff\u00e9 Latt\u00e9\nThis is the drink that Seattle made famous. It is similar to the cappuccino with much less foam and more steamed milk. A latt\u00e9 can be made by holding back the foam with a spoon while pouring the frothed milk from the steaming pitcher. The drink is topped at the conclusion of the pour with a small amount of foam (approximately 30%). This drink can be served over ice. It is not necessary to steam the milk first for the preparation of an iced latt\u00e9. The espresso can be combined with the milk, poured directly from its carton. Latt\u00e9 in Italian means milk. Caff\u00e9 latt\u00e9, of course, refers to the addition of coffee to the milk.\nThe Caff\u00e9 Mocha\nA variation of the caff\u00e9 latt\u00e9 is the caff\u00e9 mocha. This is basically the same drink as the latt\u00e9 with either powdered or chocolate syrup added at the beginning of the drink preparation. It is important that chocolate is first added to the hot shot of espresso, and stirred well enough to thoroughly blend the two flavors together. The procedure should be the same with iced mochas, with the ice added after the coffee and chocolate have been blended. The steamed or cold milk can then be added to the espresso-chocolate mixture to complete the drink. Mochas are usually topped with whipped cream.\nFlavor-Based Drinks\nThe foundation of these beverages is, once again, the caff\u00e9 latt\u00e9. Almost any gourmet-flavored syrup can be added. Some of the more popular flavors are: vanilla, Irish creme, almond, hazelnut, and caramel. Some fruit flavors such as orange and raspberry also work well. Syrup can also be added to chocolate and the espresso to make a flavored mocha. When adding flavors to the beverage, they should be combined with the hot espresso and stirred. The milk can then be added to the flavored espresso and stirred again. All of these drinks taste great over ice.\nFrom Bean Business Basics, a pulication of Bellissimo Coffee InfoGroup , a company dedicated to providing high quality educational materials, personalized business consulting and custom media production for the specialty coffee industry.

First of all coffee beans are decaffeinated when they are still green, before they are roasted. The most common process is called the direct process. In the direct process they use chemicals like methylene chloride and ethyl acetate. These chemicals are also used in paint stripper, nail polish remover, and glue. The first step of the direct process is to steam the green coffee beans for 30 minutes to bring the caffeine to the surface of the bean, and then the coffee beans are rinsed with these chemicals. If you are looking for decaffeinated coffee, I would suggest that you buy coffee beans that have not been decaffeinated by this process because of the chemicals used. At the end of the chemical wash process the beans are steamed for 10 hours to remove any remaining chemicals solvents.\nCO2 Method\nAnother method that is used is the CO2 method. The beans are immersed into a CO2 solution that is under such immense pressure that the CO2 gas has turned into a liquid. The CO2 acts as\na solvent and washes away any of the caffeine at the surface of the bean. After this initial process is complete the pressure is released and the CO2 turns back into a gas form and evaporates and leaves behind the beans.\nSwiss Water Process\nThe best process is the Swiss Water Process. In this process the beans are soaked for 10 hours in a green coffee extract. Coffee beans are soaked for a long time to remove the flavor and the caffeine. After \u00a0about 10 hours when all the flavor and the caffeine have dissolved in the water the beans are removed and what is left is a concentrate of flavor and caffeine. The caffeine is then filtered out of this solution only leaving the flavor solids. With the next batch of beans that is soaked in this green coffee extract solution, only the caffeine dissolves in the water because of the high concentration levels of soluble flavor components that are already present in the solution. This method removes 99.9% of the caffeine present in the green coffee bean. This is the best and most natural method for decaffeinating coffee. Posh Portage Fresh Roast Coffee only roasts decaffeinated coffee using the Swiss Water Process.\nI don\u2019t suggest that you try and emulate these processes at home since the cost and amount of time it would take would not be efficient.\nThis is a video explaining and promoting the Swiss Water Process.\n"}, {"score": 1099.5951, "uuid": "2fa048df-dde4-5054-bb4f-af1409f3cd2a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-31-20002", "target_hostname": "www.poshportage.com", "target_uri": "http://www.poshportage.com/home-espresso/category/media/news", "page_rank": 2.3783435e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "News | Home <em>Espresso</em>", "snippet": "There are few (but major) <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> two sections of town <em>and</em> their indie <em>coffee</em> shops, however, <em>the</em> consistencies are unique to <em>the</em> area.

What do all these terms mean? How are these drinks made, and what do they taste like? In a world of customized Starbucks orders that could fill a paragraph, ordering coffee is not the simple task it once was.\nWhether you are a long-time espresso aficionado who wants to get more enjoyment from your brew, or a new coffee drinker altogether, this article will help you better understand the various coffee types on the market.\nBrewing Coffee at Home 101\nPeople have been drinking coffee since the ninth century, but things certainly have changed since it was initially discovered. With so many ways to prepare coffee, you may wonder how to go about making a brew with a flavor you will enjoy.\nThe most popular and well-known method of making coffee at home is an automatic drip coffeemaker. These machines make coffee by running water through a filter filled with ground beans and emptying the coffee into a carafe as it is brewed. An alternative to this is a French press, a small glass jug with a mesh filter attached to the lid. French presses are well-loved by coffee connoisseurs, and a simple alternative to traditional drip coffee.\nTim Eggers, coffee expert and moderator of the CoffeeGeek.com forums, says that this is his favorite way to prepare coffee.\n\u201cI prefer French press for its simplicity and complete control over the brewing process. Press coffee is a method that anyone can do if they are willing to spend the extra few minutes,\u201d said Eggers. \u201cAdd boiling water to freshly ground coffee, wait four minutes or so, then press the plunger filter through the brew. Simple, versatile and very good coffee.\u201d\nBut do you have to be an expert to make a great cup of coffee? Eggers says that you should start by using fresh-roasted, high-quality coffee that is properly ground. Investing in a grinder and purchasing your beans whole is a good place to start.\n\u201cThere aren't as many tricks to making a great cup as you might think,\u201d said Eggers. \u201cIf coffee is brewed at the right temperature for the correct amount of time, anyone can make excellent coffee.\"\nChoosing a Good Roast\nHaving the proper equipment is important, but all the machinery in the world is worth nothing without a flavorful roast. But how can a novice determine which coffee types are the highest quality? Well, research is one possibility.\nEggers advises coffee drinkers to look for reputable, well-known roasters with a \u201cpassion for coffee.\u201d Try looking for blends at a local coffee house, and don't be afraid to ask your barista for recommendations. Sample as many kinds as you can - as you try different blends of coffee, you will soon develop a taste for which roasts you prefer.\nThe process of roasting beans is complex, using high temperatures to bring out the flavor. The different blends are determined by how long the beans are roasted after the \u201cfirst crack,\u201d or when the beans start to split from the boiling temperatures of the roaster.\nDifferent roasts come with wildly different tastes and nuances. How can you select the best coffee type based on roast?\nEggers provides this breakdown of the various different types of roasts:\nLight Roasts\nTypically, lighter roasts - or those stopped just after the complete finish of \u201cfirst crack\u201d - will have more origin character than darker roasts. The actual flavors of the beans and acidity have a muted body or \u201cmouth\u201d feel. However, if you stop the roast too soon before it has fully developed, the coffee will have a sour or grassy flavor.\nMedium Roasts\nStopped shortly after the complete finish of first crack, medium roasts can create a balance between the sometimes raw, aggressive origin character, and the intense \u201ccarbon\u201d roast flavors. Medium roasts will also have a heavier body than lighter roasts.\nDarker Roasts\nThis roast is stopped just as second crack either starts, is in progress or just concludes. It will have a pronounced roast flavor, which is often pungent and sharp. Most of the bean's flavor will have been replaced with roast flavors, and body is usually at it's heaviest. But roast it too far, after second crack stops, and the coffee can be destroyed, with an ashy, charcoal or burnt rubber taste.\nIf you adore coffee, but can't handle all that caffeine, a different coffee type for you may be decaffeinated. Decaf blends go through a process before the beans are roasted that removes most of the caffeine, although not all.\nAccording to researchers at the University of Florida, consuming five to 10 cups of decaf will give you roughly the same amount of caffeine that can be found in one or two cups of regular brew.\nEspresso-Based Drinks and Other Coffee Types\nEspresso is a way of brewing coffee to create a very strong, heavy drink. Espresso is created in special machines that push water through the grind with an extreme amount of pressure. This pulls out more flavor from the beans. It is also the life blood of coffee shops, forming the base for myriad popular drinks. So what is the difference between espresso-based drinks, such as lattes and cappuccinos?\n\u201cThe ratio of steamed milk and froth added,\u201d explained Eggers. \u201cIdeally, the milk and froth are evenly mixed together, also known as microfoam.\u201d\nSome popular espresso based coffee types are:\n* Americano \u2013 Espresso added to hot water, resulting in a drink similar to drip coffee but with a bolder flavor.\n* Latte \u2013 A blend of espresso and frothy milk.\n* Cappuccino \u2013 Similar to a latte, except made with less milk.\n* Mocha \u2013 A combination of espresso, milk and cocoa.\nOrdering coffee can seem complicated \u2013 especially when the person ahead of you orders a no-foam, extra-hot, three-shot, extra-drizzle Caramel Macchiato. But there's nothing wrong with keeping it simple.\nIf you have a rudimentary knowledge of different coffee types, that's all you need to order a drink you will enjoy. But why order coffee out at all? With a selection of home espresso makers on the market, you can make your own.\nThere are a wide variety of espresso machines available for home use, from modest stove-top kettles that run around $20, to elaborate machines that will set you back almost a grand. You may not want to break the bank for a cup of joe, but a simple espresso maker may be a good addition to your coffee artillery as you expand your palate.\n\u201cOne can make the best espresso in the world at home,\u201d said Eggers. \u201cForget Starbucks, I make better coffee in my kitchen!\u201d\nWith so many coffee types available today, a person can feel spoiled for choice \u2013 or just confused. But now that you've learned a little about home brewing, picking a quality roast and how to order what you really want at the local coffee shop, you're guaranteed to get the most out of each cup. So wake up and smell the coffee!\nAre You a Coffee Connoisseur?\nFor most of us, the best part of waking up is that steaming java in our cup.

Hill:\nI have wanted a one cup brewing system for a long time but hesitated after sampling the Keurig system beverages at a gourmet cooking shop demonstration. A friend and I made our selections and had the coffee brewed for us. The initial delight with trying out a new machine was quickly replaced with the reality of a very weak, tasteless, stale cup of coffee. We both took a sip and tossed the cups in the trash. The woman demonstrating the system kindly offered us the choice of another variety, but the results were the same. The idea of the beverage system was clearly better than the execution.\nOver the last couple of years I\u2019ve sampled a few other Keurig varieties, and continued to be disappointed. So, I was skeptical, but hoped the Tassimo would produce a higher quality product, and without question it did not disappoint. Will this replace a 00 espresso bar? No. Will it replace your favorite coffee shop\u2019s concoctions? No. But it makes an excellent cup of coffee, a plus when you just want a cup and don\u2019t want to brew a whole pot, and it makes excellent coffee drinks along with tea.\nThe Tassimo Bosch T65 automatic hot beverage system comes with clear instructions and minimal requirements to get started. An optional water filter is included. This filter is very similar to the one I use in my Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker. In both instances use of a filter is optional but since the quality of the water used to brew coffee or tea greatly affects the end results, I always use either a filter or filtered water.\nThe unit is incredibly quiet and efficient \u2013 the water heats up immediately. There are warning lights for almost every eventuality from too little water in the tank, to when it is time to descale the unit. The machine itself has a nice solid feel \u2014 not flimsy. The maintenance requirements are no worse than those for any quality coffee maker \u2014 they need to be kept clean for optimal performance.\nThe discs have a barcode which when read, permits each drink to be precisely brewed for optimal taste. But, if after sampling a disc, a level of customization is desired, there is a manual over-ride to permit a smaller size stronger drink or a larger weaker cup. I made one cup after another without any delay. The water tank is large \u2014 61 ounces \u2014 so it doesn\u2019t require frequent filling.\nA criticism of the Tassimo over the Keurig is the availability and selection of the discs but I found the discs in many easily accessible retailers including a couple big box store\u2019s grocery departments, and of course, they are all over the internet. Currently two free packages of T discs are available when registering the product on the Tassimo web site. This provides a great opportunity to sample a variety of discs and find favorites. The discs I\u2019ve sampled are listed below. There are currently five different Starbucks varieties available alone. Tazo and Twinings teas are also among the selections, and many more I look forward to tasting.\nStarbucks Caf\u00e9 Verona \u2013 my favorite by far. The coffee is strong and delicious. Even when cold the coffee maintains its flavor. Not quite the coffee shop quality but very close.\nStarbucks House Blend \u2013 very good. The cup brewed was delicious but the flavor took a drastic dive as the cup cooled and became almost undrinkable. Drink it hot.\nGevalia Signature Blend \u2013 this is the only variety I tried and would not buy again. Although it isn\u2019t weak, the coffee tastes like bad vending machine brew. A little stale with a flavor reminiscent of coffee brewed through old gym socks. Ugh.\nGevalia Cappuccino \u2013 good flavor. The brew is almost a perfect balance of milk (2% so relatively low fat) to espresso with a decent, although not luxurious amount of foam. The coffee is strong enough to have a presence in the cup, although an extra espresso disc can be used to create a stronger coffee flavor.\nGevalia Latte \u2013 good flavor. Again, a nice balance between the milk (same 2% variety as above) and espresso flavors. I preferred the latte but would buy both again.\nMaxwell House Latte \u2013 coffee flavor too weak. This latte is definitely improved by using two espresso discs with one creamer (same 2% used in the Gevalia products) otherwise the coffee flavor disappears into the background and the milk is entirely too prominent.\nMaxwell House House Blend Decaffeinated \u2014 a medium brew. The coffee isn\u2019t as bad as the Gevalia, but it also isn\u2019t Starbucks. There is a slighly smoky aftertaste, which I actually liked. This will do nicely when I\u2019ve met my caffeine threshold. Currently, the only decaffeinated options are this one, Gevalia Signature Brew (see below) and Gevalia Espresso. Hopefully, Starbucks will create one soon.\nSuchard Hot Chocolate Syrup \u2013 good tasting chocolate but odd drink. This is a very watery, non-dairy chocolate drink. I\u2019ve read reviews from people who adore the drink, but I would definitely add a little milk or cream. I did try using creamer T disc but the hot chocolate lost too much of the chocolate flavor. The Suchard, and an espresso disc and a little milk made a passable mocha, but the milk needs to be heated. I understand the Milka T discs, initially only available in the foreign market are now available and that variety makes a delicious cup of hot chocolate. Milka will be in my next disc order, and I will post an update. I will keep experimenting with my remaining Suchard discs and see if I can find a great combination of flavors.\nTwinings Chai Tea Latte \u2013 very pleased with flavor but contains Splenda and sugar \u2013 weird. Nevertheless, I found this chai tea latte delicious, and will definitely buy it again. That said, I do not have a problem with Splenda. Some people have a sensitivity to the sweetener and also notice an aftertaste. I noticed no aftertaste and wouldn\u2019t have known the drink contained Splenda if I hadn\u2019t read the package. The creamer is the same 2% product noted in the latte and cappuccino products.\nAlthough not necessary, I found using a warm cup (microwave with a little water for 30 seconds) added to the enjoyment. I look forward to sampling the Seattle\u2019s Best Coffees, the Milka hot chocolate, the other Twinnings and Tazo teas. This is a quality machine with plenty of delicious coffee and tea selections readily available and it lives up to the promise of an automatic beverage system, something the Keurig system failed to do for me.\nUpdate:\nMilka Hot Chocolate \u2014 did not disappoint \u2014 it is a creamy rich hot chocolate that is absolutely delicious. For mocha simply add an espresso disc. This is one variety I will always have on hand. And, there are only 90 calories per serving and 2.5 grams of fat.\nGevalia Caramel Latte Macchiato \u2014 has a decidedly artificial caramel flavor which although not overpowering is unpleasant. I won\u2019t buy again. A better idea would be to buy a quality caramel coffee syrup and add it to the Gevalia Latte.\nGevalia Decaffeinated Signature Blend coffee \u2014 ugh, not surprisingly it has the same dreadful flavor as the regular Gevalia Signature Blend coffee. The Maxwell House decaffeinated T disc is far superior.\nUpdate II:\nMaxwell House Morning Blend \u2014 brews a large 12 ounce cup of medium strength coffee. The taste is fine, again slightly smoky. I will definitely keep this on-hand for emergencies.\nMaxwell House French Roast \u2014 produces a decent bold cup of coffee. I find the quality of the Maxwell House T discs superior overall to the Gevalia regular coffee brews. The espresso Gevalia disc is the only exception because the Maxwell House espresso is too weak.\nStarbucks Africa Kitamu \u2014 absolutely amazing bold cup of coffee without bitterness or any aftertaste. This variety has taken over as my favorite from Starbucks Verona. If you drink bold coffee black, this is the T disc to buy. Delicious.\nUpdate III:\n2/19/2010 The recently released Starbucks Latte Primo and Cappuccino Primo are absolutely superior to the Maxwell and Gevalia milk based coffee drinks. Starbucks has created their own milk T-Discs and both the cappuccino and latte versions are a significant improvement. Both milk discs contain a small amount of sugar although I did not detect any sweetness in taste. Perhaps the sugar helps balance the cooked milk flavor. The most important improvement is found in the taste of the espresso T-Disc that comes with both drinks. The flavor is fabulous and we can only hope that in the future the espresso discs will be sold separately. I wrote a detailed review of both the Starbucks Cappuccino Primo and Latte Primo under the actual product listings. I also added photos of the drinks brewing because they layered so beautifully. I continue to use my Tassimo daily and remain absolutely delighted by its performance.\nReview by T Rose:\nI\u2019ve been a Keurig fan for years and I was hesitant to try the Tassimo mainly because I wasn\u2019t familiar with the brand. I received the Tassimo today and I am more than pleased with it.\nPros:\nGreat flavor! Really, really great flavor. As I said, I\u2019ve been in love with many of Keurig\u2019s K-cups for years and I didn\u2019t think anything could top it but the Tassimo is just as good, maybe even better. The flavor is very strong but if you like it milder you can adapt it to suit your taste.\nYou can brew espresso, lattes or cappuccino. The latte and cappuccinos are brewed in a two step process-the packages come with an equal amount of espresso and latte (or cappuccino) milk mix. You brew the espresso disc first, then insert the milk mix disc to finish the drink. (however see note below about cleaning)\nIt comes with an adjustable cup stand. You can remove it for very tall mugs or adjust to the highest height to accommodate espresso cups. (Eliminates splashing on the side of the brewer-the coffee seems to come out at high pressure at the end of the brew cycle).\nAlthough it is programmed to read barcodes to add the precise amount of water, you can customize your brew by reducing the amount of water added, or add extra water to the cup at the end of the cycle for a milder taste.\nSet up is easy.\nIt comes with a \u201ccleaning disc\u201d that stores in the back of the machine. The machine reads a barcode on every disc to see how much water to use. When it reads the cleaning disc code it prompts you to \u201cbrew\u201d 4 times. Simply follow the instructions on the LCD screen.\nThe water reservoir is very large and easy to fill. There is a carrying handle and the top comes off completely.\nThe display is pretty impressive if you like LCD displays, written, flashing instructions and multi colored lights. It\u2019s a little over the top and unnecessary but I have to admit it impressed me.\nCons:\nThe discs aren\u2019t as easy to come by as K-cups. My local store carries about 15 K-cup varieties and not one T-disc. While I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be purchasing most of the discs online, I like to have the option of running into town to pick them up if I run out. Not only that but I haven\u2019t found any good deals on the T-discs (amazon and many other sites often have K-cups at significantly discounted prices). So far no such luck with Tassimo. Although you can get 2 free packages for registering your machine and even more free items if you sign up for their delivery service.\nAccording to the manual, the water filter should be replaced every 8 weeks. That adds up over time.\n***BIG CONSIDERATION FOR LATTE/CAPPUCCINO DRINKERS***\nThe manual suggests that after each milk based drink is dispensed you clean the piercing unit and do the cleaning disc process.\nI sincerely hope that\u2019s just an overly cautious suggestion to prevent the taste from showing up in the next drink. If the entire process really has to be done every time (to prevent milk from sitting and spoiling in the unit or something) then this clearly isn\u2019t a quick and easy solution when you want a latte. So if you\u2019re looking to buy this to make one latte, cappuccino or hot chocolate a day, I\u2019d strongly suggest calling customer service and getting more information on this \u201cImportant Note\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t want to spend 15 minutes going through the \u201cclean disk\u201d cycle and take apart the piercing unit (3 pieces) just for one drink. When I make a milky drink I make a regular coffee right after it to flush out the milk. I hope that\u2019s good enough!\nSo bottom line, Keurig vs. Tassimo:\nI feel Keurig has lower prices and availability going for it: K-cups are everywhere and come in hundreds of varieties.\nTassimo offers more functionality (specifically cappuccinos and lattes) and possibly a higher end taste. I like being able to offer guests an espresso, cappuccino or latte without having to have extra machines taking up room in the kitchen.\nBuy Bosch TAS6515UC Tassimo Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, Twilight Titanium now for only $ 120.00!\nBosch TAS1000UC Tassimo Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, Anthracite\nBetter brewing by design, Tassimo is a brewing system unlike any other.

In the Turkish culture, coffee is always offered at the start of any visit. No true conversations begin until kahve is served. The discussions and the brew are remembered together. No wonder that Turkish coffee is unforgettable .\nThere is no ritual more important in any culture than marriage. It is a way to improve ones standing and situation in society after all. Every prospective bride is tested by the way she makes coffee. Some brides are known to have substituted salt for the sugar in order to avoid an unwanted marriage .\nIt was also considered an insult to spill the coffee, even just a little on to the saucer so a reluctant bride would sometimes find a way to spill coffee, not just on the saucer but on the guests. That usually ended the marriage talks.\nThe foam on Turkish coffee is very important. It is made as the brew sits on the stove without being stirred. A few people will tell you that it is okay to stir after the first two boiling, in fact some will say it is a must but never is it stirred once it is placed on the heat for the last time. In fact, it is said that the host who serves coffee with no foam loses face.\nFor those of us who\u2019ve always wanted our future read with coffee, Turkish coffee is the brew you must try. It is the remains from this brew or fal that is used to read ones possible fututre or destiny . In fact it is still a favorite pastime in Turkey today, especially among the women.\nMake yourself a cup of Turkish coffee or go find a place that makes good Turkish coffee. Enjoy the experience for yourself.

Over the years they have found that precision is required to make a great espresso. There are four factors that affect the making of a great shot. They are also called the four M\u2019s.\nThe first factor is Macinazione or the proper grinding of the beans. Great baristas in fact will only grind beans for an espresso right before using them. 30 seconds after they have been ground, the beans are already too stale for a good espresso. The proper grind is between fine and powdery. The grind has to be uniform in order to insure the best taste. Instant powder will definitely make an awful espresso.\nThe second factor is Miscela or the coffee blend. Good beans means better tasting coffee. Perfectly logical, right?\nThe third factor is the Macchina or the espresso machine. Thanks to many inventors, you now have eay to use tools to help you make your espresso. But it will not magically make perfect espresso if you don\u2019t know how to use it properly. The Rancilio Silva is considered the best by most espresso lovers but feel free to shop around til you find the machine that you are comfortable with.\nThe last factor is Mano or the skill of the barista \u2013 that means you. More than half the battle is knowing how to use your equipment properly. You need to know how to properly fill your filter basket. Some espresso lovers will tell you to tamp the ground coffee, others will tell you not to. Like all skills, making the perfect espresso takes practice so that your every espresso shot has that beautiful crema that is the mark of true espresso.\nPosted by java queen \u00b7 Comments Off\nOf Flavored Coffee\nOctober 28, 2009\nI went to Coffee Bean the other day to meet up with some friends, something which I hadn\u2019t done in a while, and I was surprised at the fact that I got a bit confused as to what to order. I usually get something basic \u2013 brewed or a latte \u2013 but then I saw flavored coffees. I still got my usual \u2013 a latte \u2013 but it got me curious about how they make the flavored coffees, so I did some research.\nObviously, in many coffee shops, they add the flavor after brewing the coffee. The most common way is to add shots of syrup, depending on the flavor that you want. You can have vanilla, strawberry, hazelnut, and so on. Alternatively, you can flavor your own coffee by using natural products such as cinnamon sticks or its powdered form; same thing with nuts and other flavors that you may fancy.\nBut did you know that some people add flavor to the coffee before brewing it? Check out the coffee beans at the grocery store and you will find various packaging of flavored coffee beans.\nWhat they do is to add the chemicals to the beans. The flavoring can take the form of either powder or liquid. These chemicals are usually added to the beans right after they come out of the roasting drum.\nYou ought to know, also, that purists simply abhor adding flavor to the beans while or after roasting. Some even hate the addition of flavors after brewing! While I am not particularly fond of flavored coffee, I am not really against it either. How about you?\nPhoto courtesy of http://blog.promoindie.net/\nNo Electricity Coffee Maker\nAugust 8, 2009\nMy gut reaction when I saw the initial description of this novel coffee maker was \u201cWOW!\u201d For one, it would be a perfect gadget for when you go camping or if the power ever goes out (both are very real possibilities in the Philippines; and it is the season for Philippine travel ). Another reason, which is more altruistic, is that using less electricity means that you are cutting your carbon footprint down. That\u2019s always a good thing, right?\nThen again, when I took a closer look at the specs of this baby, I had second thoughts. Guess how long it will take you to brew coffee using the Hourglass coffee maker ? Well, at least 12 hours! Now I am not the most impatient person in the world, but having to wait 12 hours for my cup of coffee is way too long.\nThe concept behind brewing coffee using the Hourglass is nothing new. The basic idea is to brew coffee using cold water and time (lots of the latter). Some coffee shops actually offer coffee brewed in this manner. Cold-brewed coffee has an intense flavor, making it perfect for those who like their coffee strong. More so, you can also store the extracted coffee in your fridge for up to two weeks. This means that you do not actually have to wait 12 hours each time you want a cup of joe.\nAnother advantage is that this brewing method is supposed to decrease acidity by around 70%. With this bit of information, I think that I just might give the Hourglass a try. Not all coffeeholics are excited by the Hourglass but it should at least prove to be a good conversation piece.\nWhy Should I Get A French Press?\nMarch 31, 2009\nFor now, I have one compelling reason to get one. You see, I went on vacation about three weeks ago and once again, I was reminded of one of my pet peeves: the hotel didn\u2019t have brewed coffee. Can you believe that? I had no choice, so for the next 6 days, I was drinking instant coffee.\nThen it hit me. I should just get a French press and bring it with me every time I go on vacation! You see, I like going to \u201cexotic\u201d locations where brewed coffee is not a daily need. I had already considered taking a small drip machine before but I would probably have problems at the airport. Perhaps a French press would be easier to lug around.\nAside from that fact though, what other reasons are there for me to get a French press?\nThe answer lies in the flavor of the drink that is made from a French press. Anyone who drinks drip coffee machine every day and then suddenly tries a brew made with a French press will know this: coffee made from the latter is definitely stronger and has more flavor. So, aside from being able to make coffee in a relatively simpler way, you also get to produce a more flavorful brew.\nI think I am convinced. I shall take a look around when I get the chance and find me a good French press. Suggestions anyone? (Oh, and please don\u2019t tell me to go to Starbucks to get one.)\nPhoto courtesy of http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephencarlile/487699768/sizes/s/\nIs Grinding Your Own Beans Worth It?\nFebruary 24, 2009\nI think that this question has been asked so many times that it has gotten quite old. However, the fact that people keep asking it over and over again means that it is not that clear to many how grinding your own coffee beans can make a difference in the quality of your coffee.\nTo be honest with you, I was one of those people who kept asking this question. I normally use my good old drip coffee machine. It is just really more convenient (prep time and clean up time) than using my espresso machine (which, by the way, is in storage \u2013 yeah I know, sacrilege!). When I did get a grinder (Krups) and tried grinding my own beans, however, I discovered what I had been missing out on.\nIt is hard to explain, really. All that I can say is that when you buy freshly roasted whole beans and then you grind a small amount to brew, the flavor is just so wonderful! Naturally, the quality of the drink would depend on the kind of beans that you get but given the same kind, freshly ground beans are the best.\nAnother thing about grinding your own beans and preserving the flavor of the coffee is that you can store the whole beans for a longer period of time than you could store coffee grounds. I have noticed that even if you store coffee grounds in a sealed container, the freshness deteriorates much more quickly than if you stored the whole beans.\nSo to answer that question \u2013 yes, grinding your own coffee beans is definitely worth the extra effort that you have to put into measuring out the beans, grinding them, and then cleaning out the grinder. It\u2019s a small price to pay, really.\nLocust Bean Coffee: A Healthier Alternative?\nFebruary 11, 2009\nCoffee this, coffee that\u2026one moment we read that coffee is bad for your health. The next moment we read the exact opposite \u2013 that it is actually good. There really is no definitive information on this topic. But what I do know is that people have not stopped trying to look for alternatives to coffee. Why exactly I would want to find an alternative to coffee, I really do not know but for those of you who are looking for another \u2013 similar \u2013 drink, then check this out: locust bean coffee.\nI don\u2019t really feel like drinking anything that comes from an insect but what the heck, it won\u2019t hurt to take a look right? Yeah, my ignorance just shone through right there \u2013 locust bean is NOT an insect! I just overlooked the word BEAN right after locust. Sorry guys, when I see locust, I remember the story in the Bible wherein God sent locusts to eat all the stuff in Egypt.\nAnyway, locust bean is supposed to be good for you. It keeps your cholesterol levels down. It also promotes bone growth. Oh yeah, and it is supposed to be an aphrodisiac\u2026now you got me interested!\nSo what\u2019s the relation between the locust bean and coffee? It is now being used as instant coffee! Now I have turned you off, haven\u2019t I? I know that some of you ONLY drink brewed coffee and I totally understand that \u2013 I am the same. There are times when you just can\u2019t have brewed, though. And if you are thinking of stocking up on some of that instant stuff, maybe the\ninsect\n"}, {"score": 947.7517, "uuid": "7fd77c9e-8382-5e7c-af70-ffbf7d2df5d1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-07-12432", "target_hostname": "www.standardbank.co.za", "target_uri": "http://www.standardbank.co.za/site/business_banking/espresso/issue7/Espressoweb.html", "page_rank": 1.175974e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Espresso</em> Business Magazine", "snippet": "<em>The</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> a small business owner <em>and</em> an inspired entrepreneur Froth or cream Many of us who&#x27;ve started our own businesses with dreams of financial independence <em>and</em> freedom from a nine-to-five existence end up finding ourselves entrapped by debt <em>and</em> a five-to-nine workday.", "explanation": null, "document": "If you wish to unsubscribe from this newsletter, click here and include your full name.\nCopyright Standard Bank.

Not quite flower, not quite feather, just a Rorschach blot crowning my morning cappuccino.\nWhen he started judging latte art competitions, I obliged by glancing over his shoulder and rambling things about line quality, since of course I felt this was in my area of expertise as a designer. But I had no idea how extensive the actual criteria are. For instance, at the World Latte Art Competition, there\u2019s both a technical judge and a style judge. (Perhaps design competitions could employ a similar model.)\nThe main judging criteria are summarized as:\nBalance and Symmetry (dividing lines are even and show no hesitation)\nHarmony (between the size of the cup and the size and position of the design)\nClarity of Design (contrast)\nQuality of Milk Texture (yes, it takes a lot of practice to perfectly texture milk)\nOver time, I began to be able to spot the signature style of many baristas around Boston. There was one barista in particular who had a very whimsical line quality I grew to love, similar to the initial cap at the beginning of a book of Aesop\u2019s Fables I remember reading as a child. Yes, there are technical reasons for variations from barista to barista like how quickly they pour the milk through the espresso or the size of the cup; but in the end, it\u2019s the rhythm of their hand, just like any artist\u2019s hand, that makes the difference. No two are alike and personal style can be your best friend or something you fight in the quest for perfection.\nHere are 12 delicious cups poured by talented hands across Boston.

Of the Acacia genus, in the Mimosa family, wattle trees often have little puffy flowers and long seed pods. Six hundred are native to Australia, but many, such as Australian Blackwood, have been introduced throughout the world.\nA hardy tree with strong timber and a shady canopy, the Australian Blackwood is cultivated in habitats from Chile to California. Its prized wood is carved into ukuleles in Hawaii, boats in South Africa, and a collection of small treasures \u2015 pipes, pens, guitar picks \u2015 that would fill a Blackwood-inlay cabinet. Meanwhile, in most of these countries, the trees \u2015 and their seeds \u2015 have spread far beyond their designated territory, making the Australian Blackwood yet another introduced species to embellish on the terms of its invitation.\nThe seeds are curious things, each wrapped in an unmistakable coral-colored ribbon, and so many. They play a significant role in the tree\u2019s life cycle, and its reputation as an internationally recognized invasive species. They are packaged in a legume that develops just after the flower. Long and thin, the beans twist and constrict as they mature, weaving themselves into a bundle of extravagant curls. Once they have dried, the pods split along both margins, exposing the seeds, which, given the odd angles of the curled pods, flail in every direction. The seeds are small (2-3mm long), and they are fastened to the pod by a reddish-orange seed stalk, called an aril or funiculus, that folds twice around the seed.\nThe bright accent distinguishes our tree from other wattles (which might have yellow, or cream arils), and it is a bright billboard for birds, a seed dispersing agent\u2015at least in Australia, where birds have evolved to forage on the red aril and disperse the seed. However, many birds in the tree\u2019s new environments are not similarly adapted \u2015 this can keep the tree from wandering where it\u2019s not wanted. Birds in South Africa, however, have developed a taste for the aril. Here the tree\u2019s populations are growing, and it\u2019s believed the birds have something to do with it. The country has declared the tree a noxious weed species, and biologists have taken measures to control it, including the introduction of seed-feeding weevils (and the Australian Blackwood is not the only nuisance; in total, 10 control agents have been released to control 10 Acacia species). In its native country, the tree is also recognized as a problem, which doesn\u2019t diminish its status as a national icon \u2015 Acacia melanoxyln has been featured on two postage stamps, in 1959 and 1966.\nThe aril is not only pretty; it\u2019s also rich in protein, which makes the seed package rather appealing to ants, which consume the aril and discard the seed, in a fertile rubbish heap, or in the nest. Now buried, the seed has secured itself a pretty good place to wait until it\u2019s time to germinate. Like many Australian natives, the seed has a hard coating, a preference for bushfire germination, and incredible patience \u2015 all of which make for years of dormancy. There is evidence that soil-stored seeds are viable after 50 years. And the tree itself can grow for over 100 years, perhaps even sacrificing a limb or two for a polished wooden treasure.\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

Johnny Selman spends every morning ritually checking headlines on the BBC. But that\u2019s not all. In 2010, \u201cI decided to create a poster a day for 20 days in reaction to a headline for each day,\u201d he recently told me. This exercise triggered the idea for his Academy of Art University in San Francisco graduate school thesis, which he expanded into 365 days of posters and world news, he calls\u00a0\u201d BBCx365 .\u201d It is an obsessive tour de force.\n\u201cThe purpose of this project is to promote the awareness of global current events with the American public,\u201d Selman wrote in the introduction to his website . \u201c\u2018American citizens know little about current events in general and even less about overseas events\u2019 according to The Washington Post in 2006.\u201d\nThe changing pool of content kept the project exciting, he says. \u201cI created a tight set of design parameters to ensure that the project would hang together as a set at the end of the day. I reduced the composition to its simplest visual form and removed all unnecessary elements from the designs. The most challenging aspect to the project, outside the \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019-like repetition, was the importance of creating designs based on rich ideas.\u201d\nSlow news days were inevitable, but he tried to instill a sense of urgency and importance to every story he represented in the hopes that someone would be inspired by even the more bland news days. Still, keeping up the pace day after day, approaching every story as new and maintaining a semblance of originality had to be a chore. \u201cI had elements of gestural drawing in my posters,\u201d he explains, \u201cand many times I would reuse bits and pieces of an already used image to provoke a different thought. There were times when using a repetitive image added to the posters\u2019 meaning, such as the two posters about the Dutch family that was held captive by pirates in Somalia. The reuse of the imagery helped bring closure to an already told story.\u201d\nRigor is imperative when creating a daily poster. So Selman\u2019s list of dos and don\u2019ts included: \u201cUse as few elements as possible. Reduce the story to its simplest visual form. Don\u2019t over think it. Don\u2019t overwork it. Use as few colors as possible. Use flat color. Use color as a representative element. Don\u2019t use gradients. Use typography as the central visual element whenever possible. Use Gotham Bold or your hand. When needed use Tungsten Bold as a condensed face. Other typefaces can be used sparingly for parody. Use bitmap and vector graphics. Rip the levels out of photographs. Keep it interesting. Use humor. Use parody. Use satire. Use visual puns. Stay neutral. Be bold. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nThe task he set for himself was exhausting. Some days he just wanted to sleep in. \u201cIn order to maintain sanity within a task like this you have to allow yourself room to breathe and give yourself a break once in a while,\u201d he notes. It was best to start my posters when I was feeling inspired or up to the task, \u201cit made the process go quicker than if I forced myself to to sit and stare at my computer or endlessly sketch in my notebook.\u201d\nBut the project became \u201cthe constant in my life.\u201d Through sickness, vacation, injury, work and even a houseboat bachelor party, the daily design ritual was there like a backbone. \u201cA deadline that was as predictable as the temperature in San Francisco.\u201d\nThe posters vary in conceptual acuity, but on the whole Selman\u2019s visual shorthand is up to the task. There are also traces of various other poster designers, including Paul Rand, Joseph M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Ivan Chermayeff, even James Victore, and others who view economy as a virtue.\nSelman insists the poster marathon had an ultimate purpose. To take complex information and to distill it down into digestible bites. \u201cI certainly learned about time management,\u201d he adds. \u201cI learned how to deal with the barrage of anonymous online criticism [the series had an online component that drew many yays and nays ].\u201d\nIn the final analysis, Selman, who graduated in December 2011, admits, \u201cThe skill-set I gained during the course of the project can be directly applied to many aspects of visual communication. I\u2019m working in New York now and am involved in some really exciting projects. Most of all, I\u2019m making up for lost time with my wife. We are quickly referring to events in our lives as pre- or post-posters.\u201d\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

An agent clued me in; a few days later I was at photographer Martha Cooper \u2019s apartment and asked if she\u2019d caught wind of \u201cUnderbelly.\u201d She\u2019d heard all about it and was hoping to receive an invitation to the underground gallery. It was summer 2010 and the project was wrapping up. In late October of the same year, the secret was out when the New York Times ran a feature about an art installation that very few people would ever see.\nI\u2019m not sure if Cooper ever made it down to the abandoned New York City subway station, but between May 2009 and August 2010 Workhorse and PAC escorted 103 street artists four stories beneath street level and unleashed them in an empty space big enough to fit six subway trains. Jim and Tina Darling, the first artists to get up on the grimy, barren walls, describe it as \u201can industrial version of an orchard with its rows of concrete and steel beams, stretching on forever and fading into darkness. The air\u2026 thick enough to see in our lights.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nPAC first discovered this space in 2005, taken there by a stranger. On subsequent visits, he always left \u201cwith an inexplicable sense of calm.\u201d Having been abandoned for 80 years, only a handful of visitors had entered this subterranean cavern, and none of them had been graffiti artists . Legendary old-school graffiti writer HAZE reminds readers that since the early 1970s, train tunnels and ghost stations have been galleries for New York City graffiti. Back in the day, 12-year-old HAZE and his crew ran roughshod through the abandoned 91st station on a now defunct Broadway IRT line. So the fact that PAC had been ushered into an area undiscovered by graffiti artists was auspicious to say the least. After meeting Workhorse through an art gallery connection, the makings of a singular endeavor were in place.\nAble to reach out to a stunning array of international graffiti and street art talent, Workhorse and PAC assembled an impressive cast of contributors, many of them able to make livings off their work. This is a result of individual talent, of course, but also a number of cultural circumstances that have come to pass over the past few years, raising graffiti and street art out of the low-culture gutters and into the lofty high-culture strata of museum exhibits, glitzy fashion runways and global advertising campaigns. But as Workhorse points out, this bubble is \u201cstarting to burst.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nThe roll call of acclaimed artists who participated in this project is staggering. Ranging from graffiti writers like SABER, REVOK, CEAZE, and STASH to street artists like Know Hope, SWOON, Flying Fortress, FAILE , and Ron English, the logistics of organizing so much talent is dizzying. These artists are no strangers to acting covertly and breaking the law, but even by their standards the Underbelly Project possessed an aura of a covert operation akin to some sort of special-ops mission.\nThe result of everyone\u2019s work is a gallery of contemporary graffiti and street art on par with the recent \u201c Art in the Streets \u201d exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, or any high-profile gallery group show. But the venues couldn\u2019t be any more different. Workhorse admits that in thinking about this undertaking he and PAC asked themselves \u201cIf no one will see it, will it still be important?\u201d\nSuch a question strikes at the heart of why the street art bubble is beginning to burst. Unlike the original graffiti writers, and even the first wave of street artists like Shepard Fairey, kids running around today with aerosol cans, stencils and wheat paste have it in the back of their minds that they might have a shot at becoming rich and famous. This is a far cry from the get up for the sake of getting up credo that inspired kids in the \u201870s, \u201880s and \u201890s.\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nIf there is anything to criticize about \u201cWe Own the Night\u201d it\u2019s that there are too many photographs of the artists. I said as much to the agent when I first saw the proposal and seeing the finished book, which is big and brimming with photographs of the phenomenal artwork, I feel the same. Many of the featured artists have played a role in how the world views this art form, and if you look at their work you can see why. \u00a0As Harlan Levey writes in the book\u2019s most insightful piece, no matter where you look on this particular art history timeline, the movement has been spurred by action. But the remnants of these actions, the actual art, have been noticed by surprise \u2013 the hilariously appropriate placement of a sticker, the delicate latticework of a stencil sprayed on a sidewalk, the precision of a gravity-defying tag proudly trumpeting from a highway overpass. The how did they do that? awe and mystery matters. Museums usually don\u2019t exhibit photographs of artists next to their work; I don\u2019t see the need to feature photographs of street artists next to their pieces.\nIn the scheme of how popular culture has embraced graffiti and street art the idea of separating the art from the artists merits a stand-alone essay, but within the context of \u201cWe Own the Night\u201d it is a minor, though thought-provoking, critique. On the whole, the book is mesmerizing thanks to Workhorse and PAC\u2019s collective vision, which is as perceptive about the past as it is in looking toward the future, and accepting that a change is in the air. As Levey suggests, \u201cIt is the action that connects all of the participants, and as an action, the Underbelly Project seems to appear right before the closing of a chapter.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nJoe Iurato\u2019s striking \u201cThe People Upstairs Are CRAZY\u201d shows a boy using a drainpipe like a periscope; the letters in the word \u201ccrazy\u201d appear in circles made to look like letters identifying subway lines. It\u2019s a fitting sentiment. It\u2019s clear that the artists who contributed to the Underbelly Project conjured a realm of sanity beneath the streets, a return to the essence of the art form: creating in the moment and not worrying or thinking about what comes of what is left behind.\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

As you can imagine, our kitchen has an espresso machine, an industrial grinder, a home grinder, two coffee pots, an iced coffee maker, a french press, a pour over kit\u2026 Needless to say, we\u2019re well-equipped in case there is an apocalypse and the new currency is coffee beans.\nMy first introduction to the merits of latte art was through him. I actually dislike recognizable shapes in my cups, but I have come to love the pen and ink McSweeney\u2019s quality of rosettas (the shapes you see etched below). Not quite flower, not quite feather, just a Rorschach blot crowning my morning cappuccino.\nWhen he started judging latte art competitions, I obliged by glancing over his shoulder and rambling things about line quality, since of course I felt this was in my area of expertise as a designer. But I had no idea how extensive the actual criteria are. For instance, at the World Latte Art Competition, there\u2019s both a technical judge and a style judge. (Perhaps design competitions could employ a similar model.)\nThe main judging criteria are summarized as:\nBalance and Symmetry (dividing lines are even and show no hesitation)\nHarmony (between the size of the cup and the size and position of the design)\nClarity of Design (contrast)\nQuality of Milk Texture (yes, it takes a lot of practice to perfectly texture milk)\nOver time, I began to be able to spot the signature style of many baristas around Boston. There was one barista in particular who had a very whimsical line quality I grew to love, similar to the initial cap at the beginning of a book of Aesop\u2019s Fables I remember reading as a child. Yes, there are technical reasons for variations from barista to barista like how quickly they pour the milk through the espresso or the size of the cup; but in the end, it\u2019s the rhythm of their hand, just like any artist\u2019s hand, that makes the difference. No two are alike and personal style can be your best friend or something you fight in the quest for perfection.\nHere are 12 delicious cups poured by talented hands across Boston.

The East Village Other. The Berkeley Barb. The L.A. Free Press. Gidra. Wait \u2026 Gidra?\nWasn\u2019t that a monster in those dumb Godzilla movies? Yes, but just because he tried to lay waste to Japan and the rest of civilization, Gidra wasn\u2019t all bad. Which is how five UCLA students felt when they decided to name their newspaper after this three-headed winged dragon from outer space.\nThe ambitions of Gidra, which published monthly from 1969 to 1974, were more modest, and more noble. Its editors only wanted to destroy American imperialism in Southeast Asia and racism at home. As the \u201cVoice of the Asian American Movement,\u201d it promoted pride in Japanese culture, which had not fully recovered from the legacy of World War II incarceration. And was recently part of Drawing the Line, a Pacific Standard Time exhibition at L.A.\u2019s Japanese American National Museum .\nIts text spreads were unexceptional: simple, straightforward blocks of columns.

At a certain point, it became so popular as the place you could give your old books a good home, that people would back trucks up to the front of the store in the middle of the night and literally dump libraries of tomes at the store\u2019s threshold. If you arrived early enough, you had your pick of the tasty, choice ones and could come to the store after it opened to contribute your donation. Without a doubt, I was able to acquire some very unusual and esoteric books this way. This is also how I came to own two editions (acquired at different times) of a Russian book titled \u201cA Book About Tasty And Healthy Food\u201d.\nThese books appear to have been published as a profile of popular Soviet Russian foods, food products and recipes. There are plenty of\u00a0 heavily retouched monochromatic and full-color photographic illustrations. A brief journey through the books to evaluate the graphic technique used to present the foodstuffs leaves you with the impression that these were perhaps published in the 1930-40s. The retouching is so heavy-handed and the majority of the design is so unsophisticated that my instincts were telling me that they had to be pre-Cold War. Hardly. When I eventually referred back to the title page and saw the 1961/1965 publishing dates, I gasped. I\u2019d never seen such a blatant example of stunted graphic design development \u2013 if it were produced intentionally it would be brilliant parody!\nOf all the images, this is the nicest - could easily make an awesome poster !\n. . .and the chapter headings had a decent style to them.\nEnough to make anyone swear off mayonnaise. . .\nImpressive and bold treatment of a typical kitchen of the time. . .

Here are the best ways to use it\nTopics: Imprint , Design\nThis article originally appeared on Imprint .\nSocial media watchers are ablaze lately with the news: Pinterest appears to be THE next hot tool. While Slate\u2019s Farhad Manjoo gave a not-meant-for-me review of the tool (his article title, \u201cCupcakes, Boots and Shirtless Jake Gyllenhaal,\u201d says it all), Pinterest\u2019s numbers are indeed exploding. The site hit 10 million monthly unique visitors faster than any site ever , and it\u2019s responsible for more referral traffic than Google+, YouTube and LinkedIn combined . Clearly those are stats worth paying attention to.\nBut who should be using Pinterest , and for what exactly? More crucially, how can Pinterest feed the ever-ravenous maw of color and design fandom, whether you lead an entourage for your own work or dig the design work of others? Your primer has arrived \u2026\nWhat is Pinterest?\nPinterest is basically online scrapbooking. It\u2019s an invitation-only network, so to get started just ping someone who\u2019s already on Pinterest (like me, joodstew ), and they will invite you in.\nOnce you\u2019re in, simply install a \u201cPin it!\u201d bookmarklet in your favorite Web browser. From that point on, any time you see a gorgeous photo online, simply click \u201cPin it!\u201d and a popup window will appear, allowing you to add that photo to one of several photo collections, or \u201cboards,\u201d you maintain on Pinterest.\nIf you happen to pin an image from a retail site with a price associated with it, your image will also appear in Pinterest\u2019s Gifts section with price listed.\nPinterest operates on a follower-following basis, just like Facebook and Twitter. You can jump-start your Pinterest network by connecting your FB and Twitter user names. That will populate your Pinterest wall with your friends\u2019 pinned images, and show your pins to people who follow you. From there, the acceleration effect kicks in: you can repin images you like, comment on them, or simply \u201clike\u201d them (which doesn\u2019t commit them to any of your boards; it\u2019s sort of a shopping-cart option for images you may or may want to keep permanently).\nTo stoke your madly pretty collecting urge further, download the Pinterest mobile app and pin during idle minutes via your iPhone or Android phone.\nWhat benefits does Pinterest offer, and to whom?\nPinterest scratches the itch of anyone visually minded who wants to collect evocative images for various purposes and share them with like-minded folks. Put in plain English, here are some of Pinterest\u2019s target audiences and motivations:\nBrides gather hairstyle images, shop for flowers, dresses, for their big day \u2014 everything they shop for. Brides get monster mileage out of Pinterest, and retailers have definitely noticed.\nMoms gather DIY project ideas for kids, promising recipes to try later, clothes they\u2019re shopping for, inspirational quotes of all kinds. This group also fuels a lot of retailer site traffic if they ultimately buy the stuff they\u2019ve collected or shared via Pinterest.\nFrom PoodlePoddle\nInterior decorators share beautiful home designs, collect furniture and home-interior products they recommend, assemble and share color palettes for every room in the home. Here\u2019s a one-stop place to stoke their clients with pricey, tantalizing ideas that will hopefully turn into paying projects.\nRetailers can use Google Analytics and other site-traffic tools to see which sites are sending them the most traffic in any given month. If Product A is submitted by someone to Pinterest, it may well catch fire with the community, getting pinned and repinned. All those collective eyeballs can simply click back to the original retailer\u2019s site to buy \u2014 and many do.\nFrom my Should I Buy This ? board\nInfographic-makers can submit their thought-provoking graphs to Pinterest and watch the referral traffic (hopefully) roll in. However, as the above indicates, Pinterest skews heavily toward affluent adult women \u2014 pictures of killer crankshafts or infographics that don\u2019t speak to this demographic may fizzle with this audience fast.\nWhy should designers and color fans care?\nPinterest sits at a crossroads right now. It captures the DIY-handmade aesthetic (and associated shopping urge) of Etsy. As its collected images diversify from the merely cutesy, it could become a super-charged version of Flickr.\nFrom fffound.com via Thao Huynh\nMost crucially for designers, this is an images-driven social community. In other words, it\u2019s built for your kind to positively dominate. While many of the good moms using Pinterest aren\u2019t clued in to the latest design looks, they are a madly appreciative crowd \u2014 if you offer up your gorgeous images, you will be met with copious applause. Anyone posting their portfolio to Behance or Core77 should double up with a little Pinterest test. After all, Pinterest users are well-educated, affluent females who likely wield serious hiring power in between Pinterest coffee breaks.\nIf you\u2019re selling retail designed goods, pin your products so that site traffic flows back to your preferred retail site. That may be your Etsy storefront or a retail partner. But Pinterest users are definitely, permanently in a shopping mode \u2014 and they like buying design-driven stuff.\n"}], [{"score": 914.7856, "uuid": "5b0ff7bc-ab70-5dcf-b163-269c81293f94", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1710wb-29-11597", "target_hostname": "awakeanddreaming.org", "target_uri": "http://awakeanddreaming.org/?cat=20", "page_rank": 1.4898375e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>Coffee</em>", "snippet": "I like all kinds of <em>coffee</em> \u2013 <em>espresso</em>, capuccino, <em>lattes</em>, mochas, frappes, ice coffees, macchiatos <em>and</em> all kinds of ice cold creamy goodness.

I think yes and at 2 hours or so. I would say yes because ordering a single coffee and maybe a muffin doesn\u2019t mean that the customer should be able to occupy a table and use the free Wifi for hours at a stretch. Can the coffee shop afford to let that happen? And what happens when more customers come in and they are unable to get a free table because this one person has set up camp at a table for the past 7 hours? That is a definite no-no and should be frowned upon. I wouldn\u2019t blame the cafe owners if they asked the camper to leave. Actually, instead the person shouldn\u2019t allow such a situation to happen and be more sensible.\nHere in India, or atleast in my city, I only know of one cafe that offers free wifi. There used to be two but the other one, the more fancier & better cafe, had to close down well over a year ago. Now the reason that they closed is obvious to me. They were in a prime location, in a new exclusive mall where they rent for stores are at a premium, they were in one of the choicest sections, i.e right at the back which overlooks a walkway and the Arabian sea and the walkway is always filled with tourists & local at all times of the day. With all that higher end shopping (clothes, watches, perfumes, electronics, gadgets, gifts, music, dvds/blu rays etc etc) a tired shopper will naturally want a refreshing beverage & a bite to eat.\nEven others who would just want a coffee and a sandwich/muffin/pastry found the place to their liking. It was a good location, the food & coffee was really good, they had free wifi \u2013 what happened? The staff kept letting their friends and some other idiots, hang around all day long with ordering just one coffee and that too the cheapest and let the watch cricket matches on the big screen tv. Me & the others \u2013 we\u2019d spend atleast Rs.150-190 on a good frappe & sandwich, read a book or use the wifi on our devices and stay for an hour or 2 at the most. Not theses guys! Poseurs, loud mouthed idiots and only there to waste almost an entire day. How do I know that they were there all day? Because one day I saw them there at 11am when I came in and I passed by the cafe again at 3pm with a couple of friends \u2013 they were still there crowding around on several chairs and watching the tv. Later that same day at 7pm, I was strolling on the walkway enjoying the breeze with my friends and those guys were still there! Serves the staff right that they had to close!\nMy point is that several other customers were uncomfortable at the idea of a bunch of guys all ganging up around a table, making it difficult for others to move around, yelling out loudly at the tv. This isn\u2019t a bar! So even if they weren\u2019t using the wifi, they were occupying tables and their purchases didn\u2019t reflect the time they spent there and also they made it hard for other paying customers to come in and bring more business to the cafe.\nWhat I normally do \u2013 whether I take a book to read in the coffeeshops that I visit or a laptop to the current only one that offers free wifi \u2013 is I usually order a big coffee and a sandwich (in some cases a muffin) and I\u2019m there for 2 hours at the most. It\u2019s usually 90 minutes or even less but I think that\u2019s fair for the price of the sandwich + coffee. At times I have finished my coffee quicker if I feel that the place is filling up and people will need a table.

The same was done to our Probat LG5 a few years ago, and it is still looking great. \u00a0I cleaned and polished the chrome, repacked bearings, replaced all corroded fasteners with stainless steel, sourced new fenders, tires and chain.\nEnough about the bike, the real focus here is our commitment to helping our community by raising needed funds for Southern Tier AIDS Program. \u00a0Team Gimme! makes the Ride For Life our greatest effort each year, and we value everyone who contributes - jersey sponsors, customers, friends, family and even total strangers. \u00a0All that good energy together makes the 100 mile ride around the lake seem effortless. \u00a0To get in on this action, please visit the Cayuga Street Gimme to purchase raffle tickets. \u00a0If you cannot make it there you can still participate!

It's sometimes called Toddy which references the most popular brand of cold brewing device. It's a slow extraction process using room temperature water. How slow? 12-14 hours.

We had such a great time serving affogatos at Cayuga Street for the Ithaca Parade that we have decided to offer them again. For those of you who missed out during the parade, an affogato is a scoop of ice cream ( Purity vanilla in this case) topped by an espresso shot, it is a delicious combination.

The festival is four days of music and food that starts Thursday night with a parade and race down Cayuga Street, passing right in front of our original location . This year we have decided to take advantage of the massive amount of people crowded onto the street to bring you a summertime treat: the Affogato. An Affogato is a scoop of ice cream topped with a shot of espresso. It is close to heaven in a cup. We tried some last week for, um, research and found that the combination of sweet vanilla ice cream and a well extracted shot created an out of this world caramel flavor. We are so excited that thanks to a partnership with Purity Ice Cream we are able to share this with you!\nNow, we don't have freezers normally in our cafes, so this is a one day special, only at our Cayuga location. From 3pm until close (or while supplies last) this Thursday (June 2nd) we will be serving this frosty treat. Come for the ice cream and stay for the parade! Keep an eye out for Team Gimme in their bright red jerseys kicking off another fundraising year.\nFor those of you who (gasp) do not consume coffee, we will have Sundaes available made with our house made chocolate syrup, as well as fresh squeezed lemonade. For those of you who (gasp) don't get excited for Ice Cream, we will still be offering our entire menu of coffee beverages ,including our awesome cold brewed iced coffee.

Starting the week off with Video 1 \u2013 Crema , inspired by the crema conversation over at the coffee collective , Hoffmann challenges the espresso community, stirring up our beliefs and acceptance of even the most fundamental espresso best practices that we tend to accept without question.\nJames Hoffmann is an established, thoughtful and talented leader in the specialty coffee community. More currently, his attention is focused on his company Square Mile Coffee Roasters . When he shares his thoughts about coffee folks tend to pay attention.\nSo Do You Really Love The Taste Of Crema\nIn his characteristic polite and respectful manner, Hoffmann asks the question, \u201cdo you really like the taste of crema\u201d?\nWe\u2019re all consumed, chasing the elusive espresso technique, aspiring for that perfect shot. We focus on the crema, it\u2019s all about the crema.\nWe learn to gauge the\u00a0 quality of the espresso shot by the color, consistency and volume of crema we can produce.\nIn fact, the quality of the espresso is ultimately in the taste of the coffee, but we rely on the crema as a visual clue of whether or not the shot will hit the mark.\nAnd challenging further, Hoffmann asks whether you have ever bothered to taste the crema by itself, skimming off a spoonful from the top of your espresso.\nTry isolating the crema as a stand-alone component of the espresso. It\u2019s not exactly a pleasant taste. Rather bitter and chalky, actually.\nSo is it really all about the crema?\nAs an experiment, keep spooning the crema off the top until you remove as much of the crema as you can.\nNow, what do you think of the taste of the espresso with the crema skimmed off the top? A little smoother and sweeter? A little less astringent?\nIn the ongoing pursuit of better coffee, I most definitely appreciate James Hoffmann for his honest challenge, questioning the conventional thinking.\nFor me, I must admit, I like the extra body and mouthfeel as well as the edge that the crema adds to the espresso.\nMy preference, I prefer to stir the espresso to better distribute and mix the crema throughout the drink. This provides a more balanced and consistent espresso from first to last sip.\nAs Hoffmann points out, the espresso stir is becoming more common place, and you\u2019ll find more coffee houses serving a well crafted espresso with a demitasse spoon if your preference is to stir.\nBy the end of the week, Hoffmann finishes with a recap on the \u201ccrema is rubbish\u201d challenge. Fortunately, he\u2019s not suggesting we need to abandon our love and worship of crema. That\u2019s a relief! And after all, stirring up some controversy is good marketing.\nHere\u2019s to challenging the conventional wisdom and stirring it up.

The 10th annual 2009 World Barista Championship was held a few months back this year in Atlanta Georgia on April 16th to April 19th.\nWatching the top baristas (or baristi) from countries around the world compete for \u201cbest in class\u201d has always been an enlightening coffee experience for me as well as great coffee entertainment not to mention a specialty coffee education.\nEach year, regional barista championships held in a growing number of countries around the world select the best local baristas and send them to their respective national barista championships. The winners of the national barista competitions then head for the World Barista Championship. This year, national barista champions from 51 countries came together in Atlanta and demonstrated the best in specialty coffee preparation for the world to admire and enjoy!\nThe World Barista Championship (WBC) Governance\nThe WBC is a non-profit organization governed by a board representing both the SCAA \u2013 Specialty Coffee Association of America and the SCAE \u2013 Specialty Coffee Association of Europe .\nThe WBC\u2019s stated mission is to promote recognition and excellence in the Barista profession, to advance the practice, knowledge and expertise in the preparation and serving of specialty espresso coffee, to promote the knowledge and consumption of specialty coffee to the consumer, and to become globally recognized as the premier World Barista event.\nHow The Barista Competition Works\nAs explained in the 2009 WBC Rules and Regulations document, each competitor is judged by 4 sensory judges, 2 technical judges and 1 head judge. The competing baristas serve each of the four sensory judges a single espresso, a single cappuccino, and a signature espresso based beverage of choice (must be non-alcoholic) for a total of 12 espresso drinks.\nThe technical judges evaluate technical abilities and skill and adherence to proper and prescribed procedure including \u201ckeeping the station, equipment and work area clean\u201d. Hey, cleanliness has its espresso virtue!\nEach competitor is given a total of 45 minutes at their station in three segments; 15 minutes of setup/preparation, 15 minutes of performance, and 15 minutes of clean-up.\nTo level the playing field, each competitor uses the same set of equipment including the espresso machine and coffee grinders. This year, the baristas competed using a Mahlkonig K30 grinder (see below) and the Nuova Simonelli Aurelia espresso machine.\nThe winner of the WBC fulfills a specialty coffee ambassadorship role as the the representative of the World Barista Championship, the SCAA and the SCAE for the following year.\nThere is also a physical prize awarded to the WBC winner, usually sought after (if you\u2019re a specialty coffee or barista enthusiast) coffee equipment.\nThis year, the equipment prize to the winner included a Victoria Arduino Athena espresso machine and Mahlkonig K30 grinder .\nAnd the 2009 World Barista Championship winner is \u2026\nCongratulations go to Gwilym Davies who captured the distinguished first place position. The final competition included the following six \u201cbest in world\u201d competitors:\nGwilym Davies, United Kingdom \u2013 623 points\nSammy Piccolo, Canada \u2013 619.5 points\nMichael Phillips, United States \u2013 618.5 points\nColin Harmon, Ireland \u2013 572 points\nLee Jong Hoon, Korea \u2013 542 points\nAttila Molnar, Hungary \u2013 535.5 points\nThis distinction for the UK continues a trend started by James Hoffman , the 2007 WBC champion from Great Britain, and Stephen Morrissey , last year\u2019s 2008 WBC champion from Ireland.\nRather than bore you with more tedious WBC description, why not simply have a look at the following videos of the top 2009 WBC competitors. These videos are made possible by specialty coffee extraordinaire Nick Cho , SCAA board member who is usually involved in some form of officiating, hosting and announcing at these WBC events. That\u2019s Nick in the white suit introducing Sammy Piccolo at the beginning of video #2.\nAs is the tradition, first place barista champions from prior years take care of the hosting and announcing as a sort of \u201chanding off of the baton\u201d. In case you\u2019re not familiar, that is 2007 WBC champion James Hoffman (the taller, thin gentleman), 2008 WBC champion Stephen Morrissey (the bearded gentleman), and Nick Cho at the front of Gwilym Davies video #1.\nYes, yes, \u2026 a picture is worth 1,000 words. So that would make a video worth how many words (not including the words spoken in the video)?\n"}, {"score": 872.2237, "uuid": "01e84b9a-b8cc-5ca5-b0b7-62109de2b228", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1011wb-07-12391", "target_hostname": "openeyecafe.com", "target_uri": "http://openeyecafe.com/category/coffee/", "page_rank": 1.3295307e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Coffee</em> \u2013 Open Eye Cafe", "snippet": "Join us to learn <em>the</em> secrets behind steaming sweet, glossy, micro-foamed milk.

No one knew or cared how he did it; the only thing that mattered was the final product, and everyone only ended up greedily wanting more. In the world of specialty coffee, roasters feel a similar pressure, but even less appreciation in the public eye. For twelve hours a day, Zoka\u2019s roasters work tirelessly behind the scenes, transforming green coffee shipped directly to the roasterie from around the world into the rich, aromatic beans that customers consume every day at the cafe or buy for use on private machines in their homes. \u201cKeep it coming, \u201d everyone seems to be saying. \u201cWe don\u2019t care how you do it; just make sure it tastes good.\u201d\nEven the most discerning coffee enthusiasts (customers, baristas, you and I) know little about these people behind perhaps the most nebulous and certainly one of the most important links in the chain of artisan coffee: the roasting. Theirs is a mysterious art, overlooked, prone to misunderstanding, and full of intrigue. Most people wouldn\u2019t find it too far-fetched if they were told that roasting coffee is done in the dark corners of caves by little elves in their time off from making shoes. Roasters, some would say in hushed tones, perform alchemy.\nAnd in a way, this notion isn\u2019t too far-fetched.\nSo who really does roast your coffee? Who are these alchemists who turn the straw into gold, so to speak? Zoka employs three of them, and none of them are elves. In this first part of two blogs dedicated to roasting, some formal introductions are in order. For God\u2019s sakes, these people are in charge of making your morning cup taste the way it does! Meet them. Get to know them. Learn to love them. Their creations are in your grinder at this very moment.\nDrew Billups\nDrew Billups already knows how much espresso he is going to drink for the day: three shots- two in the morning and then a single cappuccino in the afternoon. He makes his own drinks on the espresso machine in Zoka\u2019s roasterie using beans he most likely roasted himself. Drew learned how to roast coffee almost seven years ago in Muncie, Indiana \u2013 not the most likely place one might associate with coffee roasting. He began roasting when the company he worked at began roasting. His learning process was organic, fueled by the spirit of experimentation and growth in his roasting art. Drew spent four years at the coffee shop in Indiana until he moved to Seattle with his wife two and a half years ago to roast for Zoka.\nAs Drew stands by the 1964 Probat roaster that Zoka uses to roast its beans, he tells me that roasting coffee is not unlike other culinary professions. \u201cIt takes a certain type of person, someone who is self-motivated, has a natural propensity towards the love of good work, and pays attention to detail.\u201d As he says this, he checks the half-roasted beans in the trier (a detachable rod used to observe beans as they are being roasted) in the bright light over our heads for the amount of smoke the beans are giving off. Our conversation runs in shifts because Drew is constantly recording numbers from a gauge or adjusting the intensity of the burners under the roasting drum. What he exactly is shooting for, I can only imagine.\nDrew was a music composition major in college, a field of study he says that has helped him with roasting. \u201cIt definitely requires the balance of the left and right brain, just like in music. You need both imagination and precision to be a successful roaster.\u201d\nDrew\u2019s profession has become a family affair. His sister, Lori Billups, roasts coffee for Alliance World Coffees, where Drew first learned how to roast. His favorite coffees right now are Kenya AA Chinga and Panama Las Marianas.\nJeff Shafer\nJeff walks into the roasterie in the mornings carrying his preferred mode of transportation. After hooking his bike to a latch on the wall in the corner of the roasterie, he walks into the bathroom each morning, bag in hand, and comes out a few minutes later donning regular guy clothes instead of a cycling outfit. He is the resident southpaw of the group, which doesn\u2019t alter his roasting techniques, but does look backwards when he jots down crack times of the beans.\nJeff started roasting along the Nickel Plate Road, in the city of St. Louis. He helped open a bike shop/cafe in 1997 that he named Java Hub. He quickly moved on to Kaldi\u2019s, a roasterie in St. Louis where he began learning the art of roasting on a 25lb. San Franciscan Roaster. He roasted for five years at Kaldi\u2019s in St. Louis, until, when in 2002, he moved to Seattle with his wife and began roasting intermittently at Zoka while roasting was still becoming a burgeoning department within the company. The roaster itself was still located in Zoka\u2019s Greenlake shop.\nToday, though, Jeff is firmly established, along with Zoka\u2019s roasterie, which is now located separately from the cafes in Interbay, just east of Magnolia. He darts back and forth from the roaster to the cupping table, tasting the single origins and blends he concocted the day before.\nI ask Jeff when the most crucial time is during the roast. He thinks about it before he replies, \u201cFrom the time coffee is dropped into the roaster until the time it comes out.\u201d He tells me that half and quarter batches, the proportions that are often used to roast Zoka\u2019s Artisan reserve coffees, require the most attention in order to hit the first crack of the beans perfectly. I ask him what the first crack is and that starts an entirely new conversation.\nJeff also has a penchant for photography (some of his photographs were featured in Barista Magazine) and frequently talks politics over a pressed El Salvador. He also enjoys Sumatra Lake Tawar and when prodded can mimic a pretty mean mid-western accent.\nChris Davidson\nChris, as roastmaster of Zoka\u2019s roasting department, isn\u2019t without his routines. When I walk into the roasterie at eight in the morning, bleary eyed and half awake, I find Chris easily into his second hour of roasting for the day. A French press sits on the cupping table already half gone. He looks at me, his baseball cap backwards, smiles and says, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, man?\u201d\nChris has been at Zoka since 1999. His path towards roasting coffee has been a winding one, with a few detours along the way. He first discovered Zoka as a customer, spending hours a day in the Greenlake cafe while studying ethnomusicology. He quickly applied as a barista and spent the winter of 1999 working both at Zoka and a drive-thru espresso bar called Steamers. He originally had plans of becoming an upright bass player and still dabbles, picking up the occasional gig. In the summer of 2001, Chris spent four months in New York, hoping to find work as a musician. Oddly enough, it was there that he realized that 1) he wanted to dedicate his time to coffee and 2) he couldn\u2019t do it in New York. So, he came back to Seattle in the fall of 2001 and traveled once again, this time with Zoka to Norway for the Nordic barista jam. It was there that his decision to make coffee a career solidified. When he came home, he soon learned the art of roasting and became head roaster of Zoka in 2003. That same year, he spearheaded a small group of volunteers to create The Barista Guild of America, a trade guild of the Specialty Coffee Association.\nIt is pouring outside when I talk to Chris. When I ask him what the most important aspect about roasting is he gives me a surprising answer: cupping. Of course, this will need some explanation. \u201cBefore you put any single origin bean into the hopper for roasting, you have to know what kind of flavor profile you are shooting for,\u201d Chris explains as he scoops green coffee beans into a bucket to record the weight. \u201cYou have to know if you want to roast for acidity, for body; what do you want to bring out of that particular coffee? What strengths does it have? The ultimate goal is to enhance the intrinsic characteristics of the specific bean you are roasting.\u201d\nChris\u2019s favorite coffee right now is Colombia and he loves roasting Sumatra Lake Tawar because of its always varied flavor profiles. He also likes Latin and Funk music, and one would be hard pressed to find a Coen Brothers movie he hasn\u2019t seen.\nWant to know what a first crack is and why it is so vital? Want to understand the differences between African and Central American coffee and how they are roasted accordingly?

Some of my blogger friends before encouraged me to work hard on my blog so I could earn some money while doing the thing that I am passionate about. They even told me to register to different online accounts that offer opportunities to blog owners. But, I never listened to them. I did not have enough courage and confidence in myself. Honestly, I was too afraid to try it because I knew I will not make it unlike what they have achieved. So, I kept everything simple until last month when I began to discover the beauty of freelancing, online working and blog writing.\nIt took me more than three years of blogging before I decided to take one step forward. On the 10th of October 2011, I joined Odesk and looked for online jobs that I could do during the sem break. Since my profile was a little dull, I placed The Coffee Chic blog on my portfolio url to make it easier for employers to see my original posts and articles. Thus, I started updating my page regularly and did all the best that I can to write interesting contents for my readers. Luckily, there were some bosses who admired my online page and hired me to do writing jobs. My first ever freelance job was content writing for different websites wherein I earn some dollars per hour. Yes, the rate was not fixed per article since I also do data entry jobs for the same boss. Even if I already have one contract, I still searched for more jobs that I could apply for. Again, another employer liked my blog and asked me to write articles for him. When I realized how great freelancing is, I registered to Elance . Fortunately, I was hired there as an article writer. All these great things, I owe to my blog. Because of this online journal, I began earning money on my own. At the same time, I have paid posts on this blog but I only have three\u00a0because my focus is entirely on my contracts for Odesk and Elance .\nIn just a matter of 1 month and ten days, I earned enough funds to make some changes for my blog and made my Paypal account active. Here are some of the great things I received after working hard.\n\u2665 I got my own domain ! (Though I lost my ranking in Alexa and Google, I still believe I made the right decision because having my own \".com\" domain was something I have dreamed of.)\n\u2665 I had a blog make over ! I now have my own custom-made design.\n\u2665 I was able to host a mini-giveaway to express my gratitude to my visitors and readers.\n\u2665 I became one of the sponsors for a contest . (But I only paid $5. LOL)\n\u2665 My gift to myself - My own 32 gb iPad 2 Wifi + 3g!\nThis is the first ever item that I bought using the money from my own pocket! For the longest time, I have always depended on my parents to give me every single thing I want. So, can you imagine how happy I am for being able to get this for myself? I availed Globe's Super Unli Surf Plan 999 . I paid the cash out in full and the advance payment for the first month. Who would thought that I can buy this tablet without asking anything from my parents?\nWith my new iPad 2 Wifi + 3g, I can already go online anytime and anywhere. It is certainly what I needed especially that I still have two existing contracts in Odesk and one on Elance. By using this advanced tablet, I can still do my tasks even if I'm at school. I can still read the emails sent my by employers and talk to them on Skype. Most importantly, I can now update my blog and visit my friends' blogs without connecting to a Wi-Fi spot which is usually limited in my university. In fairness to Globe, the signal is really excellent! The Wi-Fi at home will be solely used by my younger brother allowing him to play online games better.\nI know freelance jobs come and go. Whatever happens in the next coming days, like losing the contracts, I will have no worries and regrets. At least, I have given myself\u00a0an advance Christmas gift. I really feel blessed. This is a great beginning I will never forget.\nP.S. Anyway, I'm planning on making a new blog with a niche but I'm not yet sure if I can do it. I need to manage my time well in studying my lessons, doing my thesis, freelancing and keeping TCC updated. Since I have 0 PR and a low rank in Alexa, I am no longer qualified for paid posts. So, for now, I think I have to work on making my blog earn some traffic and rank higher. Do you have any suggestions on how I could do it?\nThank you for the first Coffee Talk \u2665\n"}], [{"score": 811.3492, "uuid": "a07ccece-72cb-5f16-be99-650a03e31a72", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0707wb-41-28060", "target_hostname": "www.tomatom.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tomatom.com/2011/03/guide-to-espresso-coffee/", "page_rank": 1.1804893e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Everything you wanted to know about <em>coffee</em> (but were afraid to ask your", "snippet": "In a <em>latte</em> glass but <em>the</em> same ratio as a Magic \u2013 1:4 <em>coffee</em> to milk.

No sooner do you think you have a grip on all the current vogue brewing methods and another one lands on the scene.\nIn my case the latest ones to enter my vocabulary it\u2019s the Trifecta (coming soon) and the Magic (see definitions below).\nNo longer are the options just espresso-based but there a plethora of new methods appearing mainly designed to express the taste of single origin beans in addition to a new generation of blends, that are lighter roasted and younger when drunk.\nThe difference over the old-style dark and Italian-style roasts is that the coffee has fewer bitter notes and a lot more acid, sometimes to the point of curdling milk (or more often soy) in the milk-style drinks.\nHere\u2019s an update to keep you hip with the coffee scene.\nI won\u2019t even address grinders, frequency of cleaning them and bean roasts in this post.\nPart 1 Espresso based coffees (Part 2 -other methods coming soon)\nLatte \u2013 the art means something\nEspresso\nDesigned to be knocked back rather than sat over, it means translated from Italian \u2013 made expressly for you. It should be syrupy and luscious, thick enough to almost chew with a golden \u201ccrema\u201d \u2013 cream. If there is a lot of bitterness it probably has been over extracted. Generally about 7 grams of freshly ground coffee (a good barista with adjust the ground through the day as environmental conditions change) is extracted from the group head over about 25 to 30 seconds. This should produce about 30-35ml of aromatic, thick black liquid. If it\u2019s thin or bitter the grind is probably wrong.\nThe best I\u2019ve recently have had are at Padre in East Brunswick (ignore the \u201cno bloggers\u201d sign on the door), Proud Mary in Collingwood and Omar and the Marvellous Coffee Bird.\nDouble (or doppio) espresso\nExactly what it says it is \u2013 14 grams of freshly ground coffee.

A long black is a double espresso with added hot water.\nRistretto\nThis is a restricted espresso. It uses the same 7g of freshly ground coffee as the espresso but is extracted for just 15 seconds instead of 25-30.

It is a single shot of espresso topped with silky textured milk and 1-1.5cm of foam. The ratio of coffee to milk is usually 1:6. Because of the shape of the glass there is a less even mixing of the milk and coffee meaning it starts off creamy and ends thinner. The milk should be heated to about about 65C otherwise the sugars in it with change composition and it will lose it\u2019s sweetness. Better a bit cold than overheated. A Soy milk shouldn\u2019t be heated to about 55C strong latte simply has a double espresso shot.\nFlat white. Good art is a sign of good coffee.\nFlat white\nApart from being served in a cappuccino cup, the flat white is like a latte but contains less milk. The shape of the cup means the milk mixes with the espresso better bringing a more even creaminess to the texture.

This article is not about coffee as much as it's about this particular American phenomenon. The coffee house is a tricky gustatory medium because evaluation of the house atmosphere is subjective and depends far more on who is drinking than the setting of consumption. All I can say is that this past Sunday I found myself in the mood for adventure. A Sunday afternoon has never felt so off-kilter for me, and I think I can attribute this to a strange quest that seems without end: What's the right atmosphere for the American coffee shop?\nI also feel that it is my duty to tell you that as I type this, I am drinking coffee on my way to New York City. When I get there, my goal is to have lunch at Motorino, a pizza place on 1st Avenue that I've had my eye on for months. This same place, believe it or not, just received a star from Sam Sifton of The New York Times. A pizza place getting a star from the Times is huge, and I fully expect to have to bulldoze my way through a mob of leisure-suit wearing sycophants to dig into my Brussels sprout, mozzarella and pancetta pizza. Maybe I should postpone the rest of this article and just talk about how damn good I know this pizza is going to be. But I'll save that for another week.\nWhere was I? The atmosphere of the coffee shop, right. Sometimes, instead of splashing it into a paper cup and running to class with scalding liquid searing your hand and staining your shirt (me on a Monday), it's nice to sit down and remember that it's occasionally acceptable to act like a semi-civilized human being. Anyone that has ever been lucky enough to have visited a real live Parisian caf\u00e9 can recall with a glazed look the simple indulgence of sipping a hot cappuccino and people watching like a proper flaneur. However you feel about France, the simple truth is that the American coffee house is modeled after the French caf\u00e9 (which is a little incongruous if you think about it, considering the fact that coffee comes from the Americas, and the Euro-folk only ever got it once the Spanish gunned their way through this hemisphere).\nA note regarding my own coffee preferences: I am not any kind of bean purist. I doubt I could adequately describe the difference between good coffee and great coffee. I never shell out the big bucks for the primo beans. All I know is that I can tell a serious difference between coffee that I can drink and coffee that I can't put anywhere near my mouth. But I'm not exactly critiquing coffee itself today. No, my sights are set a little higher: on the ever-elusive coffee house atmosphere.\nThe question is where to enjoy with leisure this liquid that so many of us guzzle like an 18-wheeler sucking down gasoline. We all know that the Vassar student enjoys his or her latte at Raymond Avenue's Cubbyhole or Crafted Kup. There is a notable difference between the two coffee houses: The moods and settings are decidedly polarized between the two. The Cubbyhole offers what might best be called a dimly-lit lounge setting, designed for people who want to spend a long time comfortably sipping out of oversized mugs. Conversely, the Crafted Kup offers a brighter, crisper atmosphere, like a stream of light breaking its way through your window in the morning. The Crafted Kup always makes me want to open my eyes as wide as possible and take a deep breath of the bracing morning air. But then again, I hate feeling that cheery.\nI don't want to seem prejudiced toward or against either of these businesses. My general attitude towards both of them is something between \"meh\" and \"mmmeeehhhhh\u2026\"\nPeople asking me to spend an evening with them lounging at the Cubbyhole chatting about post-modern poetry isn't really my cup of tea (so to speak). Neither is an onslaught of cheery people asking me how my morning is going (it normally sucks because it means I'm not asleep anymore.) What does get me excited is funky stuff. People, places, designs. If it's quirky, I'm in. Lucky for me, there are places in Poughkeepsie that cater to my eccentricities.\nI'm a firm believer that one of the best ways to find these quirky food venues is to get out of one's comfort zone. For me\u2014and, to be fair, most of Vassar's students\u2014the small portion of Route 9 in Poughkeepsie just north of the train station is foreign enough to be another city entirely. The culture around Marist College and the commercial zone that caters to the College has an entirely different atmosphere than the three blocks of Arlington by Vassar. A desire to find the new led me to a coffee house right in the heart of this world.\nWhich brings me to the main event: Casablanca Coffee Co. Casablanca is right across the street from Marist in a little commercial park that also houses a tanning salon and tattoo parlor. Stepping inside, two things struck me immediately. One: This place is obviously in the business of catering to college students. The prices were amazing throughout, and the quirky, unpolished design insisted upon no excuses, no apologies. Two: While students are the obvious target market, just being in college doesn't make you fit in here. I hardly ever get very self-conscious, but I just couldn't help noticing the fact that I felt out of place. This is probably because I wasn't wearing a sweat suit and Uggs to match the girls and guys seated around me.\nBut the simple, unavoidable value of the place assuaged any of my lingering fashion hesitancies. I don't often list prices, but here I feel that I must. Coffee (that tastes really good) and a bagel (that you can get in a ton of varieties\u2014jalape\u00f1o for myself) with cream cheese (again, everything from plain to walnut raisin to olive) will never run you more than $4.50. That price seems to be something of a moniker for them, as their most expensive breakfast item (on an extensive list), the \"Famous Breakfast Burrito,\" loaded with eggs, sausage, jack cheese, onions, peppers and tomato, is the same price, and well worth it. The lunch menu, which caters to vegetarians as well as meat-lovers, tops out at $7. The deals hardly stop there. What if you're into buying in bulk? Fear not, my friend. You can also buy big bags of day-old bagels for a buck and a half.\nWallets aside, Casablanca offers some interesting menu bits that aren't strictly by the book. A huge menu of rotating flavored coffee is available for those who want some variety and aren't too stickler-ish about their preferences. Something that you don't see too often in a small coffee operation\u2014an extensive and customizable smoothie menu\u2014sits next to the espresso drinks with an element of some prominence.\nOf course no place is perfect, and Casablanca does have some issues. Their pastry selection is both lackluster and limited. On my visit, there were three sad looking muffins and two cupcakes whose frosting looked like it had crustified more than a couple days ago. They do a good job of not reminding you of this by hiding that particular display case in a shadowy corner. But for me, pastries are an integral part of the caf\u00e9 experience and a failure to recognize this on their part is pretty disappointing. The shop's layout is also a bit bonkers, which is a blessing and a curse. Which brings me to the age-old question of atmosphere. Here, I am a picky customer.\nIt seems that Casablanca couldn't quite master whether they wanted a lounge atmosphere or a typical caf\u00e9 atmosphere with round tables and tall chairs. The caf\u00e9 interestingly attempts to straddle the Crafted Kup-Cubbyhole divide by literally dividing the space in the caf\u00e9. A short aisle separates a plush couch and poofy chairs on one side from wooden, acute seating blocks set against the window.\nSo the quest continues. Would that I could declare an ultimate coffee house atmosphere champion, but I'm forced to declare that I cannot. Perhaps this is part of the appeal of the American coffee house, a culinary genre that we've stolen from the Europeans and are still struggling to adapt. But I remain optimistic about the prospects for caffeine consumption when you dare to venture away from Vassar. Maybe I'll never find the perfect coffee house, but at least I continue down this (possibly endless) road with a thirsty spirit and plenty of caffeine surging through my veins to boot.\nRecommended: Articles that may interest you\n"}, {"score": 786.424, "uuid": "f510923d-537b-5819-bfac-243b2f0507e7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-80-20236", "target_hostname": "www.barringtoncoffee.com", "target_uri": "https://www.barringtoncoffee.com/media/bean-counters", "page_rank": 1.1816056e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Bean Counters \u2013 Barrington <em>Coffee</em> Roasting Company", "snippet": "REBECCA GRAY drank four <em>lattes</em> <em>and</em> an <em>espresso</em> to get this column turned in on time. * SELECT ORIGIN &gt; These coffees represent <em>the</em> best that each origin has to offer.", "explanation": null, "document": "Jan 13, 2010\nFOOD\nSpecialty coffee shops are percolating more than ever: You almost forget: What\u2019s brewing is an old industry.\nBy Rebecca Gray\n\u201cNice extraction,\u201d Barth Anderson says kindly, complimenting his business partner Gregg Charbonneau. Happily for me the two are not dentists but coffee roasters, the extraction not a tooth but an exceptional cup of espresso. The three of us are standing reverently before the chrome-plated espresso machine at the far end of Barrington Coffee Roasting Company\u2019s roasting room in Barrington, Massachusetts. Gregg is grinding freshly roasted Indian beans and filling the machine\u2019s metal filter cup, turning water pressure knobs, drawing liquid through to the spigot and into a cup, then dumping both grounds and coffee into a trash bin.\nHe repeats the process three times, discards what looks quite acceptable to me, then hands each of us a demitasse of deep, rich elixir foamed over with a creamy chestnutcolored froth \u2013 termed the crema, it is the mark of perfectly extracted espresso. Its taste is exquisite, a testament to Barth\u2019s and Gregg\u2019s expertise and attention to detail; and perhaps more, the intense flavor manifests a new (old?) way of thinking about coffee drinking \u2013 and is part of what\u2019s putting the jolt back into the coffee business.\nIn the 1970s Americans consumed about half of the world\u2019s coffee output and 75 percent of Americans over the age of 10 drank coffee; by 1990 that figure had dropped down to 50 percent and probably would have continued its decline through the decade if it were not for the specialty coffee people. The Specialty Coffee Association of America reports that there were about 2,000 specialty coffee retailers in 1990, and more than 11,000 by the end of 1995.\nOf course, way out in front of the specialty pack is the $465 million a-year Starbucks, whose most phenomenal growth came in the l990s; earnings grew ten times through 1991 alone and sales were up 63 percent in 1995. Starbucks had started in the 1970s as a microroaster selling dark roast coffee beans (some roasters fondly call them \u201cCharbucks\u201d), then ten years ago they began taking to coffee cafes, airport kiosks, and historic register hotels to educate a whole baby-boomer generation about latte, cappuccino, and full city roast coffee. We didn\u2019t just learn to walk the walk and talk the coffee talk with Starbucks; more importantly we began to pay attention to all the elements that must precisely blend to make a great cup of coffee: aroma, agricultural heritage, quality-control, the art of identifying and accentuating flavors and, of course, the \u201cbuzz.\u201d\nCoffee has always had a unique edge over the world\u2019s other taste sensations: caffeine.

And 50 years later coffee ads boasted that the beverage could cure scurvy, gout, and other maladies.\nIn 1807 Napoleon had his troops drink coffee rather than alcohol as a stimulant, until British troops cut off imports and the coffeeklatched French troops were obliged to mix their eversmaller coffee supply with chicory. War would later cause another coffee panic: In World War II the hoarding of it in the United States would lead to coffee rationing, as citizens were limited to one pound every five weeks \u2013 not a lot, but perhaps enough to keep them alert and awake.\nWe are indeed awake \u2013 and we\u2019re smelling the coffee. Coffee aroma is one of the more distinctive and vital attributes of coffee and helps define its taste. In an attempt to understand coffee aroma, Colombia\u2019s (second to Brazil in coffee production) National Coffee Growers\u2019 Federation commissioned a team of French researchers to categorize the world\u2019s top coffees according to their woody, fruity, vegetable, spicy, toasted, and animal aromas, much the way wines are categorized. The 1997-8 project, titled, \u201cLe Nez du Cafe\u201d (\u201cA Nose for Coffee\u201d) identified 36 signature smells of the finest coffees. One of the researchers wrote, \u201cAs coffee is the aromatic belt of the world, nothing was more logical than to compose \u2013 using these 36 notes of olfactory music \u2013 a symphony for five continents.\u201d For many, the rich coffee smell summons a pleasant memory \u2013 breakfast\nwith a favorite grandfather; a cool, starry night around a campfire \u2013 and, as the words of this professional sniffer imply, a whiff can also conjure the exotic places of a bean\u2019s origin.\nThe global coffee-growing belt stretches from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn. Coffee came to the Western Hemisphere in 1723 when a French Naval officer, Gabriel-Mathieu de Clieu, stole a seedling from the French Jardin Royale and then made his way to Martinique, sharing his water ration with the plant on his long sea journey. That one seedling was to become the ancestor to most of the coffee bushes in the Americas \u2013 and the American coffee industry would eventually produce 90 percent of the world\u2019s coffee.\nCoffee plants must have a cool dry season and warm rainy season, so equatorial, subtropical countries are optimal for growing. The finest coffee, coffea arabica \u2013 named for its original fifteenth-century promoters, the Arabs \u2013 grows best at an altitude of between 3,000 and 6,000 feet. Coffea robusta, the dominant bean used in canned blends, can grow at sea level, is cheaper and hardier, but lacks in depth of flavor when compared to the arabica bean. Invariably, the best coffees come from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Kenya. Jamaican \u201cBlue\u201d and Hawaiian Kona Coffee (Hawaii is the only state to grow coffee) have earned goldstandard reputations, too, unfortunately with price tags to match \u2013 so valuable in price that \u201ccounterfeit\u201d scams have arisen.\nPrice has affected much of the world\u2019s attitude towards coffee. The British turned to tea as their favorite beverage and caffeine source when it was determined that one pound could yield up to 200 cups. This made it more affordable than coffee \u2013 except for the colonists who\u2019d had a tea tax imposed; the high price of tea incited protest not only in the 1773 Boston Tea Party but also in the form of a campaign to increase Americans\u2019 coffee intake. Bostonians were already great coffee drinkers and could claim the first colonial coffeehouse, ironically named the London Coffee House, opened in 1639. Yet, coffee would do an admirable job in its attempts to replace tea and liquor. By 1851 coffee consumption would soar to six-and-a-half pounds per average capita \u2013 in 1821 it was one-and-a-half-pounds \u2013 as alcohol was replaced by coffee stimulants in support of prohibitionist sentiment. Then in 1869 disaster struck: The coffee rust, Hamileia vastatrix, appeared in Ceylon and spread across the Orient. The sky-high coffee prices destroyed the coffee industry, and tea cultivation replaced the bean\u2019s propagation there \u2013 and foreshadowed what could happen to coffee consumption when natural disasters forced high prices. \u201cBlack frost\u201d would decimate Brazil\u2019s coffee bushes first in 1975 and then again in 1994; not coincidentally the 20-year span when consumption dropped 25 percent. However, Corby Kummer suggests in his book, The Joy of Coffee, an additional factor in coffee\u2019s decline \u2013 and an explanation for the explosion of the specialty coffee industry: Understanding that higher prices meant lower consumption, the big commercial coffee companies used more of the cheaper robusta beans to keep prices down. The coffee cost less, but its taste suffered, too. As a result, consumers scurried to soft drinks as their beverage choice (in the United States, coffee drinking was surpassed by soft drinks in 1975); except for those who knew about the good stuff. They figured out how to identify, develop, and promote great coffee and found that people would pay for taste.\nBack at Barrington, Barth stood with me in front of the roasting machine.

It involves pouring hot water over ground coffee, \u201cbreaking the crust\u201d \u2013 or plunging the spoon through the floating coffee grounds \u2013 closely smelling the coffee, then removing the crust and loudly and emphatically slurping the coffee from the spoon so as to spray it over as many taste buds as possible. Finally you\u2019re supposed to spit the coffee out. All quite impolite, of course, but it works.\nYou can truly taste the differences in the beans \u2013 we sample a Costa Rican, Sumatran, and a Jamaican Blue Mountain. The color of the roast was perceptible, too \u2013 there was cinnamon, city, and a French roast to test (from lightest to darkest the roasts are commonly termed: cinnamon, city, full-city, Vienna, Italian, and French). Yet what the cupping ultimately revealed of flavor went well beyond the color of the roast or the bean\u2019s origin to reach the art involved in roasting coffee beans.\nGreen or raw coffee is unroasted, the flavor locked inside. Heat is what releases the flavor complexities, but the application of fire to beans can accentuate or destroy the flavors. It requires skill and a sense of art \u2013 with the roasting ranging precisely between 12 and 16 minutes \u2013 and demands a knowledgeable eye and nose to determine readiness. As with any art, what you like is a matter of taste; and many of us have developed our own idiosyncratic preferences in coffee. The roaster becomes the maestro and collaborator in fulfilling the coffee flavor quest.

The Specialty Coffee Association of America reports that there were about 2,000 specialty coffee retailers in 1990, and more than 11,000 by the end of 1995.\nOf course, way out in front of the specialty pack is the $465 million a-year Starbucks, whose most phenomenal growth came in the l990s; earnings grew ten times through 1991 alone and sales were up 63 percent in 1995. Starbucks had started in the 1970s as a microroaster selling dark roast coffee beans (some roasters fondly call them \u201cCharbucks\u201d), then ten years ago they began taking to coffee cafes, airport kiosks, and historic register hotels to educate a whole baby-boomer generation about latte, cappuccino, and full city roast coffee.

I'm Jon Steinman.\nIt's been a long time in the making here on Deconstructing Dinner to air a feature on coffee, the second most valuable traded commodity in the world, second only to petroleum.\nAnd so if coffee is the most valuable agricultural commodity on the planet, then deconstructing coffee is possibly the closest we can come to deconstructing humanity itself.\nCoffee is constantly scrutinized for its human and social impacts around the world, but rarely do we examine the environmental consequences of a Tim Horton's Double Double; a Starbuck's Cappuccino; or even an Organic Fair Trade Espresso.\nI will say that there is no intention on this broadcast to undermine the significantly positive impact that the organic and fair trade movements have had on people and the planet. But we would be foolish to end our examination there. Because as we will learn today, the environmental and social impacts of coffee are far greater than anyone may imagine. And as the global population all too clearly recognizes now, the environmental impact of our presence on this planet is having more of a human impact than any fair trade rules or any international trade agreements.\nOn today's broadcast we will learn about the far-reaching environmental impacts of coffee, which among them, include an imminent and significant threat to three critical animal species on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. And we will hear from Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund on this issue. We will also hear from Daniel Fourwinds, a pioneer in the organization and distribution of a coffee bean that claims to provide more money per pound to villagers than any other bean in the world, and does so with the least environmental impact. Daniel is the founder of Capulin coffee, and he spoke to me over the phone from Nayarit, Mexico.\nWe will also hear a segment produced here in Nelson, British Columbia featuring Benji Hansen, the owner of the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9; a roadside espresso stand that exclusively sells this Capulin coffee, and is encouraging an even greater level of social and environmental change by not offering any take-out cups. An interesting idea for what is essentially a drive-thru coffee shop.\nincrease music and fade out\nBefore we hear from my first guest, I would like to first share some of my thoughts that arose throughout the preparation for today's broadcast. As was just mentioned a feature on coffee has never before appeared on this program. And I feel as though it's important to first justify why it's taken so long to do so given Deconstructing Dinner has now been on the air since January 2006, and given coffee is quite essential to many of our meals. And it's for two reasons. First off, when we think of social justice and human rights in relation to our food, coffee is I think undisputedly, the most recognized food and beverage product through which we can connect these issues. So it is for this reason, that attempts have been made to steer clear from featuring coffee, out of fear that we would forget that right here in Canada, agricultural products are also unfairly traded.\nAs a society we are still a long ways away from embracing the idea of fair trade carrots, fair trade grains, or fair trade beef. And the socially-responsible coffee campaigns have been so successful, that caf\u00e9s all across the country are selling fair trade coffee, yet nothing else on the menu has been fairly traded such as the integral sugar so many of us place into a fresh brew.\nAnd so that is one reason I've steered clear of coffee here on the program, and the second, is that coffee truly represents a window into the human condition. With a history so rich with happiness, sadness, blood, sweat and tears, exploring our connection to coffee is as I see it, exploring our connection to our planet, to each other and to ourselves, and with the endless issues to investigate following such an understanding, I had feared that any first show on coffee, would lead to the need to feature many more on the topic. And I can say that after putting today's show together, this will not be the last cup of coffee here on the program.\nWe live in a time right now that may very well be the most exciting and pivotal time in the history of humankind, given our long-standing dominion over this planet is literally crumbling beneath our feet. And the detachment we have allowed to exist between us and this earth is now recognized to be the greatest mistake we could have ever made. But as the mainstream media has so quickly pointed the finger, I for one do not observe that this mistake as rooted in our reliance on fossil fuels, nor rooted in capitalism, SUVs or travelling in airplanes, but rooted in our isolation from the natural world. And this has bred a level of selfishness that continues to spread from country to country, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Coffee, as will become clearer during this broadcast, is a beverage that is founded upon this very selfishness and this greed as it was colonialism, slavery, and a relentless deforestation that brought coffee to where it exists today.\nAll over the world people sit down in homes, in coffee shops, in automobiles, seeking a moment of happiness, in a cup of coffee. But in a cappuccino, in a latt\u00e9 or an Americano, is a destruction that is incomprehensible. And so long as we justify our consumption of coffee because of how integral it is to our lives, then the accompanying human impact that is understood to extend to farmers will come back to impact we, the consumers, ourselves. And this, we are now too clearly aware of.\nsoundbite\nWhen you last enjoyed a cup of coffee, did you ever consider that it may be endangering three animal species on the other side of the planet? Located on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia is Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park where three of the world's most endangered large species are found - the rhino, the elephant, and the tiger. The park itself is home to roughly a quarter of the entire wild populations of Sumatran rhinos and elephants.\nOne of the most recent threats to the population of these animals has been the illegal cultivation of coffee, coffee that ends up here in North America. The Washington D.C.-based World Wildlife Fund has taken on this issue because as they state, the current rate of illegal forest destruction to grow this illegal coffee may lead to the local extinction of these species by 2010; not very long from now. The World Wildlife Fund released a report in January of this year 2007 titled \"Gone In An Instant,\" and in it they document their investigation into which of the world's major coffee buyers are purchasing this illegal coffee.\nSo I spoke with Adam Tomasek, who leads the development of WWF's work in Indonesia and Malaysia. Adam joined the organization in 2001, and he spoke to me over the phone from Washington D.C.\nAdam Tomasek: Our first inclination was to look at the impacts on this national park and see the three very interesting and unique species that called this park home - Sumatra Tiger and rhino and elephant and in particular among ninety or so other mammal species. And what we found was that coffee production or coffee-dominated agricultural systems run by small holding farm families was really causing them the major impact in deforestation within the park itself and unfortunately overlapping with the known distributions and home ranges of a lot of these big mammals.\nJS: As the idea of illegal coffee may be new to some, Adam describes what makes this coffee so illegal.\nAT: The term \"illegal coffee\" comes up and it's a confusing one I admit, because it's really illegally produced coffee. And the fact of the matter is, is that coffee that is being grown inside the boundaries of the national park is an illegal land-use, it goes against the legal framework around the national park itself. And therefore anything that is actually being produced inside of the park is termed as being illegal. Now this goes beyond just coffee; obviously there are other agricultural crops that are being grown in these small-scale farm systems but coffee really is the major commodity that is dominating these systems right now.\nJS: With the cultivation of coffee dominating the destruction of this critical national park in Indonesia, Adam provides an illustration of just how much of this park has disappeared.\nAT: Our Indonesian office has been working here in this park for well over a decade now. And through the various surveys in research in conservation programs that are being carried out, we were quickly concerned with the disappearance of forest cover. And through a series of estimates both done by ourselves and other colleagues of other conservation groups, NGO colleagues, and government officials, we were able to characterize the overall forest loss at about just about 30%. And that means that roughly a third of this national park has been either deforested or degraded in different ways over the past number of years. And this is quite concerning because we've seen an upward trend in the level of forest loss and this is something that we are continuing to refine because the data that is available is often one or two years out-of-date if it's from satellite imagery. And so we're actually still now refining that classification. But what we know right now is that about a third of the park has been deforested.\nJS: We will shortly learn where this illegal coffee is ending up and which companies are purchasing these beans. But first, we learn more about the scope of this danger, that cappuccino's and latt\u00e9s are presenting to these three animal species in the park.\nAT: Within the three major species of concern - the tigers, the rhinos, and the elephants, if we first just look at the overall numbers of the species themselves, we're looking at about, a rough estimate of around forty tigers and that's about 10% of the population that's left on the island. And this is the only species of Indonesian tiger that's left - the Sumatran Tiger. So this really is the last remnant in terms of tiger's on the island.\nFrom the perspective of the Sumatran Elephant, we're looking at right around 500 or so that exist and this is about 20% or so of the elephants that are found on the island. And then from the perspective of rhinos, again, it's anywhere between 15-25% of the rhinos. There's an estimate between 40 and 60 of the rhinos that are found in this park alone. So you have very significant populations of these three species found in this park and that really is one of the reasons why we were so concerned with this issue. I don't want to fail to point out that a number of other groups have also prioritized this park itself, this national park as a priority to the extent that the United Nations has classified it as a world heritage site.\nJS: The Indonesian province of Lampung, where this national park is located is the primary area of coffee production in the country. And the pressure on the park is in large part due to the ease at which coffee can be grown and sold in the area. But as Adam describes this kind of coffee being grown there, we also learn that it is also the new energy drink craze that is fueling the destruction of this forest and these animal species.\nAT: The coffee that is grown in this region in this part of Sumatra is Robusta Coffee. Now this is the variety that is often found in instant coffees, well it is actually preferred for instant coffees. But it is also used to blend in with the higher quality Arabica Coffee that is grown in other parts of Indonesia. Arabica is really the variety of coffee that most consumers in North America and in the western world are familiar with. It's the type of coffee that you go and purchase in coffee houses. It has good quality flavours. Robusta, on the other hand, is considered to coffee experts to be the little lower quality but higher caffeine content coffee so there's a lot more bang for the buck so to speak in terms of the caffination within this variety of bean.\nAnd it's interesting that this part of the island of Sumatra is really the epicenter of the coffee trade for the entire country of Indonesia. Indonesia is the world's fourth largest producer of coffee but it's also the world's second largest producer of Robusta variety coffee. So it's extremely important to the economic of this part of the island, but nationally the trade is about 70% of the trade of coffee goes through the port that is 100 miles or so away from this very national park. So it's a real driver that is routed right in this part of the island.\nJS: And you're tuned in to Deconstructing Dinner, produced at Kootenay Co-op Radio in Nelson, British Columbia. Today's broadcast is titled \"Coffee, The Earth, and The Future of Civilization\" - a pretty serious title for a show, but laying coffee out on the table so to speak and looking behind the mug, really does expose a window into ourselves.\nWe're presently listening to clips from my interview with Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund and their efforts to track the cultivation of illegal coffee on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, where the rapid destruction of a protected national park is threatening the future survival of three key animal species.\nThe World Wildlife Fund published a report released in January 2007 that traced this very illegal coffee to the major international buyers, and Adam Tomasek explains why the organization chose to undertake such an investigation.\nAT: As we started looking deeper into this problem we really didn't know where it was going to lead us. We knew it was a complicated issue and the more we looked the more confusing it was. The supply chain for coffee and in this region, even inside of the park and outside of the park or in neighbouring provinces, it's really similar to a spider web; but a disorganized spider web. One that has all sorts of different points along the supply chain where coffee is bought, sold, traded, and mixed together with coffee from other parts of the area or other regions. And then is traded through middle men and stored in warehouses and purchased by a variety of different groups from those warehouses. And then eventually taken to the provincial capital and that is where the port is located where it is all shipped out. And what we found through all this background research was that the international buyers were really the largest in terms of volume purchasers of the coffee. And so that directly led us then to focusing more on to who might be some of the players that could be involved in reversing or changing this current situation.\nJS: To learn of who these international buyers are, we can quickly look back to our recent expose of Kraft Foods here on Deconstructing Dinner. Because the largest buyer of this illegal coffee is Kraft Foods, who, according to the WWF's data from 2005, are responsible for between 20-30% of the overall purchase of coffee from the region in question. Other major buyers that would be recognizable to Canadians are Nestle and Lavazza, who is a well-known supplier to restaurants and the Timothy's Coffee chain.\nFollowing their research in 2005, the World Wildlife Fund addressed letters to all of the largest purchasers, and more detailed information on their responses will be linked from the Deconstructing Dinner website. But here's brief overview of these responses.\nAT: As we went through the research and started to get a good handle for who was at the receiving end or the buying end of a lot of the coffee, we looked into how would we best communicate with these companies knowing that we're not coffee experts and knowing that they likely are not fully aware of the source of their products. And so what we did was we started just by sending a simple letter to the companies that we could easily identify, notifying them of the research that we've been doing. We provided them with a draft of the findings of the research at that point and time and asked for their comments; raising the point that we are confident in knowing that coffee that is being produced within inside the park is being mixed with coffee that is being grounded in other areas outside of the park. Which means that the overall coffee supply chain is really tainted; that there really isn't any level of confidence in purchasing coffee from this part of Sumatra.\nThe variety of responses that we got back from companies was interesting. Some companies have yet to actually respond. Others responded and thanked us for the letter but disagreed with the findings. And other companies like Kraft were very straightforward and very earnest in their response in terms of being concerned about the issue and offering to learn more from us about what we've been doing on the ground and the research and what we've been finding. But also to begin the dialogue about how we might be able to change the current situation.\nJS: Again, more information on the responses received will be linked to from the Deconstructing Dinner website. And that website is cjly.net/deconstructingdinner.\nNow that the letters have been sent, Adam describes the dialogue that has taken place since the issue was placed before the major buyers of this illegal coffee.\nAT: Well there's been obviously a lot of dialogue. When the letters went in 2005 some of the responses didn't come in until toward the end of the year or the beginning part of 2006. And we've started to follow-up with some of them. With Kraft in particular, over the course of the last year or so, we had a number of meetings either at their headquarters in Chicago or here in Washington where I'm based, to really go into more detail about what the issues are and since sending that letter some of the new findings that we've been able to generate in terms of new areas of coffee production within the park or new entities be it traders or other companies being involved in, etc. We're just now at the point, over the past two months, we've concluded what we call the first multi-stakeholder workshop in Indonesia to address this issue of coffee trade. And there were a little over 160 participants who were there, most of them from different levels of Indonesian government, the National Park Authority itself.\nThe industry was quite strongly represented by trade associations, producer associations, traders themselves, some of the coffee recipients, the big international buyer companies as well as NGOs and others.\nA part of this workshop was essentially a declaration and it was a declaration to bring about responsibility within the coffee sector, particularly in this region and within this park. And so we're now in the process of implementing that framework that we think can really change how coffee is produced and how the habitats of the tigers and elephants and the rhinos in this park can really be preserved and restored where possible.\nJS: And again, we're currently learning about the steps now being taken to ensure the preservation of three key animal species in a national park in Indonesia, where the illegal deforestation for the cultivation of coffee is threatening their very survival. As Kraft is the major purchaser of this illegal coffee, Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund lists some of the immediate steps that companies need to now take.\nAT: Well one of the most immediate needs is to have the major international buyers who buy in such large volumes really send the message down to through their supply chain - through their networks and traders and exporters and other groups that they're concerned about this problem. That it's unacceptable within the code of conduct, within their own business. That they want and demand verification of legality within the coffee that they're buying. A lot of companies have already done that and actually started to do that the first time they received the letter.\nA second part to that is really that right now that the coffee harvest is ongoing in Sumatra. Really what we're focused on is bringing together these various groups - the international buyers, the government, the park authorities itself, conservation organizations like ourselves who have the infrastructure and staff on the ground, to be able to take advantage as soon as this coffee harvest season is done with. To start to put into place that framework around a verifiable chain of custody that would then be able to provide the coffee with the confidence that's needed and that's really requested by these companies that is being legally produced outside of the park itself.\nJS: As mentioned earlier, the WWF predicts that at the current rate of forest destruction, the potential extinction of these animal species may come as early as 2010. And we hear more on these consequences should nothing be done to respond to this threat.\nAT: Well, it's quite dire, I mean to be completely honest. The analysis that we've been working on most recently is showing that coffee production is increasing in a couple of extremely critical habitats for the Sumatran Elephants and the Sumatran Tigers. And if nothing changed, we could assure ourselves that what we'll end up with is fragmented sub-populations of these major species which will have obvious long term negative impacts on their viability and their reproduction. And that is something that was presented at this multi-stakeholder workshop in the sense that we can really start to look at in very fine detail, at the levels of fragmentation within certain areas that we know to be where our surveys have told us and have shown us, are some of the most important areas for these species. And if we don't address that now, the coffee that is being produced there is going to be responsible for the demise of these species.\nJS: The report released in 2007 titled \"Gone In An Instant\" listed three major stakeholders who should take the lead in addressing this issue. But missing from the list was the consumer. And in closing out my conversation with Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund, I inquired into how consumers can become involved.\nAT: As we have seen with other commodities, consumer pressure is a very powerful force and it can be a real tool for bringing about change. In our report the recommendations being focused on consumers because we really felt like we had to deal with the issues at hand in a very immediate fashion because of severity of the problems that we are finding. And the time it takes to mount consumer pressure is often a slower developing process than going directly to some of the known international buyers and roasters and government authorities themselves.\nBut in terms of recommendations, I think falling into line as we've seen with other commodities, where consumers have voiced their concern about where the products that they're consuming and they're purchasing are coming from directly to the companies, would be completely feasible and would be welcomed in this case.\nThe difficulty with Robusta coffee in particular is that it's rather ubiquitous with being caffeinated beverages. It can be found in instant coffees and a lot of caffeinated drinks, we know to be used in the growing market around the popular energy drinks and things like that. So I think that the consumers who are concerned about this issue - you know writing a simple letter, picking up the phone, giving a company a call if they're a regular consumer of one of these products. Or if they even have questions as to whether or not the product they're consuming does potentially contain this coffee from this region would be a great help to the overall cause.\nJS: And that was Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund. The report titled \"Gone In An Instant\" provides a far greater background on this topic, and will be made available through a link on the Deconstructing Dinner website at cjly.net/deconstructingdinner. And you can learn more about the WWF on their website at wwf.org.\nAnd to close out this segment, I will note that the Kraft products that this illegal coffee most likely makes its way into, consist of Maxwell House and Nabob, along with Nestle products such as Nescafe.\nsoundbite\nAnd you're listening to Deconstructing Dinner. I'm Jon Steinman. I'd like to quickly pass along a reminder that this radio program is available as a Podcast for any listeners who are interested in downloading the show on a weekly basis to your iPods or portable music players. And information on how to do so can be found on our website.\nThe title of today's broadcast is \"Coffee, The Earth and The Future of Civilization.\" In this next segment we will see how all three of these are connected. Located in the state of Nayarit in Mexico, is a coffee that presents a perfect illustration of where our food system has gone wrong. And is doing so by providing an alternative to the destruction that, in the case of coffee, has driven millions from their lands, has destroyed forests and wildlife around the world, and decreased the quality of coffee to a point where the difference in flavour is astounding. And having tasted this coffee myself, it is in no doubt, one of the most decadent coffees that I have ever tasted.\nLocated here in Nelson is a small roadside espresso bar that exclusively sells a coffee known as Capulin. This espresso stand is not only selling a coffee that provides an opportunity for significant social and environmental change, but is encouraging its own social and environmental change by refusing to provide take-out containers. Now this may not seem to be too absurd, but take into consideration that the espresso stand is on the side of the main highway running through the city, and is essentially a drive-thru coffee shop. And I'll leave that as a teaser, because we will hear more on this incredibly unique caf\u00e9 at the end of today's broadcast. And first we will travel to the state of Nayarit Mexico where Capulin coffee originates.\nCapulin is being distributed internationally with the hope that it will provide an insight into how and why the people upon whose lands the richest agricultural crop in the world is produced, are amongst the poorest people in the world and exactly how 'we the consumers', might exercise control over the resulting poverty and devastation.\nThe founder of this project is Daniel Fourwinds who based in Tucson, Arizona spoke to me over the phone from Mexico, about 30 minutes from the jungle where the village is located. Daniel discovered Capulin over 20 years ago while on vacation in the area. He's one of a growing number of people questioning the fair trade standard and the many labels now being associated with brands of coffee.\nDaniel Fourwinds: Coffee was originally introduced as Arabian wine. It's very intoxicating when it is a natural processed coffee. And that's the real key and the real misunderstanding of people that would be concerned. We can just drop the people that aren't concerned. We're not reaching those people. They're not willing to pay more than the minimum price for coffee; they're not concerned about the environment; they're not concerned about the social order of what's going on behind their cup. My approach is always to the concerned, to the interested or the seekers. Now these people, the people that really want to make a difference on the planet have been, I would almost say \"bought up\" by these little tags that we have become accustomed to, such as shade grown, fair trade, equal exchange. These are all little words and labels that some company has grabbed.\nJS: Coffee has become one of the most recognizable products that has a significant social impact around the world. But Daniel Fourwinds sees that the foundation for the environmental destruction, the poverty and hunger that plague global coffee growing regions is a result of a process that most coffee drinkers have probably never heard of. And this is what is known as water processing, a technique implemented by the industrial producers of coffee. And here we learn how the selfish pursuit of money has resulted in poorer quality coffee, poverty, hunger, environmental destruction, and now, the most pressing symptom of this destruction, climate change.\nDF: Quality in coffee comes from the cherry, but then it depends on what was done to that cherry. This didn't happen before, let's say fifty years ago. About fifty years ago after the war, the corporations took over the largest drug industry on the planet. They were pretty much in control of it before but the big boys moved in. These folks have developed a process called \"water processing\" or what most coffees are, are caf\u00e9 lavado, washed coffees. That means that someone picked the cherry, floated it in water. The problem is and the reason they use water is because bad fleet seeds float and as they use in many industries. And so they placed the coffee, unskinned, in water to float off the bad ones. But right now the bad ones are sticky and the good ones are sticky and the good ones and the bad ones stick together and the bad one will float off two or three good ones.\nSo the companies in their wisdom said, well let's ferment that sugar and then it's not sticky anymore. And this allows the bad beans to float free. Well, this eliminated the women who had processed coffee by hand. They didn't have to take the bad seeds out because the company floated them out.\nIn this floating process, your coffee basically goes through three major changes. One, the oils that are your flavour are solvented by the alcohol and so the bean comes out opaque, washed out. The sugars that traditionally would have been dried in are fermented so it makes the processing easier. And then the sugars that naturally would be sweet, are not dried into the coffee; they are fermented. And then the caffeine, which is a H20 chemical bonding crystal, that's the way they extract caffeine in water. Well if you process your coffee in water, what happened to the fine alkaloids of caffeine? So what really takes place is consumer loss in the processing to make coffee cheap.\nSo now we have a major problem that arises in the villages is that the labour that normally went into coffee has been floated out and that's where the most serious devastation occurs because there's no work in the villages.\nSo anybody that really, I'm serious, really wants to take care of the jungle or has any social heart whatsoever must realize that by floating the labour out of the villages, you float the pay cheques, the salaries, the incomes, the food off of these people's table.\nJS: And this is Deconstructing Dinner. Now having an understanding of what water processing is, Daniel further emphasizes how it's the very unemployment created by the industrial coffee industry that has led to the devastation of the jungle. His comments also introduce a recent topic discussed here on the program and that is why so many migrant workers coming to Canada are so willing to leaves their families for upwards to eight months of the year.\nDF: The devastation of the jungle is occurring because you have all the people unemployed. The connection is, is unemployed people cut trees because there's no cherries to work. They consume the animals and the birds. They consume everything like a blight upon the jungle. They don't want to do it, they don't want to starve. And most of them take the walk \"a thousand miles to the frontier\" not too lightly. They have to leave their families to send money home to maintain them because there is no work in the village. So it really isn't people coming in and buying up mass tracks of jungle. It's the jungle dwellers consuming the forest that people don't understand. That's the link between washed coffee and natural coffee.\nJS: We are currently listening to segments from my conversation with Daniel Fourwinds of Capulin Coffee. Daniel spoke to me over the phone from Nayarit, Mexico.\nIt's been rather troubling for myself recently to open up a newspaper or check out a television newscast and witness the way the mainstream media is reporting on climate change. The tone that overrides much of the content is, \"well how can we sustain our lifestyles, but do so with less of an impact.\" Adding to this discontent, there is little to no coverage on the topic of agriculture and food. How many newscasts have reported that the U.N. has discovered that 18% of all human-caused greenhouse gases originate from livestock. Instead the focus on much of the climate change debate is on energy, and alternative sources of energy. But we forget that the most sustainable energy is ourselves.\nCapulin Coffee yet again presents a window back in time to the days before the advent of fossil fuels, and Daniel Fourwinds draws out a picture of the human energy that goes into producing this coffee.\nDF: Orginally, the caravans use to come in here on mules and bring out bags of gold. It was called \"oro\" gold. Why, because all the labour from the entire season went into it. The men picked the cherries and then they had to dry them for weeks in the sun. And when they were brittle they had hammered them with wooden mallets. Later of course the Burr Mill came in, but in the early days it was all done by hand. And so the beans were pounded and then they were whittled and cast into the air. And then the coffee was passed through the families, the elders, and the children, and the women. And they sat around and they took out the bad beans and the broken beans and the misshapen and miscoloured, and they selected the cream of the crop - oro. And they sold it and they survived on it.\nBut once the corporations came in and said, \"Well, we don't want to have to pay for all that labour.\" That they applied the water process to eliminate the labour. And that was great for giving you all a cheaper cup of coffee. But it's not good for the consumer, it's good for the planet, and it's not good for the planet's caretakers in the village. So the only ones that really gain are your big multinational corporations.\nJS: As the industrialization of coffee has led to such devastation in coffee growing regions, we of course cannot ignore that currently, coffee is distributed around the world, using fossil fuels. And Daniel comments on this concern.\nDF: We have to start somewhere. The largest industry and most destructive industry on our planet is petroleum. We're shackled. Everyone is strung into petroleum. It's an environmentally disastrous product; but it's what we currently have. We can't get rid of it tomorrow or in a year or in two years or five years; we're still going to be addicted to petroleum.\nBut coffee, coffee is the second largest cash river on the planet. Imagine taking that flow and directing it directly into the poorest people on the planet. The wealthy always will end up. Our project is to expose how we can direct the money back into the village and let it trickle up from after feeding the people. This is taking billions of dollars directly out of corporate hands and putting directly into hungry people's tables.\nAnd what we're suggesting is that if we had enough people that stopped supporting the water processed industry, I don't care what product it is, I don't care what label it has. If it was processed in water - if it wasn't naturally processed, the planet loses. The consumer loses because he has no quality in this product. The environment loses because the people in order to survive are consuming the jungle that we are talking about protecting. They're consuming the birds that we talk about protecting. But we go to Starbucks and we give Mr. Batarsucks our money - dollars. Not dimes - dollars. Imagine redirecting some of those dollars back to feeding people. They'll stop cutting the trees. They will stop becoming foreign illegal aliens seeking work because they've been starved off their land. And then their land they have to sell and they of course have to sell cheap to the people that have the money. Well who has the money? All these multinational corporations, that's who has the money.\nJS: And this is Deconstructing Dinner. On a financial level, Capulin coffee provides an income to the farmers and villagers that is enough to live on, a luxury that most farmers around the world are not afforded. Daniel Fourwinds claims that Capulin provides more money per pound directly to local villagers than any other coffee company on the Planet.\nDF: Now with Capulin, we've been doing this for 23 years. We provide more money to a farmer, twice as much money as any coffee growers on the planet receive. Now that's a big, big stake. I'm going to say it again because it's really, really important that people understand. We are paying double what the commercial industry pays. That's our guarantee to the people. Whatever the water processes are paying, we're doubling. And we have done that now for 23 years. And our quality is unsurpassable. You can do it as well, and maybe every year if somebody did just what we did - took 100% fully matured cherries and turned them every day once or twice, piled them at night, covered them from the dew, re-spread them in the morning - tons and tons and tons and tons of cherries being done just as though you are only doing one pound. And this is what we offer in Capulin. The highest, most stimulating, sweetest leaf bitter coffee available.\nJS: In closing out my conversation with Daniel Fourwinds, he ends with a comment that really could apply to anything it is we do here in Canada. That so long as we remain ignorant to where our food is coming from, such ignorance is, in and of itself, destroying the environment and destroying ourselves.\nDF: People do what they do because they don't know. The quality in the cup of a 100% fully matured cherry that's been hand-processed, you can't do it any better. But you could do it as well. Somewhere on the planet there's going to be the best. But you can only really be the best if you have naturally processed that coffee. If you fermented it, floated it in water, and then sell it to the public under the fair trade label, or the equal exchange, or the bird-friendly, or the ... and they are all water processed coffees. They all strip the incomes from the village. They all force the villagers to survive off the land. Well how do you that. Well you cut the trees. And if your wife gets sick you cut 10 trees and if your little girl gets sick too you cut 20 trees. And that's what people have to understand, is the destruction - social and environmental, is directly attributable to the water processing of coffee, aside from the millions and millions of gallons of water that are polluted by the process. It is the people attempting to survive after the season is over.\nJS: And that was Daniel Fourwinds of Capulin Coffee. Daniel spoke to me over the phone from Nayarit Mexico and you can learn more about Capulin coffee on their website at capulin.com. And if you're interested in getting in touch with a Canadian distributor of the coffee who is actually based here in Nelson, there will be information posted on our website on how to do so.\nSo now we've explored where the Capulin coffee beans originate, but where do they end up. Well one place is located here in Nelson, British Columbia, and that is the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9. A newly established espresso stand that operates out of the back of a trailer. The coffee sold exclusively at the caf\u00e9 is Capulin Coffee. But the real interest of this next segment is the social and environmental change that this caf\u00e9 is encouraging, and it has nothing to do with the beans themselves. The Clean Bean Caf\u00e9 is located directly beside the main highway running through the city, and is essentially a drive-thru coffee shop. But here's the scoop, The Clean Bean Caf\u00e9 does not provide any disposable take-out containers - no take-out cups. Certainly a new approach to take-out coffee service that I for one, have never seen. And here's a segment featuring the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9's Benji Hansen.\nJS on highway: This probably has to be the closest interview that I have ever done to the radio station. We are literally one block away from the radio station here on the streets of Nelson. And I'm standing here beside what literally is a highway with Benji Hansen of the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9. And now that we have learned where the beans are coming from in Mexico we are not here on the streets of Nelson learning where the beans end up, in the mugs of people.\nespresso machine sound\nBH: I first encountered Capulin in Tucson, Arizona working at a vegetarian restaurant - the Oasis Vegetarian Eatery. I was a bartender there, it was an alcohol-free bar, so one of the main drinks I was able to serve up was espresso.\nespresso machine sound\nWe happened to serve exclusively Capulin beans. Daniel Fourwinds was that man who happened to teach me the art of espresso, how to taste espresso. He turned me on to the character of Capulin, the origin of Capulin, and what makes it what it is.\nguitar and singing\nJS: One of your last customers came in and said that they come here for your energy. But you say that the energy isn't really coming from you but it's coming through the coffee.\nBH: I guess the way I see and the way I feel it, it's the energy of the earth being uninterrupted because this coffee is Arabica Typica Trees are growing in the rain forest, in the jungle. Those are happy trees and they putting out happy cherries. Which got right in the middle of them, they got happy beans. And they got happy people touching these beans, working these beans by hand and with hand tools from turning with shovels the cherries as they dry in the sun to whittling, hauling and whittling the beans and then hand processing these beans. That to me is the most beautiful thing - the most beautiful bean I've ever encountered; the fact that it is considered from all the way from the earth to the separating table to the cup. It's uninterrupted love. And I just can't help but to be excited about it; I can't help but to love it.\nJS: Now as Daniel so eloquently puts it, this coffee is social change in a cup. But in your little hut here, right on the side of the highway you have your own sort of level of social change that you're encouraging. And here we are standing as more or less a drive-thru espresso shop yet you don't offer any takeout containers.\nDH: Shoot man, that's my conscience. I can't stand walking down the sidewalk seeing a paper cup that's been walked on, driven over on the street. It breaks my heart to know that cup was once, well it depends on how you break it apart, but the ink there's the petroleum products that have been used as a sealant and there's also the meat of trees laying there on the street. And I can't stand for that. And I can't stand to see it even in a trash bin let alone on the street. And there's no point, there's plenty of artisans making beautiful ceramic mugs - works of art. And even there's a good bit of vintage mugs out there too that are maybe looking for a home, sitting on the shelf at your local thrift shop.\nJS: Well, see you have this collection of mugs here and you've referred to your mugs as your children and that here it is a mug orphanage. And I notice when people come up to ask for a coffee, that you contemplate what kind of mug you want to give them. What's going through your head when you're deciding which mug is going to be the best mug for your customer.\nBH: Well, there are a few mugs here in my orphanage, if you will, have been handcrafted by local artisans. So number one, if they are going to stick around the trailer I might give them a special, one of those special mugs. If they are going to walk down the street, I may send them away with a more, more generic say mug. People are dropping off mugs all the time. I do appreciate the ones that have special markings. I have one with a Fozzy mug (glass clinking) that got The Muppet Show and he's got his finger, yeah just special mugs like that.\nJS: You mention that people walk away with their mugs and I've been watching the people come up here, order a coffee, you put it in a mug, and then they walk away. I mean this is something no one ever sees anywhere. And I likened it in that the other day to going through the drive-thru at McDonalds and instead of you receiving your paper bag and styrofoam containers, you'd instead receive re-useable plates and they trust that you are going to bring those plates back. And the idea of that's almost absurd for most people that that would ever happen. But here you're letting people walk away with mugs.\nDH: They're coming back. And if not, they must have found a good home. I trust that people won't just disregard a mug as something to be set and forgotten. Someone, somewhere, at some point in time is going to consider that mug; not just throw it into a trash bin. At least give it, like I say, to the local thrift shop and yeah, mugs have a life of their own. They're not easily tossed by the wayside.\nJS: If you have people coming up here who see this as a take-out drive-thru espresso stand, what's the response from people when they recognize well there's no take-out cups? What kind of responses do you get?\nDH: Oh, I've had an assortment of responses. Everybody seems to have responded in their own way but definitely taken aback, seemingly on the verge of frustration and then realization that, \"oh, I like this idea. I don't have to throw something away.\" And most people, most often are more than pleased to take the ceramic mug. I've had probably three customers come and actually turn around and leave because I didn't have cups with lids. And that doesn't make me, yeah I can still smile and give out ceramic mugs and not even stop to consider buying paper cups.\nJS: You use the words \"slowing down.\" Can you talk about this idea of how your coffee stand is allowing people to slow down?\nBH: It's a beautiful thing our friend the ceramic mugs. Numerous times folks pull up on their way through, maybe not from town, maybe from Castlegar, maybe going through on this highway and they're anticipate picking up their coffee and hopping back in their car. They realize there are so many ceramic mugs. They do, they stop, and on the verge of being upset they say, \"well, maybe I can sit down and enjoy this coffee.\" It's a beautiful thing, people get to stop and enjoy themselves in the middle of the day and also feel good about the fact that they aren't throwing a cup away, just for convenience sake. It's a beautiful thing to be able to offer people that opportunity.\nsoundbite\nJS: And this is Deconstructing Dinner, and that segment featured Benji Hansen of the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9 in Nelson, British Columbia. You can find Benji's espresso trailer in the parking lot of Kas Restaurant on Highway 3A just down from Hall Street.\nAnd for any Canadian listeners, restaurants or retail outlets wishing to get their hands on Capulin coffee, there will be contact info on our website on how to do so, and just look under the May 4th broadcast. There will also be some contact info for Benji Hansen should you want to learn more about his coffee mug revolution. And for any non-Canadian listeners, you can check out the website for Capulin coffee at capulin.com.\nsoundbite\nTo close out today's broadcast I wanted to quickly go through a brief list of some environmental impacts of coffee production that were not touched on during today's broadcast. The World Wildlife Fund has a great web page listing off some of these impacts, and this research is courtesy of Jason Clay, who for anyone who caught our July 20, 2006 broadcast titled \"Shocking Sugar,\" you may remember his role in highlighting the environmental impacts of sugar cane cultivation and sugar production.\nJason Clay authored an excellent book titled \"World Agriculture and Environment,\" published by Island Press. In it he highlights the most serious impact as being the deforestation that was just referred to on today's broadcast. Deforestation itself represents 20-25% of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Of the 50 countries in the world with the highest deforestation rates from 1990 to 1995, 37 of them were coffee producers.\nThis has led to biodiversity loss, which from studies undertaken in Colombia and Mexico, indicate that full-sun coffee plantations support 90% fewer bird species than shade-grown coffee. But as he points out, the thinning or clearing of forests for even a shade-grown coffee is a major concern as considerable biodiversity is lost both above and below ground.\nSoil degradation is yet another concern from coffee cultivation as following deforestation, the land is cultivated using practices that eventually rob the soil of its nutrients. These practices further lead to soil erosion, and eventually the land becomes useless, unless of course chemicals derived from fossil fuels are placed into the soil and are affordable to farmers.\nDegradation of water quality was also touched on during today's broadcast, and Jason Clay's book expands on this by describing the process that occurs when the waste coffee pulp is dumped into rivers. When dumping this organic material into river systems, its decomposition requires oxygen and this lower oxygen level in the river systems then leads to fish kills. And with no fish in the rivers, the cycle of destruction continues from there.\nA link to more information on the environmental impacts of coffee production will be made available on the Deconstructing Dinner website.\nanonymous: Deconstructing Dinner is made possible by the generous support from Ryerson University's Centre for Studies and Food Security, and West Coast Seeds at phone number 604-952-8820.

I'm Jon Steinman.\nIt's been a long time in the making here on Deconstructing Dinner to air a feature on coffee, the second most valuable traded commodity in the world, second only to petroleum.\nAnd so if coffee is the most valuable agricultural commodity on the planet, then deconstructing coffee is possibly the closest we can come to deconstructing humanity itself.\nCoffee is constantly scrutinized for its human and social impacts around the world, but rarely do we examine the environmental consequences of a Tim Horton's Double Double; a Starbuck's Cappuccino; or even an Organic Fair Trade Espresso.\nI will say that there is no intention on this broadcast to undermine the significantly positive impact that the organic and fair trade movements have had on people and the planet. But we would be foolish to end our examination there. Because as we will learn today, the environmental and social impacts of coffee are far greater than anyone may imagine. And as the global population all too clearly recognizes now, the environmental impact of our presence on this planet is having more of a human impact than any fair trade rules or any international trade agreements.\nOn today's broadcast we will learn about the far-reaching environmental impacts of coffee, which among them, include an imminent and significant threat to three critical animal species on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. And we will hear from Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund on this issue. We will also hear from Daniel Fourwinds, a pioneer in the organization and distribution of a coffee bean that claims to provide more money per pound to villagers than any other bean in the world, and does so with the least environmental impact. Daniel is the founder of Capulin coffee, and he spoke to me over the phone from Nayarit, Mexico.\nWe will also hear a segment produced here in Nelson, British Columbia featuring Benji Hansen, the owner of the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9; a roadside espresso stand that exclusively sells this Capulin coffee, and is encouraging an even greater level of social and environmental change by not offering any take-out cups. An interesting idea for what is essentially a drive-thru coffee shop.\nincrease music and fade out\nBefore we hear from my first guest, I would like to first share some of my thoughts that arose throughout the preparation for today's broadcast. As was just mentioned a feature on coffee has never before appeared on this program. And I feel as though it's important to first justify why it's taken so long to do so given Deconstructing Dinner has now been on the air since January 2006, and given coffee is quite essential to many of our meals. And it's for two reasons. First off, when we think of social justice and human rights in relation to our food, coffee is I think undisputedly, the most recognized food and beverage product through which we can connect these issues. So it is for this reason, that attempts have been made to steer clear from featuring coffee, out of fear that we would forget that right here in Canada, agricultural products are also unfairly traded.\nAs a society we are still a long ways away from embracing the idea of fair trade carrots, fair trade grains, or fair trade beef. And the socially-responsible coffee campaigns have been so successful, that caf\u00e9s all across the country are selling fair trade coffee, yet nothing else on the menu has been fairly traded such as the integral sugar so many of us place into a fresh brew.\nAnd so that is one reason I've steered clear of coffee here on the program, and the second, is that coffee truly represents a window into the human condition. With a history so rich with happiness, sadness, blood, sweat and tears, exploring our connection to coffee is as I see it, exploring our connection to our planet, to each other and to ourselves, and with the endless issues to investigate following such an understanding, I had feared that any first show on coffee, would lead to the need to feature many more on the topic. And I can say that after putting today's show together, this will not be the last cup of coffee here on the program.\nWe live in a time right now that may very well be the most exciting and pivotal time in the history of humankind, given our long-standing dominion over this planet is literally crumbling beneath our feet. And the detachment we have allowed to exist between us and this earth is now recognized to be the greatest mistake we could have ever made. But as the mainstream media has so quickly pointed the finger, I for one do not observe that this mistake as rooted in our reliance on fossil fuels, nor rooted in capitalism, SUVs or travelling in airplanes, but rooted in our isolation from the natural world. And this has bred a level of selfishness that continues to spread from country to country, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Coffee, as will become clearer during this broadcast, is a beverage that is founded upon this very selfishness and this greed as it was colonialism, slavery, and a relentless deforestation that brought coffee to where it exists today.\nAll over the world people sit down in homes, in coffee shops, in automobiles, seeking a moment of happiness, in a cup of coffee. But in a cappuccino, in a latt\u00e9 or an Americano, is a destruction that is incomprehensible. And so long as we justify our consumption of coffee because of how integral it is to our lives, then the accompanying human impact that is understood to extend to farmers will come back to impact we, the consumers, ourselves. And this, we are now too clearly aware of.\nsoundbite\nWhen you last enjoyed a cup of coffee, did you ever consider that it may be endangering three animal species on the other side of the planet? Located on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia is Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park where three of the world's most endangered large species are found - the rhino, the elephant, and the tiger. The park itself is home to roughly a quarter of the entire wild populations of Sumatran rhinos and elephants.\nOne of the most recent threats to the population of these animals has been the illegal cultivation of coffee, coffee that ends up here in North America. The Washington D.C.-based World Wildlife Fund has taken on this issue because as they state, the current rate of illegal forest destruction to grow this illegal coffee may lead to the local extinction of these species by 2010; not very long from now. The World Wildlife Fund released a report in January of this year 2007 titled \"Gone In An Instant,\" and in it they document their investigation into which of the world's major coffee buyers are purchasing this illegal coffee.\nSo I spoke with Adam Tomasek, who leads the development of WWF's work in Indonesia and Malaysia. Adam joined the organization in 2001, and he spoke to me over the phone from Washington D.C.\nAdam Tomasek: Our first inclination was to look at the impacts on this national park and see the three very interesting and unique species that called this park home - Sumatra Tiger and rhino and elephant and in particular among ninety or so other mammal species. And what we found was that coffee production or coffee-dominated agricultural systems run by small holding farm families was really causing them the major impact in deforestation within the park itself and unfortunately overlapping with the known distributions and home ranges of a lot of these big mammals.\nJS: As the idea of illegal coffee may be new to some, Adam describes what makes this coffee so illegal.\nAT: The term \"illegal coffee\" comes up and it's a confusing one I admit, because it's really illegally produced coffee. And the fact of the matter is, is that coffee that is being grown inside the boundaries of the national park is an illegal land-use, it goes against the legal framework around the national park itself. And therefore anything that is actually being produced inside of the park is termed as being illegal. Now this goes beyond just coffee; obviously there are other agricultural crops that are being grown in these small-scale farm systems but coffee really is the major commodity that is dominating these systems right now.\nJS: With the cultivation of coffee dominating the destruction of this critical national park in Indonesia, Adam provides an illustration of just how much of this park has disappeared.\nAT: Our Indonesian office has been working here in this park for well over a decade now. And through the various surveys in research in conservation programs that are being carried out, we were quickly concerned with the disappearance of forest cover. And through a series of estimates both done by ourselves and other colleagues of other conservation groups, NGO colleagues, and government officials, we were able to characterize the overall forest loss at about just about 30%. And that means that roughly a third of this national park has been either deforested or degraded in different ways over the past number of years. And this is quite concerning because we've seen an upward trend in the level of forest loss and this is something that we are continuing to refine because the data that is available is often one or two years out-of-date if it's from satellite imagery. And so we're actually still now refining that classification. But what we know right now is that about a third of the park has been deforested.\nJS: We will shortly learn where this illegal coffee is ending up and which companies are purchasing these beans. But first, we learn more about the scope of this danger, that cappuccino's and latt\u00e9s are presenting to these three animal species in the park.\nAT: Within the three major species of concern - the tigers, the rhinos, and the elephants, if we first just look at the overall numbers of the species themselves, we're looking at about, a rough estimate of around forty tigers and that's about 10% of the population that's left on the island. And this is the only species of Indonesian tiger that's left - the Sumatran Tiger. So this really is the last remnant in terms of tiger's on the island.\nFrom the perspective of the Sumatran Elephant, we're looking at right around 500 or so that exist and this is about 20% or so of the elephants that are found on the island. And then from the perspective of rhinos, again, it's anywhere between 15-25% of the rhinos. There's an estimate between 40 and 60 of the rhinos that are found in this park alone. So you have very significant populations of these three species found in this park and that really is one of the reasons why we were so concerned with this issue. I don't want to fail to point out that a number of other groups have also prioritized this park itself, this national park as a priority to the extent that the United Nations has classified it as a world heritage site.\nJS: The Indonesian province of Lampung, where this national park is located is the primary area of coffee production in the country. And the pressure on the park is in large part due to the ease at which coffee can be grown and sold in the area. But as Adam describes this kind of coffee being grown there, we also learn that it is also the new energy drink craze that is fueling the destruction of this forest and these animal species.\nAT: The coffee that is grown in this region in this part of Sumatra is Robusta Coffee. Now this is the variety that is often found in instant coffees, well it is actually preferred for instant coffees. But it is also used to blend in with the higher quality Arabica Coffee that is grown in other parts of Indonesia. Arabica is really the variety of coffee that most consumers in North America and in the western world are familiar with. It's the type of coffee that you go and purchase in coffee houses. It has good quality flavours. Robusta, on the other hand, is considered to coffee experts to be the little lower quality but higher caffeine content coffee so there's a lot more bang for the buck so to speak in terms of the caffination within this variety of bean.\nAnd it's interesting that this part of the island of Sumatra is really the epicenter of the coffee trade for the entire country of Indonesia. Indonesia is the world's fourth largest producer of coffee but it's also the world's second largest producer of Robusta variety coffee. So it's extremely important to the economic of this part of the island, but nationally the trade is about 70% of the trade of coffee goes through the port that is 100 miles or so away from this very national park. So it's a real driver that is routed right in this part of the island.\nJS: And you're tuned in to Deconstructing Dinner, produced at Kootenay Co-op Radio in Nelson, British Columbia. Today's broadcast is titled \"Coffee, The Earth, and The Future of Civilization\" - a pretty serious title for a show, but laying coffee out on the table so to speak and looking behind the mug, really does expose a window into ourselves.\nWe're presently listening to clips from my interview with Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund and their efforts to track the cultivation of illegal coffee on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, where the rapid destruction of a protected national park is threatening the future survival of three key animal species.\nThe World Wildlife Fund published a report released in January 2007 that traced this very illegal coffee to the major international buyers, and Adam Tomasek explains why the organization chose to undertake such an investigation.\nAT: As we started looking deeper into this problem we really didn't know where it was going to lead us. We knew it was a complicated issue and the more we looked the more confusing it was. The supply chain for coffee and in this region, even inside of the park and outside of the park or in neighbouring provinces, it's really similar to a spider web; but a disorganized spider web. One that has all sorts of different points along the supply chain where coffee is bought, sold, traded, and mixed together with coffee from other parts of the area or other regions. And then is traded through middle men and stored in warehouses and purchased by a variety of different groups from those warehouses. And then eventually taken to the provincial capital and that is where the port is located where it is all shipped out. And what we found through all this background research was that the international buyers were really the largest in terms of volume purchasers of the coffee. And so that directly led us then to focusing more on to who might be some of the players that could be involved in reversing or changing this current situation.\nJS: To learn of who these international buyers are, we can quickly look back to our recent expose of Kraft Foods here on Deconstructing Dinner. Because the largest buyer of this illegal coffee is Kraft Foods, who, according to the WWF's data from 2005, are responsible for between 20-30% of the overall purchase of coffee from the region in question. Other major buyers that would be recognizable to Canadians are Nestle and Lavazza, who is a well-known supplier to restaurants and the Timothy's Coffee chain.\nFollowing their research in 2005, the World Wildlife Fund addressed letters to all of the largest purchasers, and more detailed information on their responses will be linked from the Deconstructing Dinner website. But here's brief overview of these responses.\nAT: As we went through the research and started to get a good handle for who was at the receiving end or the buying end of a lot of the coffee, we looked into how would we best communicate with these companies knowing that we're not coffee experts and knowing that they likely are not fully aware of the source of their products. And so what we did was we started just by sending a simple letter to the companies that we could easily identify, notifying them of the research that we've been doing. We provided them with a draft of the findings of the research at that point and time and asked for their comments; raising the point that we are confident in knowing that coffee that is being produced within inside the park is being mixed with coffee that is being grounded in other areas outside of the park. Which means that the overall coffee supply chain is really tainted; that there really isn't any level of confidence in purchasing coffee from this part of Sumatra.\nThe variety of responses that we got back from companies was interesting. Some companies have yet to actually respond. Others responded and thanked us for the letter but disagreed with the findings. And other companies like Kraft were very straightforward and very earnest in their response in terms of being concerned about the issue and offering to learn more from us about what we've been doing on the ground and the research and what we've been finding. But also to begin the dialogue about how we might be able to change the current situation.\nJS: Again, more information on the responses received will be linked to from the Deconstructing Dinner website. And that website is cjly.net/deconstructingdinner.\nNow that the letters have been sent, Adam describes the dialogue that has taken place since the issue was placed before the major buyers of this illegal coffee.\nAT: Well there's been obviously a lot of dialogue. When the letters went in 2005 some of the responses didn't come in until toward the end of the year or the beginning part of 2006. And we've started to follow-up with some of them. With Kraft in particular, over the course of the last year or so, we had a number of meetings either at their headquarters in Chicago or here in Washington where I'm based, to really go into more detail about what the issues are and since sending that letter some of the new findings that we've been able to generate in terms of new areas of coffee production within the park or new entities be it traders or other companies being involved in, etc. We're just now at the point, over the past two months, we've concluded what we call the first multi-stakeholder workshop in Indonesia to address this issue of coffee trade. And there were a little over 160 participants who were there, most of them from different levels of Indonesian government, the National Park Authority itself.\nThe industry was quite strongly represented by trade associations, producer associations, traders themselves, some of the coffee recipients, the big international buyer companies as well as NGOs and others.\nA part of this workshop was essentially a declaration and it was a declaration to bring about responsibility within the coffee sector, particularly in this region and within this park. And so we're now in the process of implementing that framework that we think can really change how coffee is produced and how the habitats of the tigers and elephants and the rhinos in this park can really be preserved and restored where possible.\nJS: And again, we're currently learning about the steps now being taken to ensure the preservation of three key animal species in a national park in Indonesia, where the illegal deforestation for the cultivation of coffee is threatening their very survival. As Kraft is the major purchaser of this illegal coffee, Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund lists some of the immediate steps that companies need to now take.\nAT: Well one of the most immediate needs is to have the major international buyers who buy in such large volumes really send the message down to through their supply chain - through their networks and traders and exporters and other groups that they're concerned about this problem. That it's unacceptable within the code of conduct, within their own business. That they want and demand verification of legality within the coffee that they're buying. A lot of companies have already done that and actually started to do that the first time they received the letter.\nA second part to that is really that right now that the coffee harvest is ongoing in Sumatra. Really what we're focused on is bringing together these various groups - the international buyers, the government, the park authorities itself, conservation organizations like ourselves who have the infrastructure and staff on the ground, to be able to take advantage as soon as this coffee harvest season is done with. To start to put into place that framework around a verifiable chain of custody that would then be able to provide the coffee with the confidence that's needed and that's really requested by these companies that is being legally produced outside of the park itself.\nJS: As mentioned earlier, the WWF predicts that at the current rate of forest destruction, the potential extinction of these animal species may come as early as 2010. And we hear more on these consequences should nothing be done to respond to this threat.\nAT: Well, it's quite dire, I mean to be completely honest. The analysis that we've been working on most recently is showing that coffee production is increasing in a couple of extremely critical habitats for the Sumatran Elephants and the Sumatran Tigers. And if nothing changed, we could assure ourselves that what we'll end up with is fragmented sub-populations of these major species which will have obvious long term negative impacts on their viability and their reproduction. And that is something that was presented at this multi-stakeholder workshop in the sense that we can really start to look at in very fine detail, at the levels of fragmentation within certain areas that we know to be where our surveys have told us and have shown us, are some of the most important areas for these species. And if we don't address that now, the coffee that is being produced there is going to be responsible for the demise of these species.\nJS: The report released in 2007 titled \"Gone In An Instant\" listed three major stakeholders who should take the lead in addressing this issue. But missing from the list was the consumer. And in closing out my conversation with Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund, I inquired into how consumers can become involved.\nAT: As we have seen with other commodities, consumer pressure is a very powerful force and it can be a real tool for bringing about change. In our report the recommendations being focused on consumers because we really felt like we had to deal with the issues at hand in a very immediate fashion because of severity of the problems that we are finding. And the time it takes to mount consumer pressure is often a slower developing process than going directly to some of the known international buyers and roasters and government authorities themselves.\nBut in terms of recommendations, I think falling into line as we've seen with other commodities, where consumers have voiced their concern about where the products that they're consuming and they're purchasing are coming from directly to the companies, would be completely feasible and would be welcomed in this case.\nThe difficulty with Robusta coffee in particular is that it's rather ubiquitous with being caffeinated beverages. It can be found in instant coffees and a lot of caffeinated drinks, we know to be used in the growing market around the popular energy drinks and things like that. So I think that the consumers who are concerned about this issue - you know writing a simple letter, picking up the phone, giving a company a call if they're a regular consumer of one of these products. Or if they even have questions as to whether or not the product they're consuming does potentially contain this coffee from this region would be a great help to the overall cause.\nJS: And that was Adam Tomasek of the World Wildlife Fund. The report titled \"Gone In An Instant\" provides a far greater background on this topic, and will be made available through a link on the Deconstructing Dinner website at cjly.net/deconstructingdinner. And you can learn more about the WWF on their website at wwf.org.\nAnd to close out this segment, I will note that the Kraft products that this illegal coffee most likely makes its way into, consist of Maxwell House and Nabob, along with Nestle products such as Nescafe.\nsoundbite\nAnd you're listening to Deconstructing Dinner. I'm Jon Steinman. I'd like to quickly pass along a reminder that this radio program is available as a Podcast for any listeners who are interested in downloading the show on a weekly basis to your iPods or portable music players. And information on how to do so can be found on our website.\nThe title of today's broadcast is \"Coffee, The Earth and The Future of Civilization.\" In this next segment we will see how all three of these are connected. Located in the state of Nayarit in Mexico, is a coffee that presents a perfect illustration of where our food system has gone wrong. And is doing so by providing an alternative to the destruction that, in the case of coffee, has driven millions from their lands, has destroyed forests and wildlife around the world, and decreased the quality of coffee to a point where the difference in flavour is astounding. And having tasted this coffee myself, it is in no doubt, one of the most decadent coffees that I have ever tasted.\nLocated here in Nelson is a small roadside espresso bar that exclusively sells a coffee known as Capulin. This espresso stand is not only selling a coffee that provides an opportunity for significant social and environmental change, but is encouraging its own social and environmental change by refusing to provide take-out containers. Now this may not seem to be too absurd, but take into consideration that the espresso stand is on the side of the main highway running through the city, and is essentially a drive-thru coffee shop. And I'll leave that as a teaser, because we will hear more on this incredibly unique caf\u00e9 at the end of today's broadcast. And first we will travel to the state of Nayarit Mexico where Capulin coffee originates.\nCapulin is being distributed internationally with the hope that it will provide an insight into how and why the people upon whose lands the richest agricultural crop in the world is produced, are amongst the poorest people in the world and exactly how 'we the consumers', might exercise control over the resulting poverty and devastation.\nThe founder of this project is Daniel Fourwinds who based in Tucson, Arizona spoke to me over the phone from Mexico, about 30 minutes from the jungle where the village is located. Daniel discovered Capulin over 20 years ago while on vacation in the area. He's one of a growing number of people questioning the fair trade standard and the many labels now being associated with brands of coffee.\nDaniel Fourwinds: Coffee was originally introduced as Arabian wine. It's very intoxicating when it is a natural processed coffee. And that's the real key and the real misunderstanding of people that would be concerned. We can just drop the people that aren't concerned. We're not reaching those people. They're not willing to pay more than the minimum price for coffee; they're not concerned about the environment; they're not concerned about the social order of what's going on behind their cup. My approach is always to the concerned, to the interested or the seekers. Now these people, the people that really want to make a difference on the planet have been, I would almost say \"bought up\" by these little tags that we have become accustomed to, such as shade grown, fair trade, equal exchange. These are all little words and labels that some company has grabbed.\nJS: Coffee has become one of the most recognizable products that has a significant social impact around the world. But Daniel Fourwinds sees that the foundation for the environmental destruction, the poverty and hunger that plague global coffee growing regions is a result of a process that most coffee drinkers have probably never heard of. And this is what is known as water processing, a technique implemented by the industrial producers of coffee. And here we learn how the selfish pursuit of money has resulted in poorer quality coffee, poverty, hunger, environmental destruction, and now, the most pressing symptom of this destruction, climate change.\nDF: Quality in coffee comes from the cherry, but then it depends on what was done to that cherry. This didn't happen before, let's say fifty years ago. About fifty years ago after the war, the corporations took over the largest drug industry on the planet. They were pretty much in control of it before but the big boys moved in. These folks have developed a process called \"water processing\" or what most coffees are, are caf\u00e9 lavado, washed coffees. That means that someone picked the cherry, floated it in water. The problem is and the reason they use water is because bad fleet seeds float and as they use in many industries. And so they placed the coffee, unskinned, in water to float off the bad ones. But right now the bad ones are sticky and the good ones are sticky and the good ones and the bad ones stick together and the bad one will float off two or three good ones.\nSo the companies in their wisdom said, well let's ferment that sugar and then it's not sticky anymore. And this allows the bad beans to float free. Well, this eliminated the women who had processed coffee by hand. They didn't have to take the bad seeds out because the company floated them out.\nIn this floating process, your coffee basically goes through three major changes. One, the oils that are your flavour are solvented by the alcohol and so the bean comes out opaque, washed out. The sugars that traditionally would have been dried in are fermented so it makes the processing easier. And then the sugars that naturally would be sweet, are not dried into the coffee; they are fermented. And then the caffeine, which is a H20 chemical bonding crystal, that's the way they extract caffeine in water. Well if you process your coffee in water, what happened to the fine alkaloids of caffeine? So what really takes place is consumer loss in the processing to make coffee cheap.\nSo now we have a major problem that arises in the villages is that the labour that normally went into coffee has been floated out and that's where the most serious devastation occurs because there's no work in the villages.\nSo anybody that really, I'm serious, really wants to take care of the jungle or has any social heart whatsoever must realize that by floating the labour out of the villages, you float the pay cheques, the salaries, the incomes, the food off of these people's table.\nJS: And this is Deconstructing Dinner. Now having an understanding of what water processing is, Daniel further emphasizes how it's the very unemployment created by the industrial coffee industry that has led to the devastation of the jungle. His comments also introduce a recent topic discussed here on the program and that is why so many migrant workers coming to Canada are so willing to leaves their families for upwards to eight months of the year.\nDF: The devastation of the jungle is occurring because you have all the people unemployed. The connection is, is unemployed people cut trees because there's no cherries to work. They consume the animals and the birds. They consume everything like a blight upon the jungle. They don't want to do it, they don't want to starve. And most of them take the walk \"a thousand miles to the frontier\" not too lightly. They have to leave their families to send money home to maintain them because there is no work in the village. So it really isn't people coming in and buying up mass tracks of jungle. It's the jungle dwellers consuming the forest that people don't understand. That's the link between washed coffee and natural coffee.\nJS: We are currently listening to segments from my conversation with Daniel Fourwinds of Capulin Coffee. Daniel spoke to me over the phone from Nayarit, Mexico.\nIt's been rather troubling for myself recently to open up a newspaper or check out a television newscast and witness the way the mainstream media is reporting on climate change. The tone that overrides much of the content is, \"well how can we sustain our lifestyles, but do so with less of an impact.\" Adding to this discontent, there is little to no coverage on the topic of agriculture and food. How many newscasts have reported that the U.N. has discovered that 18% of all human-caused greenhouse gases originate from livestock. Instead the focus on much of the climate change debate is on energy, and alternative sources of energy. But we forget that the most sustainable energy is ourselves.\nCapulin Coffee yet again presents a window back in time to the days before the advent of fossil fuels, and Daniel Fourwinds draws out a picture of the human energy that goes into producing this coffee.\nDF: Orginally, the caravans use to come in here on mules and bring out bags of gold. It was called \"oro\" gold. Why, because all the labour from the entire season went into it. The men picked the cherries and then they had to dry them for weeks in the sun. And when they were brittle they had hammered them with wooden mallets. Later of course the Burr Mill came in, but in the early days it was all done by hand. And so the beans were pounded and then they were whittled and cast into the air. And then the coffee was passed through the families, the elders, and the children, and the women. And they sat around and they took out the bad beans and the broken beans and the misshapen and miscoloured, and they selected the cream of the crop - oro. And they sold it and they survived on it.\nBut once the corporations came in and said, \"Well, we don't want to have to pay for all that labour.\" That they applied the water process to eliminate the labour. And that was great for giving you all a cheaper cup of coffee. But it's not good for the consumer, it's good for the planet, and it's not good for the planet's caretakers in the village. So the only ones that really gain are your big multinational corporations.\nJS: As the industrialization of coffee has led to such devastation in coffee growing regions, we of course cannot ignore that currently, coffee is distributed around the world, using fossil fuels. And Daniel comments on this concern.\nDF: We have to start somewhere. The largest industry and most destructive industry on our planet is petroleum. We're shackled. Everyone is strung into petroleum. It's an environmentally disastrous product; but it's what we currently have. We can't get rid of it tomorrow or in a year or in two years or five years; we're still going to be addicted to petroleum.\nBut coffee, coffee is the second largest cash river on the planet. Imagine taking that flow and directing it directly into the poorest people on the planet. The wealthy always will end up. Our project is to expose how we can direct the money back into the village and let it trickle up from after feeding the people. This is taking billions of dollars directly out of corporate hands and putting directly into hungry people's tables.\nAnd what we're suggesting is that if we had enough people that stopped supporting the water processed industry, I don't care what product it is, I don't care what label it has. If it was processed in water - if it wasn't naturally processed, the planet loses. The consumer loses because he has no quality in this product. The environment loses because the people in order to survive are consuming the jungle that we are talking about protecting. They're consuming the birds that we talk about protecting. But we go to Starbucks and we give Mr. Batarsucks our money - dollars. Not dimes - dollars. Imagine redirecting some of those dollars back to feeding people. They'll stop cutting the trees. They will stop becoming foreign illegal aliens seeking work because they've been starved off their land. And then their land they have to sell and they of course have to sell cheap to the people that have the money. Well who has the money? All these multinational corporations, that's who has the money.\nJS: And this is Deconstructing Dinner. On a financial level, Capulin coffee provides an income to the farmers and villagers that is enough to live on, a luxury that most farmers around the world are not afforded. Daniel Fourwinds claims that Capulin provides more money per pound directly to local villagers than any other coffee company on the Planet.\nDF: Now with Capulin, we've been doing this for 23 years. We provide more money to a farmer, twice as much money as any coffee growers on the planet receive. Now that's a big, big stake. I'm going to say it again because it's really, really important that people understand. We are paying double what the commercial industry pays. That's our guarantee to the people. Whatever the water processes are paying, we're doubling. And we have done that now for 23 years. And our quality is unsurpassable. You can do it as well, and maybe every year if somebody did just what we did - took 100% fully matured cherries and turned them every day once or twice, piled them at night, covered them from the dew, re-spread them in the morning - tons and tons and tons and tons of cherries being done just as though you are only doing one pound. And this is what we offer in Capulin. The highest, most stimulating, sweetest leaf bitter coffee available.\nJS: In closing out my conversation with Daniel Fourwinds, he ends with a comment that really could apply to anything it is we do here in Canada. That so long as we remain ignorant to where our food is coming from, such ignorance is, in and of itself, destroying the environment and destroying ourselves.\nDF: People do what they do because they don't know. The quality in the cup of a 100% fully matured cherry that's been hand-processed, you can't do it any better. But you could do it as well. Somewhere on the planet there's going to be the best. But you can only really be the best if you have naturally processed that coffee. If you fermented it, floated it in water, and then sell it to the public under the fair trade label, or the equal exchange, or the bird-friendly, or the ... and they are all water processed coffees. They all strip the incomes from the village. They all force the villagers to survive off the land. Well how do you that. Well you cut the trees. And if your wife gets sick you cut 10 trees and if your little girl gets sick too you cut 20 trees. And that's what people have to understand, is the destruction - social and environmental, is directly attributable to the water processing of coffee, aside from the millions and millions of gallons of water that are polluted by the process. It is the people attempting to survive after the season is over.\nJS: And that was Daniel Fourwinds of Capulin Coffee. Daniel spoke to me over the phone from Nayarit Mexico and you can learn more about Capulin coffee on their website at capulin.com. And if you're interested in getting in touch with a Canadian distributor of the coffee who is actually based here in Nelson, there will be information posted on our website on how to do so.\nSo now we've explored where the Capulin coffee beans originate, but where do they end up. Well one place is located here in Nelson, British Columbia, and that is the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9. A newly established espresso stand that operates out of the back of a trailer. The coffee sold exclusively at the caf\u00e9 is Capulin Coffee. But the real interest of this next segment is the social and environmental change that this caf\u00e9 is encouraging, and it has nothing to do with the beans themselves. The Clean Bean Caf\u00e9 is located directly beside the main highway running through the city, and is essentially a drive-thru coffee shop. But here's the scoop, The Clean Bean Caf\u00e9 does not provide any disposable take-out containers - no take-out cups. Certainly a new approach to take-out coffee service that I for one, have never seen. And here's a segment featuring the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9's Benji Hansen.\nJS on highway: This probably has to be the closest interview that I have ever done to the radio station. We are literally one block away from the radio station here on the streets of Nelson. And I'm standing here beside what literally is a highway with Benji Hansen of the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9. And now that we have learned where the beans are coming from in Mexico we are not here on the streets of Nelson learning where the beans end up, in the mugs of people.\nespresso machine sound\nBH: I first encountered Capulin in Tucson, Arizona working at a vegetarian restaurant - the Oasis Vegetarian Eatery. I was a bartender there, it was an alcohol-free bar, so one of the main drinks I was able to serve up was espresso.\nespresso machine sound\nWe happened to serve exclusively Capulin beans. Daniel Fourwinds was that man who happened to teach me the art of espresso, how to taste espresso. He turned me on to the character of Capulin, the origin of Capulin, and what makes it what it is.\nguitar and singing\nJS: One of your last customers came in and said that they come here for your energy. But you say that the energy isn't really coming from you but it's coming through the coffee.\nBH: I guess the way I see and the way I feel it, it's the energy of the earth being uninterrupted because this coffee is Arabica Typica Trees are growing in the rain forest, in the jungle. Those are happy trees and they putting out happy cherries. Which got right in the middle of them, they got happy beans. And they got happy people touching these beans, working these beans by hand and with hand tools from turning with shovels the cherries as they dry in the sun to whittling, hauling and whittling the beans and then hand processing these beans. That to me is the most beautiful thing - the most beautiful bean I've ever encountered; the fact that it is considered from all the way from the earth to the separating table to the cup. It's uninterrupted love. And I just can't help but to be excited about it; I can't help but to love it.\nJS: Now as Daniel so eloquently puts it, this coffee is social change in a cup. But in your little hut here, right on the side of the highway you have your own sort of level of social change that you're encouraging. And here we are standing as more or less a drive-thru espresso shop yet you don't offer any takeout containers.\nDH: Shoot man, that's my conscience. I can't stand walking down the sidewalk seeing a paper cup that's been walked on, driven over on the street. It breaks my heart to know that cup was once, well it depends on how you break it apart, but the ink there's the petroleum products that have been used as a sealant and there's also the meat of trees laying there on the street. And I can't stand for that. And I can't stand to see it even in a trash bin let alone on the street. And there's no point, there's plenty of artisans making beautiful ceramic mugs - works of art. And even there's a good bit of vintage mugs out there too that are maybe looking for a home, sitting on the shelf at your local thrift shop.\nJS: Well, see you have this collection of mugs here and you've referred to your mugs as your children and that here it is a mug orphanage. And I notice when people come up to ask for a coffee, that you contemplate what kind of mug you want to give them. What's going through your head when you're deciding which mug is going to be the best mug for your customer.\nBH: Well, there are a few mugs here in my orphanage, if you will, have been handcrafted by local artisans. So number one, if they are going to stick around the trailer I might give them a special, one of those special mugs. If they are going to walk down the street, I may send them away with a more, more generic say mug. People are dropping off mugs all the time. I do appreciate the ones that have special markings. I have one with a Fozzy mug (glass clinking) that got The Muppet Show and he's got his finger, yeah just special mugs like that.\nJS: You mention that people walk away with their mugs and I've been watching the people come up here, order a coffee, you put it in a mug, and then they walk away. I mean this is something no one ever sees anywhere. And I likened it in that the other day to going through the drive-thru at McDonalds and instead of you receiving your paper bag and styrofoam containers, you'd instead receive re-useable plates and they trust that you are going to bring those plates back. And the idea of that's almost absurd for most people that that would ever happen. But here you're letting people walk away with mugs.\nDH: They're coming back. And if not, they must have found a good home. I trust that people won't just disregard a mug as something to be set and forgotten. Someone, somewhere, at some point in time is going to consider that mug; not just throw it into a trash bin. At least give it, like I say, to the local thrift shop and yeah, mugs have a life of their own. They're not easily tossed by the wayside.\nJS: If you have people coming up here who see this as a take-out drive-thru espresso stand, what's the response from people when they recognize well there's no take-out cups? What kind of responses do you get?\nDH: Oh, I've had an assortment of responses. Everybody seems to have responded in their own way but definitely taken aback, seemingly on the verge of frustration and then realization that, \"oh, I like this idea. I don't have to throw something away.\" And most people, most often are more than pleased to take the ceramic mug. I've had probably three customers come and actually turn around and leave because I didn't have cups with lids. And that doesn't make me, yeah I can still smile and give out ceramic mugs and not even stop to consider buying paper cups.\nJS: You use the words \"slowing down.\" Can you talk about this idea of how your coffee stand is allowing people to slow down?\nBH: It's a beautiful thing our friend the ceramic mugs. Numerous times folks pull up on their way through, maybe not from town, maybe from Castlegar, maybe going through on this highway and they're anticipate picking up their coffee and hopping back in their car. They realize there are so many ceramic mugs. They do, they stop, and on the verge of being upset they say, \"well, maybe I can sit down and enjoy this coffee.\" It's a beautiful thing, people get to stop and enjoy themselves in the middle of the day and also feel good about the fact that they aren't throwing a cup away, just for convenience sake. It's a beautiful thing to be able to offer people that opportunity.\nsoundbite\nJS: And this is Deconstructing Dinner, and that segment featured Benji Hansen of the Clean Bean Caf\u00e9 in Nelson, British Columbia. You can find Benji's espresso trailer in the parking lot of Kas Restaurant on Highway 3A just down from Hall Street.\nAnd for any Canadian listeners, restaurants or retail outlets wishing to get their hands on Capulin coffee, there will be contact info on our website on how to do so, and just look under the May 4th broadcast. There will also be some contact info for Benji Hansen should you want to learn more about his coffee mug revolution. And for any non-Canadian listeners, you can check out the website for Capulin coffee at capulin.com.\nsoundbite\nTo close out today's broadcast I wanted to quickly go through a brief list of some environmental impacts of coffee production that were not touched on during today's broadcast. The World Wildlife Fund has a great web page listing off some of these impacts, and this research is courtesy of Jason Clay, who for anyone who caught our July 20, 2006 broadcast titled \"Shocking Sugar,\" you may remember his role in highlighting the environmental impacts of sugar cane cultivation and sugar production.\nJason Clay authored an excellent book titled \"World Agriculture and Environment,\" published by Island Press. In it he highlights the most serious impact as being the deforestation that was just referred to on today's broadcast. Deforestation itself represents 20-25% of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Of the 50 countries in the world with the highest deforestation rates from 1990 to 1995, 37 of them were coffee producers.\nThis has led to biodiversity loss, which from studies undertaken in Colombia and Mexico, indicate that full-sun coffee plantations support 90% fewer bird species than shade-grown coffee. But as he points out, the thinning or clearing of forests for even a shade-grown coffee is a major concern as considerable biodiversity is lost both above and below ground.\nSoil degradation is yet another concern from coffee cultivation as following deforestation, the land is cultivated using practices that eventually rob the soil of its nutrients. These practices further lead to soil erosion, and eventually the land becomes useless, unless of course chemicals derived from fossil fuels are placed into the soil and are affordable to farmers.\nDegradation of water quality was also touched on during today's broadcast, and Jason Clay's book expands on this by describing the process that occurs when the waste coffee pulp is dumped into rivers. When dumping this organic material into river systems, its decomposition requires oxygen and this lower oxygen level in the river systems then leads to fish kills. And with no fish in the rivers, the cycle of destruction continues from there.\nA link to more information on the environmental impacts of coffee production will be made available on the Deconstructing Dinner website.\nanonymous: Deconstructing Dinner is made possible by the generous support from Ryerson University's Centre for Studies and Food Security, and West Coast Seeds at phone number 604-952-8820.

Rapha recently caught up with SFCC store manager Emily Haddad to talk about the city\u2019s cycling culture and a whole lot more besides.\nOK, bike background. How did you get into cycling? What was your earliest memory or favorite bike from way back?\nI was born and raised in Texas. I grew up on the beach but spent my formative years in Austin. My love of cycling, breakfast tacos and denim \u2018jorts\u2019 can all be traced back to that wonderful city. One of my earliest childhood cycling memories is getting chased off the local golf course by security guards (we had a penchant for jumping our bikes into sand bunkers). I got into cycling as an adult for more utilitarian reasons. I got a Masi commuter rig and soon realized two wheels was the best way to travel. It was a slippery slope; before I knew it I had four bikes and was working at a bike shop.\nYou previously worked at one of Rapha retail partners, Mellow Johnny's in Austin. How does the SF Cycle Club compare?\nMellow Johnny's was one of the best learning experiences I could have asked for. When I started working there I had lots of experience of technical clothing but very little bike knowledge. I learned so much about bikes and even more about business and branding. The customer experience at the Cycle Club is a mix of the best retail environments I\u2019ve worked in. It\u2019s a \u2018destination shop\u2019, similar to MJ's but with a much more relaxed environment than traditional bike shops.\nDid you ever meet Lance? Just kidding, you don't have to answer that (but no, really, did you?).\nLance was a little busy with his other job (I heard he was pretty good at riding a bike) but he was around from time to time and he threw us some great parties at his ranch; the man makes a mean margarita.\nAustin is renowned for a vibrant cycling scene that has grown hugely in recent years. How does it compare to San Francisco?\nAustin's bike community is great because it is so fresh. Within the last five to 10 years the cycling scene has exploded. A huge number of people are getting into riding for transportation. It\u2019s great to see the bike lanes filled with folks on their way to work in the morning. In San Francisco, everyone rides because driving to get around is absurd. The cycling community is extremely diverse. You don't have to worry about being pigeonholed as a commuter, a roadie, or a mountain biker. If you have a road bike, you probably also race cross and ride a mountain bike a few times a month.\nThe Cycle Club seems a natural fit for San Francisco\u2019s cycling community.\nVery much so. The Cycle Club is a unique space because we are so many things. Our cafe has become the go-to coffee stop for everyone on this side of town. The race screenings are a fun way to bring cycling fans together and allow some good-natured bickering over allegiances. The rotating art gallery, meanwhile, keeps the store fresh and also brings in people from the art and design community.\nTell us about some of the shows you\u2019ve had there, such as Brian Vernor's NorthCal. Cyclocross or the Gage+Desoto exhibit.\nBrian Vernor's show, Uncle Charlie's and Other Stories of North Cal. Cyclocross, was a huge hit. We originally approached Brian about putting together a show of his cross photography and he came back with the idea of a multimedia show featuring different artists and contributors. The amount of talent and historical content he was able to pull together was phenomenal.\nThe Gage+Desoto exhibit was awesome because it was a different take on an art show. Among other things, Mike and Brett make great cycling-inspired t-shirts. Instead of having them make a whole bunch of prints for the show, we decided to showcase their work in a medium it was intended for, i.e. cotton t-shirts. It was great fun and very Gage+Desoto.\nWhat can we look forward to at the Cycle Club in the coming year?\nWe have some fun events in the works for 2012. The infamous Bike Snob NYC will be giving a reading as part of his tour for his new book. There are also rumors of a springtime Gentleman's Race in the Bay Area, one that will feature a new twist. The Tour of California is coming through the city again in May. It coincides with the Giro so it will make for an amazing month of racing.\nWe have also started doing a \u2018Free Drip Friday\u2019 for commuters. If you ride in on two wheels you get a free cup of French press coffee. We also have a ride that leaves the shop every Saturday morning, and which brings in regulars and tourists alike. Movie nights will start up again soon, as well, so keep an eye on our website and follow @RaphaCycleClub on Twitter to hear about all the happenings.\nCoffee\nA big part of the Cycle Club\u2019s popularity is based on great coffee. How has coffee culture influenced the way you think about the shop?\nThe Cycle Club is pretty unique because the cafe and retail space are virtually one and the same. All our employees have barista training as well as a natural love of cycling. That means they can talk shop with anyone. We want everyone who works here and everyone who comes in, to be as excited about their espresso as they are about Rapha. It\u2019s amazing how many of our regular coffee customers have become cycling enthusiasts and vice versa.\nWhat\u2019s the most popular drink among cyclists that come in? A regular black coffee, or do San Franciscans prefer something a bit more decadent?\nFree Drip Friday makes it a big day for regular black coffee. On all the other days it varies. An espresso or macchiato are typical pre-ride pick-me-ups. Post-ride cappuccinos are fairly common. We also do small French press carafes that are perfect for splitting with your training partner.\nWe hear you've had a few fantastic parties over that way; what can the Cycle Club offer by way of hangover cures?\nWe find simple methods work best. First, a big glass of water with a couple Nuun electrolyte tablets dropped in (thanks to Tyler, by the way, for the awesome custom boxes). Second, a mug of hot French press. Then a Pellegrino. Then an espresso. Then another Pellegrino. Repeat as necessary.\nWhat have you learned about the coffee business, we know you can pull a great shot of espresso, was this something you learned working here or did you bring this skill with you?\nI've always been a coffee enthusiast. Working at Mellow Johnny\u2019s I was able to play around on their La Marzocco machine. Danielle is master-barista extraordinaire and working under his expert tutelage opened up a whole new world. Working with Four Barrel Coffee for the Cycle Club, I\u2019ve come to realise how much there is to learn; at times it feels a bit like studying for a master\u2019s degree in coffee. Every time I think I\u2019ve got it, I learn something new. One of the most interesting parts of my coffee education hasn\u2019t been making or preparing the coffee, it\u2019s been about learning what goes into every cup. From sourcing to roasting and everything in between, Four Barrel has a passion about their coffee that is infectious. I find myself wanting to learn as much about soil composition in Africa as I do about latte art.\nHistorically, the link between cycling and coffee was established by pro riders in Continental Europe. The recent boom in cycling, however, seems to have brought out a new breed of coffee aficionados. Why is that?\nI think that the connection between cycling and coffee is both simple and complex. A simple theory is that cycling requires fuel and coffee is a fuel that is hot, readily available and delicious.\nThe more complex theories are something I could talk about for hours. For example, coffee, at it's most basic, is fairly rudimentary. Same with bicycles. However, once you start enjoying coffee, and cycling, more, you develop a taste for the finer things. Personal preferences start to play a role. You don't know why, but you prefer Central American beans to South American, or pour-over to French press. People are becoming really passionate about coffee, just as they are about SRAM vs Shimano, or why steel is \u2018real\u2019.\nDo these differences really matter? No. Truth is, you'll drink gas station coffee at a pinch. Or you'll ride your friend's 20 year-old Walmart bike while on vacation. But then, when you get home to your own coffee and your own bicycle, everything seems right in the world again. You just need to have that first sip, or ride that first climb, and you remember why you love Guatemalan beans and Double Tap so much.\nWomen Riders\nThere has been a conscious push at the Cycle Club to do more to promote women's cycling. Tell us about that.\nI read recently that in order to judge the safety of a city's cycling infrastructure one only need look at the amount of women commuting by bike. If that's true, then the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition is doing an incredible job. I see so many women cruising around town by bicycle every day. When I ride over the bridge into Marin, I\u2019m always amazed how many women are out there on their road bikes. The racing community in California is so strong. These women are tough and fast and drop me on every climb. It's empowering and embarrassing at the same time.\nTell us about the ladies rides that you organise at the Cycle Club.\nI've been doing women's rides out of the club once a month. It's a mellow pace \u2013 mainly for my sake \u2013 and we usually stop for coffee at some point. It's not only a great way to get some miles in but a good place to meet other ladies who ride. I find that, as a non-competitive cyclist, I have a hard time meeting other women who want to ride like I do. The women's rides have brought out all different levels of riders, which is exactly what I'd hoped for. I don't own a PowerTap or follow a training plan but I love riding and I love hanging out with my friends. Why not just combine the two?\nTraditionally bike shops have a reputation for being unwelcoming, male-dominated places. How is the Cycle Club different?\nIn the past, certain bike shops had a vibe that used to put women off (and quite a lot of men, too). They were quite intimidating places but most women who come in to the Cycle Club are surprised by how mellow the environment is and how comfortable they feel hanging out. We\u2019d still love to see more women riders stop by, though. Maybe, when I'm out riding, I should wear a sandwich board that says: \u201cHey ladies, follow me to the Rapha Cycle Club.\u201d\nWhat are currently your three favorite Rapha pieces and what are you hoping for in the coming season?\n1) If I could justify owning the Wind Jacket in every color I would. It is the perfect Bay Area jacket. Warm but not too warm, it keeps that misty morning fog off you, and packs into a jersey.\n2) Lately I have been wearing my 3/4 Bib Shorts and I love them. Women's-specific bibs are hard to come by, and these are cozy and comfy.\n3) I also love the Knitted Hat . I am, as previously mentioned, always cold and it\u2019s perfect for keeping my ears warm and happy. What am I hoping for in the Rapha Women's line? Bib shorts, bib shorts, bib shorts\u2026.and definitely some City Riding gear\u2026\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 732.4909, "uuid": "e7bd9ec6-1eb3-5721-bc1a-4e668e5fc9f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0008wb-12-27096", "target_hostname": "taylormaidfarms.com", "target_uri": "http://taylormaidfarms.com/news/queen-of-cups/", "page_rank": 1.2148212e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Queen of Cups | Taylor Maid Farms <em>Coffee</em> &amp; Tea", "snippet": "It\u2019s a damn fine cup of <em>coffee</em>, with Taylor Maid\u2019s sweet <em>and</em> nutty <em>Espresso</em>-a-Go-Go blend <em>and</em> thick, creamy milk.

V. Scheide\nNow that there\u2019s a Starbucks or similar chain store on virtually every corner of every city in the United States, it\u2019s tempting to think that Americans know a thing or two about coffee. The truth is, from bean to cup, most of us know very little about the world\u2019s favorite caffeinated beverage. That, however, is changing\u2014thanks to specialty coffee companies like Sebastopol\u2019s Taylor Maid Farms.\n\u201cOne of the best-kept secrets about coffee is that it\u2019s a lot like wine,\u201d says Trish Skeie, Taylor Maid\u2019s official \u201croastmaster.\u201d As roastmaster, Skeie\u2019s in charge of roasting and blending the many different varieties of organic, fair trade coffee beans that Taylor Maid founder, president and \u201cgreen buyer\u201d Mark Inman imports from small farmers around the globe.\nLike winemaking, selecting and roasting coffee beans is a complex art with its own rich language for describing aroma and flavor, from \u201cfloral\u201d to \u201cashy,\u201d \u201cdelicate\u201d to \u201cacrid,\u201d \u201cbland\u201d to \u201cpungent.\u201d Also as in winemaking, microclimates play an important role in determining the flavor of the coffee beans.\nOne major difference between winemaking and the specialty coffee trade, Skeie says, is that the latter, from growing the beans to roasting them, is much more labor-intensive. Another is that while anyone can learn about viticulture at the local community college, there is presently no equivalent for becoming a roastmaster or green buyer. Just about the only way to learn the trade is to go out in the real world and do them.\n\u201cThere is no school for coffee,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to hang out with other coffee people.\u201d\nSkeie\u2019s real-world training began after moving to Norway in the late 1980s. While specialty coffee is relatively new in the United States\u2014Inman founded Taylor Maid just 11 years ago in 1993\u2014the Scandinavian countries have a long history of being persnickety about quality coffee. An art major with a successful painting career, Skeie began working on the side as a barista in Oslo\u2019s famed coffee houses. She soon discovered that coffee was her calling, and rose to the position of roastmaster at the prestigious Mocca Kaffebar og Brenneri before being recruited by Taylor Maid last year.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve probably never had a real cappuccino,\u201d she says, drawing freshly brewed espresso from the chrome machine in a corner of Taylor Maid\u2019s Sebastopol warehouse. The espresso must be warm, not piping hot like most American coffee houses serve it. Instead of whipping the milk into a huge head of white foam, she gently steams it, creating creamy microbubbles that blend better with the coffee\u2019s flavor. \u201cOpen your mouth when you drink it, that way you taste the coffee and the milk,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s a damn fine cup of coffee, with Taylor Maid\u2019s sweet and nutty Espresso-a-Go-Go blend and thick, creamy milk.\nTasting the coffee is of primary importance, and Skeie says that popular drinks such as lattes are, in the U.S., nothing more than tall glasses of milk. \u201cIt\u2019s a great marriage, milk and coffee, but we in the coffee business see that the taste of the coffee is losing out,\u201d she says.\nIn the same corner of the warehouse, Taylor Maid has set up a retail outlet featuring a score of its different coffee varieties, as well as teas from around the world, which are also wholesaled to local restaurants and cafes. The coffees are separated into three groups: premium blends, espresso and single origin. Blends are just that: mixtures of two or more bean varieties; espressos are also blends. Single origin coffees feature beans that come from one specific crop and are valued for their consistency in flavor.\nThe raw beans arrive in 130- to 150-pound gunny sacks from locations as disparate as Nicaragua, Ethiopia and Sumatra. As green buyer, Inman seeks out certified organic beans that are grown using the most sustainable methods possible. Ensuring that farmers are paid a fair price for their crops is built in to the company\u2019s credo \u201cthat a business can be environmentally and socially progressive while remaining profitable.\u201d\n\u201cIf we can commit to a farmer in Nicaragua, we can do a lot of good,\u201d Skeie says. \u201cIf he knows he can sell to us every year, he can send his children to school.\u201d\nIn fact, the demand for specialty coffee is helping making small farms across the Third World more viable. Because of Inman\u2019s willingness to journey to remote and sometimes dangerous locations to seek out small farmers, he\u2019s gained a reputation as the \u201cIndiana Jones of green buyers.\u201d Small farmers are generally more open to organic and sustainable methods, such as \u201cshade grown\u201d coffee, which retains as much of the natural vegetation as possible.\nBut specialty coffee consumers demand the best, and the only way to ensure that is to test each year\u2019s crop with a process known as \u201ccupping.\u201d\nHere again, the similarities to winemaking are striking, right down to the swirling and spitting. In Taylor Maid\u2019s upstairs office, Skeie places nine white ceramic cups, three sets of three, on a circular concrete table that rotates like a Lazy-Suzan. Using a nearby coffee grinder, she grinds three varieties of fresh-roasted, single-origin Guatemalan beans, one variety for each set of cups. Testing each sample three times ensures that the beans are uniform, that there are no defects.\nShe fills each cup with about three tablespoons of ground coffee. Covering the top of a cup with both hands, she inhales deeply to sense the aroma. She repeats the process on the two cups remaining in the sample, then rotates the table to bring the next sample around.\nThat\u2019s step one. Next she fills each cup to the brim with hot water. As the coffee brews, the grounds sink to the bottom and a thick crust forms across the top. With a soup spoon, she breaks through the crust, sticking her nose right down to the cup again and inhaling deeply, repeating the process until the table comes around to the first set of cups again.\nFor the final step of the cupping, Skeie scrapes off the remaining crust of each cup. Using a clean spoon, she sips the fresh brew through her teeth with a hissing sound, so that it sprays across her palate. She swirls it around in her mouth then spits it out into a nearby tin can reserved for the purpose.\nThroughout the entire process, Skeie records the fragrance, acidity, flavor, body, aftertaste and balance for each variety on a cupping form. When it\u2019s all said and done, the overall score determines which variety is the best. The main difference between the demonstration Skeie performed in the office and cupping in the field is that in the field, the beans are only lightly roasted, in order to give the cupper a better reading of the coffee\u2019s enzymatic properties.\n\u201cThere are enough small farmers and enough of a specialty movement to keep it going,\u201d Skeie says.\nAfter the beans are purchased and shipped to Taylor Maid, Skeie supervises the roasting process. On average, beans are roasted for 16 to 20 minutes at temperatures reaching more than 450 degrees, turning from a light grayish-green color to the familiar chocolate brown hue and filling the warehouse with the rich smell of freshly roasted premium-grade coffee.\nSkeie is confident that the specialty coffee market will continue to thrive. Prices between the more commercial coffee brands and organic, fair trade coffee such as Taylor Maid\u2019s are already fairly comparable, particularly when taste is factored into the equation.\n\u201cWe hope that people will see that specialty coffee is an everyday thing that\u2019s affordable,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the average consumer picks a good coffee off the shelf, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to turn it around for everybody in the industry.\u201d\nThis entry was posted in Articles, Press, & Links .

I had drunk coffee before (mostly instant) but this was a watershed coffee, ordered in a whimsy. It made me aware that there was more to coffee than I had previously realised \u2013 warm, sweet, and satisfying. The problem now is that being ten or more years further along this coffee journey; I cannot remember if this coffee was any good. I suspect modern me would probably never have sat down in the place in the first instance. Instead I would have surreptitiously identified a glaring flaw with some element of the coffee preparation technique and exited stage-left without delay. That or I would have sat down, glanced at a neighbouring table, identifying \u201csoap bubble\u201d foam on top of a latt\u00e9 and resigned myself to having a tea or a soft-drink. If past me had not ordered that cappuccino though, modern me might not exist. The space-time continuum is in jeopardy.\nModern me, despite being more than a little obsessed with coffee, does not drink a lot of coffee outside of the home. Modern me is an embittered snob. To my discredit I look down my nose at the unwashed masses drinking their latt\u00e9s (most often), accepting mediocrity, unaware of the flaws \u2013 ignorance is bliss. I held myself back as I witnessed a woman who received a latt\u00e9 and complained that she had ordered a cappuccino was satiated by the addition of some cocoa powder to the top of the foam. I look at coffee chains opening new stores all the time, and my heart breaks for the shiny new La Marzoccos and Mazzers that will never produce a great espresso, or cappuccino, or latt\u00e9.\nI go to restaurants, award winning restaurants whose chefs clearly have an appreciation for taste and flavour, chefs so skilled that they make haute cuisine seem effortless. These same restaurants produce espresso that can only be described as effortless; a dark black liquid bereft of flavour and aroma, with an imperceptibly thin crema. I just spent \u20ac30 on some halibut \u2013 couldn\u2019t you spend 50c on some fresh coffee beans? Needless to say, more and more I am rounding off my dinner with a glass of port instead (Coffee 0 Alcoholism 1).\nThe situation is not uniformly grim though. Both established and up-and-coming pioneers exist who are driving quality coffee in all parts of this country. Some of these are nationally and internationally recognised names, while others have a more local reputation. Irish coffee importers travel the world; they cup samples of the latest crops. They taste the coffee at origin, trying to identify that lot of coffee to add to their next blend. They often spend far more than fair-trade price on these coffees. There are big roasters who supply supermarkets, multiple independent coffee retailers, and some of the coffee chains. Bewleys for example has done more to push speciality coffee in Ireland than anyone else and have been doing so since well before coffee became trendy.\nLatte Pour\nThere are medium sized roasters supplying caf\u00e9s and also the end-user (you and me). One advantage these guys have perhaps is that they do not have the unjustly quaint reputation that Bewleys has in some quarters. Despite the growing commercialisation of these medium sized roasters they still have an air of the independent \u201cartisan\u201d about them. Then there are the smaller guys selling roasted coffee on the internet, in farmers markets, or in their independent caf\u00e9. At all points on this scale you can see that there is appreciation for what makes great coffee. Conversely, even down to the artisan guys, you can see the concessions made in the name of remaining viable (pre-ground beans going stale on supermarket shelves).\nAt the retail end the chains dominate, and the masses flock, comforted by the familiarity and uniformity. Not all of these chains are equal, but nearly all have a lot of room for improvement. Typically observed problems are: filter baskets insufficiently cleaned between shots, stale beans, dosers full of ground coffee going stale, under-extracted shots, topping up already hot milk with cold for steaming (mmm bacteria), and overheating the milk. Many independent retailers are equally culpable, and the increasing domination of the market by the chains is inevitable if these independent retailers don\u2019t demonstrate the potential for greater quality.\nThere are some great examples to follow. Perhaps they are not immediately obvious, but if you search them out you will find them. There are the Italian guys whose heads were wetted in the Italian espresso scene, whose baseline for a good espresso tends to be quite high. If you follow a group of Italians around for long enough maybe they will lead you to these places. There are plenty of Irish guys too, in Dublin, Galway, Cork, and elsewhere who \u201cget it\u201d. They understand the importance of freshly roasted, freshly ground beans. They train their staff to know the difference between good and bad coffee. They insist on better coffee. These guys don\u2019t live in isolation though. Behind them there is the chain. The chain goes back from retailer, to roaster, to importer / buyer, ultimately to the co-op or farm where the green coffee emanates.\nNaked Portafilter\nSurely the guys making the brilliant coffee are rolling in the euros and like a virus the idea of quality speciality coffee is spreading? It\u2019s not that simple. The unwashed masses I referred to previously are in fact the greatest obstacle to improving the standard of coffee commonly accessible in Ireland. No one really wants to create crap coffee, everyone wants to take pride in their product, but the roadside is strewn with the corpses of coffee shops with principles. What\u2019s the point in getting the finest beans, and observing the best standards and preparation techniques if your customers neither understand nor appreciate the difference? Despite the increasing familiarisation with terms like macchiato, ristretto and arabica, they are little more than buzz-words to many.\nWith this in mind it is the objective of this website to draw attention to those in the Irish coffee scene who strive for excellence, not to criticise those who fail to meet these standards, because ultimately the market defines the standards, and our market is not there yet. This website wants great coffee in Ireland to become the norm. Moving the standard of coffee forward in Ireland need not be an exclusive elitist effort. In fact to really succeed it cannot be that. Through awareness, passion, and example the bar can be raised for everyone. If this website, in any small way can put a little spotlight on those whose cross this is to bear, then it will have succeeded.\nModern me wants to drink more coffee outside of the home.\nP.S. This website does not advocate stalking Italians.\nP.P.S. Maybe a little.\n"}, {"score": 639.30865, "uuid": "f101aa4d-8afe-5e67-96fe-2792a5e6d75c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1406wb-31-08471", "target_hostname": "www.sweetmarias.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sweetmarias.com/coffee.reviewarchive.l-p.php", "page_rank": 1.3066347e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Sweet Maria&#x27;s <em>Coffee</em> Cupping Reviews: Archive L - P", "snippet": "Robusta also helps <em>espresso</em> to cut through in <em>cappuccino</em>, so this blend is recommended for milk drinks ...except <em>Latte</em>, which is simply <em>the</em> Big Gulp version of an <em>espresso</em> beverage <em>and</em> will hopefully fall out of fashion soon!

Starbucks\u2019 doors are open to accommodate the line that extends past the counter. Patrons leave, quickly finish their coffee, and then toss the cup. Coffee has become a bit of a thoughtless consumable, a necessity to exist. But for local aficionados, coffee \u2014 from the green fruit grown around the world to the roasting process \u2014 is a way of life.\nJohn Wheir started Beacon Coffee in Ventura close to a year ago, after working for Whole Foods\u2019 Allegro roasters and as the senior roaster at The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf\u2019s offices in Camarillo. Over time, Wheir developed a keen sense of how a bean should look, feel and taste when properly roasted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an appropriate way to roast every bean. To do each and every bean justice, to show it in its best light,\u201d said Wheir. Beacon\u2019s cafe began as an educational center in which shop owners and their baristas came to learn the proper technique for brewing or \u201cpulling\u201d a shot of espresso.\nWheir then opened the cafe to the public, offering an education in the origin of the beans that become lattes or cappuccinos. Wheir has traveled the world visiting farms and meeting farmers, something he finds important in the age of faceless interaction.\n\u201cWe try as hard as possible to be transparent in the process. We believe that when you taste Guatemala Antigua, you should understand and recognize the difference between it and others.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s wife, Jennifer Wheir, is the manager of Palermo in Downtown Ventura, and the Chief Operations Officer for Beacon Coffee. She\u2019s overseen the locavore movement at Palermo, sourcing locally produced ingredients to try and take an edge off the premixed powders and syrups that Starbucks and other chains utilize.\n\u201cI like to experiment with coffee. Some of our best-selling drinks are things you don\u2019t find elsewhere,\u201d Jennifer said. Over the years, the baristas at Palermo have experimented with everything from lavender in mochas to orange peel, to induce a unique flavor for their espresso, provided by Beacon. Much of their ingredients can be sourced from within the county, an ideal that Jennifer believes stays true to the agricultural origins of Ventura County.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cultural difference between L.A. and Ventura. People here are more about the local community.\u201d\nRather than deny the large corporations that surround them, Wheir and the baristas of Palermo have adapted to appease their customers\u2019 requests.\n\u201cPeople ask for a frappuccino and we joke with them not to say the F-word,\u201d said Wheir. \u201cWe know what they\u2019re talking about, though; we can make one very similar. We see them again because we make it better.\u201d\nIn Camarillo, Mike Colston, owner of Element Coffee, slowly brews a cup of coffee using his distinct \u201cpour over\u201d method, a process that takes two to three minutes to complete, utilizing a cone-shaped ceramic pot balanced above an empty mug. Here, things move at a leisurely pace while customers relax on sofas.\nThere are no blended drinks on the menu. The most experimental drink, called a Black & Tan, is the coffee equivalent to the bar classic, using half and half and espresso. Rather, Colston chooses to highlight the nuances of the coffee he serves, with each cup\u2019s beans ground fresh to order while the chocolate and vanilla syrups used for lattes and mochas are handmade.\n\u201cYou\u2019re guaranteed a fresh cup,\u201d Colston said. \u201cIf you go into any given coffee house, you have no idea how long it\u2019s been sitting in those containers. You can know that we\u2019re going to make you a fresh cup every time because we grind it when we make it. As soon as it\u2019s ground, it\u2019s losing all kind of flavor.\u201d\nColston, who has traveled far and wide in search of the perfect cup of coffee, receives his beans from Verve, a roasting company located in Santa Cruz. Opened two years ago in the location once inhabited by a branch of Palermo in downtown Camarillo, Element has become the focal point for connoisseurs seeking coffee perfection.\n\u201cI think what\u2019s important to me is finding ways to give a small town everything that larger cities get,\u201d said Colston. \u201cA lot of times you find coffee shops like this in the Bay Area or L.A. Why doesn\u2019t a small community deserve just as good a cup of coffee?\u201d\nWithin two miles, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Starbucks occupy corner markets, places where Colston, like many, were first introduced to the budding world of coffee. His appreciation grew beyond the abilities of the larger corporations as he began to form the basis of Element\u2019s motto of rising above the mundane.\n\u201cI used to be able to drink five cups of Denny\u2019s coffee and be OK with that,\u201d said Colston as his last customers of the night trickled out. \u201cLittle did I know that coffee had the potential to be something far greater.\u201d\nWhile there will always be the morning rush at the local chain, there exists an alternative in which John and Jennifer Wheir, Mike Colston and many others serve coffee as if it were gold, trading salesmanship for expertise. One doesn\u2019t have to seek out El Dorado to enjoy a cup \u2014 the next generation of alchemists has set up shop next door.\n"}, {"score": 599.9769, "uuid": "45472377-7342-5ef3-bc69-d96e74b5cac5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0604wb-14-17243", "target_hostname": "www.metrojacksonville.com", "target_uri": "http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2011-nov-inside-riversides-bold-bean-coffee-roasters", "page_rank": 1.2717438e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Inside Riverside&#x27;s Bold Bean <em>Coffee</em> Roasters | Metro Jacksonville", "snippet": "But <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> this place <em>and</em> <em>the</em> type of <em>coffee</em> shops you normally see is abundantly clear even to me.

Zack Burnett, Bold Bean's roastmaster, gives Metro Jacksonville a behind the scenes tour.\nPrint Article\nAbout The Riverside coffee bar\nBold Bean puts a different spin on the traditional Jacksonville coffee shop theme. \u00a0Currently, Bold Bean roasts artisan coffee for restaurants and stores, such as Whole Foods, throughout Florida in a small Southside warehouse. \u00a0Bold Bean's Riverside venue joins this roasting operation with a brew bar in a coffeehouse style setting. \u00a0In addition to Bold Bean's artisan coffee blends, the brew bar will also offer five to six beers on tap. \u00a0The roastery and brew bar was designed by local Architects Greg Beere, James Blythe, and Jason Fisher of Content Design Group. According to Content Design, \"Because of the relationship that Bold Bean has with organic coffee and sustainability, we wanted the space to remain raw, but we needed to introduce a bit of warmth to the design. \u00a0The bar is warmed with wood planks wrapping it and the main wall, while weathered 5-v crimp metal frames the roastery area and the bar seating area, adding a touch of a rustic finish. Carpet has been ripped up from the floor and the existing concrete floor will be sealed and exposed.\"\nThe Brew Bar\nQuote\nSure, as roasters, we\u0092ll take some of the credit for the coffee in your cup. But, in our eyes, it is the farmer who is the real star.\nSmall-scale, family farmers in remote regions of Central and South America, Mexico, Africa, Indonesia, the Pacific and Caribbean carefully tend and produce remarkable coffee crops on tiny, mountainside plots that are often perched more than a mile above sea level. Those farmers and their families are at the heart of every bag of our 100% high-altitude Arabica coffees \u0096 the finest coffees in the world.\nEach family\u0092s attention to detail and the care that goes into producing their crops \u0096 coupled with near-perfect climates and ideal growing conditions \u0096 result in green coffees of exceptional quality.\nAs a small, family business, we can relate to the farmers who produce those coffees. We share the same pride in product and a commitment to quality as those farmers and farm families who produce the extraordinary green coffees we roast. And, like them, we\u0092re hands-on, involved in every facet of production, from the time a shipment of green coffee beans arrives at our roastery until each bag is filled, sealed and packed for shipment or delivery.\nBut our involvement doesn\u0092t end there. Our commitment to exceptional customer service goes beyond the sale, and is as important to us as the quality of the coffees we produce.\nOur small-batch, artisanal approach to roasting brings out the best flavor and aroma characteristics in every batch of beans, from delicate floral notes and a natural sweetness not unlike that of fruit and berries, to bittersweet chocolate,. Caramel and cinnamon. And, the classic design and well-tooled details of our gas fired Ambex drum roaster allows us to manually control every aspect of each roast.\nAnd, because we are committed to bringing our customers only coffees of outstanding quality and freshness, we roast fresh daily to ensure that our coffees will be delivered to you at the peak of flavor and aroma.\nhttp://www.boldbeancoffee.com/about\nThe Roastery\nBold Bean will be a great addition to the Stockton Street Town Center, which is already home to a cluster of exciting businesses including Bakery Moderne and 13 Gypsies. \u00a0Bold Bean is tentatively expected to open on Wednesday, November 30, 2011.\nArticle and photographs by Ennis Davis.

Green cherries spoil the taste of a cup of coffee. This process is performed entirely by hand.\nPulping:\nThe same day the berries are gathered, they are subjected to a pulping process, whereby the berry is removed from the bean.\nFermentation:\nDuring this part of the process, the beans are allowed to rest.\nWashing:\nThe remains of mucilage left on the bean are removed and sugars are eliminated with fresh water.\nDrying:\nAfter washing, the beans are exposed to the heat of the sun for their humidity to decrease, thus facilitating their conservation. To make transportation easier, the dried beans are then packed in clean sacks made from sisal. Further on, the thin shell of parchment called pergamino is removed from the bean.\nRoasting:\nThe process comes to an end with the roasting of the coffee. The green bean is subjected to a heat source, and delicious aroma and flavor are generated.\nBefore it ever gets to Jacksonville, the boys will be threading it through Tunnel 13 on the coffee line near Pereira, Colombia, in the 'Zona Cafe.'\nOCKLAWAHA\nDog Walker\nDecember 04, 2011, 08:44:21 AM\nWe forget what young, rugged mountains the Andes are.\u00a0 That first picture is just surreal, like something out of Lord of the Rings.\nAll of the steps to get a cup of coffee; makes you wonder how it was ever discovered.\nstephendare\nQuote from: Dog Walker on December 04, 2011, 08:44:21 AM\nWe forget what young, rugged mountains the Andes are.\u00a0 That first picture is just surreal, like something out of Lord of the Rings.\nAll of the steps to get a cup of coffee; makes you wonder how it was ever discovered.\ngoats.\u00a0 and their adventurous herder, named Kaldi.\nIt was illegal for Christians to drink it in most parts of europe.\nstephendare\nDecember 04, 2011, 08:58:52 AM\nThe story of coffee has its beginnings in Ethiopia, the original home of the coffee plant; coffee Arabica, which still grows wild in the forest of the highlands. While nobody is sure exactly how coffee was originally discovered as a beverage, it is believed that its cultivation and use began as early as the 9th century. The only thing that seems certain is that it originated in Ethiopia, from where it travelled to Yemen about 600 years ago, and from Arabia it began its journey around the world.\nThe Ethiopian legend surrounding the discovery of the coffee bean revolves around an inquisitive goat herdsman Kaldi. Kaldi's goats' behavior became suspiciously noisy, exaggerated, and enthusiastic one afternoon. He observed his goats eating a bright red cherry off nearby trees. In interest, Kaldi decided to try one of these obscure berries and was excited to discover the berries had the same energetic effect on him as it did his goats. Kaldi sped home to his wife with his pockets stuffed with these berries. She was as excited as he was and, convinced they were a gift from God, sent Kaldi to their local monastery. The monk was skeptical of this so-called miraculous discovery and declared the berries from the devil while throwing them into the fire. An enticing aroma began to saturate the room drawing other monks in curiosity. They knelt down and scooped up the now roasted berries to cover them with hot water for preservation. That night the monks sat up drinking the rich fragrant brew and discovered for themselves the novel sense of elation and energy. They committed to drinking the brew every night to help them stay awake during night prayers.\nFrom Ethiopia, the ingenious coffee beans made their way north to Yemen and eventually became a staple drink in Arabia. Over time the legend of and love for coffee spread throughout Europe and was eventually exported to various colonies around the world. An insignificant goat herdsman in the solitude of the Ethiopian hills made one of history's most significant beverage discoveries that has led to revolutions, epiphanies, innovations, and a socially based coffee-drinking culture.\nIt was the Arabs who first roasted coffee, produced it, and marketed it as a drink in defiance of a ban issued by the religious authorities in Mecca.\nstephendare\nDecember 04, 2011, 09:09:44 AM\nFrom the Muslim world, coffee spread to Italy. The thriving trade between Venice and North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the \"Muslim drink.\" The first European coffee house opened in Italy in 1645. The Dutch were the first to import coffee on a large scale. The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon.\u00a0 The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711.\u00a0 Through the efforts of the British East India Company, coffee became popular in England as well. Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still in existence today. Coffee was introduced in France in 1657, and in Austria and Poland after the 1683 Battle of Vienna, when coffee was captured from supplies of the defeated Turks.\nWhen coffee reached North America during the Colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe as alcoholic beverages remained more popular. During the Revolutionary War, however, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was also due to the reduced availability of tea from British merchants. After the War of 1812, during which Britain temporarily cut off access to tea imports, the Americans' taste for coffee grew, and high demand during the American Civil War together with advances in brewing technology secured the position of coffee as an everyday commodity in the United States\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#History\nProhibition\nCoffee was initially used for spiritual reasons. At least 1,100 years ago, traders brought coffee across the Red Sea into Arabia (modern-day Yemen), where Muslim dervishes began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. This beverage was known as qishr (kisher in modern usage) and was used during religious ceremonies.\nCoffee drinking was prohibited by jurists and scholars (ulema) meeting in Mecca in 1511 as haraam, but the subject of whether it was intoxicating was hotly debated over the next 30 years until the ban was finally overturned in the mid 16th century. Use in religious rites among the Sufi branch of Islam led to coffee's being put on trial in Mecca: it was accused of being a heretical substance, and its production and consumption were briefly repressed. It was later prohibited in Ottoman Turkey under an edict by the Sultan Murad IV. Coffee, regarded as a Muslim drink, was prohibited by Ethiopian Orthodox Christians until as late as 1889; it is now considered a national drink of Ethiopia for people of all faiths. Its early association in Europe with rebellious political activities led to Charles II outlawing coffeehouses from January 1676 (although the uproar created forced the monarch to back down two days before the ban was due to come into force).\u00a0 Frederick the Great banned it in Germany in 1777 for nationalistic and economic reasons; concerned about the price of import, he sought to force the public back to consuming beer. Lacking coffee-producing colonies, Germany had to import all its coffee at a great cost.\nA contemporary example of religious prohibition of coffee can be found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The organization holds that it is both physically and spiritually unhealthy to consume coffee. This comes from the Mormon doctrine of health, given in 1833 by founder Joseph Smith in a revelation called the Word of Wisdom. It does not identify coffee by name, but includes the statement that \"hot drinks are not for the belly,\" which has been interpreted to forbid both coffee and tea.\nQuite a number of members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church also avoid caffeinated drinks. In its teachings, the Church encourages members to avoid tea and coffee and other stimulants. Abstinence from coffee, tobacco and alcohol by many Adventists has afforded a near unique opportunity for studies to be conducted within that population group on the health effects of coffee drinking, free from confounding factors. One study was able to show a weak but statistically significant association between coffee consumption and mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all causes of death.\nFor a time, there had been controversy in the Jewish community over whether the coffee bean was a legume and therefore prohibited for Passover. Upon petition from coffeemaker Maxwell House, the coffee bean was classified in 1923 as a berry rather than a bean by orthodox Jewish rabbi Hersch Kohn, and therefore kosher for Passover\nstephendare\nDecember 04, 2011, 09:21:04 AM\nNaturally there were crazy claims surrounding coffee:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_coffee\nThe banning of women from coffeehouses was not universal, but does appear to have been common in Europe. In Germany women frequented them, but in England they were banned. Many believed coffee to have several medicinal properties in this period. For example, a 1661 tract entitled \"A character of coffee and coffee-houses\", written by one \"M.P.\", lists some of these perceived benefits:\n\u201c \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'Tis extolled for drying up the Crudities of the Stomack, and for expelling Fumes out of the Head. Excellent Berry! which can cleanse the English-man's Stomak of Flegm, and expel Giddinesse out of his Head. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201d\nNot everyone was in favour of this new commodity, however. For example, the anonymous 1674 \"Women's Petition Against Coffee\" declared:\n\u201c \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0...the Excessive Use of that Newfangled, Abominable, Heathenish Liquor called COFFEE [...] has [...] Eunucht our Husbands, and Crippled our more kind Gallants, that they are become as Impotent, as Age.\nben says\nDecember 04, 2011, 09:33:09 AM\nDamn those pictures are amazing...That first one especially.

We had bumped into each other exiting the car park and walked over together, slightly embarrassed like a pair of adulterous lovers caught before they were safe in their nest.\nThere isn\u2019t space inside so we grab a table outside. The menu comes, we make our own orders. Time was when we remembered each other\u2019s usual choices. Now I can\u2019t remember if you prefer a latte or a cappuccino. You seem surprised when I order a double shot; I didn\u2019t use to drink that much coffee, I guess.\nWe are like little children again, strangers at our first meeting. Shy and slow to warm. Our shared history almost forgotten. We have coffee, we have our single slices of cakes. We eat. We discuss the weather (unpredictable), other friends we have lost touch with (ironic), our bodily pains and aches (ageing). We smile and drink more coffee.\nWe used to laugh, we used to spend our precious minutes sending text messages to each other, small endearments and worthless gossip. What we have now is what remains. Our moment in the sun.\nWe used to be so tight, we were, inseparable and then some. (Find one and so you find his other, they would say.) Deepest secrets and darkest tears. Embraces that would last for days. Friends are forever, and then you find you walk different ways; you can walk away. You are you, and you, and you. So many true friends come, and so many will go, whatever you may say. Promises aren\u2019t promises; everything changes and nothing stays.\nI sit here, at this small table outside this small caf\u00e9. You are not here, and it is okay. We had our moment in the sun and we will always have that. When friends are gone, we are grateful for the friendship we had and the memories that remain. The sun warms my face and my coffee is strong. A good day. A smile on my face. I remember.

I would like to reassure everyone that we are reviewing our system and will be making changes to improve the flow of people \u2026. my wish list includes a second cash to speed up the lines \u2026 some new chairs in the front \u2013 as my 11 year old would say\u201dthere have been too many bums sitting in those chairs\u201d \u2026\u00a0they\u2019re not feeling a comfy as they used to \u2026 better stools at the back bar.\u00a0 Never in a million years could we ever have anticipated the volume of people who come through our door every day! It\u2019s been a steep learning curve with little room for error. We always appreciate your feedback \u2026 your patience \u2026 and your continued support.\nFeb 14th \u2026 La Festa di San Valentino ~ Leanne Cusack and CTV Live\nIt was our great pleasure to share the Valentine Day\u2019s stage with Mr. and Mrs. Henrick from Chelsea, Quebec \u2026 who\u2019ve been married for a blessed 57 years! Leanne Cusack had us\u00a0telling tales of love,\u00a0romance and friendship \u2026 some from the hills of Rome \u2026\u00a0others from the hills of the Gatineau Valley \u2026 all over a cup of Passion Fruit & Mango Sorbet. I had a quite a\u00a0chuckle when after I put out my modest, little sandwich board trying to draw attention to the fact that Leanne was going LIVE with CTV at NOON \u2026 an oversized CTV truck pulled up outside the front window and hoisted a monster-sized antennae in the air.\nFeb 13th ~ We\u2019ll be LIVE AT NOON on CTV NEWS OTTAWA with Leanne Cusack for Valentine\u2019s Day! A little romance, a little gelato \u2026 You\u2019re invited to drop by the shop around noon to share your love story \u2026 whether it\u2019s about that certain someone in your life who still gives you goosebumps after 25 years , your latest romance, your love of the Italian language, or simply your passion for \u201cla dolce vita\u201d Arrivaderci a domani!\nFeb 10th ~ Eating, Praying and Loving with Luca Spaghetti\nLuca Spaghetti, whom we all got to know\u00a0from\u00a0Liz Gilbert\u2019s\u00a0International Best Seller, Eat, Pray, Love joined us for an entertaining night of gelato, cappuccino and laughs last night. The Roman born and raised \u201cAccountant turned Writer\u201d told stories of when he first met Liz Gilbert in Rome, the\u00a0 making of the movie starring Julia Roberts and (yum) Javier Bardem\u2026who, by the way can come and eat my gelato anytime!\nJim Sherman from \u201cPerfect Books\u201d was on hand with Luca\u2019s recently released book \u201cUn Amico Italiano\u2026Eat, Pray, Love in Rome\u201d. And, here in the middle of Ottawa, at a little Gelato Shop that was once only a dream, the world became a little smaller\u2026it turns out that Luca lived about 3 km from Alessandro\u2019s family home in the neighbourhood of Prati in downtown Rome. Luca\u2019s uncle owns a restaurant not far from where the Giuliani Pub was located\u2026AND my family\u00a0ate at his restaurant when they were in Rome for our wedding over 25 years ago. Jim Sherman of Perfect Books took one look at Alessandro and realized that they knew each other from WAY back when we first arrived from Rome years ago. Alessandro had been invited to join the Jovial Fishing Club where Jim had been a member for years. He remembered Alessandro, green and fresh off the plane, up in the back-country, as they hauled lumber across the lake to rebuild an old cabin. Alessandro had been asked to wheel a wheelbarrow filled with heavy, wet sand down the dock\u2026.he made it about 3 feet, when he lost control and send it flying into the lake. To the jeers and teasing of the men around, Alessandro replied in his thick Italian accent \u201cin Italy I work with my brain, not with my hands\u201d. It\u2019s just like I said\u2026it\u2019s more than just Gelato\u2026it\u2019s about friendships forged along the road!\nTo buy Luca\u2019s book, contact Jim at Perfect Books, 258 B Elgin Street.

It wasn\u2019t just Liz\u2019s mouthwatering descriptions of the food that readers fell in love with, but the stories of the warm and welcoming friends she made in Rome. The most memorable and captivating of these was undoubtedly the inimitable Luca Spaghetti, Gilbert\u2019s close friend and guide to \u201cla dolce vita\u201d in Rome.\nThursday, February 9th from 7 to 9 pm Take a Roman Holiday at Stella Luna and meet Luca Spaghetti for an up-close and intimate evening \u201cGelato is Ice-Cream with Romance\u2026.The Culture of the Italian Gelateria\u201d\nJanuary 27th ~ TSN\u2019s Micheal Landsberg says\u00a0 Stella Luna has the Best Grilled Cheese in Ottawa\nLittle ole\u2019 us appreared on TSN\u2019s Off the Record for our non infamous grilled cheese panini.

With permission from the Branson Family, I have included\u00a0their note to Joel\u00a0below:\nOn Tuesday December 6th, my husband and I decided to have lunch at Stella Luna in Ottawa South.\u00a0 As we happily tucked into our delicious panini sandwiches, a lady at a neighbouring table said, \u201cGood, isn\u2019t it!\u201d. We agreed, adding it was our first visit.\u00a0 \u201cOur first time here too\u201d, she said. I explained that although we didn\u2019t watch much TV, we did watch Regional Contact on Sundays and enjoyed the review of this place. \u201cWe saw the same show and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here\u201d, she said.\nAfter sharing comments about the fantastic gelato, we rose to leave at about the same time. \u201cSee you here tomorrow,\u201d said our neighbouring diner.\n\u201cI wish,\u201d I said, \u201cbut we live south of Metcalfe\u2014too far\u201d. Conversation then led to the naming of curlers in Metcalfe well known to all five of us.\nWe then asked whether they lived in Ottawa. It turned out they lived in North Gower, one on the same road as our son.\u00a0 They had even been present on the day that he bid by auction on his property.\nThe visit to Stella Luna was just as you said it would be\u2014great food, friendly staff and friendly diners.\u00a0 We want to return. There are many flavours of gelato yet to try.\u00a0 And maybe Clara, Betty and Anima will be our cheerful companions at the next table.\nThank you to the staff of Regional Contact for providing such an informative and entertaining show.\nSincerely,\nLynne Branson\nDecember 13th ~ Centenarian at Stella Luna!\nWe were honoured today to receive a visit from Mr. Williams, who turns 102 years old on February 18th.

I feel like a kid standing in from of the teacher with some lame excuse for why I didn\u2019t do my homework\u2026I was too busy, I was inventing new flavours, the rainy days made me feel exhausted (I am DEFINATELY a solar person). After 3 months in business I\u00a0am taking my first night off\u2026.my daughter Erica and I\u00a0are heading see one of my favourite Italian artists perform \u2013 Zucchero Sugar Fornaciari on his \u201cChocobeck\u00a0\u00a0Tour\u201d. With a title like that, technically it could be considered\u00a0a \u201cwork night\u201d. Check out Zucchero at http://www.zucchero.it/. If you ever pass by the shop after hours, you might be able to hear the sound of Zucchero blaring through the window panes as we mop the floors to his rhythm and blues.\nOn the home-front, I made some yummy new flavours these past couple of weeks so drop by to check them out. I started making a lot of Custom Gelato Cakes. I did one for Thanksgiving at my sister\u2019s house\u2026Rich Chocolate on the bottom and Pumpkin Spice on top\u2026..modesty aside it was freaking DELICIOUS!!! Chocolate and Pumpkin are decidedly a match made in heaven\u2026.Well, off to the concert we go\u2026.maybe I\u2019ll get close enough to the stage to invite him back to the shop for some home-style gelato\n. Wouldn\u2019t that be a hoot!\n11:00 PM \u2013 The concert was AMAZING. We were sitting five rows from the front (surrounded by Stella Luna Gelato patrons!!!). Thanks to CHIN Radio Ottawa for the tickets!!\nOctober 4th ~ Pumpkin Cakes for Thanksgiving\nI will be preparing Pumpkin Gelato Cakes for Thanksgiving\u2026..imagine a layer of spicy pumpkin gelato pared with a layer of rich chocolate or madagascar vanilla!!!! Two words come to mind\u2026YUM ME! I won\u2019t be making many so order yours in advance.\nOctober 4th ~ P.U. verses PEW\nWe\u2019ve assembled a change table in the ladies bathroom (no sweat dads\u2026you can use it too) so you no longer have to change your wee ones on the church pew in the back of the shop. Lauren and I broke into a round of giggles when we realized that we\u2019d been telling people to change their babies on the PEW\u2026.is that PEW or P.U.????\nOctober 4th ~Welcome Back Adrian\nOur Front Line Woman and Queen of Efficiency, Adrian IS BACK (cheer, cheer). A certain American-franchise-who-shall-remain-nameless\u00a0but who attempted to instruct Adrian that THEY brought the cappuccino to America\u2026.HA! She wouldn\u2019t stand for it. She up and left the opportunity to speak more french for\u2026well the opportunity to speak more Italian\u2026that and\u00a0she missed Stella Luna\u2019s amazing customers and staff.\u00a0Adrian has moved to the afternoon/evening so all of you regular morning folks will have to drop by for a visit after 3pm to say hello.\nSeptember 25th ~ Sundays \u201cBeat the Monday Blues\u201d 40% Off Madness from 9:00 to 10:00 pm\nRemember that every Sunday from 9:00 pm to 10:00 pm we offer 40% off all gelato while quanities last. Come dressed in your jammies and we\u2019ll give you an additional 5% off\nSeptember 24th ~ Farewell Adrian\nAdrian, whom you\u2019ve come to know as one of our front line women has moved on to pursue her goal of learning French while in Ottawa from Vancouver Island. Adrian has been a treasured member of the Stella Luna staff \u2013 keeping us on track, keeping everything stocked, keeping the kitchen clean and organized, and\u00a0 most importantly keeping our customers happy and well served. Adrian has always given me the feeling like someone has my back\u2026that I might just let my guard down a minute because I know she won\u2019t miss a beat. She will be dearly missed. Next time you\u2019re flying out of the Ottawa Airport\u2026go through security and you\u2019ll find her working at\u2026\u2026gasp, I can\u2019t even say the word\u2026.you\u2019ll just have to look for her. See you on the other side of the counter my friend.\nSeptember 23st ~ Happy First Day of Fall!\nPumpkin puree, cinnamon, freshly grated ginger, a pinch of ground cloves, a sprinkle of nutmeg\u2026.sounds like Pumpkin Pie Gelato!

Off to make Lemon Poppy Seed Gelato and Raspberry Red Currant Sorbet!!\nSeptember 15th ~ Approval From the Pros\nFrom the looks of these photos our Dulce de Leche seems to have passed the taste taste!\nSeptember 15th ~ Have Your Cake and Eat it Too!\nI\u2019m inspired by our lovely friends Jill, Lori and Tara who cycled down to the shop all the way from Chelsea for lunch and gelato\u2026.I didn\u2019 t have the heart to remind them that it\u2019s up-hill all the way back!!\nSeptember 14th ~ Farewell Sofia!\nShe\u2019s gone! I only had a day to prepare myself to say goodbye\u2026.to try to decide what would be our last flavour together? Something traditional\u2026.spicy?\u2026.original?\u2026..innovative? The end came with very little warning\u2026one minute we were cranking out chocolate ginger together\u2026Sofia rocking back and forth to the rhythm of\u00a0Bridget\u2019s Latin music and the next, they were hovering over the doorway of the kitchen\u2026.\u201dstay where you are\u201d I told them\u2026\u201dshe\u2019s not clean yet\u201d! I took a quiet moment alone with her, gently rinsing the chocolate from her belly..getting her ready to face the long road ahead\u2026.and then they took her\u00a0through one final journey through the\u00a0front of the shop where we first met, down the stairs, past the Folklore Centre and \u00a0rolled her along Bank Street and out of sight. The first day we met\u2026.when she rolled off the back of the delivery truck and hit the sidewalk like a pigeon against a patio door, I knew she had spunk. Even with her compressor lying on her side, Sofia got\u00a0us through our first six weeks in business, cranking out flavour after flavour\u2026.and now her replacement has come and Sofia is gone. Goodbye my old friend. I\u2019ll miss you. Grazie.\nSeptember 14th ~ Gelato Tornado\u2026.\nI am living in a Gelato Tornado\u2026whirling through the kitchen, pans after pan held high over my head on my way to the display\u2026.mostly with a smile on my face\u2026sometimes wide eyed wondering how I will ever manage to make enough gelato for all the people lined up through the door, spilling onto the sidewalk. Never in my wildest dreams could I ever have imagined so many people. Yet, even amongst the choas of keeping up with the demand, your feedback inspires us to find time to sneek new, scrumptious ideas into the lineup\u2026.Chocolate Cardamon Gelato, Strawberry Rhubarb Sorbet and today\u2019s newest additiona\u2026.Lychee Sorbet. As always, we are appreciative of your support\u2026and keep those suggestions coming our way!\nSeptember 7th ~ Rich Hot Chocolate & Apple Cider with\u00a0 Creme Anglaise\u2026.yum!\nWe unpacked our CHOCOLADY (no I\u2019m not kidding\u2026that\u2019s really her name). She is a sleek, elegant, Italian, hot chocolate warmer with a Bain Marie system so as not to burn the delicate, rich chocolate. Heated to just the right temperature, the aroma of chocolate in the kitchen\u2026and I\u2019m talking good quality Chocolate Noir\u2026was irresistible\u2026.top it with freshly whipped cream and you\u2019ve a match made in heaven. Then there\u2019s Bridget\u2019s creation\u2026.a Hot Apple Cider infused with Creme Anglaise (and I must use capital letters because it\u2019s THAT good!). And if that weren\u2019t enough\u2026Lauren\u00a0sliced and chopped all morning to prepare an apple compote which we tossed into our base to make an absolutely scrumptious Apple Pie Gelato\u2026it was like taking a bite of pie and ice-cream at the same time\u2026but without the pie. Fall is bringing out our spicy side\nSeptember 6 ~ Back to School\nWelcome back Hopewell Students, Staff and Parents. Welcome back Carleton U\u2026.Ottawa U\u2026.St. Paul\u2019s! Moms and Dads with tots heading to school for the very first time\u2026.I\u2019ll but the kettle on to soothe your worries.\n\u201cIgnorance is the curse of God; knowledge is the wing wherewith we fly to heaven.\u201d William Shakespeare\nSeptember 2nd ~ Love Is in the Air at Stella Luna\nAn afternoon smooch over a raspberry filled Berle de Berlin. Good luck in Kingston Kayla!!\nSeptember 1st ~ Meet the Stella Luna Family Part I \u2013 The Morning Ladies\nA business is only as good as the people who provide the service. Here is a part of the team who makes Stella Luna such a special place\u2026.\nLAUREN \u2013 JUNIOR GELATO MAESTRO IN TRAINING!\nWith the precision of a surgical nurse, Lauren measures out all the gelato and sorbet recipes every morning, keeps me focused and on track and handles Sofia like a true friend.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t be messing with Lauren anytime soon \u2013 she\u2019s developed some pretty wicked biceps from wielding the MONSTER IMMERSION BLENDER\u2026.which must weigh at least 20 pounds without exaggeration! Lauren is responsible for coming up with the popular Black Forest Cake Gelato idea. Lauren assistance has brought some much needed sanity back into my life\u2026.leaving me more time to write silly blogs.\nADRIAN \u2013 ENERGY AND EXSUBERANCE IN ONE SMALL PACKAGE\nAdrian has the energy and drive of three people compacted into one small package. She sees everything, knows exactly what goes where, what\u2019s missing and gets the job done. She disappeared\u00a0down \u201cinto the dungeon\u201d (aka: the stock room) one day to do an inventory and came back hours later looking like she\u2019d run a marathon\u2026.we had to rehydrate her and lay her down on my nap mattress to recover before sending her back out onto the front line. Got a job needs doing\u2026Adrian is your woMAN!\nBRENDA \u2013 THE QUEEN OF COOL AND CALM\nNo matter how crazy busy or hectic the day, Brenda maintains an air of calm which centres the entire team. She has a smile that lights the room. One day Brenda smashed her finger on the espresso machine\u2026.and much like in a Bugs Bunny cartoon where the finger\u00a0starts pulsing to 50 times its normal size and a horn blasts a \u2018WHONK, WHONK\u201d sound, I could tell it hurt a lot\u2026.but the smile never once left Brenda\u2019s face.\nBRIDGET\u00a0 \u2013 CORDON BLEU GRADUATE/RESIDENT SANDWICH ARTIST/LATIN MUSIC AFFECTIONATO\nHere is the face behind those AMAZING GOURMET sandwiches you find every day\u2026.smoked salmon and aspargus frittata with a lemon and caper aioli\u2026oven roasted chicken (yes..an actual chicken roasted in the oven) with lime, cilantro and avocado\u2026.roated cherry tomatoes with carmelized onion and spicy arugula\u2026need I say more!!! Bridget is usually up to her wrist in parsly aioli! Every day she has new, ecletic ideas that make our mouths water\u2026and the early morning aroma of roasted fennel or fresh cilantro is heavenly.\nSeptember 1st ~ Fall Inspiration\nThe early morning air has turned in the direction of Fall and I leave home needing a sweater to warm my bones that haven\u2019t had quite enough sleep. The appoach of Fall inspires flavours we are testing out today \u2013 this afternoon: \u00a0Pineapple and Sambuca Sorbet\u2026.and tonight: Decadent Dark Chocolate with Whisky topped with Italian\u00a0Sour Cherries. And in the photo is our Raspberry Mango Puree ready to transform into tasty Sorbet\u2026colours worthy of an artist\u2019s palette!\nAugust 31st ~ The Family is Back!\nI\u00a0check the blog today and realized that the last two comments I wrote aren\u2019t here! And of course, they were brilliant\n. Trouble is, I don\u2019t know if I actually wrote them, or if I dreamt I wrote them, or if I wrote them, then Sofia started beeping and I forgot to save them and they disappeared never to be found again. Ah well. I had written about Matthew (youngest Giuliani) who had arrived back from the summer on Vancouver Island and worked his first shift bussing tables\u2026in his mini Stella Luna uniform looking OH SO ADORABLE!!! The little charmer made $9 in tips! And, if anyone from Revenue Canada is reading this..please let him bask in his 11 year old glory of making his first few under-the-table shiny loonies without raining on his parade with the black cloud of taxation. He was so proud to be back in town and working at the family business. It was the first time since we opened that all three kids were back in town and working together. I had my camera out all night waiting for the perfect shot to post but somehow we were so busy that I never had a chance. On the gelato front, I made a Strawberry Lime Sorbet that was amazing (I say that not with a lack of modesty but simply with appreciation for some truly fine fruit\u2026the lime balanced the sweetness of the fresh strawberries and the texture was divine!!). Sofia (read ahead to August 20th if\u00a0 you haven\u2019t yet been introduced) continues to act like an Italian Prima Donna! She was beeping, insisting that her Chocolate Banana be extracted and I was busy\u2026so I made her wait until the second beep\u2026then the third\u2026enjoying the thrill of treading in dangerous water\u2026feeling like I was living on the edge\u2026wanting to show her who\u2019s boss\u2026so Sofia did what Sofia always does when I make her wait. She had a fit. She started to vibrate, shooting all 10 gelato pans off her top where they crashed to the floor\u2026scaring the wits out of Lauren (who\u2019s usually very composed). So who\u2019s boss now? Sofia of course.\nAugust 24th ~\u00a0Matthew Comes Home Tomorrow!!!\nMatthew, our youngest son,\u00a0comes home from a summer on Vancouver Island tomorrow night and will be in the shop on Friday for lunch. He\u2019s given me his order\u2026.raspberry and lemon sorbet and dark chocolate. Pretty refined tastes for an 11 year old! I\u2019ll wait until he gets here on Friday and we\u2019ll make it together. I\u2019m off to pick up some Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream in the morning\u2026.thinking about mixing it into the creamy chocolate. Will be ready Thursday late afternoon. Tried a Chocolate Chip with Mint today\u2026lasted 4 hours\u2026very creamy!\nAugust 23rd ~ The Way We Were\nI was chatting with some friends tonight about our \u201clong and ardu\nous journey\u201d to open Stella Luna and it prompted me to look back on some photos. Was it worth it? RIGHT DOWN TO THE LAST DELICIOUS, CREAMY DROP OF SICILIAN PISTACHIO! Here\u2019s looking back at \u201cthe way we were\u201d\u2026\nAugust 23rd ~ Visions of Fall\nLauren started helping with the gelato production last week and it\u2019s made a world of difference to my days! It\u2019s allowing me more time to spend out front\u2026more time to plan for the cooler fall days. The panini have taken off like wild fire\u2026and I\u2019m so sorry if you\u2019ve come by and we\u2019ve sold out. Please know that I am increasing our bread order every week to accommodate the increasing demand for our fresh, wholesome, homemade panini. I\u2019ve started contemplating what life will be like on those crisp autumn days\u2026had a chat with the Folklore Centre about getting some live music in on Sunday afternoons\u2026starting imagining\u00a0cr\u00e8me anglaise on freshly made waffles, warmed chocolate sauce over Madagascar Bean Vanilla and steaming blueberry coulis on Fior di Latte Gelato. Mmmmmmm!!\nP.S. Matthew (the youngest Giuliani) flies back late Thursday night from Papa Ron and Nan\u2019s on Vancouver Island where he spent an amazing summer. He\u2019ll be in the shop on Friday for lunch wearing his minature version of the Stella Luna uniform (which is SO ADORABLE!!!). Finally, the entire Giuliani Family will be together once again. Drop by for lunch and I\u2019ll introduce you to him.\nAugust 22nd~ NEW Sunday Night Specials \u2013 9PM \u2013 10PM ALL CUPS AND CONES AT 40% OFF\nLast night\u2019s Sunday Night Special went extremely well! Every Sunday night, between 9PM and 10PM we offer all cups and cones at 40% off. Our decision to close Mondays means that no gelato or sorbet can be left hanging around in the freezer until Tuesday waiting to be loved\u2026.it\u2019s all got to go \u201cthe way of the tonsils\u201d. So next Sunday night, get a head start on beating the Monday Blues with a freshly made gelato or sorbet at 40% off the regular price\u2026while quantities last.

It seemed so disrespectful to call Her \u201cthe\u00a0gelato machine\u201d so I gave her a\u00a0distinguished\u00a0name\u2026..SOFIA.\u00a0You see, when Sofia has finished making gelato, and signals you in her high pitched, repeated, relentless\u00a0beeping, she will wait for no one. She will simply blow her top and begin to extract gelato out her sides\u2026.I hear\u00a0Her voice in my head\u2026in a lilting, thick, Italian accent\u2026I tolllld you I was redddy and you deedn\u2019t coome\u2026now yu must leeve with thee consequences.\u00a0Sofia, swaying back and forth trying to madly extract that last\u00a0bit of\u00a0Sicilian Pistachio from your blades\u2026I love you my friend!\nAugust 18th ~ NEWS FLASH\u2026..LE CORDON BLEU GRADUATE JOINS THE STELLA LUNA TEAM\nWe are thrilled to announce the newest member of the Stella Luna team \u2013 Bridget Prendergast!\u00a0 Bridget is a recent graduate of the Pastry Program at Le Cordon Bleu in Ottawa where she specialized in French pastry.\u00a0\u00a0Bridget`s come onboard to oversee the lunch menu\u2026introducing some delicious, eclectic\u00a0panini and fabulous salads and will start working towards introducing the Crepe & Waffle menu in the Fall (I have she makes a wicked Creme Anglaise!!!). Here`s a note from Bridget:\nHello Everyone,\nMy passion is food\u2026whether it\u2019s artisan gelato, pastry, grilling, sandwiches\u2026.ALL FOOD!\u00a0\u00a0In school I studied French pastry, with the basis being Viennese Pastry. \u00a0During Basic Pastry the focus was perfecting our technique \u2013 everything is done by hand (whipping eggs for meringue, whipping cream, making G\u00e9noise\u2026). \u00a0From there, we moved onto Intermediate Pastry and focused on mousse\u00a0cakes\u2026lots and lots of mousse cake! \u00a0Thankfully we were able to use our mixers, otherwise I\u2019d look like Popeye right now! \u00a0Superior Pastry was the most challenging, yet also the most fun \u2013 we were encouraged to create from the heart and use all of our senses \u2013 follow a recipe, but mix it up and change the flavours.\u00a0 The chefs want you to take risks!\u00a0 We rolled up our sleeves, and worked with sugar, chocolate, and fat, to make sculptures.\u00a0 I look back on my time at Le Cordon Bleu with only the fondest memories.\nFollowing my course, I also worked at Benny\u2019s Bistro on Murray Street in the Byward Market (where the people are amazing!!).\u00a0 I was part of a team, plating dishes, organizing the specials, cooking for lunch, brunch, and breakfast.\nIn addition to cooking, my interests include\u00a0music, spending time with friends and family, and travelling.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve been cooking and baking for as long as I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0My first memory of being in the kitchen was at my Nonna\u2019s house making cinnamon rolls.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve lived in Ottawa my entire life\u2026in the same house, in Little Italy and love it!\u00a0\u00a0I am looking forward to being a part of the Stella Luna team, and lending my creativity, and passion for well prepared food to this awesome shop!\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to meeting you!\nBridget\nAugust 13th ~ Special Announcement Coming Next Week\nAs we approach our 2 week anniversary, I can finally say we\u2019ve settled into a more comfortable routine. I\u2019m starting to get ahead instead of chasing to keep up which allows a little time to experiment with flavours. I made a tasty Rich Chocolate Ginger this week which seemed to be a hit. I started using some of our \u201cTwo Leaves and a Bud\u201d tea infusions which the cream flavours\u2026Chai Latte Gelato being the most popular. I was finally able to clear my head and think about something other than gelato\u2026panini \u2013 I picked up some lovely little cherry tomatoes, roasted them in the oven, dressed them with extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil and pared them with some fresh arugula and Fontina\u00a0cheese on Kalamata\u00a0olive bread for a tasty vegetarian panini\u2026.they sold out before I could even taste one! More tomorrow. I also have a surprise to announce next week\u2026someone special will be joining our staff\u2026.stay tuned! BTW\u2026Zachary and Erica come home on Monday\n. We sent them to Nonna\u2019s in Rome before we opened so they\u2019ll be seeing the place \u201call dressed up\u201d for the first time AND if you can believe it, they\u2019ll have their FIRST taste of my gelato\u2026.the machines arrived after they had already left. Fresh from Rome, they\u2019ll be able to give me an honest opinion of how mom\u2019s gelato compares to the pros in Italy. Little Matthew will be home toward the end of August\u2026he\u2019s still hanging out on Vancouver Island with Papa Ron and Nan \u2013 and loving every minute, in spite of being deprived of lemon sorbet.\nAugust 9th ~ La Notte di San Lorenzo\nTonight is \u201cLa Notte\u00a0di San Lorenzo\u201d\u2026the best night to view shooting stars.

So drop by, take a lick and wish upon a Stella!\u00a0 BTW\u2026the SICILIAN PISTACHIO arrived!!!\nAugust 8th ~ Home Before Sunset\nAlessandro and I spent the day tidying up loose ends yesterday. It was a tough decision to close Mondays\u2026..I was in the front of the cafe reprogramming the cash system and could see people coming to the door, gloomy looks appearing on their faces as they tugged at the locked door\u2026I felt SOOOO\u00a0guilty!!! But it really was necessary\u00a0to take a day to plan the menu for the week, catch up with the payroll and admin, clean the fridges, run errands and buy a few groceries\u2026.we even got home before the sun set for the first time in over 2 weeks! We had VEGETABLES for dinner. That might not seem like such a big deal to you but over the past 10 crazy-busy days we had been surviving on gelato and panini. It was bliss! Today, the Sicilian Pistachio arrived and our gelato display is featuring GOLDEN GREEN once again. Drop by for a taste.\nAugust 5th ~ New Hours\u2026Difficult Decisions\nIt\u2019s been so busy\u2026which is amazing. I ran out of base last night (PANIC ATTACK!!!)\u2026so we were here until past midnight getting them ready for today. The secret is out and people know we\u2019re here. I have been spending so much time in the kitchen cranking out pan after pan of gelato that I don\u2019t get as much time as I would like to spend upfront\u2026with YOU! That\u2019s the best part \u2013 chatting with neighbours, listening to your feedback. I get so absorbed in the recipes that I\u2019ve been told I constantly mutter to myself and make silly faces while I\u2019m working\u2026.I\u2019ll have to work on that. Alessandro and I made the very difficult decision last night to close on Monday. I feel terrible about it but we just can\u2019t keep up the pace\u2026I actually stretched out on the kitchen floor yesterday and took a power nap. We continue to be filled with passion and love for what we do\u2026but those middle-aged bones just won\u2019t keep up. A day a week will allow us to catch up with our home-life and the admin side of the business and have at least 1 family dinner a week\u2026and sleep in to the ridiculously leisurely hour of 7:00 AM!! Imagine!!! I can\u2019t tell you enough how appreciative we are of your continued support. Grazie!!! A presto.\nAugust 4th ~ Flying By the Seat of Our Pants\nUp at 5:30 am\u2026out the door by 6:00\u2026doze with Alessandro at the wheel\u2026arrive\u2026make a list of sandwiches to prepare\u2026worry that I forgot to order stock\u2026take a moment to breathe, inhaling the aroma of an amazing cappuccino made with velvety milk\u2026reflect on a moment of gratitude for our incredible team of staff and a neighbourhood who has welcomed us so warmly\u2026.dream about the gelato flavours I am going to make today\u2026.worry that I won\u2019t get them done in time\u2026.wonder at how for a \u201cslow food\u201d establishment the pace seems awfully fast (?). Reap the rewards of a year-long adventure \u2013 laughing children, amber lighting reflecting the faces of happy, satisfied people chatting and connecting with friends. Feeling a lot like we\u2019re a village within the city. Sigh.\nJuly 31 ~ Build it and They Will Come!\nWhat an overwhelming first day with over 750 people through the door. We had anticipated a \u201csoft opening\u201d\u2026we\u2019d just quietly open our doors and let people discover we\u2019re open. We figured most people would be out of the city on holidays\u2026.NOPE! Most people in the city were at Stella Luna!! In the early morning I gently nestled each flavour into its\u00a0space in the display cabinet\u2026by noon, I was wearing out the floor between the\u00a0kitchen to the front, cranking out gelato faster than is humanly possible\u2026wasn\u2019t this supposed to be \u201cslow food\u201d. The feedback was wonderful\u2026THANK YOU to all of you who popped their heads in the kitchen to offer\u00a0words of encouragement and tell us how much you loved it. KUDOS to the Stella Luna team as well \u2013 brand new staff, brand new products, new cash, new debit machine, new everything\u2026and they were amazing! They hustled and bustled, keeping a smile on their faces and keeping up with the pace. Thank you to everyone who made our first day such an incredible experience. Now, back to the kitchen!\nJuly 30th ~ AT LAST!!!\nI\u2019ve been wanting to post all the amazing photos I took of the finished product\u2026both of the transformation inside and the display case filled to the brim with fresh, creamy gelato\u2026but\u00a0I can\u2019t find the cable for my camera\u2026it might be a case of sugar overload\u2026I\u2019ve been tasting every flavour before it goes in the display cabinet. We had a lovely celebration yesterday with family, friends and those who have helped shape us into what we are today. I prepared gelato, we had music, everything went very smoothly and the staff was amazing. We\u00a0took Saturday off to hang pictures, finish putting the glassware away, start the preparation for a brand new display filled with gelato for you tomorrow \u2013 opening day. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s really here! I wish I had just a few more days to put everything in its place, make sure it\u2019s absolutely perfect for when you come.\u00a0 I\u2019m so nervous\u2026and quite sad that the children won\u2019t be here to share the big day with us. They all called yesterday to see how the\u00a0celebration went\u2026I could hear a tinge of sadness in their voices.\u00a0Not that it\u2019s such a hardship to \u201chave to\u201d spend the summer with Nonna\u00a0in Rome! Ho hum, what should I do today, swim in the mediterranean or visit the Spanish Steps? \u00a0If I find that camera cable, I\u2019ll post those photos for you to see. It\u2019s almost time. We\u2019ll see you on the other side\u2026ATTRAVERSIAMO!!!!!!\nJuly 27th ~ OPENING SUNDAY, JULY 31!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI am taking a HUGE leap of faith to tell you that we\u2019ll finally be opening our doors on SUNDAY, JULY 31. We passed our Building Inspection yesterday (remember that we started with a shell \u2013 the building had been stripped from the roof deck to the foundation). We had to install all the plumbing, electrical and heating and ventilation systems. The flooring is almost finished, we brought the furniture in, the painting will be completed today and I sterilized the kitchen last night so I can start experimenting with my recipes. Today we\u2019ll start unpacking boxes and boxes of dishes and the team will start begin training on the espresso machine. There has been a steady stream of people popping by to see if we\u2019re open and I feel SO\u00a0BAD to have to turn you away. We\u2019ve all been waiting ALL LONG, LONG, TIME! BTW\u2026how did you like the sign????\u00a0Kevin from Classic Graphics in Kemptville did a beautiful job building it from a design that Mike Leahy put together.\nJuly 24th ~ We Make Our First Batch of Gelato Today\nWe scrubbed the kitchen, dusted off my recipe book\u00a0and made our first batch of gelato this morning to test out the machines\u2026.choosing to start with a rich, creamy PISTACHIO. We\u2019ve opted to use\u00a0pure pistachios\u00a0imported from Bronte, Sicily. Bronte is a town near Mount Etna -the\u00a0tallest, active volcano in Europe,\u00a0made\u00a0famous for\u00a0what is referred to as\u00a0\u201dthe green gold\u00a0of Bronte\u201d.\u00a0 It was delicious! Creamy, with the rich taste of pistachios\u2026.impossible to believe it was made with milk and not cream. There was a steady stream of friends dropping by to check on our progress so I ended up making a refreshing blood orange sorbet followed by a tangy\u00a0apricot sorbet! Tomorrow, Rome Flooring is onsite\u00a0to install the hardwood, so before heading home, I stopped to pick up some juicy, ripe mangos -\u00a0a little mango sorbet should keep them cool. I\u2019m also going to whip up mascarpone and rum gelato. I was so worried about forgetting everything I learned in Bologna but, just like riding a bicycle, it all came back to me as soon as I put on my apron.\nJuly 22nd ~ We\u2019re Missing 2 out of 3 Children\nThe phone rang at 4:30 am this morning\u2026it was Alessandro\u2019s sister in Rome. It would seem that our children are lost somewhere around Piazza Navona. We had the brilliant idea to send the kids to their grandparents for the summer so we could focus on \u201cthe newborn\u201d \u2013 knowing full well that a new business would require\u00a0early mornings and late nights\u2026.and as a result, a sometimes\u00a0very grouchy disposition. But now we\u2019re in a predicament \u2013 not only do we have to locate our children somewhere in the eternal city, but because we\u2019ve encountered so many delays, the kids will miss the Stella Luna opening \u2013 our little family business is about to open WITHOUT OUR FAMILY!!!!! So, we\u2019ve decided that the day we\u2019re ready to open (which will be the END OF JULY) we\u2019ll do it quietly,\u00a0without a big hoopla\u2026no helium balloons, no dancing clown on the sidewalk (just kidding \u2013 I\u2019d never do that anyway). When the kids return we\u2019ll have a BIG GRAND OPENING CELEBRATION. And in the meantime, we\u2019ll get to know each other over a cup of \u00a0gelato.\nJuly 21st ~ Reality TV in Old Ottawa South\nSince I took the paper off one of\u00a0the front windows, there has been a steady\u00a0stream of people who pass by to cup their hands against the glass, sneaking a peek at the latest progress. Last night, after my fourth straight 16 hour day, I took a minute to stretch out along the old church pew (which just happens to be parked smack-darn in front of the window) to rest my throbbing feet. I had only planned to close my eyes for \u201cjust a second\u201d but ended up dozing off. Now you can imagine what that must have looked like to anyone who happened to be passing by \u2013 Old Ottawa South gets its own reality TV show!\nJuly 19th ~ The Day My Gelato Equipment Fell of the Back of the Delivery Truck!!\nThe sun was shining, the radio was cranking out the tunes, the team was happily working towards the opening date and my nose was pressed against the front glass window like a kid in a candy store, waiting for the delivery truck to arrive with my gelato equipment\u2026the same equipment that travelled all the way across the dark, stormy Atlantic Ocean. And then IT happened. As I stood in the doorway, grinning like an idiot at the prospect of whipping up some cool, creamy mango sorbet, my $25,000 specialty gelato batch freezer\u2026.the Ferrari of gelato machines, catapulted from the back of the truck onto the sidewalk. Now that\u2019s quite a predicament. Stay tuned.\nJuly 15th ~ On Target for the End of the Month\u2026..Really!!!\nWhew! Where do I even begin to tell you what\u2019s\u00a0happened\u00a0this week? Our team has just completed its third\u00a0week on the job site and things are just buzzing\u2026the tiles are down, the walls are up, the painting has started, the mill work\u2019s\u00a0installed, the hot water tank is in, the old church pews have been cut to size, the sign\u2019s ready to install (you\u2019ll have to wait until the last second until I reveal that masterpiece though:), the plumbing is finished, the lights are almost all attached,\u00a0the equipment starts to arrive Monday, and the staff is excited and ready to serve! My team has made the impossible possible! The time has come to quickly shift my mindset from \u201cendless renovations\u201d to \u201ccreating and preparing gourmet treats\u201d. I have to leap out of the familiar comfort zone of \u201cyear-long-thought-I-would-never-make-it-through\u201d reno project and open the doors for you to taste my dreams. Whew!\nJuly 18th\nExplore Dream Discover After months and months of \u201cslow as molasses\u201d progress, my team has taken over the show and things are happening faster than I can keep up. It\u2019s been a whirl-wind of activity at the shop\u2026.the sub floor is down, golden tiles are being laid, painting is transforming the once bare walls, ducts have been installed, Wayne turned the water on yesterday and we heard the sweet swoosh of fluid flow through\u00a0the pipes for the first time, the electrician is working through the weekend, Mario is installing the cabinets on Tuesday, the equipment is arriving on the 18th\u2026.whew! It\u2019s time for me to shift my mind set and start thinking about making gelato again\u2026it\u2019s been a while\u2026and I\u2019d be lying it I told you I wasn\u2019t incredibly nervous!\nJune 30th ~ Happy Last Day of School Hopewell!\nArrrr\u2026the school year ended without even one tasty gelato or creamy smoothie! That\u2019s sucks and I\u2019m sorry kids. I\u2019ll make it up to you in September with a\u00a0 little something special to soothe\u00a0your back-to-school-blues. In the meantime, \u00a0have an amazing vacation \u2013 drop by over the summer for a visit!\nOn the home-front, I arrived this morning to find a masked man sanding the walls getting it ready to apply the first coat of paint\u2026and if you can believe it, I still can\u2019t decide on my colours. Where\u2019s Debbie Travis when you need her?? My shipment of dark and milk chocolate covered yummies\u00a0arrived yesterday (almonds, hazelnuts, coffee beans, blueberries\u2026you get the picture). My family was \u201ctaxed\u201d with the job of taste testing to make sure it\u2019s all delicious enough for you\u2026.let\u2019s just say it was no hardship. Half the box of Gianduja\u00a0and Milk Chocolate Hazelnuts has\u00a0 already gone \u201cmissing\u201d.\u00a0Happy Canada Day Folks!\nJune 23rd \u2013 Opening Soon, Really!\nIt was a strange sight to see the kitchen walls go up today, creating a shape inside that has\u00a0lived in my imagination over the past year. It was exciting to finally experience it \u201cin real life\u201d. Simon is installing a giant window between the caf\u00e9 and the kitchen so you\u2019ll be able to watch me prepare gelato. Wayne \u201cSuper Plumber\u201d Beaven starts tomorrow fixing up my tubes and, tonight when you tuck yourself into bed, a giant stack of gourmet cones will set sail across the Atlantic Ocean from Northern Italy.\nP.S. I took the paper off the front door so you could come by and take a peek inside\nJune 21st -\u00a0Happy\u00a0Summer Solstice!\nHow perfectly appropriate that our crew started painting the exterior today, on the first day of summer. What a change!! The building looks so much like a rich creamy mango gelato made with ripe juicy fruit that I was tempted to take a lick! It\u2019s fresh, vibrant, inviting, and cheerful\u2026everything we aspire to be.\n\u201cWhatever is dreamed on this night shall come to\u00a0pass\u201d\u2026.sweet dreams gelato lovers!\nJune 15th -\u00a0Faith is the Bird\u2026\nTagore wrote \u201cFaith is the birth that sings when the dawn is still dark\u201d.

Venice has some of the most incredible Carnival masks in the world. And, being February, it was Carnival time. Within seconds of walking inside the door of this quirky little shop I spotted her hanging on the wall, right in front of me, in all her ceramic beauty\u2026.LUNA. \u00a0The expression on her face communicated something which I hadn\u2019t been able to find words for.\u00a0It\u2019s the expression\u00a0you make\u00a0when you take that first lick of a really, really delicious, freshly made,\u00a0artisan gelato. I smacked my euros down on the table, wrapped her up and lovingly carried her home. My LUNA, paired\u00a0with the face of STELLA -\u00a0a picture of tranquility and simplicity, depict everything we dream to become. We dreamt for the Stars and the Moon!\nJune 2nd -\u00a0The Bare Bones\nAmazing but true \u2013 when we scrape life down to the bare bones we can be grateful for such simple things. Today my gratitude is for my newly drywalled bathroom walls and my shiny new electrical panel!\u00a0 I am also grateful for chocolate. This morning I met with Leeorah from Chelsea Truffles about offering her artisan chocolate bars at Stella Luna. Leeorah is a Cordon Bleu Chef, trained Belgian Chocolatier who handcrafts all the bars herself, in Chelsea, using only the finest ingredients \u2013 which is a perfect marriage to Stella Luna Artisan Gealto!! www.chelseatruffles.com coming soon to Old Ottawa South.\nHe is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has. ~ Epictetus\nJune 1st \u2013 Porch Party\nI didn\u2019t intend to spend the entire day scraping the old Phase 2 sticker off the front door.\u00a0But, with the sun shining and that warm summer breeze blowing, true to the spirit of Old Ottawa South, it became a bit of a porch party. Neighbours stopped to chat, wondering about our opening date, sneaking a peek behind the glass to see how the interior is being transformed, sharing a memory of \u201ctheir first gelato\u201d.\u00a0Once all the tradesmen had left for the day, I climbed on top of a stack of dywall which tomorrow, will become the bathroom walls, to dream about opening day.\nMAY 27th \u2013 A Feast for Your Eyes!\nI\u2019ve spent\u00a0the past week trying to decide what colour to paint the exterior to give it a fresh, revitalized look..something reminicint of Italy. When my good friend Heidi, who\u2019s been travelling through Italy these past few weeks \u2013 feasting on gelato in my favourite hang-outs, visiting our old apartment, drinking the best espresso -\u00a0 sent me these photos, I stopped to wonder why we don\u2019t use vibrant colours to decorate our building in Ottawa\u2026.colours which are so different, yet always harmonious\u00a0- like our communities should be. Through the doom and gloom of endless\u00a0rainy days, loud hammering,\u00a0clouds of dust, and finding \u201csurprises\u201d in the walls you\u2019d rather not find (yes, sometimes surprises are NOT good!), I wanted to share some of Heidi\u2019s images of Italy with you to feast your eyes on \u2026Buon\u00a0Appetito!\nMAY 26th \u2013\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the expression \u201csometimes things have to get worse before they get better\u201d. Well, I hope they\u2019re right\u2026here\u2019s the view from inside today\u2026.the wall is up, the ceiling is down and there\u2019s a whole lotta mess in between. Once they crash through the back wall and make me my very own back door, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll\u00a0be a light at the end of the tunnel again.\nMAY 23 rd \u2013\nProgress is\u00a0as slow as molasses as these old buildings aren\u2019t partial to change. And, with the sun shining and the\u00a0mercury rising, my craving for a cool, rich and creamy gelato is becoming almost unbearable. I\u2019m hoping\u00a0 to see some real change inside this week!\nIt looks like I\u2019ll have to learn to live with those\u00a0awful, horribly ugly t-bar ceiling panels \u2013 the cost to replace them just won\u2019t squeak past my already tight-as-a-drum budget.

Keep it near the inner side of the pitcher to create a vortex with the milk.\nLindsey Goodwin\nFoamed milk or frothed milk is used in many espresso drinks and other hot beverages. With some practice, you can make fantastic foamed milk for cappuccinos, macchiatos, tea lattes and other drinks. Methods vary slightly for each drink, but these are the basics.\nPrep Time: 1\u00a0minute\nTotal Time: 3\u00a0minutes\nIngredients:\nCold milk (There's always a little waste in this process, so you'll need slightly more than you want to add to your drink.)\nPreparation:\nPour fresh, cold milk into a small metal pitcher.\nEngage the steam wand on an espresso machine.\nInsert the steam wand into the milk, just below the surface.\nKeeping the tip of the wand near the side of the pitcher, create a vortex in the milk.\nMove the pitcher so the steam wand is higher, lower, closer to the edge or further from the edge in order to incorporate air into the milk and break up larger bubbles. The bubbles should get progressively smaller.\nOnce the mixture has increased in size substantially (about double the volume for a cappuccino or 1.5 times the volume for a latte), remove the wand from the pitcher.\nThe texture of the milk should be smooth (not pixelated) and similar in appearance to melted ice cream. *\nImmediately pour the foamed milk into your espresso or other drink, leaving some in the pitcher.

The bubbles should get progressively smaller.\nOnce the mixture has increased in size substantially (about double the volume for a cappuccino or 1.5 times the volume for a latte), remove the wand from the pitcher.\nThe texture of the milk should be smooth (not pixelated) and similar in appearance to melted ice cream. *\nImmediately pour the foamed milk into your espresso or other drink, leaving some in the pitcher.

Bewley\u2019s is the first Irish company to launch this unique single serve coffee capsule product to the Irish market. The new Bewley\u2019s Gaggia Machine uses foil sealed capsules which provide deliciously fresh roast and ground coffee, and tea, immediately at the touch of a button. Apart from espressos and filter coffee on demand, an easy to use steam frother also allows everyone to make cappuccinos and lattes.\nWith this innovative new coffee machine, Bewley\u2019s has pooled all of its knowledge and expertise to satisfy demand for fresh coffee and tea all day. The pioneering coffee roaster has already trialed the machine with customers whose staff and clients have reacted enthusiastically to the exciting new offer.\nDavid Doran, Administrator, Anglo Irish Bank, commented on the benefits provided: \u201cThe machines work perfectly. They are easy to use and the coffee is super, it\u2019s a really good system. The coffee capsule is a sealed unit so it\u2019s as fresh as you can get it. People even come from other floors to use our machines. Our people like it, they like it a lot.\u201d\nAll a coffee or tea lover has to do is to place one of the unique new capsules into the machine for a choiceof freshly made filter coffee, decaffeinated coffee, espressoor tea \u2013 with the distinctive Bewley\u2019s aroma, trademark freshness and quality taste, just like a real caf\u00e9 coffee.\nBewley\u2019s Master Roaster Paul O\u2019Toole personally selected the varieties of coffee and tea used in the new capsule system, maximising the flavour intensity and freshness of the offer. Each sealed foil capsule contains 8 grammes of roast and ground coffee, or 2.5 grammes of fresh tea leaves, the exact amounts needed to provide consistent quality and taste every time.\nBecause each capsule provides a single serving, there is no wastage in addition to not having to guess the amount of coffee required to make that perfect cup. The fully airtight foil capsule provides a long shelf life and preserves the full flavour and aroma when making a cup of coffee or tea.\nThe beauty of The Bewley\u2019s single serve Gaggia machine is that it can be used in a variety of locations in the office environment including meeting rooms, canteens, conference rooms, reception areas or anywhere that people might want to enjoy a cup of tea or coffee. The machine is adaptable and can be moved between different rooms depending on requirements as it has an accessible water tank which can also be plumbed and unplumbed.\nIt is also designed for use in hotel meeting rooms and conference centres, where a fresh roasted and ground coffee service is seen as a big quality differentiator by guests and business delegates.\nIn research undertaken for Bewley\u2019s by independent Am\u00e1rach Research, four out of five Irish companies surveyed said that their employees appreciated the ability to have a high quality fresh coffee at work, comparable to their favourite nearby caf\u00e9. 70% of companies said that having a branded coffee solution in-house makes a positive impression on clients and guests as well as boosting staff morale. The independent research also identified Bewley\u2019s as the most popular brand of coffee and machine purchased by companies in Ireland today.\nBewley\u2019s Managing Director, Jim Corbett commented: \u201cThings are really looking up for the coffee aficionado at work. If you want to be a barista in your own boardroom, then this is the machine for you. It\u2019s simple to use, avoids any wastage and needs almost no cleaning. The coffee capsules offer a superb quality cup of Bewley\u2019s freshly roast and ground coffee with no tiresome measuring or brewing. This is a remarkable new system which will make a major difference for the overall quality of coffee and tea service in companies and venues all over Ireland,\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAt Bewley\u2019s, we have been exploring, sourcing and roasting the world\u2019s most delicious coffee for over a century. Ever since Bewley\u2019s broke from the East India Company\u2019s tea importation monopoly in 1835 and brought tea directly from Canton to Dublin, we have led the market with new innovations. Bewley\u2019s was the first company to offer \u2018bean to cup\u2019 coffee solutions to Irish customers, the first to offer \u2018coffee to go\u2019 in convenience stores, the first to introduce latt\u00e9 art to Ireland and the first to carry out quality audits for customers. We are now the first in Ireland to introduce a unique new capsule based single-serve system to the Irish business market.\u201d\nBewley\u2019s is a leading supplier in offices, caf\u00e9, restaurants and four and five star hotels across the country and supplies many of the largest business clients in Ireland including many well known names in the hospitality sector including The Ritz Carlton Hotel, The Merrion Hotel, The K Club, Dromoland Castle, Avoca, Hilton Hotels, Nude, Carton House, Butler\u2019s Chocolate Caf\u00e9, Caf\u00e9 Sol, the Thomas Read Group and Ashford Castle.\nBewley\u2019s provides full training on all coffee service systems as well as after-sales service and technical support through dedicated customer care and nationwide engineering teams.

So people who attend the school get a chance every year to order oil, which we did.\nThe arrival of the oil reminded me of one of the big lessons of the school: the soffrito. Soffrito is a terribly misunderstood technique, primarily because people don't realize that it is a technique. Raised on cooking television where the mire poix and trinity are common, people figure that the soffrito is the Italian word for mire poix, and so the assumption is that the soffrito is carrots and onion and celery, or perhaps only two of those.\nIn reality, soffrito means \"softly fried\", and it's actually the Italian version of \"sweating\", or cooking aromatic vegetables at a low temperature. It's used in the same way mire poix is, by being a flavorful base to just about anything savory.\nThe difference between mire poix and soffrito is that it doesn't really matter which aromatic vegetables you use in a soffrito. If you are missing carrots that day, don't fret. Use some more celery! If you have peppers, throw those in. The proportions are not key, the specifics are up to what you have handy when you're cooking. It's Italian: relax.\nThe technique is basically the same, though. Dice the aromatics into roughly equal-sized pieces, add some salt, andcook over medium-low heat in oil (or butter; whatever) until the vegetables show signs of being cooked. The signs include some increased transparency, being soft, deepening of color, depending on the vegetable.\nThere ya go. If you're making a soup, throw this together at the beginning for better flavor. If you're making a braise, throw this together for better flavor. Stews, casseroles, sauces, etc etc. Go for it. Don't fret about the specifics, just make sure you have some sort of base, and your food and diners will thank you for it.\n*- or, as the Italians call it, \"oil.\"\nin\n"}, {"score": 440.61243, "uuid": "ba280577-7af6-5d12-8350-19ffb50bdd90", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0107wb-80-29394", "target_hostname": "www.fairtraderesource.org", "target_uri": "http://www.fairtraderesource.org/2007/08/02/america-runs-on-fair-trade-dunkin/", "page_rank": 1.1734772e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Fair Trade Resource Network &raquo; America Runs on Fair Trade Dunkin&rsquo;", "snippet": "Apparently\u2014among <em>the</em> java titans, at least\u2014that\u2019s <em>the</em> Dunkin\u2019 <em>Difference</em>.

For many of us it's a crutch -- we just can't live without it. And it's a good reason why a certain chain coffee shop has stayed in business all these years, but we've got a bone to pick with them. Not only has this coffee company created Italian-sounding names that were never Italian to begin with ( Frappuccino ) but it's also caused some confusion with authentic terms, namely the macchiato. Most people would know an espresso or a cappuccino when they saw one, but would you know a real macchiato?\nThe Macchiato Defined\nThe macchiato (mah-key-AH-toe) is a cornerstone of Italian coffee culture, along with the espresso and cappuccino, among other coffee drinks . It's basically an espresso (served in a demitasse cup) with a small amount of foamed milk on top -- the name macchiato means \"marked.\" So really, you could look at it as a cross between an espresso and a cappuccino. Since Italians only drink cappuccino in the morning, a macchiato gives the afternoon drinker the option of having a little milk in their espresso for some extra flavor. It's also a good option for those who can't tolerate a strong espresso but find a cappuccino too weak and milky.\nThere is another type of macchiato called \"latte macchiato,\" which is a cup of hot milk with a shot of espresso, but it does not have caramel-flavored syrup added, which is what the chain coffee shop would have you believe is a true macchiato.\nHow To Order\nAn authentic macchiato is one of those coffee drinks that's served at any reputable coffee bar or restaurant, so you won't necessarily see it written up on the menu. Go ahead and order one without hesitation. But if you decide to order one at the chain coffee shop, you'll probably have to specify an \"espresso macchiato\" unless you want to get that caramel concoction. In Italy, all you have to ask for is a \"caffe macchiato\" and everyone will know what you want -- but don't ask for a frappuccino unless you want to be embarrassed.\nWhat's your favorite kind of coffee?

What is an Americano? \u2013 A Mocha?\nThese are the questions we need answered! hehe\nWe all enjoyed the famous South African Wimpy advert with the tagline; \u201cI love it when you talk foreign\u201d \u2013 referring to Wimpy\u2019s delicious new range of premium blend coffees.\nAt our breakfast, my order of a \u201cFlat White\u201d left my friends giggling with laughter, exclaiming that I\u2019d come to Port Elizabeth with my \u2018Cape Town\u2019 ways!\nI was shocked.\nThis is something that should be common knowledge -a universal language that we should all know!\nIt gave me a great idea for an article\nI have since made it my endeveour to list the most common javas (slang for \u2018coffees\u2019) around\u2026.\nSo here we go.\nAmericano\nThis you will often see on the menu as \u2018Caf\u00e9 Americano\u2019.\nIt\u2019s made by adding about 125 ml of hot water to a shot or two of espresso.\nThere\u2019s actually a joke around the origin of this coffee \u2013 that it was created because Americans weren\u2019t \u2018tough enough\u2019 to drink straight up Italian espresso!\nHistory has it that the Americano originated in Seattle, USA.\nInstant Coffee\nMade from pre-brewed coffee beans, this is the kind where you add a heaped teaspoon to a mug and pour in boiling water. Voil\u00e0 !\nYou can find it in jars and packets in the form of granules (little crunchy pieces), or fine powder.\nHere in South Africa we can buy some quality instant coffees off the shelves of chain stores such as Pick \u2018n Pay.\u00a0Nescaf\u00e9 and Jacobs come to mind.\nFilter Coffee\nThis is created by using ground roasted coffee beans through which boiling water is poured by using a paper or stainless steel filter.\nIn India they use stainless steel filters but in other parts of the world disposable paper is used.\nThe idea is that the liquid is passed through the filter leaving only the fresh brew in the cup. The grounds stay trapped in the filter.\nWe know it as \u2018Filter Coffee\u2019 or \u2018Drip Coffee\u2019 because water passes through the grounds solely by gravity and not under pressure or in longer-term contact.\nIn India it\u2019s known most commonly as \u2018South Indian Coffee\u2019 because the method of making it first began in India.\nPopular Indian lore says that on pilgrimage to Mecca in the 16th century, Baba Budan, a revered Muslim holy man from India, discovered for himself the wonders of coffee. In his zeal to share what he\u2019d found with his fellows at home, he smuggled seven coffee beans out of the Yemeni port of Mocha, wrapped around his belly. On his return home, he settled himself on the slopes of the Chandragiri Hills in Kadur district, Mysore State (present day Karnataka) . This hill range was later named after him as the Baba Budan Hills and one can see his tomb even today by taking a short trip from Chikmagalur .\nAnother interesting fact about filter coffee is that on July 8, 1908, the first paper coffee filter was created. It was created a by German housewife named Melitta Bentz . She wanted to remove the bitter taste caused by boiling loose grounds or using the typical method of linen to brew coffee.\nHmmm, didn\u2019t know that!\nCaff\u00e9 Latte / Caf\u00e9 au Lait\nThis is a French coffee drink.\nThe French call it a \u201cCaf\u00e9 au Lait\u201d but other names for it are \u201cCaff\u00e8 Latte\u201d in Italy, \u201cCaf\u00e9 con Leche\u201d in Spain, \u201cKawa Bia\u0142a\u201d (\u201cwhite coffee\u201d) in Poland, \u201cMilchkaffee\u201d in Germany, \u201cGrosser Brauner\u201d in Austria, \u201cKoffie Verkeerd\u201d in Netherlands, and \u201cCaf\u00e9 com Leite\u201d in Portugal.\nAn easy way to tell the difference is that the Latte is served in a tall glass, whereas a\u00a0Caf\u00e9 au Lait is served in a mug (or \u2018bowl\u2019 as it\u2019s known). This happens commonly in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia.\nIt\u2019s a coffee beverage consisting of strong or bold coffee (sometimes espresso) mixed with a lot of hot milk.\nApparently the French are the ones who introduced milk to coffee \u2013 the previous cultures of Ethiopia and Arabia who enjoyed coffee were not milk drinkers, as were the French.\nA Caff\u00e8 Latte (or Caf\u00e9 au Lait) differs from another way of serving coffee\u2026 the \u201cLatte Macchiato\u201d.\nThe\u00a0Caff\u00e8 Latte adds the espresso to the milk, rather than the reverse as in the case with a \u201cLatte Macchiato\u201d.\nThis results in the Caff\u00e8 Latte having a stronger coffee flavor, which is why it is said to be more popular.\nCaff\u00e8 Macchiato\nThis is an espresso-based coffee, consisting mostly of coffee with a small amount of milk.\nIt\u2019s closer to a straight espresso than the others (s-t-r-o-n-g!) because it contains less milk than a cappuccino.\nIn fact it really doesn\u2019t have a lot of milk at all, which would explain it\u2019s name.\n- A \u2018Caff\u00e8 Macchiato\u2019 in Portuguese is named Caf\u00e9 Pingado which means coffee with a drop\u2026. the drop here being the \u2018drop\u2019 of milk.\n\u2018Macchiato\u2019 in Italian means \u2018marked\u2019 or \u2018stained\u2019, and in the case of Caff\u00e8 Macchiato, this means literally \u2018espresso stained/marked with milk\u2019.\nSo definitely a morning starter, methinks!\nCaf\u00e9 Mocha\nThis is a variant of a Caff\u00e8 Latte.\nThe term \u201cCaff\u00e8 Mocha\u201d as such is not used in Italy or France. Like a Caff\u00e8 Latte, it\u2019s based on espresso and hot milk, but it has added chocolate \u2013 typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder.\nMochas can contain milk chocolate or dark chocolate.\nCaf\u00e9 Mochas contain the well-known milk froth on top, although they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead.\nThey are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder. Marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration.\nA variant is the white Caf\u00e9 Mocha, made with white chocolate instead of milk chocolate or dark chocolate.\nCappuccino\nAh!\nProbably the most well-known coffee beverage amongst us, it comprises of equal parts of espresso, milk and froth.\nA shot of espresso is followed by milk and the top third of the drink consists of milk foam.\nThis foam is often decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk called Latte Art.\nShaved chocolate, cinnamon or other sweet spices can be sprinkled on top of the finished drink.\nHere are some glorious ways that baristas around the world can decorate the foam (a barista is the person who makes and serves coffee):\nEspresso\nA small \u2018shot\u2019 of very strong Italian coffee!\nIt\u2019s also known as a \u201cshort black\u201d.\nEspresso was invented in 1903 by Luigi Bezzera, the owner of a manufacturing business.\nHe wanted to find a way to brew coffee much faster and one day he added pressure to the coffee brewing process, reducing the brewing time. He went on to invent a machine termed the \u201cFast Coffee Machine\u201d, which did just that.\nThe coffees it produced were dubbed \u201cespressos\u201d \u2013 espresso meaning \u201cfast\u201d in Italian.\nNot only did his machine reduce brewing time, it made a better cup of coffee!\nThe quick brewing time allowed the best qualities of the bean to be extracted, avoiding some of the unfavorable qualities associated with over-extraction.\nFlat White\nThis is made just like a cappuccino but it has a very thin layer of foam.\nMade by pouring steamed milk from the bottom of a pitcher over a single or double shot of espresso.\n\u2026 Flat white is one part espresso with two parts steamed milk, but no foam.\nIt\u2019s richer than a Latte and creamier than a Cappuccino.\nHere is an article written by The Independent in 2009 when the Flat White first started rearing it\u2019s scrumptious head in coffee shops all over the country.\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/time-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-flat-white-1776213.html\nIt was UK\u2019s fastest growing new coffee brew at that time and provided the \u201cperfect antidote to the latte\u201d.\nThe article also mentions that Flat White sales grew more than 10 times as fast as the rest of the market at that time and thus brought with it a new identity to coffee in the UK.\nIrish Coffee\nHot coffee with Irish whiskey and brown sugar, topped with thick cream.\nIced Coffee\nThis is a shot of Espresso in a tall glass with cold milk, crushed ice and ice-cream.

As they rightly conclude, coffee consumption in commercial outlets and caffeine content of other drinks need to be studied further, so that consumer information can be improved.\nCaffeine is also found in other foods including tea, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some cold and flu remedies.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of Glasgow. No sources of external funding were reported in the paper. The study was published in the Royal Society of Chemistry\u2019s journal, Food and Function.\nThe story was generally covered accurately in the media. The Daily Express\u2019s claim that \u201cpregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies at risk\u201d was misleading as it implied the study found that pregnant women consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. The analysis was of caffeine levels in high-street coffee outlets. It did not look at caffeine intake among pregnant women or any other group.\nWhat kind of research was this?\nThis was a chemical analysis of levels of caffeine in single-shot espresso coffees purchased from 20 different outlets. Researchers also looked at levels of another substance in these products called caffeoylquinic acid (CQA). They said that CQA has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antioxidant properties, but there is limited evidence for any direct protective effects on human health.\nThey pointed out that consuming caffeine in excess can lead to unpleasant symptoms, although individual susceptibility varies. Certain groups, including pregnant women and young children, are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine because their bodies process it more slowly.\nThe researchers also say that there is no published information on the caffeine content of the various types of commercially prepared coffees, despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the high street and in other settings, such as airports. The authors quote figures from a US review, published by the International Food Information Council Foundation, which suggest that a 28ml of espresso contains 30\u201350mg of caffeine.\nWhat did the research involve?\nThe researchers bought single-shot espresso coffees from 20 different outlets in Glasgow\u2019s west end. They measured the volume of each coffee serving, which ranged from 23ml to 70ml, before diluting it with methanol (alcohol) and freezing it. The diluted coffee samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a biochemical technique that can separate and identify individual components of a particular compound.\nTo explore a possible reason for any variations in the coffees\u2019 caffeine and chemical content, they also carried out a similar analysis of six samples of ground espresso arabica coffee, prepared from beans subject to different roasting methods.\nWhat were the basic results?\nThe analysis of caffeine levels in the 20 espresso shots found a six-fold variation in caffeine levels. The strongest coffee contained 322mg in one shot (from Patisserie Francoise), six times more than the lowest strength, which contained 51mg (from Starbucks). Three further products contained more than 200mg of caffeine and a further eight contained over 100mg (between 129mg and 173mg). The cup size ranged from 23ml to 70ml.\nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\nThe researchers concluded that the range of results in their snapshot of espresso coffees demonstrates that the normally quoted figures for caffeine content \u2013 about 50mg a cup \u2013 are misleading. Consumers at risk of caffeine toxicity, including pregnant women, children and those with liver disease, may unknowingly consume excessive caffeine from a single cup of espresso coffee.\nThey suggest that the large variability in caffeine content could be due to a number of factors, such as:\nthe amount of coffee used to prepare the espresso\ndifferences between batches of coffee beans\ndifferent procedures used to roast the beans (such as high-temperature short roast and low-temperature long roast)\ngrinding conditions\ncoffee-making process (such as the temperature of the water or steam, and ratio of coffee to water or steam)\nThey highlighted that since many coffee houses prepare larger-volume coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, by diluting a single or double shot of espresso, further study on these products is needed. New data are needed to provide labelling information \u201cwith attention to bean variety, preparation and barista methods\u201d.\nConclusion\nThis analysis provides a useful snapshot of the caffeine content in a range of espresso coffees bought on the high street. Although the study was carried out in only one city, its finding that there is a wide variation in caffeine content is likely to apply to coffee bought in other UK cafes. It found that the caffeine content of most products was higher than normally expected and it is possible that some coffee drinkers may unknowingly consume large amounts of caffeine. In some cases, a single serving may place people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine at risk.\nThe researchers only looked at caffeine levels in espresso coffee, which may not be standard preference in the UK. Although they point out that other types of coffee drinks are based on espresso shots, further analysis of the caffeine content of the more popular, larger drinks is needed. The researchers carried out their analysis only once, without any replication, and the possibility of error in the chemical procedure used to analyse caffeine levels should be noted.\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should take care with how much caffeine they consume. Current advice from the FSA is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day, due to concerns about potential associations with low birth weight and miscarriage. However, the risks from occasionally exceeding this recommended intake are thought to be low.\nThe FSA states that the average daily caffeine intake during pregnancy is already believed to be below 200mg. However, in light of the current study\u2019s findings, further study investigation of the caffeine intake of pregnant women and other vulnerable groups would be valuable.\nThe researchers in this study say that a cup of coffee is assumed to contain 50mg of caffeine, but the FSA advises that a mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg caffeine, and a mug of filter coffee contains around 140mg of caffeine.\nConsumers should also be aware that there is caffeine in other foods including tea, chocolate and some soft drinks. Caffeine is also found in some cold and flu remedies, and pregnant women in particular are advised to check with a pharmacist or midwife before they take any such remedies.\n"}, {"score": 420.50327, "uuid": "21f29161-c74c-5252-973f-a4d78d8d8b4c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-62-19134", "target_hostname": "www.comprehensiveobgyn.net", "target_uri": "http://www.comprehensiveobgyn.net/blog/?Tag=dr%20adler", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "dr adler | Comprehensive OB-GYN of <em>the</em> Palm Beaches | Comprehensive OB-GYN", "snippet": "<em>The</em> authors also highlight that many <em>coffee</em> outlets prepare other coffees, such as <em>lattes</em> <em>and</em> <em>cappuccinos</em>, from <em>espresso</em> shots.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\n\u201cPregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies in danger by drinking coffee from high street chains,\u201d reported the\nDaily Express.

One single shot of a high-caffeine drink could place at risk people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of coffee. These include pregnant women, women taking oral contraceptives, young children and people with liver disease, they warn.\nThe authors also highlight that many coffee outlets prepare other coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, from espresso shots. As they rightly conclude, coffee consumption in commercial outlets and caffeine content of other drinks need to be studied further, so that consumer information can be improved.\nCaffeine is also found in other foods including tea, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some cold and flu remedies.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of Glasgow. No sources of external funding were reported in the paper. The study was published in the Royal Society of Chemistry\u2019s journal, Food and Function.\nThe story was generally covered accurately in the media. The Daily Express\u2019s claim that \u201cpregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies at risk\u201d was misleading as it implied the study found that pregnant women consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. The analysis was of caffeine levels in high-street coffee outlets. It did not look at caffeine intake among pregnant women or any other group.\nWhat kind of research was this?\nThis was a chemical analysis of levels of caffeine in single-shot espresso coffees purchased from 20 different outlets. Researchers also looked at levels of another substance in these products called caffeoylquinic acid (CQA). They said that CQA has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antioxidant properties, but there is limited evidence for any direct protective effects on human health.\nThey pointed out that consuming caffeine in excess can lead to unpleasant symptoms, although individual susceptibility varies. Certain groups, including pregnant women and young children, are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine because their bodies process it more slowly.\nThe researchers also say that there is no published information on the caffeine content of the various types of commercially prepared coffees, despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the high street and in other settings, such as airports. The authors quote figures from a US review, published by the International Food Information Council Foundation, which suggest that a 28ml of espresso contains 30\u201350mg of caffeine.\nWhat did the research involve?\nThe researchers bought single-shot espresso coffees from 20 different outlets in Glasgow\u2019s west end. They measured the volume of each coffee serving, which ranged from 23ml to 70ml, before diluting it with methanol (alcohol) and freezing it. The diluted coffee samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a biochemical technique that can separate and identify individual components of a particular compound.\nTo explore a possible reason for any variations in the coffees\u2019 caffeine and chemical content, they also carried out a similar analysis of six samples of ground espresso arabica coffee, prepared from beans subject to different roasting methods.\nWhat were the basic results?\nThe analysis of caffeine levels in the 20 espresso shots found a six-fold variation in caffeine levels. The strongest coffee contained 322mg in one shot (from Patisserie Francoise), six times more than the lowest strength, which contained 51mg (from Starbucks). Three further products contained more than 200mg of caffeine and a further eight contained over 100mg (between 129mg and 173mg). The cup size ranged from 23ml to 70ml.\nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\nThe researchers concluded that the range of results in their snapshot of espresso coffees demonstrates that the normally quoted figures for caffeine content \u2013 about 50mg a cup \u2013 are misleading. Consumers at risk of caffeine toxicity, including pregnant women, children and those with liver disease, may unknowingly consume excessive caffeine from a single cup of espresso coffee.\nThey suggest that the large variability in caffeine content could be due to a number of factors, such as:\nthe amount of coffee used to prepare the espresso\ndifferences between batches of coffee beans\ndifferent procedures used to roast the beans (such as high-temperature short roast and low-temperature long roast)\ngrinding conditions\ncoffee-making process (such as the temperature of the water or steam, and ratio of coffee to water or steam)\nThey highlighted that since many coffee houses prepare larger-volume coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, by diluting a single or double shot of espresso, further study on these products is needed. New data are needed to provide labelling information \u201cwith attention to bean variety, preparation and barista methods\u201d.\nConclusion\nThis analysis provides a useful snapshot of the caffeine content in a range of espresso coffees bought on the high street. Although the study was carried out in only one city, its finding that there is a wide variation in caffeine content is likely to apply to coffee bought in other UK cafes. It found that the caffeine content of most products was higher than normally expected and it is possible that some coffee drinkers may unknowingly consume large amounts of caffeine. In some cases, a single serving may place people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine at risk.\nThe researchers only looked at caffeine levels in espresso coffee, which may not be standard preference in the UK. Although they point out that other types of coffee drinks are based on espresso shots, further analysis of the caffeine content of the more popular, larger drinks is needed. The researchers carried out their analysis only once, without any replication, and the possibility of error in the chemical procedure used to analyse caffeine levels should be noted.\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should take care with how much caffeine they consume. Current advice from the FSA is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day, due to concerns about potential associations with low birth weight and miscarriage. However, the risks from occasionally exceeding this recommended intake are thought to be low.\nThe FSA states that the average daily caffeine intake during pregnancy is already believed to be below 200mg. However, in light of the current study\u2019s findings, further study investigation of the caffeine intake of pregnant women and other vulnerable groups would be valuable.\nThe researchers in this study say that a cup of coffee is assumed to contain 50mg of caffeine, but the FSA advises that a mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg caffeine, and a mug of filter coffee contains around 140mg of caffeine.\nConsumers should also be aware that there is caffeine in other foods including tea, chocolate and some soft drinks. Caffeine is also found in some cold and flu remedies, and pregnant women in particular are advised to check with a pharmacist or midwife before they take any such remedies.\n"}, {"score": 420.11172, "uuid": "73d49483-c226-5959-b6f6-5d6e2fd29570", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-44-07176", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/what-is-a-macchiato_n_1432821.html", "page_rank": 1.1880371e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "What A Macchiato Really Is", "snippet": "Most people would know an <em>espresso</em> or a <em>cappuccino</em> when they saw one, but would you know a real macchiato? <em>The</em> Macchiato Defined <em>The</em> macchiato (mah-key-AH-toe) is a cornerstone of Italian <em>coffee</em> culture, along with <em>the</em> <em>espresso</em> <em>and</em> <em>cappuccino</em>, among other <em>coffee</em> drinks.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted: 04/19/12 08:54 AM ET\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0Updated: 04/19/12 01:56 PM ET\nWhat A Macchiato Really Is\nGet KitchenDaily Alerts:\nSign Up\nFollow:\nVideo , Italian Coffee Vocabulary , Caffe Macchiato , Cappuccino , Coffee , Espresso , Macchiato , Macchiato Coffee , Macchiato Pronunciation , Recipes Using Coffee , Photo Galleries , What Is a Macchiato , KitchenDaily News\nExcept for a select few of us, practically everyone drinks coffee in the morning. For many of us it's a crutch -- we just can't live without it. And it's a good reason why a certain chain coffee shop has stayed in business all these years, but we've got a bone to pick with them. Not only has this coffee company created Italian-sounding names that were never Italian to begin with ( Frappuccino ) but it's also caused some confusion with authentic terms, namely the macchiato. Most people would know an espresso or a cappuccino when they saw one, but would you know a real macchiato?\nThe Macchiato Defined\nThe macchiato (mah-key-AH-toe) is a cornerstone of Italian coffee culture, along with the espresso and cappuccino, among other coffee drinks . It's basically an espresso (served in a demitasse cup) with a small amount of foamed milk on top -- the name macchiato means \"marked.\" So really, you could look at it as a cross between an espresso and a cappuccino. Since Italians only drink cappuccino in the morning, a macchiato gives the afternoon drinker the option of having a little milk in their espresso for some extra flavor. It's also a good option for those who can't tolerate a strong espresso but find a cappuccino too weak and milky.\nThere is another type of macchiato called \"latte macchiato,\" which is a cup of hot milk with a shot of espresso, but it does not have caramel-flavored syrup added, which is what the chain coffee shop would have you believe is a true macchiato.\nHow To Order\nAn authentic macchiato is one of those coffee drinks that's served at any reputable coffee bar or restaurant, so you won't necessarily see it written up on the menu. Go ahead and order one without hesitation. But if you decide to order one at the chain coffee shop, you'll probably have to specify an \"espresso macchiato\" unless you want to get that caramel concoction. In Italy, all you have to ask for is a \"caffe macchiato\" and everyone will know what you want -- but don't ask for a frappuccino unless you want to be embarrassed.\nWhat's your favorite kind of coffee?

What can I do to fix that?\nAs a result, we bring you the 2007 Buyers guide to better coffee during the festive season.\nAnd so you know - we are approaching things a little differently this year; more words and fewer pictures.\nAnd it's not that I am lazy about pictures (even if I am a bit...) - It is just that sometimes, what the reader needs to see is more information and less visual filler. Or so the theory goes. So here goes. Without further fuss, I bring you - The 2007 Buyers Guide to better coffee... for the 2007 Festive season!\nIn 2007 we saw a lot of stuff coming across our desk and kitchen lab - most of it commercial stuff (and generally of little interest to the home and office consumers)\nIn reality, there were only a few major developments that would be of interest to specialty coffee fans for this year - and short of simply reproducing last years guide verbatim, I am going to put some small spin on things... by talking about my most common questions over the last 6 months and what fixes or suggestions I would make for this time of year.\nIf I get asked 1000 questions a month, in person or otherwise, the number one question is:\nHow can I...\na.) Make that leap into home espresso in a sensible and sustainable way or\nb.) How can I improve my current set-up or make that jump from drip or press coffee to the \"bigs\", that is - espresso-based specialty coffee!\nYea, that is 2 questions - 2 questions that are largely joined at the hip as it were. It is actually 2 questions rolled into one question.\nSo... What are the issue(s)? Issues being any one or more factors that inhibit the remediation of said discrepancy in an individuals coffee universe:\n1.) The cost!\nEspresso Making: In over 13 years of writing about specialty coffee and testing all methods of brewing, this is the single most common question that comes up:\n\"I want to stop spending 15$ a day on lattes and make cafe quality espresso, cappuccino and latte at home... So, how much?\"\nOften prefaced with the following: \"I have less than $200 to spend...\"\nThis is where I say: \"The average cafe has over $10,000 worth of equipment to bring you that latte...\"\nAnd although that is not an entirely accurate statement, it does help to illustrate a point - You cannot to drive from Seattle to San Francisco in a Lamborghini if you drive a Hyundai Pony. You might steal a Lamborghini, but you won't get far. Trust me... personal experience.\nBottom line - It takes great coffee to make great coffee - and so it is with gear. If you cannot make a minimum commitment of dollars to better kit, well... maybe you should stick with improving your drip... or press... or, whatever.\nNow, thankfully when the Winter approaches along with the festive giving season - we often stop thinking about how much stuff costs... and we just get down to the dirty work of finding it - or finding what we need.\nOk. Back to the question - \"What do I need and what do I pay?\"\nWell. At bare minimum you can get into the World of specialty for under $500. Seriously. Well under $500.\nIf pressed, I would say - \"Go out and buy a Gaggia, any Gaggia that has a pump in it... there is a great selection of units from a variety of vendors for just under $300.\"\nAnd do me a favor: Stay off of E-Bay. I know I will incur the wrath of the E-Bay sellers... but do you really want to buy something from an entirely unknown quantity?\nSure, you might save a few bucks but for what you lose in customer service and guarantee (if any) - It is all but made up by dealing locally or from a reputable online vendor.\nGaggia is the best bang for the buck and they make real espresso coffee. Yes, I could mention the Solis and the Rancilio and a variety of others - but they are more expensive and are mentioned extensively in other sections of this website.\nAs for buying a common brand name \"espresso\" or \"cappuccino\" maker at a department store? Well, trust me friend - that only leads down a road of tears and regret.\nI have yet to see any gigantic multi-national / trans-national manufacturer of \"home appliances\" come up with anything that was not a piece of junk.\nThese are machines whose design is over-seen by \"bean\" counters. Their theory being: Do not use a speck of metal when plastic or composite will do just fine thank you very much!\nSuccessful espresso brewing is all about heat control and retention (this subject is covered in coma-inducing thoroughness elsewhere on this site).\nYou cannot brew a perfect espresso (and as a result a great cappuccino...) with a coffee maker made out of plastic with aluminum or potted metal parts.\nSo. Do not waste your time and money. You simply do not want an \"I told you so...\" from me now or anytime in the future.\nCoffeeCrew approved Gaggia espresso (cappuccino) makers include the Gaggia Topazio, the Gaggia Carezza, the Gaggia Coffee, the Gaggia Baby, the Gaggia Espresso and the Gaggia Classic.\nGrinding: You cannot carve the perfect turkey without good knives and similarly, you cannot brew great coffee without a good burr grinder.\nThe coffee grinder is the one must-have accessory that makes or breaks the whole process.\n\"But I have a perfectly good blade grinder Colin! What? You want me to get another grinder?\"\nTake the blade grinder and re-purpose it to a spice grinder. A blade grinder has no right to come in contact with coffee beans. It simply will not work with espresso.\nSo. What is the perfect grinder and how much will it set me back?\nWell, I have been testing a variety of grinders over the last year and one stands out - It is the Baratza Virtuoso burr grinder. And thankfully, it is for sale at virtually every Starbucks on the Planet... so there is no issue of finding one. They cost around $200 (US) or $200(CAN)... maybe 100-Euro or so.\nCutting to the chase - it does espresso really well... and drip... and French Press and virtually any other method you can throw at it... Even percolator coffee, Ack!\nSo. Two things. If you want to buy the perfect espresso kit for a loved one (or yourself), consider a Gaggia coffee maker and a Baratza Virtuoso grinder. You cannot go wrong.\nIf you wish to upgrade your kitchen coffee outfit, the Baratza Virtuoso grinder makes a great single gift too!\nBeans. The single most important ingredient in specialty coffee is often the most mis-understood and ultimately the hardest to find.\n1.) If there is a fresh coffee roaster in your area, get to know it. Try their coffees. Ask questions. They are your lifeline to better coffee.\n2.) You cannot make great home espresso from beans that come from the grocery store - unless of course the grocery store is selling fresh roasted coffee from the roaster above!\n3.) Coffee has a shelf life of about 2 weeks. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. There is an \"aged-coffee\" thing circulating right now - it is utter \"Kopi Luwak\" as far as I am concerned. What is \"Kopi Luwak\"? It is Indonesian for \"Coffee pooped out of a marsupial cat...\" or in other words, B.S.!\nIf you must buy coffee as a gift this year, make sure you do your shopping \"last minute!\" - I repeat: Coffee only lasts 2 weeks.\nAnd if you have been on a waiting list to buy $70/pound Jamaican Blue Mountain (a great coffee by the way...)[and a VERY popular gift this time of year...], make sure it has been roasted in the last... yes, 2 weeks!\nIt should come as no surprise that expensive coffees are often sold this time of year - and the recipients of said coffee often shelve for a special occasion! As if late December was not a good enough reason to brew up a cup of Jamaica Blue Mountain!\nIf you have no local options for fresh roast coffee, consider a mail-order source... but do your homework! There are many, many companies that send coffee through the mail. There is one great big downside - the cost. Shipping. It adds to the overall expense of enjoying fresh coffee. Is it worth it? If you cannot get great coffee locally, it does!\nIn picking an online source of coffee-via-mail, look for a specialty coffee name brand, like Peet's, Stumptown, Dancing Goat (formerly Batdorf & Bronson) or Raven's Brew. Another good option is to cruise CoffeeReview.Com - the website that does nothing but review and profile better coffees. This is an excellent learning resource and starting point for finding who is close to you geographically in Coffee World.\nAccessories - Gadgets - More: The number one coffee gadget or extra for the espresso-coffee lover is the Reg Barber coffee tamper. Sure it is 50$ or more, but it is light years ahead of the plastic toy that comes with most (if not all) espresso machines.\nOther tools that you can use in the kitchen are, get this, bristle brushes from a craft store - I use them for cleaning the nooks and crannies of the grinder.\nThe Pallo Coffee tool from EspressoParts.Com is a must-have and it is perfect as a stocking stuffer.\nNo Espresso machine-Grinder combo is complete without an espresso knock-box - also from EspressoParts.Com.\nCups and Saucers? Always a great gift. The average coffee lover can never have too many coffee, cappuccino, latte and espresso cups. Go take a snoop over at Fantes.Com - and if you are a foodie or kitchen hound, Fantes.Com has a selection of kitchen things that is simply staggering.\nI could go on and on and on - but I will let you use your imagination.\nI have always been a big fan of Peet's Coffee (and I have never had any kind of business relationship with them) and I have a closet full of Peet's wear!

Both can brew coffee, tea and hot cocoa.\nHere are the key differences:\nTassimo:\n1. Uses a smart bar code reader to read the coded t-disc lid.

The Keurig relies on the user to determine the final brewed product, through K-Cup and drink size selection. Keurig offers some K-Cups that are \"extra bold\", which contain more coffee than a standard K-Cup for a stronger brew.\n2. Based on the model the Keurig may have up to 4 cup size selections.\n3.

Cost is roughly 45 \u0096 50 cents per cup of coffee.\nThe bottom line...\nTassimo is a newer, more technologically advanced system that can brew more authentic drinks like espressos and lattes. However at this time, the systems and pods are a little more expensive and there are fewer choices. The Keurig system relies more on the coffee drinker to brew the perfect cup, but is less expensive and holds more options.\nOver time we believe each single serve system will continue to evolve and improve the experiences of coffee drinkers everywhere.\nMain Categories:\n"}, {"score": 392.596, "uuid": "dfc30a7a-64e4-5917-b668-d03672c44f68", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-51-15418", "target_hostname": "photographyproduct.001photography.com", "target_uri": "http://photographyproduct.001photography.com/what-other-types-of-birds-can-be-put-in-a-cage-with-budgies/", "page_rank": 1.2864879e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "What other types of birds can be put in a cage with budgies? &laquo;", "snippet": "A machine built for <em>espressos</em> is required. <em>Espresso</em> machines usually come with a steam wand, in which extremely hot water is passed through <em>the</em> tube thus producing steam.

But basically it\u2019s not a good idea to mix breeds of birds unless they are babies. The reason?? More often than not, one will try to kill the other. Simply put.\nAdd your own answer in the comments!\nCoffee is one of the world\u2019s widely enjoyed beverages. From drip coffee to espresso, there are many different ways to make coffee. Each has its own distinct style and flavor.\nA drip coffee machine is one of the more popular ways to make coffee in the United States. Most drip coffee machines are portable, in which the user can move the machine around the kitchen. Some homes have the coffee machine built right into the kitchen in which water is piped into the machine by itself. Drip coffee machines can be placed into three different categories; manual, semi automatic and automatic. Some will require you to grind beans in a separate machine, add water and turn it on. Others have a grinding machine built in and you can set the timer to brew coffee when one wishes it too. The newest drip machines can now brew one cup of coffee at a time, simply place a pre-measured pod into the machine and it will brew a perfect cup of coffee.\nDrip coffee tends to have a smooth, mellow flavor.\nIn Europe, they prefer the French Press. This type of coffee produces a stronger, creamier flavor. Finely ground coffee is placed at the bottom of a glass container, in which hot boiling water is poured over it. After a few minutes, a wire plunger is used to press the coffee grounds to the bottom of the container. While this method produces a rich flavor, the French Press does not hold heat for a long time.\nEspresso machines originally became popular in Europe, but now are widely used and recognized by most Americans. Espresso is made by passing hot water through finely ground beans that is tightly packed. A machine built for espressos is required. Espresso machines usually come with a steam wand, in which extremely hot water is passed through the tube thus producing steam. This steam wand is used to steam milk which can be combined with the espresso to make lattes or cappuccinos. Espresso has a heavy, creamy flavor.\nJanet Lynn is a homemaker who lives in Miami, FL.

Current advice from the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day.\nThe story comes from an analysis of the caffeine content of single shots of espresso from 20 high-street coffee shops in Glasgow. The amount of caffeine they contained varied considerably, from 322mg to 51mg a shot.\nThe authors say that normally quoted figures for caffeine levels in coffee, which they say are about 50mg a cup, are misleading. One single shot of a high-caffeine drink could place at risk people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of coffee. These include pregnant women, women taking oral contraceptives, young children and people with liver disease, they warn.\nThe authors also highlight that many coffee outlets prepare other coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, from espresso shots. As they rightly conclude, coffee consumption in commercial outlets and caffeine content of other drinks need to be studied further, so that consumer information can be improved.\nCaffeine is also found in other foods including tea, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some cold and flu remedies.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of Glasgow. No sources of external funding were reported in the paper. The study was published in the Royal Society of Chemistry\u2019s journal, Food and Function.\nThe story was generally covered accurately in the media. The Daily Express\u2019s claim that \u201cpregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies at risk\u201d was misleading as it implied the study found that pregnant women consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. The analysis was of caffeine levels in high-street coffee outlets. It did not look at caffeine intake among pregnant women or any other group.\nWhat kind of research was this?\nThis was a chemical analysis of levels of caffeine in single-shot espresso coffees purchased from 20 different outlets. Researchers also looked at levels of another substance in these products called caffeoylquinic acid (CQA). They said that CQA has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antioxidant properties, but there is limited evidence for any direct protective effects on human health.\nThey pointed out that consuming caffeine in excess can lead to unpleasant symptoms, although individual susceptibility varies. Certain groups, including pregnant women and young children, are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine because their bodies process it more slowly.\nThe researchers also say that there is no published information on the caffeine content of the various types of commercially prepared coffees, despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the high street and in other settings, such as airports. The authors quote figures from a US review, published by the International Food Information Council Foundation, which suggest that a 28ml of espresso contains 30\u201350mg of caffeine.\nWhat did the research involve?\nThe researchers bought single-shot espresso coffees from 20 different outlets in Glasgow\u2019s west end. They measured the volume of each coffee serving, which ranged from 23ml to 70ml, before diluting it with methanol (alcohol) and freezing it. The diluted coffee samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a biochemical technique that can separate and identify individual components of a particular compound.\nTo explore a possible reason for any variations in the coffees\u2019 caffeine and chemical content, they also carried out a similar analysis of six samples of ground espresso arabica coffee, prepared from beans subject to different roasting methods.\nWhat were the basic results?\nThe analysis of caffeine levels in the 20 espresso shots found a six-fold variation in caffeine levels. The strongest coffee contained 322mg in one shot (from Patisserie Francoise), six times more than the lowest strength, which contained 51mg (from Starbucks). Three further products contained more than 200mg of caffeine and a further eight contained over 100mg (between 129mg and 173mg). The cup size ranged from 23ml to 70ml.\nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\nThe researchers concluded that the range of results in their snapshot of espresso coffees demonstrates that the normally quoted figures for caffeine content \u2013 about 50mg a cup \u2013 are misleading. Consumers at risk of caffeine toxicity, including pregnant women, children and those with liver disease, may unknowingly consume excessive caffeine from a single cup of espresso coffee.\nThey suggest that the large variability in caffeine content could be due to a number of factors, such as:\nthe amount of coffee used to prepare the espresso\ndifferences between batches of coffee beans\ndifferent procedures used to roast the beans (such as high-temperature short roast and low-temperature long roast)\ngrinding conditions\ncoffee-making process (such as the temperature of the water or steam, and ratio of coffee to water or steam)\nThey highlighted that since many coffee houses prepare larger-volume coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, by diluting a single or double shot of espresso, further study on these products is needed. New data are needed to provide labelling information \u201cwith attention to bean variety, preparation and barista methods\u201d.\nConclusion\nThis analysis provides a useful snapshot of the caffeine content in a range of espresso coffees bought on the high street. Although the study was carried out in only one city, its finding that there is a wide variation in caffeine content is likely to apply to coffee bought in other UK cafes. It found that the caffeine content of most products was higher than normally expected and it is possible that some coffee drinkers may unknowingly consume large amounts of caffeine. In some cases, a single serving may place people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine at risk.\nThe researchers only looked at caffeine levels in espresso coffee, which may not be standard preference in the UK. Although they point out that other types of coffee drinks are based on espresso shots, further analysis of the caffeine content of the more popular, larger drinks is needed. The researchers carried out their analysis only once, without any replication, and the possibility of error in the chemical procedure used to analyse caffeine levels should be noted.\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should take care with how much caffeine they consume. Current advice from the FSA is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day, due to concerns about potential associations with low birth weight and miscarriage. However, the risks from occasionally exceeding this recommended intake are thought to be low.\nThe FSA states that the average daily caffeine intake during pregnancy is already believed to be below 200mg. However, in light of the current study\u2019s findings, further study investigation of the caffeine intake of pregnant women and other vulnerable groups would be valuable.\nThe researchers in this study say that a cup of coffee is assumed to contain 50mg of caffeine, but the FSA advises that a mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg caffeine, and a mug of filter coffee contains around 140mg of caffeine.\nConsumers should also be aware that there is caffeine in other foods including tea, chocolate and some soft drinks. Caffeine is also found in some cold and flu remedies, and pregnant women in particular are advised to check with a pharmacist or midwife before they take any such remedies.\n"}, {"score": 370.221, "uuid": "7c41d77d-463c-5026-94f7-02c92e3f2a38", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-81-12639", "target_hostname": "www.comprehensiveobgyn.net", "target_uri": "http://www.comprehensiveobgyn.net/blog/?month=12&year=2011", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "December, 2011 | Comprehensive OB-GYN of <em>the</em> Palm Beaches | Comprehensive", "snippet": "<em>The</em> authors also highlight that many <em>coffee</em> outlets prepare other coffees, such as <em>lattes</em> <em>and</em> <em>cappuccinos</em>, from <em>espresso</em> shots.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\n\u201cPregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies in danger by drinking coffee from high street chains,\u201d reported the\nDaily Express.

They measured the volume of each coffee serving, which ranged from 23ml to 70ml, before diluting it with methanol (alcohol) and freezing it.

The strongest coffee contained 322mg in one shot (from Patisserie Francoise), six times more than the lowest strength, which contained 51mg (from Starbucks).

Although the study was carried out in only one city, its finding that there is a wide variation in caffeine content is likely to apply to coffee bought in other UK cafes. It found that the caffeine content of most products was higher than normally expected and it is possible that some coffee drinkers may unknowingly consume large amounts of caffeine.

Although they point out that other types of coffee drinks are based on espresso shots, further analysis of the caffeine content of the more popular, larger drinks is needed. The researchers carried out their analysis only once, without any replication, and the possibility of error in the chemical procedure used to analyse caffeine levels should be noted.\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should take care with how much caffeine they consume. Current advice from the FSA is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day, due to concerns about potential associations with low birth weight and miscarriage. However, the risks from occasionally exceeding this recommended intake are thought to be low.\nThe FSA states that the average daily caffeine intake during pregnancy is already believed to be below 200mg. However, in light of the current study\u2019s findings, further study investigation of the caffeine intake of pregnant women and other vulnerable groups would be valuable.\nThe researchers in this study say that a cup of coffee is assumed to contain 50mg of caffeine, but the FSA advises that a mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg caffeine, and a mug of filter coffee contains around 140mg of caffeine.\nConsumers should also be aware that there is caffeine in other foods including tea, chocolate and some soft drinks. Caffeine is also found in some cold and flu remedies, and pregnant women in particular are advised to check with a pharmacist or midwife before they take any such remedies.\n"}, {"score": 354.09372, "uuid": "05cd0a29-f492-5e0a-8d46-4d7331c27bfb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-94-02593", "target_hostname": "www.comprehensiveobgyn.net", "target_uri": "http://www.comprehensiveobgyn.net/blog/?Tag=royal+palm+beach", "page_rank": 1.5184692e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "royal palm beach | Comprehensive OB-GYN of <em>the</em> Palm Beaches | Comprehensive", "snippet": "<em>The</em> authors also highlight that many <em>coffee</em> outlets prepare other coffees, such as <em>lattes</em> <em>and</em> <em>cappuccinos</em>, from <em>espresso</em> shots.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\n\u201cPregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies in danger by drinking coffee from high street chains,\u201d reported the\nDaily Express.

Sorry about the delay. Also, I am very slow recording and editing audio files so I only recorded one reading per file. I still have to add audio to lesson # 3 (Al bar) and hope to do that next weekend.\nAl Bar\nApril 14th, 2008, by Francesca\nNOTE: Another little lesson without audio files. I know\u2026 I am a flake. Still in catch up mode after a weekend of running around like a headless chicken. Fortunately, I had prepared this entry a week ago so at least I have something for you while I get my act together.\nYou already know many Italian words, but are you using them \u00e0 propos? And are you pronouncing them correctly? If you speak American English, you may find the following information useful. The tips on culture and pronunciation should be generally useful, regardless of which flavor of English you are familiar with.\nEspresso\nEspresso, often referred to simply as caff\u00e8 in Italy (what other kind of coffee is there, anyway?) is a thick, smooth kind of coffee that comes served in teeny tiny cups filled only half way. None of that brodino (little broth) they serve in most American places, thank you. Not only espresso cups are small and never filled to the brim, but the frothiest part of the coffee sticks to the inside of the tazzina (small cup). It's a classic example of quality vs. quantity. Espresso is not liquid to wash down your breakfast, but rather concentrated taste and flavor to offset the sweetness of your morning cornetto (croissant).\nLatte\nLatte means \"milk\", not coffee with milk and foam, as Starbucks would have you believe. So, if you go to a bar in Italy and ask for latte, the barista will look at you funny and serve you a glass of milk, most likely cold. The closest in Italy to what people call \"latte\" in the US, would be cappuccino.\nCappuccino vs. Caffelatte\nCaffelatte or caff\u00e8 latte is what people make at home and differs from cappuccino in two important ways:\n1) Unless you have a super-duper industrial strength espresso machine at home, your home made coffee will not even resemble il caff\u00e9 del bar (the bar's espresso).\n2) Cappuccino is a coffee drink with hot milk and foam added; Caff\u00e8 latte is a milk drink with some coffee added.\nBar\nAmerican bars (think Cheers ) serve alcoholic drinks and snacks to go with those drinks. A bar in Italy serves coffee drinks, pastries, fruit juices, sodas, sometimes panini, often gelato, and alcoholic drinks. You could probably think of an Italian bar as a hybrid of the American caf\u00e9 and bar.\nWhen people say andiamo al bar (let's go to a/the bar), they could go to have breakfast, an aperitivo before lunch, a sandwich for lunch, a digestive after lunch, a coffee with or without a sweet snack in the afternoon, an ice-cream at all hours of the day, an aperitivo before dinner, and so on.\nIl bar is not just a place to eat and drink, but also a place to meet up with your friends. After work and during the weekend, people often go to their bar of choice to get together with friends. On weekedays and during business hours, it's often collegues who go to a bar together to grab a quick lunch or an after lunch coffee. Espresso is to Italians as tea is to the Brits; it's always the right time for a nice cup of coffee.\nThe finer points of espresso\nIn addition to basic espresso, these are some popular variations:\ncaff\u00e9 ristretto\n"}, {"score": 382.3983, "uuid": "5048dd65-98ca-54f3-8012-7f196ca49c61", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-75-19370", "target_hostname": "www.gevalia.com", "target_uri": "http://www.gevalia.com/TASSIMO-LCD-Premium-T65-Home-Brewing-System-by-Bosch/TG8,default,pd.html?start=1&cgid=brewers-tassimo-single-serve", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "TASSIMO LCD Premium T65 Home Brewing System by Bosch", "snippet": "<em>THE</em> BEST BETTER <em>The</em> thought of brewing <em>espresso</em> <em>and</em> regular in one appliance, is just wounderful.

There\u2019s no need to head to your favorite coffee bar when you can make frothy cappuccinos and lattes in your own kitchen.\n\u201cI made a recent purchase that has changed the way I start the day,\u201d says Chef Johnny. \u201cIt has turned my regular morning coffee into a genuine treat, making each cup feel and taste like it was served to me in a chic cafe, perhaps in Rome or Florence. It\u2019s the Capresso frothPro Milk Foamer .\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be easier to use. Simply fill the metal receptacle with milk, press a button (in addition to steamed milk or foam, you can choose cold, warm or hot, including cold foam for iced cappuccino) and watch as ordinary milk is whipped to steaming, frothy pulchritude\u2014in less than a minute! Lowfat or nonfat milk foams the best: The fat in the milk weighs down the potential fluffiness.\nLittle appliance, big foam. Photo courtesy\nCapresso.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not a fan of foam, you can simply heat your milk to the temperature of your choosing. Warm or hot milk keeps the coffee warmer for longer. You can add foam to hot chocolate, too, or simply enjoy a glass of \u2018latte milk.\u2019\n\u201cBut there\u2019s more than frothy, steamed milk to a gourmet espresso drink (see the different types of espresso drinks ).\n\u201cTo make authentic frothed coffee drinks, you need espresso, not regular coffee. If there\u2019s no coffee bean specialty shop near you, you can buy good-quality espresso, whole or ground, at most grocery stores.\n\u201cTo make the espresso, I suggest using a moka pot , a classic stovetop espresso maker like this one from Bialetti. Yes, it\u2019s another appliance, but it\u2019s small, inexpensive (under $25.00), easy to use and should last you a lifetime. If you are lucky enough to have the expensive countertop barista-style espresso machines, more power to you.\n\u201cNow that you have a few shots of espresso and a cup of foamed milk, you\u2019re ready to construct your drink. But what to make? And how?\n\u201cMany coffee drinkers know their go-to drink and just how they like it; but if you have the tools at your disposal, why not branch out? Here\u2019s a list of the most popular espresso drinks and how to make them. If you try each one, you may have a few new drinks in your morning repertoire that will make it that much easier to rise and shine.\u201d\nMake lovely lattes at home. Photo by Christian Kitazume | SXC.\nMAKE THESE ESPRESSO DRINKS\nEspresso: This is the starting point for pretty much any gourmet coffee drink (and never spelled \u201cexpresso,\u201d an unfortunate American error). It is stripped down, basic, strong and really quite wonderful on its own if you have fine espresso beans. It also gives you a chance to really appreciate the texture and flavor of espresso. Enjoy a quick shot down the hatch to get those eyes open, or sit and sip it leisurely on a weekend morning.\nCaff\u00e9 Americano: This is basically an espresso dumbed down. I am convinced that the name was coined to make fun of Americans who cannot handle the bitter, often intense flavor of espresso. To make it, simply start with a shot or two of espresso and dilute with boiling hot water. You can go with a 1:1 ratio of espresso to water, or start with a shot and fill your cup the rest of the way with water. However you like it, you probably don\u2019t want to be caught ordering one of these in Italy.\nCaff\u00e9 Latte: This may be the easiest to start with if you are just breaking into espresso drinks. Start with a shot of espresso, fill the remaining space in the cup with delicious, soothing, steamed milk, and top it off with a touch of foam. The espresso flavor is there, but in a latte it exists in the background, somewhat muted by the abundance of milk. It\u2019s a great beverage for someone who\u2019s not into super-strong coffee.\nCafe au Lait: This is, essentially, a French-style latte and another very accessible drink for those who don\u2019t want intense espresso flavor. In fact, it isn\u2019t an espresso drink at all; it\u2019s made with regular, albeit strong French-style, coffee. Simply pour half a cup of extra-strong coffee and finish filling the cup with steamed milk. Foam isn\u2019t traditionally found on a Cafe au Lait, but no one will report you if you add some.\nCaff\u00e9 Mocha: This is the espresso drink for chocolate lovers. Start by covering the bottom of the cup with some quality chocolate syrup (being a resident of San Francisco, I like Ghirardelli ). Then add a shot or two of espresso, stir a few times, and fill the rest of the way with steamed milk. If you\u2019re not worried about calories, you can finish with the traditional whipped cream. If you make it correctly, however, the whipped cream isn\u2019t necessary.\nCappuccino: This is the drink for which you really need the foam. The traditional cup size is 6 ounces only; but hey, it\u2019s your coffee, so use as large a cup as you\u2019d like. What you\u2019re going for is a 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk and foam, poured in that order. This beverage showcases a balance of its ingredients and definitely has the greatest range of textures and flavors, from earthy to ephemeral.\nMacchiatto: From the Italian word for \u201cmarked,\u201d this drink is mostly about the espresso, with just a tiny \u201cmarking\u201d of foam and/or milk. To make it correctly, you should use a demitasse cup: Pour a shot of espresso, then add just enough foam to cover it. You can definitely use some of the milk itself (as opposed to just foam), and how much depends on your preference. However, this drink should really be all about the espresso with a complement of milk/foam. It\u2019s the go-to espresso drink for coffee geeks and espresso enthusiasts.\nFor less than $60.00, the Capresso frothPro is a worthy addition to the kitchen and a great gift. Get yours.\n"}, {"score": 352.15717, "uuid": "8e98afaf-adb3-5a93-9f00-24a5cf5ecd01", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1407wb-20-16864", "target_hostname": "www.milehighwineandspirits.com", "target_uri": "http://www.milehighwineandspirits.com/Beers/NotesFromTheCooler.aspx/tabid/63/articleType/CategoryView/categoryId/2/Beers/Newsletter.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1797808e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "MILE HIGH WINE <em>AND</em> SPIRITS <em>The</em> latest beer news, reviews, <em>and</em> interviews", "snippet": "Probably because <em>the</em> smell of fresh <em>coffee</em> grounds is so powerful! <em>The</em> use of a strong, fair-trade <em>coffee</em> certainly intensifies <em>the</em> bitterness of <em>the</em> beer, <em>and</em> <em>the</em> flavor is almost more like <em>espresso</em> than <em>coffee</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Rate Beer: 99pts\nFrom our August interview with Team Avery:\n\"Some of Adam\u2019s first brews were styles that the masses should have appreciated.

Midlands Mild, Razzy Wheat, and Calypso filtered wheat should have sold off the shelves based on what craft fans were drinking in the early 90\u2019s. Fortunately they did not. In 1996 we began to brew our flagship IPA. However, at that time it did not sell well either. People called us to have the beer picked up saying it had gone bad or that something was wrong with it. They just didn\u2019t know what hops were, much less what they tasted like. In 1998 Adam brewed a 10% ABV, 100+IBU, dry hopped\u2026thing (the only Brewers Association style definition that came close was Barley Wine) as a home brew and all his friends said you must sell this from the brewery. After the reaction to our IPA Adam was skeptical anyone would know what to make of it. He actually said \u201cwhen pigs fly people will buy this beer\u201d hence the artwork on the bottle and the name Hog Heaven. Long story short, we couldn\u2019t make enough of it to satisfy the demand. People went crazy for it. And an important lesson was learned. You brew what you love and believe in, not what you think other people will like and let the cards fall where they may. Every big beer at Avery Brewing from Czar to the Demons series to our barrel work owes its creation to Hog Heaven. In time, people's palates have evolved to appreciate what Adam\u2019s did 17 years ago. Now Avery IPA is our number one seller and people search out our specialty beers wherever they may be. We\u2019re glad everyone finally got with the program.\"\nOn to the Tasting Notes:\nThe beauty of Hog is in its simplicity.\u00a0 Hog Heaven is brewed with one hop (Columbus) and two malts (Two-row barley and Caramel 120L).\u00a0 Consumed cold, this brew drinks like a Double IPA; huge, DANK aromas and flavors of pine resin and prickly, green hops.\u00a0 Allow your Hog to warm and it drinks more like a Barleywine; the warmth releases the aromas of the caramel malt and shows the malty, candy-like backbone.\nFood Pairing:\nBig beer needs big food.\u00a0 Try pairing Hog Heaven with meat or game with an apricot glaze or pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches.\nZeke's Belly Up Imperial Stout\nLike a good belly rub, it'll put you in the happy place\nBy: Brad Hargrave\nABV: 8.5%\nSOLD OUT - PLEASE STAY TUNED FOR NEXT WEEK'S SPECIAL\nLast November, Chris, the owner of Mile High Wine and Spirits, rescued our current shop dog, a Weimaraner named Zeke.\u00a0 About the same time that he came into our lives, we got the idea to brew a beer exclusively for Mile High.\u00a0 Now we are celebrating the one year anniversary of Zeke's adoption with the release of a special beer one year in the making: Zeke's Belly Up Imperial Stout.\nWe sell a lot of Bourbon at Mile High and our best seller is Buffalo Trace Bourbon.\u00a0 We sell enough of it that we no longer buy regular bottles like most stores do.\u00a0 Instead, the Buffalo Trace distillery sends us samples from 5 different barrels.\u00a0 We pick the barrel that we like the best, they set it aside for us, bottle the contents, then send all of the bottles exclusively to us.\u00a0 Most Bourbon is blended, several barrels are mixed together to form a consistent product, but not ours, it is a one of a kind, unblended, single barrel Bourbon.\u00a0 But we don't just get the bottles, they also send us the barrel it was aged in.\u00a0 And that is where our story begins.\nWe received our first single barrel batch of Buffalo Trace and our first Bourbon barrel last November.\u00a0 As they brought the barrel into the store, Steve, our Wine Buyer, said I should get a brewery to fill it with beer.\u00a0 Genius!\u00a0 Our friend Jeff Griffith, the Brewmaster at Golden City Brewery, quickly agreed to fill it with his Imperial Stout.\u00a0 Unfortunately, Jeff only brews that beer once a year, in February, so we had to wait.\nFebruary finally rolled around and Jeff brewed a big batch of his Imperial Stout.\u00a0 He filled up our Bourbon barrel then sold the remaining beer on tap at the brewery.\u00a0 The beer sat in that barrel for 6 months, quietly penetrating deeper and deeper into the barrel, absorbing more and more of the Bourbon, gaining greater and greater complexity.\u00a0 I stopped by the brewery every few months to pull a sample from the barrel and see how things were going.\u00a0 In August, after 6 months of aging, Jeff and I decided it was time.\u00a0 The beer was moved from the barrel to a keg where it stayed until November when we were ready to bottle it.\u00a0 The wait finally over, I got to take home a bottle and give it a try.\nOn to the Tasting Notes:\nZeke's Stout pours a dark, inky black.\u00a0 The mocha colored head dissipates, leaving a thin ring of fine bubbles along the perimeter of my snifter glass.\nIntense aromas waft from the glass. Prune is the most prominent aroma with accents of vanilla bean, tobacco, oak, and bourbon.\nMy first sip is flush with heady bourbon notes. But as the beer warms and my palate calibrates, I begin to experience a bounty of flavors. Milk chocolate, vanilla, anise, tobacco, charred oak, and the warming familiarity of Kentucky Bourbon. The finish displays the same bitter qualities of a cup of freshly roasted espresso, lending balance to an otherwise malt heavy brew.\nThe mouthfeel is spot on: low enough carbonation to allow for a creamy, velvety texture, but enough bubbles to carry this thick stout across the tongue before it becomes too overbearing.\nI can't say enough about the superb job done by Jeff and his colleagues at the second largest brewery in Golden.\u00a0 There is no mistaking the distinct effect of six months of bourbon barrel aging on this beer. Bourbon shows up early and often. But it is not overdone, thanks to a large compliment of secondary flavors and ideal carbonation.\u00a0 I'll be throwing half a case in my cellar for sure.\nFood Pairing:\nServe Zeke's Belly Up Imperial Stout at 55 degrees in a brandy snifter or large wine glass alongside a flour-less chocolate cake, a fine cigar, or just let it be the star and serve it as dessert.\nCellaring:\nLike a fine wine, this Stout can improve with age if kept at the proper conditions. \u00a0 We recommend that you store your beer in a cool area, away from direct light, sources of heat and in a constant temperature environment.\u00a0 Imperial Stouts should be aged at 55-60F.\u00a0 Higher temperatures and you'll risk shortening the lifespan of your beer, lower and you'll induce chill haze.\u00a0 Keep your beer away from the light as it can wreak havoc on your delicate brews.\u00a0 I'm sure everyone has heard of the term \"skunky\".

There\u2019s no need to head to your favorite coffee bar when you can make frothy cappuccinos and lattes in your own kitchen.\n\u201cI made a recent purchase that has changed the way I start the day,\u201d says Chef Johnny. \u201cIt has turned my regular morning coffee into a genuine treat, making each cup feel and taste like it was served to me in a chic cafe, perhaps in Rome or Florence. It\u2019s the Capresso frothPro Milk Foamer .\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be easier to use. Simply fill the metal receptacle with milk, press a button (in addition to steamed milk or foam, you can choose cold, warm or hot, including cold foam for iced cappuccino) and watch as ordinary milk is whipped to steaming, frothy pulchritude\u2014in less than a minute! Lowfat or nonfat milk foams the best: The fat in the milk weighs down the potential fluffiness.\nLittle appliance, big foam. Photo courtesy\nCapresso.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not a fan of foam, you can simply heat your milk to the temperature of your choosing. Warm or hot milk keeps the coffee warmer for longer. You can add foam to hot chocolate, too, or simply enjoy a glass of \u2018latte milk.\u2019\n\u201cBut there\u2019s more than frothy, steamed milk to a gourmet espresso drink (see the different types of espresso drinks ).\n\u201cTo make authentic frothed coffee drinks, you need espresso, not regular coffee. If there\u2019s no coffee bean specialty shop near you, you can buy good-quality espresso, whole or ground, at most grocery stores.\n\u201cTo make the espresso, I suggest using a moka pot , a classic stovetop espresso maker like this one from Bialetti. Yes, it\u2019s another appliance, but it\u2019s small, inexpensive (under $25.00), easy to use and should last you a lifetime. If you are lucky enough to have the expensive countertop barista-style espresso machines, more power to you.\n\u201cNow that you have a few shots of espresso and a cup of foamed milk, you\u2019re ready to construct your drink. But what to make? And how?\n\u201cMany coffee drinkers know their go-to drink and just how they like it; but if you have the tools at your disposal, why not branch out? Here\u2019s a list of the most popular espresso drinks and how to make them. If you try each one, you may have a few new drinks in your morning repertoire that will make it that much easier to rise and shine.\u201d\nMake lovely lattes at home. Photo by Christian Kitazume | SXC.\nMAKE THESE ESPRESSO DRINKS\nEspresso: This is the starting point for pretty much any gourmet coffee drink (and never spelled \u201cexpresso,\u201d an unfortunate American error). It is stripped down, basic, strong and really quite wonderful on its own if you have fine espresso beans. It also gives you a chance to really appreciate the texture and flavor of espresso. Enjoy a quick shot down the hatch to get those eyes open, or sit and sip it leisurely on a weekend morning.\nCaff\u00e9 Americano: This is basically an espresso dumbed down. I am convinced that the name was coined to make fun of Americans who cannot handle the bitter, often intense flavor of espresso. To make it, simply start with a shot or two of espresso and dilute with boiling hot water. You can go with a 1:1 ratio of espresso to water, or start with a shot and fill your cup the rest of the way with water. However you like it, you probably don\u2019t want to be caught ordering one of these in Italy.\nCaff\u00e9 Latte: This may be the easiest to start with if you are just breaking into espresso drinks. Start with a shot of espresso, fill the remaining space in the cup with delicious, soothing, steamed milk, and top it off with a touch of foam. The espresso flavor is there, but in a latte it exists in the background, somewhat muted by the abundance of milk. It\u2019s a great beverage for someone who\u2019s not into super-strong coffee.\nCafe au Lait: This is, essentially, a French-style latte and another very accessible drink for those who don\u2019t want intense espresso flavor. In fact, it isn\u2019t an espresso drink at all; it\u2019s made with regular, albeit strong French-style, coffee. Simply pour half a cup of extra-strong coffee and finish filling the cup with steamed milk. Foam isn\u2019t traditionally found on a Cafe au Lait, but no one will report you if you add some.\nCaff\u00e9 Mocha: This is the espresso drink for chocolate lovers. Start by covering the bottom of the cup with some quality chocolate syrup (being a resident of San Francisco, I like Ghirardelli ). Then add a shot or two of espresso, stir a few times, and fill the rest of the way with steamed milk. If you\u2019re not worried about calories, you can finish with the traditional whipped cream. If you make it correctly, however, the whipped cream isn\u2019t necessary.\nCappuccino: This is the drink for which you really need the foam. The traditional cup size is 6 ounces only; but hey, it\u2019s your coffee, so use as large a cup as you\u2019d like. What you\u2019re going for is a 1:1:1 ratio of espresso, steamed milk and foam, poured in that order. This beverage showcases a balance of its ingredients and definitely has the greatest range of textures and flavors, from earthy to ephemeral.\nMacchiatto: From the Italian word for \u201cmarked,\u201d this drink is mostly about the espresso, with just a tiny \u201cmarking\u201d of foam and/or milk. To make it correctly, you should use a demitasse cup: Pour a shot of espresso, then add just enough foam to cover it. You can definitely use some of the milk itself (as opposed to just foam), and how much depends on your preference. However, this drink should really be all about the espresso with a complement of milk/foam. It\u2019s the go-to espresso drink for coffee geeks and espresso enthusiasts.\nFor less than $60.00, the Capresso frothPro is a worthy addition to the kitchen and a great gift. Get yours.\n"}, {"score": 347.8607, "uuid": "8f93a684-6a52-56c6-b917-35b1f12ea347", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-02-29235", "target_hostname": "www.dentaleconomics.com", "target_uri": "http://www.dentaleconomics.com/index/display/article-display/318754/articles/dental-economics/volume-98/issue-1/columns/murphys-law/grow-your-bottom-line-by-expanding-the-right-services.html", "page_rank": 1.1722602e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Grow your bottom line by expanding <em>the</em> right services - Dental Economics", "snippet": "s has made is <em>the</em> McCafe line of premium <em>coffee</em> drinks. s has trained baristas, much like you would see at Starbucks, to make <em>the</em> <em>lattes</em>, <em>espressos</em>, <em>and</em> <em>cappuccinos</em> that we have come to crave. <em>The</em> main reason McDonald?", "explanation": null, "document": "Grow your bottom line by expanding the right services\nby Mark Murphy, DDS\nYou may recall a Saturday Night Live skit with the Coney Island restaurant that had \u201cno Coke, just Pepsi ... no fries, just cheeseburgers, cheeseburgers, cheeseburgers.? McDonald?s didn?t always have such a wide variety of menu items. It was many years before it added a breakfast menu, and currently more than 70 percent of its sales come from the drive-thru. The most recent expansion of products McDonald?s has made is the McCafe line of premium coffee drinks. McDonald?s has trained baristas, much like you would see at Starbucks, to make the lattes, espressos, and cappuccinos that we have come to crave. The main reason McDonald?s has chased this revenue stream is that coffee products are second only to iced tea in profit margins. It might interest you to know that McDonald?s makes more money off of its soft drinks, iced tea, and coffee than its hamburgers, french fries, and breakfast items.\nIn dental practices, some of us have begun to expand our products and services, and we now look at things like bleaching, TMD therapy, and Invisalign\u00ae. This expansion of services opens the door for general practitioners to focus on esthetics and treat occlusal disease and select orthodontic cases, but it also means significant revenue at a higher operating profit.\nA great example of this type of revenue and services expander that you could choose for your dental practice is the immediate-load, implant-retained overdentures using the new mini-implants. Until the recent introduction of mini-implants, you had to have specialized training or leave the placement of implants to the periodontist or oral surgeon. With the introduction and FDA approval of the smaller, less-invasive implant fixtures, more general dentists can step into the implant arena.\nOne such company, Sterngold, has executed several strategies to reduce the entry barriers and overcome implementation hurdles for us. When I lecture about this protocol I often say, ?If you do root canals and extractions in your practice, you can do this as well.? Although it is not exactly a parallel universe, the risk assessment and learning curve are actually easier. Here is what Sterngold does to help:\nThe company has a mentor program, where an experienced general practitioner visits you and oversees your first couple of placements, sort of like over-the-shoulder in dental school, but without the grades.\nThe program also offers 3-D CT scan technology and partners with a company that provides a CAD/CAM surgical guide (Implant Logic System) that makes it much easier to place the fixtures and avoid alveolar nerves, mental foramina, and other untoward sites.\nThe company gives you a sophisticated, evidence-based risk assessment protocol and helps you choose the right patients and cases.\nThe surgical kit, prosthetic kit, and surgical handpiece can all be paid for with your first surgery; the cost of entry has been reduced. Ultimately, the company wants to sell you implants, not start-up kits.\nAnother thing that is so enticing about these immediate-load, implant-retained overdentures is the potential high-profit margin. If we are using conventional implants, the patient?s total fee for a bar-retained overdenture with conventional implants can run $20,000 and up. For five ERA implant fixtures and all the parts to retrofit an existing denture with ERA attachments, dentists are charging anywhere from $3,500 to $6,000, with a 70 to 80 percent profit margin. Patients report good fitting, well-retained dentures and improved quality of life.\nThis type of procedure expands a better restorative solution to a segment of the 35 million or so edentulous patients in our country today, and helps overcome some access to care issues. This same company plans a multimillion dollar national advertising campaign to educate patients about this restorative choice. Just two cases a month could add $120,000 to production and up to $100,000 to your bottom line. Your patients can even finance it with CareCredit\u00ae or one of the other patient financing products.\nThe introduction of the right kinds of expanded services into our practices provides high-quality patient solutions to restorative issues that are also highly profitable for us. It helps us expand our field of services and gives us greater fulfillment and increased productivity at a time when we need it most.\nMark Murphy is a featured presenter for the National Dental Network and the National Lab Network.

Thing is, though, that it seems Australia\u2019s teaching me a thing or two about kicking back and enjoying the moment. Although I have been taking photographs like crazy, I seem to be less inclined whilst on vacation with my family (the entire family!) to actually make frequent blog posts. It\u2019s a different environment, yeah?\nBut I do have lots to say about Sydney. And I shall start by saying I\u2019d love to live here.\nCoffee, Flat White\nFor one, coffee\u2019s good here. Really good. You can walk into almost any small caf\u00e9 in Sydney and ask for a flat white, and chances are it\u2019ll be well done. And you see, I\u2019m a sucker for flat whites, and it\u2019s kinda what I except when I order a latte in the US. What the difference is exactly between the two is something people can\u2019t be very sure about, but the reason I prefer the flatwhites you get here, other than the fact that the espresso is usually extracted properly, is because:\nThe microfoam milk is blended in with the coffee, and isn\u2019t just a thick layer on top.\nThat layer on top is usually less than 1cm, around 2 to 5mm.\nAn odd thing is that in Sydney, cappuccinos almost always have chocolate sprinkle on top:\nOne of the reasons that Sydney coffee is usually so good is because knowledge of basic coffee techniques is a prerequisite to any hospitality job. The baristas (baristi?) who make your coffee have taken classes and are trained in the art and business of making coffee. \u00a0And Australian consumers, from what I\u2019ve heard, are by now very used to good flat-whites, and the industry is naturally expected to deliver.\nMomo, Kangaroo steak and Vegemite\nFood, it would appear, is more expensive in Sydney (dollar-to-dollar) than it is in the US. But people are also paid higher here, so it all works out. From a culinary pov, Sydney\u2019s multiculturalism means that you can find great Chinese, Singaporean, Japanese, Italian, Spanish, Lebanese cuisine. I even had some pretty authentic Nepali momo at an Indian/Malaysian restaurant, complete with great sauce!\nSome of you might remember how excited I was about getting to try kangaroo steak here. And although it took a while (we didn\u2019t have a kitchen until last week), Parag got us some pre-marinated kangaroo meat from Coles and we had kangaroo steak for dinner:\nI don\u2019t know much about steak, and what makes a good steak, but this was great! This lean cut of kangaroo meat was flavorful, and made the way it was (quite rare, I thought), absolutely a pleasure to dig in to. I actually prefer the taste of kangaroo to beef, and its supposed to be environmentally a less expensive meat. And contrary to what I\u2019d thought, it kangaroo meat isn\u2019t exactly very common here. You see it on menus sometimes, and I\u2019ve read that you can order it at grills even if they don\u2019t have it in the menu, but not everyone in Australia is necessarily aware that kangaroo meat is quite easily available. It isn\u2019t, as it were, a culture.\nAnd speaking of culture, and boy do I smell a pun coming up, there\u2019s Vegemite, what my friends at Hampshire like to call \u201cthat black gooey thing comes in a tube\u201d. It just so happens that ever since I got into Marmite back in Nepal, and my brother got me some Vegemite from Sydney the last time we met in Bangkok, I love that black gooey thing. I plan to take some back with me, too. But what\u2019s really interesting is this time, I\u2019ll be taking two kinds.\nThe old tubey, and now, this:\nThis new Vegemite, which you\u2019ll notice hasn\u2019t yet been named, is a mix of the the regular Vegemite and cream cheese. The thing that put off a lot of people was that you had to mix Vegemite with another spread, usually butter or margarine, to really enjoy it with your morning toast. I don\u2019t particularly mind having a work a little from an Amazing Toast Experience, but with this new Vegemite, you don\u2019t have that extra step. \u201cSpread it straight on!\u201d\nAussie Oddities\nThere are quite a few quirky things that make Sydney so lovable (we\u2019re not going to talk about Skippy), and why I\u2019d love to live here at some point in the future. But this I\u2019ll discuss at a later time. I\u2019m off to have some more of the new Vegemite.\nDiscussion (3)\n1 . ugyen lhamo wrote on November 18th, 2009:\nparimal\u2026.your websiteee is awesome!!! please call me if you are doing any more presentations on anything! esp.. you i-phone one\u2026..PS: the vegemite you seem to like is not as good as they taste!;>\n2 .

Of the Acacia genus, in the Mimosa family, wattle trees often have little puffy flowers and long seed pods. Six hundred are native to Australia, but many, such as Australian Blackwood, have been introduced throughout the world.\nA hardy tree with strong timber and a shady canopy, the Australian Blackwood is cultivated in habitats from Chile to California. Its prized wood is carved into ukuleles in Hawaii, boats in South Africa, and a collection of small treasures \u2015 pipes, pens, guitar picks \u2015 that would fill a Blackwood-inlay cabinet. Meanwhile, in most of these countries, the trees \u2015 and their seeds \u2015 have spread far beyond their designated territory, making the Australian Blackwood yet another introduced species to embellish on the terms of its invitation.\nThe seeds are curious things, each wrapped in an unmistakable coral-colored ribbon, and so many. They play a significant role in the tree\u2019s life cycle, and its reputation as an internationally recognized invasive species. They are packaged in a legume that develops just after the flower. Long and thin, the beans twist and constrict as they mature, weaving themselves into a bundle of extravagant curls. Once they have dried, the pods split along both margins, exposing the seeds, which, given the odd angles of the curled pods, flail in every direction. The seeds are small (2-3mm long), and they are fastened to the pod by a reddish-orange seed stalk, called an aril or funiculus, that folds twice around the seed.\nThe bright accent distinguishes our tree from other wattles (which might have yellow, or cream arils), and it is a bright billboard for birds, a seed dispersing agent\u2015at least in Australia, where birds have evolved to forage on the red aril and disperse the seed. However, many birds in the tree\u2019s new environments are not similarly adapted \u2015 this can keep the tree from wandering where it\u2019s not wanted. Birds in South Africa, however, have developed a taste for the aril. Here the tree\u2019s populations are growing, and it\u2019s believed the birds have something to do with it. The country has declared the tree a noxious weed species, and biologists have taken measures to control it, including the introduction of seed-feeding weevils (and the Australian Blackwood is not the only nuisance; in total, 10 control agents have been released to control 10 Acacia species). In its native country, the tree is also recognized as a problem, which doesn\u2019t diminish its status as a national icon \u2015 Acacia melanoxyln has been featured on two postage stamps, in 1959 and 1966.\nThe aril is not only pretty; it\u2019s also rich in protein, which makes the seed package rather appealing to ants, which consume the aril and discard the seed, in a fertile rubbish heap, or in the nest. Now buried, the seed has secured itself a pretty good place to wait until it\u2019s time to germinate. Like many Australian natives, the seed has a hard coating, a preference for bushfire germination, and incredible patience \u2015 all of which make for years of dormancy. There is evidence that soil-stored seeds are viable after 50 years.

Johnny Selman spends every morning ritually checking headlines on the BBC. But that\u2019s not all. In 2010, \u201cI decided to create a poster a day for 20 days in reaction to a headline for each day,\u201d he recently told me. This exercise triggered the idea for his Academy of Art University in San Francisco graduate school thesis, which he expanded into 365 days of posters and world news, he calls\u00a0\u201d BBCx365 .\u201d It is an obsessive tour de force.\n\u201cThe purpose of this project is to promote the awareness of global current events with the American public,\u201d Selman wrote in the introduction to his website . \u201c\u2018American citizens know little about current events in general and even less about overseas events\u2019 according to The Washington Post in 2006.\u201d\nThe changing pool of content kept the project exciting, he says. \u201cI created a tight set of design parameters to ensure that the project would hang together as a set at the end of the day. I reduced the composition to its simplest visual form and removed all unnecessary elements from the designs. The most challenging aspect to the project, outside the \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019-like repetition, was the importance of creating designs based on rich ideas.\u201d\nSlow news days were inevitable, but he tried to instill a sense of urgency and importance to every story he represented in the hopes that someone would be inspired by even the more bland news days. Still, keeping up the pace day after day, approaching every story as new and maintaining a semblance of originality had to be a chore. \u201cI had elements of gestural drawing in my posters,\u201d he explains, \u201cand many times I would reuse bits and pieces of an already used image to provoke a different thought. There were times when using a repetitive image added to the posters\u2019 meaning, such as the two posters about the Dutch family that was held captive by pirates in Somalia. The reuse of the imagery helped bring closure to an already told story.\u201d\nRigor is imperative when creating a daily poster. So Selman\u2019s list of dos and don\u2019ts included: \u201cUse as few elements as possible. Reduce the story to its simplest visual form. Don\u2019t over think it. Don\u2019t overwork it. Use as few colors as possible. Use flat color. Use color as a representative element. Don\u2019t use gradients. Use typography as the central visual element whenever possible. Use Gotham Bold or your hand. When needed use Tungsten Bold as a condensed face. Other typefaces can be used sparingly for parody. Use bitmap and vector graphics. Rip the levels out of photographs. Keep it interesting. Use humor. Use parody. Use satire. Use visual puns. Stay neutral. Be bold. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nThe task he set for himself was exhausting. Some days he just wanted to sleep in. \u201cIn order to maintain sanity within a task like this you have to allow yourself room to breathe and give yourself a break once in a while,\u201d he notes. It was best to start my posters when I was feeling inspired or up to the task, \u201cit made the process go quicker than if I forced myself to to sit and stare at my computer or endlessly sketch in my notebook.\u201d\nBut the project became \u201cthe constant in my life.\u201d Through sickness, vacation, injury, work and even a houseboat bachelor party, the daily design ritual was there like a backbone. \u201cA deadline that was as predictable as the temperature in San Francisco.\u201d\nThe posters vary in conceptual acuity, but on the whole Selman\u2019s visual shorthand is up to the task. There are also traces of various other poster designers, including Paul Rand, Joseph M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Ivan Chermayeff, even James Victore, and others who view economy as a virtue.\nSelman insists the poster marathon had an ultimate purpose. To take complex information and to distill it down into digestible bites. \u201cI certainly learned about time management,\u201d he adds. \u201cI learned how to deal with the barrage of anonymous online criticism [the series had an online component that drew many yays and nays ].\u201d\nIn the final analysis, Selman, who graduated in December 2011, admits, \u201cThe skill-set I gained during the course of the project can be directly applied to many aspects of visual communication. I\u2019m working in New York now and am involved in some really exciting projects. Most of all, I\u2019m making up for lost time with my wife. We are quickly referring to events in our lives as pre- or post-posters.\u201d\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

An agent clued me in; a few days later I was at photographer Martha Cooper \u2019s apartment and asked if she\u2019d caught wind of \u201cUnderbelly.\u201d She\u2019d heard all about it and was hoping to receive an invitation to the underground gallery. It was summer 2010 and the project was wrapping up. In late October of the same year, the secret was out when the New York Times ran a feature about an art installation that very few people would ever see.\nI\u2019m not sure if Cooper ever made it down to the abandoned New York City subway station, but between May 2009 and August 2010 Workhorse and PAC escorted 103 street artists four stories beneath street level and unleashed them in an empty space big enough to fit six subway trains. Jim and Tina Darling, the first artists to get up on the grimy, barren walls, describe it as \u201can industrial version of an orchard with its rows of concrete and steel beams, stretching on forever and fading into darkness. The air\u2026 thick enough to see in our lights.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nPAC first discovered this space in 2005, taken there by a stranger. On subsequent visits, he always left \u201cwith an inexplicable sense of calm.\u201d Having been abandoned for 80 years, only a handful of visitors had entered this subterranean cavern, and none of them had been graffiti artists . Legendary old-school graffiti writer HAZE reminds readers that since the early 1970s, train tunnels and ghost stations have been galleries for New York City graffiti. Back in the day, 12-year-old HAZE and his crew ran roughshod through the abandoned 91st station on a now defunct Broadway IRT line. So the fact that PAC had been ushered into an area undiscovered by graffiti artists was auspicious to say the least. After meeting Workhorse through an art gallery connection, the makings of a singular endeavor were in place.\nAble to reach out to a stunning array of international graffiti and street art talent, Workhorse and PAC assembled an impressive cast of contributors, many of them able to make livings off their work. This is a result of individual talent, of course, but also a number of cultural circumstances that have come to pass over the past few years, raising graffiti and street art out of the low-culture gutters and into the lofty high-culture strata of museum exhibits, glitzy fashion runways and global advertising campaigns. But as Workhorse points out, this bubble is \u201cstarting to burst.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nThe roll call of acclaimed artists who participated in this project is staggering. Ranging from graffiti writers like SABER, REVOK, CEAZE, and STASH to street artists like Know Hope, SWOON, Flying Fortress, FAILE , and Ron English, the logistics of organizing so much talent is dizzying. These artists are no strangers to acting covertly and breaking the law, but even by their standards the Underbelly Project possessed an aura of a covert operation akin to some sort of special-ops mission.\nThe result of everyone\u2019s work is a gallery of contemporary graffiti and street art on par with the recent \u201c Art in the Streets \u201d exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, or any high-profile gallery group show. But the venues couldn\u2019t be any more different. Workhorse admits that in thinking about this undertaking he and PAC asked themselves \u201cIf no one will see it, will it still be important?\u201d\nSuch a question strikes at the heart of why the street art bubble is beginning to burst. Unlike the original graffiti writers, and even the first wave of street artists like Shepard Fairey, kids running around today with aerosol cans, stencils and wheat paste have it in the back of their minds that they might have a shot at becoming rich and famous. This is a far cry from the get up for the sake of getting up credo that inspired kids in the \u201870s, \u201880s and \u201890s.\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nIf there is anything to criticize about \u201cWe Own the Night\u201d it\u2019s that there are too many photographs of the artists. I said as much to the agent when I first saw the proposal and seeing the finished book, which is big and brimming with photographs of the phenomenal artwork, I feel the same. Many of the featured artists have played a role in how the world views this art form, and if you look at their work you can see why. \u00a0As Harlan Levey writes in the book\u2019s most insightful piece, no matter where you look on this particular art history timeline, the movement has been spurred by action. But the remnants of these actions, the actual art, have been noticed by surprise \u2013 the hilariously appropriate placement of a sticker, the delicate latticework of a stencil sprayed on a sidewalk, the precision of a gravity-defying tag proudly trumpeting from a highway overpass. The how did they do that? awe and mystery matters. Museums usually don\u2019t exhibit photographs of artists next to their work; I don\u2019t see the need to feature photographs of street artists next to their pieces.\nIn the scheme of how popular culture has embraced graffiti and street art the idea of separating the art from the artists merits a stand-alone essay, but within the context of \u201cWe Own the Night\u201d it is a minor, though thought-provoking, critique. On the whole, the book is mesmerizing thanks to Workhorse and PAC\u2019s collective vision, which is as perceptive about the past as it is in looking toward the future, and accepting that a change is in the air. As Levey suggests, \u201cIt is the action that connects all of the participants, and as an action, the Underbelly Project seems to appear right before the closing of a chapter.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nJoe Iurato\u2019s striking \u201cThe People Upstairs Are CRAZY\u201d shows a boy using a drainpipe like a periscope; the letters in the word \u201ccrazy\u201d appear in circles made to look like letters identifying subway lines. It\u2019s a fitting sentiment. It\u2019s clear that the artists who contributed to the Underbelly Project conjured a realm of sanity beneath the streets, a return to the essence of the art form: creating in the moment and not worrying or thinking about what comes of what is left behind.\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

The most challenging aspect to the project, outside the \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019-like repetition, was the importance of creating designs based on rich ideas.\u201d\nSlow news days were inevitable, but he tried to instill a sense of urgency and importance to every story he represented in the hopes that someone would be inspired by even the more bland news days. Still, keeping up the pace day after day, approaching every story as new and maintaining a semblance of originality had to be a chore. \u201cI had elements of gestural drawing in my posters,\u201d he explains, \u201cand many times I would reuse bits and pieces of an already used image to provoke a different thought. There were times when using a repetitive image added to the posters\u2019 meaning, such as the two posters about the Dutch family that was held captive by pirates in Somalia. The reuse of the imagery helped bring closure to an already told story.\u201d\nRigor is imperative when creating a daily poster. So Selman\u2019s list of dos and don\u2019ts included: \u201cUse as few elements as possible. Reduce the story to its simplest visual form. Don\u2019t over think it. Don\u2019t overwork it. Use as few colors as possible. Use flat color. Use color as a representative element. Don\u2019t use gradients. Use typography as the central visual element whenever possible. Use Gotham Bold or your hand. When needed use Tungsten Bold as a condensed face. Other typefaces can be used sparingly for parody. Use bitmap and vector graphics. Rip the levels out of photographs. Keep it interesting. Use humor. Use parody. Use satire. Use visual puns. Stay neutral. Be bold. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nThe task he set for himself was exhausting. Some days he just wanted to sleep in. \u201cIn order to maintain sanity within a task like this you have to allow yourself room to breathe and give yourself a break once in a while,\u201d he notes. It was best to start my posters when I was feeling inspired or up to the task, \u201cit made the process go quicker than if I forced myself to to sit and stare at my computer or endlessly sketch in my notebook.\u201d\nBut the project became \u201cthe constant in my life.\u201d Through sickness, vacation, injury, work and even a houseboat bachelor party, the daily design ritual was there like a backbone. \u201cA deadline that was as predictable as the temperature in San Francisco.\u201d\nThe posters vary in conceptual acuity, but on the whole Selman\u2019s visual shorthand is up to the task. There are also traces of various other poster designers, including Paul Rand, Joseph M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Ivan Chermayeff, even James Victore, and others who view economy as a virtue.\nSelman insists the poster marathon had an ultimate purpose. To take complex information and to distill it down into digestible bites. \u201cI certainly learned about time management,\u201d he adds. \u201cI learned how to deal with the barrage of anonymous online criticism [the series had an online component that drew many yays and nays ].\u201d\nIn the final analysis, Selman, who graduated in December 2011, admits, \u201cThe skill-set I gained during the course of the project can be directly applied to many aspects of visual communication. I\u2019m working in New York now and am involved in some really exciting projects. Most of all, I\u2019m making up for lost time with my wife. We are quickly referring to events in our lives as pre- or post-posters.\u201d\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

An agent clued me in; a few days later I was at photographer Martha Cooper \u2019s apartment and asked if she\u2019d caught wind of \u201cUnderbelly.\u201d She\u2019d heard all about it and was hoping to receive an invitation to the underground gallery. It was summer 2010 and the project was wrapping up. In late October of the same year, the secret was out when the New York Times ran a feature about an art installation that very few people would ever see.\nI\u2019m not sure if Cooper ever made it down to the abandoned New York City subway station, but between May 2009 and August 2010 Workhorse and PAC escorted 103 street artists four stories beneath street level and unleashed them in an empty space big enough to fit six subway trains. Jim and Tina Darling, the first artists to get up on the grimy, barren walls, describe it as \u201can industrial version of an orchard with its rows of concrete and steel beams, stretching on forever and fading into darkness. The air\u2026 thick enough to see in our lights.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nPAC first discovered this space in 2005, taken there by a stranger. On subsequent visits, he always left \u201cwith an inexplicable sense of calm.\u201d Having been abandoned for 80 years, only a handful of visitors had entered this subterranean cavern, and none of them had been graffiti artists . Legendary old-school graffiti writer HAZE reminds readers that since the early 1970s, train tunnels and ghost stations have been galleries for New York City graffiti. Back in the day, 12-year-old HAZE and his crew ran roughshod through the abandoned 91st station on a now defunct Broadway IRT line. So the fact that PAC had been ushered into an area undiscovered by graffiti artists was auspicious to say the least. After meeting Workhorse through an art gallery connection, the makings of a singular endeavor were in place.\nAble to reach out to a stunning array of international graffiti and street art talent, Workhorse and PAC assembled an impressive cast of contributors, many of them able to make livings off their work. This is a result of individual talent, of course, but also a number of cultural circumstances that have come to pass over the past few years, raising graffiti and street art out of the low-culture gutters and into the lofty high-culture strata of museum exhibits, glitzy fashion runways and global advertising campaigns. But as Workhorse points out, this bubble is \u201cstarting to burst.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nThe roll call of acclaimed artists who participated in this project is staggering. Ranging from graffiti writers like SABER, REVOK, CEAZE, and STASH to street artists like Know Hope, SWOON, Flying Fortress, FAILE , and Ron English, the logistics of organizing so much talent is dizzying. These artists are no strangers to acting covertly and breaking the law, but even by their standards the Underbelly Project possessed an aura of a covert operation akin to some sort of special-ops mission.\nThe result of everyone\u2019s work is a gallery of contemporary graffiti and street art on par with the recent \u201c Art in the Streets \u201d exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, or any high-profile gallery group show. But the venues couldn\u2019t be any more different. Workhorse admits that in thinking about this undertaking he and PAC asked themselves \u201cIf no one will see it, will it still be important?\u201d\nSuch a question strikes at the heart of why the street art bubble is beginning to burst. Unlike the original graffiti writers, and even the first wave of street artists like Shepard Fairey, kids running around today with aerosol cans, stencils and wheat paste have it in the back of their minds that they might have a shot at becoming rich and famous. This is a far cry from the get up for the sake of getting up credo that inspired kids in the \u201870s, \u201880s and \u201890s.\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nIf there is anything to criticize about \u201cWe Own the Night\u201d it\u2019s that there are too many photographs of the artists. I said as much to the agent when I first saw the proposal and seeing the finished book, which is big and brimming with photographs of the phenomenal artwork, I feel the same. Many of the featured artists have played a role in how the world views this art form, and if you look at their work you can see why. \u00a0As Harlan Levey writes in the book\u2019s most insightful piece, no matter where you look on this particular art history timeline, the movement has been spurred by action. But the remnants of these actions, the actual art, have been noticed by surprise \u2013 the hilariously appropriate placement of a sticker, the delicate latticework of a stencil sprayed on a sidewalk, the precision of a gravity-defying tag proudly trumpeting from a highway overpass. The how did they do that? awe and mystery matters. Museums usually don\u2019t exhibit photographs of artists next to their work; I don\u2019t see the need to feature photographs of street artists next to their pieces.\nIn the scheme of how popular culture has embraced graffiti and street art the idea of separating the art from the artists merits a stand-alone essay, but within the context of \u201cWe Own the Night\u201d it is a minor, though thought-provoking, critique. On the whole, the book is mesmerizing thanks to Workhorse and PAC\u2019s collective vision, which is as perceptive about the past as it is in looking toward the future, and accepting that a change is in the air. As Levey suggests, \u201cIt is the action that connects all of the participants, and as an action, the Underbelly Project seems to appear right before the closing of a chapter.\u201d\nThe Underbelly Project, We Own the Night, Rizzoli, 2012\nJoe Iurato\u2019s striking \u201cThe People Upstairs Are CRAZY\u201d shows a boy using a drainpipe like a periscope; the letters in the word \u201ccrazy\u201d appear in circles made to look like letters identifying subway lines. It\u2019s a fitting sentiment. It\u2019s clear that the artists who contributed to the Underbelly Project conjured a realm of sanity beneath the streets, a return to the essence of the art form: creating in the moment and not worrying or thinking about what comes of what is left behind.\nCopyright F+W Media Inc . 2012.\nSalon is proud to feature content from Imprint , the fastest-growing design community on the web.

Rainy, and the temperature is getting steady below 30 degree\u00a0Celsius. It makes me lazy to wake up and get out to lab (haha~). Drizzling and cloudy day is the best moment for reading (books and novels of course, not papers *tongue).\nTalking about books, one of my favorite authors is Dee, a pen name of Dewi Lestari. She was firstly known as the members of singing group Rida, Sita, Dewi (RSD). In 2001, she published her first novel: Supernova (episode one); and the book immediately became hits. At that time, I was a freshman in my senior high (boarding\u00a0school), and well, with not much access to \u2018outside world\u2019, my leverage was when I had a chance to visit bookstore.\n[picture credit to: Jakarta Post ]\n-\nOne time, I went to Toga Mas discount bookstore in Yogyakarta, and my eyes caught by one book, Supernova. I didn\u2019t recognize the name \u201cDee\u201d, and I thought, new author? There was no explanation about the author in the back of the book, and the synopsis didn\u2019t help too much. Then I decided to buy the book.\nOh well, my mind was twisting the first time I read the book. After just a few pages, I said to myself, what the hell is this book? It is full of idioms and terms I didn\u2019t understand (hellooo, I lived far away from Uncle Google). And the story is broken into pieces then arranged irregularly. One chapter tells you the \u2018confusing\u2019 things, and then the \u2018normal\u2019 chapter follows. I personally felt relieved when it came to those normal chapters (haha).\nThe first book of Dee is Supernova: Ksatria, Puteri, dan Bintang Jatuh (in English: Supernova: Knight, Princess, and the Fallen Star), in which she tells the readers about two gays planning to write a masterpiece. I won\u2019t tell you the story, as always. Even from the very first chapter Dee already used such complicated words. I also encountered \u2018chaos theory\u2019 in the novel, which had been my interest (I wrote a lousy academic article about that for my high school graduation). And that was the key part that kept me from putting the book down *\u00a0tongue.\nIt was a very unusual style (colloquially, or should I say highly unlikely?) at that moment, a fusion between fiction and non-fiction story. In one way Dee emphasized a daunting forbidden love story, and in the other hand she used science\u00a0metaphor\u00a0and term to explain the plot. And I though that was\u00a0genius. Brilliant. It is the way she saw a thing not just from one point of view, not just heartily satisfying, but also\u00a0brainy\u00a0amusing. Not everyday you\u2019ll read how your happiness and passion in love explain in such plain and not-very-complicated way (for a non scientist like me, it is confusing but still, I can finally get the point). So charming!\nSupernova is meant to be a series of different books. Not everyone get that in mind in the time of Supernova: Ksatria, Puteri, dan Bintang Jatuh made its debut in Indonesia. One year after, the second book was released, entitled Supernova: Akar . Dee did not give continuity straight away, because in the second book, she brought a very brief chapter about the characters in the first book, and the rest of it, new people came in. She introduced a unique man, with great power invisible by others. The cover of the original edition, is the symbol of Om , regarded as the sacred symbol of Hinduism. After several protest of the use of the symbol, the following edition of Supernova: Akar no longer bears the Om symbol (I have the first printed edition though). Eventhough Dee seems to hide the missing piece to make the story easily understandable, the plot is still flowing. She just did not (or haven\u2019t) provide(d) details for her story.\nThe third book is Supernova: Petir , where Dee almost completely broke the relationship between the first, second and the third book. New story, new characters, new style (there\u2019s no confusing science terms in her third book, no footnote whatsoever *haha). There\u2019s a small detail related to the previous two books, just a little, at the very end of the book. Making the readers\u00a0intrigued, curious (how the hell she can do that so well?).\n-\nThe following episode hasn\u2019t been published yet, and Dee compiled her works in Filosofi Kopi , and then wrote another book, Perahu Kertas . I have to admit, Filosofi Kopi reminds me much of her three episodes of Supernova, the language and plot both refers to literature (by literature I mean literary fiction). Perahu Kertas is different, however. \u00a0It is a popular fiction, \u2018lighter\u2019 than her previous books, telling about love and its irrational world, about the hardship in being honest or keeping someone else\u2019s expectation. Superb. Never read a love story being pictured like that. Simple, but meaningful.\nDewi also creates Rectoverso, a symbiosis of writings and music; 11 short stories combined with songs. Very good idea. She tries to elaborate both of her love into one masterpiece, and Dewi, I adore you for doing so.\n-\nAnd in the end, I am intrigued if there\u2019s any thing on her stories really happened in her real life. Because I am so inspired and drowned in her books! Sometimes it even seems like I am reading my own life story.\nKeep writing Dewi, love your works,\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 321.2372, "uuid": "9f21210c-cb99-53c6-9c8f-60deb4a8b632", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1901wb-94-02600", "target_hostname": "www.comprehensiveobgyn.net", "target_uri": "http://www.comprehensiveobgyn.net/blog/?Tag=Women%26%2339%3bs+Health", "page_rank": 1.6955778e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Women&amp;#39;s Health | Comprehensive OB-GYN of <em>the</em> Palm Beaches | Comprehensive", "snippet": "<em>The</em> authors also highlight that many <em>coffee</em> outlets prepare other coffees, such as <em>lattes</em> <em>and</em> <em>cappuccinos</em>, from <em>espresso</em> shots.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\n\u201cPregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies in danger by drinking coffee from high street chains,\u201d reported the\nDaily Express. Other newspapers reported the wide range of caffeine levels in espresso shots from different coffee outlets.\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should continue to be careful about how much caffeine they drink. Current advice from the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day.\nThe story comes from an analysis of the caffeine content of single shots of espresso from 20 high-street coffee shops in Glasgow. The amount of caffeine they contained varied considerably, from 322mg to 51mg a shot.\nThe authors say that normally quoted figures for caffeine levels in coffee, which they say are about 50mg a cup, are misleading. One single shot of a high-caffeine drink could place at risk people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of coffee. These include pregnant women, women taking oral contraceptives, young children and people with liver disease, they warn.\nThe authors also highlight that many coffee outlets prepare other coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, from espresso shots. As they rightly conclude, coffee consumption in commercial outlets and caffeine content of other drinks need to be studied further, so that consumer information can be improved.\nCaffeine is also found in other foods including tea, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some cold and flu remedies.\nWhere did the story come from?\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of Glasgow. No sources of external funding were reported in the paper. The study was published in the Royal Society of Chemistry\u2019s journal, Food and Function.\nThe story was generally covered accurately in the media. The Daily Express\u2019s claim that \u201cpregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies at risk\u201d was misleading as it implied the study found that pregnant women consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. The analysis was of caffeine levels in high-street coffee outlets. It did not look at caffeine intake among pregnant women or any other group.\nWhat kind of research was this?\nThis was a chemical analysis of levels of caffeine in single-shot espresso coffees purchased from 20 different outlets. Researchers also looked at levels of another substance in these products called caffeoylquinic acid (CQA). They said that CQA has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antioxidant properties, but there is limited evidence for any direct protective effects on human health.\nThey pointed out that consuming caffeine in excess can lead to unpleasant symptoms, although individual susceptibility varies. Certain groups, including pregnant women and young children, are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine because their bodies process it more slowly.\nThe researchers also say that there is no published information on the caffeine content of the various types of commercially prepared coffees, despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the high street and in other settings, such as airports. The authors quote figures from a US review, published by the International Food Information Council Foundation, which suggest that a 28ml of espresso contains 30\u201350mg of caffeine.\nWhat did the research involve?\nThe researchers bought single-shot espresso coffees from 20 different outlets in Glasgow\u2019s west end. They measured the volume of each coffee serving, which ranged from 23ml to 70ml, before diluting it with methanol (alcohol) and freezing it. The diluted coffee samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a biochemical technique that can separate and identify individual components of a particular compound.\nTo explore a possible reason for any variations in the coffees\u2019 caffeine and chemical content, they also carried out a similar analysis of six samples of ground espresso arabica coffee, prepared from beans subject to different roasting methods.\nWhat were the basic results?\nThe analysis of caffeine levels in the 20 espresso shots found a six-fold variation in caffeine levels. The strongest coffee contained 322mg in one shot (from Patisserie Francoise), six times more than the lowest strength, which contained 51mg (from Starbucks). Three further products contained more than 200mg of caffeine and a further eight contained over 100mg (between 129mg and 173mg). The cup size ranged from 23ml to 70ml.\nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\nThe researchers concluded that the range of results in their snapshot of espresso coffees demonstrates that the normally quoted figures for caffeine content \u2013 about 50mg a cup \u2013 are misleading. Consumers at risk of caffeine toxicity, including pregnant women, children and those with liver disease, may unknowingly consume excessive caffeine from a single cup of espresso coffee.\nThey suggest that the large variability in caffeine content could be due to a number of factors, such as:\nthe amount of coffee used to prepare the espresso\ndifferences between batches of coffee beans\ndifferent procedures used to roast the beans (such as high-temperature short roast and low-temperature long roast)\ngrinding conditions\ncoffee-making process (such as the temperature of the water or steam, and ratio of coffee to water or steam)\nThey highlighted that since many coffee houses prepare larger-volume coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, by diluting a single or double shot of espresso, further study on these products is needed. New data are needed to provide labelling information \u201cwith attention to bean variety, preparation and barista methods\u201d.\nConclusion\nThis analysis provides a useful snapshot of the caffeine content in a range of espresso coffees bought on the high street. Although the study was carried out in only one city, its finding that there is a wide variation in caffeine content is likely to apply to coffee bought in other UK cafes. It found that the caffeine content of most products was higher than normally expected and it is possible that some coffee drinkers may unknowingly consume large amounts of caffeine. In some cases, a single serving may place people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine at risk.\nThe researchers only looked at caffeine levels in espresso coffee, which may not be standard preference in the UK. Although they point out that other types of coffee drinks are based on espresso shots, further analysis of the caffeine content of the more popular, larger drinks is needed. The researchers carried out their analysis only once, without any replication, and the possibility of error in the chemical procedure used to analyse caffeine levels should be noted.\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should take care with how much caffeine they consume. Current advice from the FSA is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day, due to concerns about potential associations with low birth weight and miscarriage. However, the risks from occasionally exceeding this recommended intake are thought to be low.\nThe FSA states that the average daily caffeine intake during pregnancy is already believed to be below 200mg. However, in light of the current study\u2019s findings, further study investigation of the caffeine intake of pregnant women and other vulnerable groups would be valuable.\nThe researchers in this study say that a cup of coffee is assumed to contain 50mg of caffeine, but the FSA advises that a mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg caffeine, and a mug of filter coffee contains around 140mg of caffeine.\nConsumers should also be aware that there is caffeine in other foods including tea, chocolate and some soft drinks. Caffeine is also found in some cold and flu remedies, and pregnant women in particular are advised to check with a pharmacist or midwife before they take any such remedies.\n"}]]}
