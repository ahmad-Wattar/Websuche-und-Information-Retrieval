To understand rap-rock and better appreciate the genre\u2019s essential songs , we first need to look back at the early days of hip-hop to chart its rise in popularity and eventual acceptance by the rock community.\nRap-Rock's Origins: Hip-Hop Is Born (Early 1980s)\nWhen hip-hop blossomed in the early 1980s, it couldn\u2019t have been more diametrically opposed to rock music. By that time, mainstream rock had long since matured beyond its early counterculture roots in the 1960s into a hugely respected moneymaking industry. By comparison, the first rappers were just kids from New York City having fun at parties by rhyming over records. Though rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2019s origins can be traced back to African-American innovators, such as Chuck Berry, the most successful rock bands consisted of white performers. But as hip-hop gained in stature during the \u201880s, the genre\u2019s biggest acts remained black artists, representing an alternative to rock music that wasn\u2019t just stylistic but also racial as well.\n\"Walk This Way\" Sets the Stage for Rap-Rock (Mid 1980s)\nAs often happens when a new, exciting musical subgenre emerges, there were as many who embraced this new sound as there were those who tried to dismiss it as a fad or, worse, a marginal art form that only appealed to inner-city blacks.\nBut as rap continued to establish a commercial beachhead, such biases started to melt away. One of the first bellwethers of a societal change was in 1986, when Run-D.M.C., one of the era's most respected rap groups, teamed with \u201870s rock band Aerosmith for a remake of the band\u2019s hit song \u201cWalk This Way.\u201d Tellingly, the video showed Aerosmith and Run-D.M.C. in separate recording studios performing their own brands of music, but once Run-D.M.C. start rapping the lyrics to \u201cWalk This Way,\u201d Aerosmith\u2019s lead singer smashes through the adjoining wall to whale the chorus, signaling both a literal and metaphoric merging of hard rock and rap. The song introduced Run-D.M.C. to the larger white audience and, interestingly enough, also revitalized Aerosmith's then-floundering career. But just as importantly, the single foretold the formation of a vital new musical subgenre: rap-rock.\nThe Beastie Boys and Public Enemy Bring the Noise (Late 1980s)\nIn the following years, rap and rock continued a tentative courtship. Specifically, rap groups found a kinship with the antiestablishment vibe and sonic intensity of metal. The same year as Run-D.M.C.\u2019s \u201cWalk This Way\u201d hit the charts, a white Brooklyn hip-hop trio called the Beastie Boys released Licensed to Ill, a head-banging party album that enjoyed multi-platinum sales. Later, hip-hop\u2019s greatest band of the late \u201880s, Public Enemy, sampled Slayer on a track off their landmark 1988 album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Further cementing their affinity for metal, Public Enemy would team with Anthrax in 1991 for a remake of PE's single \"Bring the Noise.\"\nRap-Rock Goes Mainstream (Early 1990s)\nThe dawn of the \u201890s saw two interesting metal-rap hybrids reach sizable audiences. Art-metal band Faith No More featured a lyricist, Mike Patton, who mixed traditional singing with rapping, most notably on their 1990 hit, \u201cEpic.\u201d And acclaimed Los Angeles rapper Ice-T earned notoriety with his hard-rock band Body Count, whose 1992 self-titled album included the controversial song \u201cCop Killer,\u201d which inspired protests across the country.\nAs rap music became the nation\u2019s predominant popular music during the early \u201890s, rock groups continued integrating hip-hop conventions into their sound. Rage Against the Machine , led by outspoken singer Zack de la Rocha, were inspired by the political hip-hop of groups like Public Enemy, retaining the militant rhetoric while adding incendiary solos from guitarist Tom Morello.\nAt the same time, the Beastie Boys were looking to distance themselves from the raunchy frat-boy antics of Licensed to Ill and decided to return to their first love: live instruments. Starting out as a hardcore band, the group incorporated punk\u2019s do-it-yourself aesthetic on 1992\u2019s Check Your Head, resulting in a groundbreaking record that captured suburban skateboard culture with a goofy melding of rap, rock, funk and thrash.\nBetween Rage\u2019s angry protest rock and the Beastie Boys\u2019 laidback intertwining of rock and hip-hop sensibilities, the time was right for a full-fledged movement. Rap-rock was ready for the spotlight.\nRap-Rock's Golden Age (Late 1990s)\nIf rap-rock\u2019s breakthrough can be pinpointed to one specific moment, it would probably be the release of Limp Bizkit \u2019s Significant Other in the summer of 1999. The Florida band\u2019s second album, featuring the smash single \u201cNookie,\u201d sold over 7 million copies by drawing from Rage\u2019s metallic aggression and the Beastie Boys\u2019 skateboard-slacker attitude. Sporting a cameo from Method Man, a member of the hardcore underground hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, Significant Other signaled the commercial viability of rap-rock.\nAfter Significant Other\u2019s success, rap-rock bands had an easier time storming mainstream radio. First, California rock band Papa Roach hit the scene in 2000 with their single \u201cLast Resort.\u201d A few months later, Linkin Park , another band from California, released Hybrid Theory. Though Limp Bizkit had trouble matching Significant Other\u2019s success on subsequent albums and Papa Roach began focusing primarily on rock songs, Linkin Park has remained the most visible rap-rock group of the 21st century, even collaborating with rapper Jay-Z on the 2004 album Collision Course.\nThe State of Rap-Rock Today\nBut now that rap-rock has become a prominent subgenre, it is currently experiencing a lack of new talents to keep the scene thriving. Part of this may be to blame on hip-hop\u2019s recent dip in popularity. After being the dominant musical style for 15 years, rap has lost market share in comparison to pop and country, consequently making rap-rock feel less exciting of a musical alternative. Much like hip-hop helped restore the vitality of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll in the early 1980s, it will be interesting to see if a new style will emerge to reanimate both rock and rap.\nMore Rap-Rock\n"}, {"score": 1349.7592, "uuid": "24ee8671-277d-5457-8de2-2b26dabe4f6b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1006wb-47-06861", "target_hostname": "jonouchiloser.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://jonouchiloser.deviantart.com/journal/poll/2237582/", "page_rank": 1.3027384e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "JonouchiLoser&#x27;s poll: Pop - <em>Rock</em> - <em>Rap</em> ?", "snippet": "* Dec 10, 2011 <em>Which</em> one you would be of these?( * Nov 24, 2011 Are you bored to my car pics yet ?? * Nov 17, 2011 Have you watched me at month 10 <em>or</em> 11 ? i know, this ones hard) * Oct 9, 2011 Traditional <em>or</em> Diginal way <em>is</em> <em>better</em>? * Sep 17, 2011 are you living in a country where <em>is</em> earthquakes?", "explanation": null, "document": "29 deviants said Rock `n Roll !!!\n14%\n5 deviants said Pop the Best!\n8%\n3 deviants said Rap whole life.\nDevious Comments\n"}, {"score": 1060.7938, "uuid": "0b7b2366-e3d6-5a1f-8e2a-609957e5460c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1006wb-36-03535", "target_hostname": "jonouchiloser.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://jonouchiloser.deviantart.com/journal/poll/2334056/", "page_rank": 1.3027973e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "JonouchiLoser&#x27;s poll: Traditional <em>or</em> Diginal way <em>is</em> <em>better</em>?", "snippet": "* Nov 17, 2011 Have you watched me at month 10 <em>or</em> 11 ? i know, this ones hard) * Oct 9, 2011 Traditional <em>or</em> Diginal way <em>is</em> <em>better</em>? * Sep 17, 2011 are you living in a country where <em>is</em> earthquakes? * Sep 3, 2011 Have you watched DisneyPixarCars movies?", "explanation": null, "document": "Traditional or Diginal way is better?\n68%\nWell, if you did, Ill hug you!\nIcon done by = DemonVenus\nmany people are side of both^^\n--\nyeah,i think its not really matter if you got some\nfun with it^^\n* Thamaire Oct 9, 2011\nI started as a Pro traditional but in the end I think both have their peeks.

The article examines eight ways in which rap music artists support the industry unlike their non-rap artist counterparts.\nMusic Production Is One Of The Keys\nCollaborate. Collaborations are king in the rap music world, and according to the research, collaborations sell better and are more interesting to the listening audience than tracks (and albums) that feature a single artist. By combining artists, DMN argues that producers can \u201cshare\u201d fans and get more reliable and effective exposure for up-and-coming acts.\nDJs count. According to DMN, DJs are critical to exposing a new artist to the listening audience. They also create a market for rap and hip-hop music by creating mixtapes that are distributed at no cost to the listener. While some may mistake the mixtape as an outlet for material that\u2019s not good enough to be put on an album, the mixtape freebies actually create an ongoing music feed to the audience and increase demand for the artists\u2019 music.\nMore work means more music. In the past musicians would work intensely for a relatively short period of time to create enough usable tracks for an album. Today\u2019s top musicians (in more genres than just rap) work all the time. Lil Wayne and Lady Gaga are notable examples of musicians who record daily. Not every track is worth putting on an album; in fact, only a few tracks make it to the album stage, but the artist creates a new product every day. This generates a lot of material that would otherwise not be created, or would be thrown away. Today\u2019s artists give away a lot of their music. For example, Lil Wayne has given away more music than most traditional musicians make in their entire careers. The benefits? Audiences have become very familiar with Lil Wayne and reward him by buying his albums when he does produce one. Another benefit? Lil Wayne can release albums at will. He has enough material available to put out a collection whenever the timing is right.\nRappers Find A Lot of Local Support Because rap musicians regularly pay tribute to where they came from, they get a lot of support from fans in those areas. By building a base of support \u2013 which includes regular mentions of the places they\u2019re familiar with \u2013 rappers can count on receptive audiences for music sales and tours.\nIn my next post, I\u2019ll look at the other four reasons DMN says that rap musicians are better at the business aspects of music than artists who work in other genres.\nPhoto Credit: gailjadehamilton , via Flickr\n"}, {"score": 1182.4622, "uuid": "f947149f-a7f4-5d98-a51a-5d7a181521b6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-74-06169", "target_hostname": "thehoopdoctors.com", "target_uri": "http://thehoopdoctors.com/online2/2011/03/better-jimmer-rap-teach-me-how-to-jimmer-or-tj-fredettes-amazing/", "page_rank": 1.177334e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Better</em> Jimmer <em>Rap</em>: \u201cTeach Me How To Jimmer\u201d <em>or</em> TJ Fredette\u2019s \u201cAmazing\u201d?", "snippet": "Fredette, who <em>is</em> a former player turned rapper, with his Jimmer themed hit \u201cAmazing\u201d: <em>Which</em> <em>is</em> your favorite?", "explanation": null, "document": "Better Jimmer Rap: \u201cTeach Me How To Jimmer\u201d or TJ Fredette\u2019s \u201cAmazing\u201d?\nMarch 21, 2011 \u2013 Allen Moll\nWe here at TheHoopDoctors.com aren\u2019t always about excellent on point analysis of the college, high school,\u00a0and pro game.

Photograph by Brian Cohen | Show Photo\nFeatures\nRock to rap: Five on the rise\nNick Keppler | Wednesday, February 22, 2012\n.\nEntrepreneurs , Music , Talent\nThere was once a time when every regional music scene was supposedly worth keeping an ear on. It was the early '90s. Back then, a handful of acts who'd been playing clubs in Seattle, a rain-soaked city in America's back end, suddenly and en mass became the most talked-about bands in the world, obliterating the notion most important musicians were from or resettled in New York or Los Angles. Any scrappy bunch of kids might be the next Nirvana and anywhere where Xeroxed flyers were stapled to lampposts might be the next Seattle in the era of dingy alt-rock.\nNow, you have to question the importance of a local scenes for the sake of nurturing potential break-out talent. A few coastal cities have reclaimed their statuses as music meccas, sucking talent from elsewhere. Plus, one stand-out performance at a shindig like SXSW or Bonnaroo can mean more than years of accruing a local following.\nBut it's still possible to go into a club in a place like Pittsburgh and see an act on the rise. The following five artists, who all make Pittsburgh their home, have had noteworthy successes and make us feel like we did back in the era, when anywhere, including Pittsburgh, felt like it could be hiding someone relevant.\nJoy Ike\nIn 2008, Joy Ike's brother fell into a coma after a four-year battle with cancer, inspiring the Pitt grad to quit her publishing job and turn to music fulltime. She's since released three albums in as many years and both the lush, clear instrumentation and decisively deep lyrics heard on them are not the stuff of an amateur. With a voice as smooth as a baby's skin and a confidence on the piano that recalls a young Tori Amos, Ike was voted Pittsburgh City Paper's \"Best Solo Artist\" in every year since she quit her day job. Recently the 27-year-old singer/songwriter received a shout out on NPR's \"All Things Considered,\" a segment in which the show's interns shared their favorite songs. \"Joy finds a way to tackle some of the most disarming emotions of the human condition while still managing to leave her listeners with feelings of optimism and hope,\" said a young, aspiring Michele Norris.\nDonora\nYou might think Donora's \"I Think I Like You\" could be the most polite and unobtrusive sentiment ever put into a pop song, but then stick around the band's MySpace page to check out another tune, simply called \"Shhh.\" \"I like it when we whisper / I like it when we are quiet with one another,\" coos lead singer Casey Hanner. The trio's sound is melodic, approachable and understated, but it is within that simplicity that they have found their personality. They write love songs for the apologetically shy and polite. In 2006, a song from the band's demo made it to the finals of a MySpace-sponsored music contents, leading to selections from their self-titled 2008 debut being featured in TV shows. After a few years dedicated to families and school, they are taking another crack at pop stardom with Boyfriends, Girlfriends. And no, they are not from the Town of Donora, but did name themselves after it after spotting it on a road sign. Hey, band names, are hard to think up.\n1, 2, 3\nRepresenting Pittsburgh in the psychedelic revival that has made stars out of MGMT and The Essex Green is 1, 2, 3. Like MGMT, the band manages to pull off the full, fuzzy, occasionally epic sound of psychedelia with just two men--drummer/multi-instrumentalist Josh Sickels and guitarist Nic Snyder--whose exasperated, angst-driven vocals are potent enough to keep up with the band's large sound and brisk sense of rhythm. The two previously worked together in the successful local band The Takeover U.K.\n1, 2, 3's debut album, New Heaven, was released last summer on Brooklyn-based Frechkiss Records and managed to pass through quite a few indie rock blogs. The track \"Scared But Not That Scared\" made it into an episode of MTV's \"Teen Wolf.\" (Believe it or not, it is still possible to discover new music through MTV.) The band tours frequently, often stomping through New York City, but keep up with them at 123land.net for Pittsburgh dates. (The two have admitted their moniker presents a bit of a search engine problem.)\nKellee Maize\nEntrepreneurship, as much as sheer talent, has been a key to success in music since the collapse of the traditional recording industry. Rapper Kellee Maize has shown she has the self-promotion and distribution skills to make it in this brave new world and, let's face; it was only through self-initiative that anyone was going to take white girl from Central Pennsylvania seriously in the world of hip-hop. Maize, the one-time events and promotions director at Pittsburgh City Paper, has propelled her videos to a total of 3.5 million views on YouTube and she has amassed more than 600,000 downloads on various sites, putting her at the top of certain genre charts on Amazon and Frost Wire. She has also performed at Bonnaroo and is equally bold and flashy with her party-happy, dancey style of hip-hop. She, of course, has recorded the requisite hometown shout out song, \"City of Champions\" and skillfully found a way to put Pittsburgh's place as the \"Most Livable City\" in the U.S. in the rankings of The Economist into verse.\nBig Snow Big Thaw\nWe're suckers for regionalism in music, so it's touching how closely the young, hipster-ish trio Big Snow Big Thaw follow the sounds and traditions of toe-tapping Appalachian folk. Their lyrics are full of mentions of mountains, rivers and loss and their instrumentation consists of acoustic guitar, banjo and light percussion. All in all, their songs sound as if they could come seeping from a back-porch get-together in a Depression-era coal mining community. What's even better is they sound sincere about it; an ironic, detached approach would never yield so much bouncy energy. The band frequently scores opening slots at Club Caf\u00e9 and Brillobox but recently much of their effort has gone into recording, resulting in a stunner of a double-EP (one disc called Spring, the other Winter) and a full-length debut they are readying to make available in a few months.\nSee more of Nick Keppler's work at www.nickkeppler.com\nPhotographs of Joy Ike, Donora, Kellee Maize, and Big Snow, Big Thaw copyright Brian Cohen\nGive us your email and we will give you our weekly online magazine.

Today we start with Katherine, our Pop and Urban expert.\nRecord of the Year\nWho Will Win: \"Rolling in the Deep\" - Adele\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Firework\" - Katy Perry\nAdele will probably take Record of the Year for \u0093Rolling in the Deep,\u0094 because it is one of the most popular songs this year. But I\u0092d like to see Katy Perry win so I can hear her give an acceptance where she doesn\u0092t thank her husband in a baby voice.\nAlbum of the Year\nWho Will Win: 21 - Adele\nWho I Think Should Win: Speak Now - Taylor Swift\nAdele\u0092s 21 will win Album of the Year.\u00a0 This record contains three number 1 singles and is the longest-running number 1 album since The Bodyguard soundtrack.\u00a0 Although I must say her competition in this category is pretty weak.\u00a0 Who decided on the nominees again?\nSong of the Year\nWho Will Win: \"Grenade\" - Bruno Mars\nWho I Think Should Win: \"The Cave\" - Mumford & Sons\nIf Bruno Mars\u0092 songwriting skills are awarded, hopefully he\u0092ll be encouraged to keep writing and stop singing.\u00a0 Mumford & Sons should win just to keep Adele from sweeping this year\u0092s Grammys\u0085 and because they are a great band.\nBest New Artist\nWho Will Win: Bon Iver\nWho I Think Should Win: The Band Perry\nI\u0092m placing my bet that Best New Artist will go to indie favorite Bon Iver. It would be amusing to see the presenter say their name incorrectly.\u00a0 I think The Band Perry should win because they broke barriers with \u0093If I Die Young,\u0094 being one of a few country artists to cross over into mainstream Top 40 this year.\nBest Pop Solo Performance\nWho Will Win: \"You and I\" - Lady Gaga\nWho I Think Should Win: Anyone but Adele\nLady Gaga will win with \u0093You and I\u0094 because it wouldn\u0092t be an award show without Gaga receiving all of the attention.\nBest Pop Solo Performance shouldn\u0092t go to Adele because being recognized for your performance would actually require performing and not canceling tour dates.\u00a0 I\u0092d also be interested to see how the Recording Academy would fill airtime if Adele gets laryngitis the day before the Grammys and bails.\nBest Pop Duo/Group Performance\nWho Will Win: \"Body & Soul\" - Tony Bennett & Amy Winehouse\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Moves Like Jagger\" - Maroon 5 with Christina Aguilera\nWhile I detest the song \u0093Moves Like Jagger\u0094 (and Adam Levine), this is the only true pop song nominated in this category.\u00a0 When did The Black Keys become a pop band?\u00a0 I think Tony Bennett and Amy Winehouse will take this one by default because it would be insensitive for her not to win.\nBest Pop Vocal Album\nWho Will Win: 21 - Adele\nWho I Think Should Win: 21 - Adele\nAgain, Adele should only take Best Pop Vocal Album because her competition is weak.\u00a0 No more Gaga or Bruno, please.\nBest Rock Performance\nWho Will Win: \"Walk\" - Foo Fighters\nWho I Think Should Win: Anyone other than Coldplay, but preferably Mumford & Sons\nMumford & Sons should win for Best Rock Performance because they put on a pretty badass live show.\u00a0 But if we are now opening up the rock category to artists with banjos, can Taylor Swift be nominated for \u0093Mean?\u0094\nBest Hard Rock/Metal Performance\nWho Will Win: \u0093Curl of the Burl\u0094 - Mastodon\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Public Enemy No. 1\" - Megadeth\nI want Megadeth to win simply because I think they are the only band in this category with the exception of Mastodon who qualify as metal. Are the Foo Fighters really hard rockers?\u00a0 Just sayin\nBest Rock Song\nWho Will Win: \"The Cave\" - Mumford & Sons\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Lotus Flower\" - Radiohead\nI want Radiohead\u0092s \u0093Lotus Flower\u0094 to take Best Rock Song so we can see Thom Yorke do a crazy, spastic dance when he accepts the Grammy like he does in the music video.\nBest Rock Album\nWho Will Win: Wasting Light - Foo Fighters\nWho I Think Should Win: Come Around Sundown - Kings of Leon\nFoo Fighters will probably win Best Rock Album, but they will take everything in the rock category.\u00a0 If I had it my way, Kings of Leon would win.\u00a0 Even though Caleb Followill would exit the stage halfway through their acceptance speech to throw up, my coworkers would finally give this album a chance.\nBest Alternative Music Album\nWho Will Win: The Kings of Limbs - Radiohead\nWho I Think Should Win: Bon Iver - Bon Iver\nI think Radiohead will win just because they are Radiohead.\u00a0 I want Bon Iver to win because this is the only rock category they should be allowed to win.\u00a0 They are an alternative/folk band, not a rock band.\nBest R&B Performance\nWho Will Win: \"Is This Love\" - Corinne Bailey Rae\nWho I Think Should Win: \"You Are\" - Charlie Wilson\nI\u0092m rooting for Charlie Wilson to take Best R&B performance with \u0093You Are.\u0094\u00a0 He\u0092s been nominated for six Grammys to date, but has never won.\u00a0 I think Corinne will win because people seem to like her the most.\nBest R&B Song\nWho Will Win: \"Fool For You\" - Cee Lo Green & Melanie Fiona\nWho I Think Should Win: \u0093Far Away\u0094 - Marsha Ambrosius\nAlthough Cee Lo will win Best R&B song, here are a few reasons why he shouldn\u0092t: 1) He would have no problem writing a crude (yet amazing) song about how he feels about the winner. Then he has a chance to win next year. 2) He will be wearing a crazier outfit than the peacock costume that he wore at last year\u0092s Grammys. 3) If his duets keep winning awards, he might be encouraged to record a new track with Gwyneth Paltrow.\nBest R&B Album\nWho Will Win: F.A.M.E. - Chris Brown\nWho I Think Should Win: F.A.M.E. - Chris Brown\nChris Brown\u0092s The F.A.M.E. is a shoe-in for Best R&B Album.\u00a0 The record not only contains the most hits, it is my favorite out of the nominees.\u00a0 However, I think it would be slightly amusing if someone other than Chris Brown wins so we could see him lose his temper.\nBest Rap Performance\nWho Will Win: \"Otis\" - Jay-Z & Kanye West\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Black and Yellow\" - Wiz Khalifa\nJay-Z and Kanye will probably take Best Rap Performance, but I\u0092d like to see Wiz Khalifa win.\u00a0 Then Amber Rose wouldn\u0092t be the only trophy Wiz won over Kanye West.\nBest Rap/Sung Collaboration\nWho Will Win: \"Party\" - Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Andre 3000\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Motivation\" - Kelly Rowland featuring Lil Wayne\nKelly Rowland should win just so we can see her be better than Beyonc\u00e9 for once.\nBest Rap Song\nWho Will Win: \"Otis\" - Jay-Z & Kanye West\nWho I Think Should Win: \"I Need a Doctor\" - Dr. Dre., Eminem & Sklyar Grey\nI\u0092ll be just as upset about Jay-Z and Kanye winning Best Rap Song as I am that Dr. Dre hasn\u0092t released Detox yet.\nBest Rap Album\nWho Will Win: Watch The Throne - Jay-Z & Kanye West\nWho I Think Should Win: Pink Friday - Nicki Minaj\nThe odds are in Kanye\u0092s favor for Best Rap Album.\u00a0 I think Nicki should be recognized in this category even though she is the underdog. Pink Friday is just an overall better album than Watch the Throne.\nBest Country Solo Performance\nWho Will Win: \"Honey Bee\" - Blake Shelton\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Mean\" - Taylor Swift\nI want Taylor to win just so we can see her act really surprised.\u00a0 She also deserves the chance to thank her cat, Meredith.\nBest Country Duo/Group Performance\nWho Will Win:\u00a0\"You and Tequila\" \u0096 Kenny Chesney with Grace Potter\nWho I Think Should Win: \"Don\u0092t You Wanna Stay\" - Jason Aldean with Kelly Clarkson\nBoth songs that have a shot at winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance feature a non-country artist, which is a little twisted.\u00a0 While I\u0092d like to see a Jason/Kelly win, I think Kenny and Grace will take this one.\nBest Country Song\nWho Will Win: \"Mean\" - Taylor Swift\nWho I Think Should Win:\u00a0\"Mean\"- Taylor Swift\nThe Grammy\u00a0for Best Country Song will sit nicely next to Taylor\u0092s AMA for Artist of the Year and her CMA for Entertainer of the Year.\nBest Country Album\nWho Will Win: My Kinda Party - Jason Aldean\nWho I Think Should Win: Speak Now - Taylor Swift\nI think Taylor Swift should win\u0097obviously.\u00a0 Did I mention that I\u0092m upset she wasn\u0092t nominated for Album of the Year?\n"}, {"score": 1042.464, "uuid": "f6d1d401-808d-5e2d-941a-b74ef6c62363", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1100tw-48-06528", "target_hostname": "www.nzpwi.co.nz", "target_uri": "http://www.nzpwi.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=7295&Itemid=112", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "G5: Victory Road, <em>Rap</em> vs. <em>Rock</em>, Chris Jericho &amp; More - NZPWI", "snippet": "Home Blog Gimme Five Gimme Five G5: Victory Road, <em>Rap</em> vs. <em>Rock</em>, Chris Jericho &amp; More Victory Road <em>is</em> behind us.

TNA Victory Road is all said and done. Did you enjoy the show? Match of the night? Dud of the night? MVP?\nKirsty:\nVictory Road was one of those ppvs I thought \"ehh, I'll give it a miss\" and am now wishing I hadn't. It sounds like some pretty cool stuff went down, further cementing Bobby Roode's heel status and I wish now I'd seen the Jeff Hardy vs. Kurt Angle match. I may have to find another way to watch the show.\nLuke:\nN/A\nDion:\nI did enjoy the PPV, but the main event was just so anti-climactic and flat which was really disappointing.\nI've always preached that as wrestling fans, we need TNA to succeed, but I just feel the product still needs a big kick in the pants.\nBlake:\nI must admit, I didn't see the event; couldn't even see highlights, stoopid YouTube. However, I have seen the results, and I must say that I did pretty freakin' good in my predictions, which means that TNA did nothing more than an expected PPV. Angle beat Hardy in a nice surprise, but that was the only prediction I didn't get. A random TV Title match between Robbie E and Devon? And Devon won?! Do they even want to be the new kids on the block? Devon and Bully are at the time in their career where they should be putting new stars over. I'm glad Sting at least knows that.\nSteph:\nI missed it. This makes me sad in my pants. Because if I'm going to fork out for WrestleMania (and let's admit it, I will) I may as well start paying for PPVs that are interesting.\nScott:\nI sat in stunned disbelief at how good Jeff Hardy vs. Kurt Angle was. That match goes straight into contention for match of the year candidate for me, not least because I wasn't expecting such a thrilling edge-of-the-seat experience from two men who, frankly, are both past their prime. Shame the rest of the card didn't match that bout.\nStevie:\nEnjoyable show. Match of the night for me was the tag title match. Some great moments, like Samoa Joe just wandering away from a Crimson aerial move that had us cracking up, and some classic old school booking - plus Matt Morgan insulting Crimson in a way we haven't seen on PG TV in some time. I also liked how Storm is looking very strong going in to his title match next month. Hardy/Angle was decent - I'm not sure why people are rating it so highly though, I just remember getting tired of Jeff only having the Twist of Fate in his arsenal to knock Angle down over and over. I enjoyed the main event ending too, it made me feel awkward and really got Roode all the heat he seemed to be lacking at the beginning of the match.\nDavid:\nVictory Road has traditionally been a bit underwhelming, but I think TNA delivered quite well this year. And with SKY dropping the price by $5, this was well worth buying. I was really impressed with Kurt Angle and Jeff Hardy - those two have had their ups and downs in TNA over the years, but couldn't have been more on-form if they tried. My match of the year, thus far. Dud goes to the Knockouts, which is a shame, but Gail and Madison seem to have approximately zero chemistry at all. MVP is Bobby Roode, as the main selling point of the pay-per-view, even if all the post-match stuff was more than a little confusing.\n2. John Cena\u2019s Rap versus The Rock Concert: Which was better? And how did both shows compare to the originals from 2003 and 2005?\nKirsty:\nCena's was edgier. Rocky actually seemed a bit nervous to start off with, but flowed better as he got into it. He was funnier, Cena was edgier - can't really pick a favourite. I'm just loving this whole angle!\nLuke:\nI thought both segments were awesome. I loved seeing John Cena in his old school persona, with the music and throwback. His rap was edgy and fresh and made me remember why I liked John Cena back in 2003 and 2004. The Rock Concert was great, not as good as the original ones in 2003 but he was a heel then. I do think that the closing part with \"We Will Rock You\" was overkill, perhaps because he couldn't even keep up with the lyrics. Either way, I am thoroughly enjoying this feud and cannot wait until they both collide on April 1st.\nDion:\nI really enjoyed both segments - Cena's throwback to seven years ago was fun. You can't beat the originals, though. The crowd seemed to really enjoy Rocky's wee concert. That said, I'd rather see these two face to face in the ring building the tension.\nBlake:\nThis 'music battle' was nothing more than a battle of nostalgia. Although Cena proved strong, it was clear from the get-go that Rocky would win. Rock did improve on his previous concerts, but the star power was just not as strong. First Rock Concert: Hurricane and Steve Austin. Second Rock Concert: Gillberg and Goldberg. Third Rock Concert?: Nobody. Cena never needed people to be there when he was rapping, so he had the advantage there. We were treated to the Rock being the final entertainer of the evening, so we're more likely to remember him than Cena, but at an individual level, they were closer than most of you will probably remember. In the end, I do have to give the win to the ego-bloating has-been. On a night of nostalgia, the man with more experience was simply able to perform better.\nSteph:\nOh gods, just end it now. Vintage Thugonomics Cena completed owned boring, borderline-homophobic cheap-pop Rock. But I have not seen the originals, so I can't really put them in context.\nScott:\nRock's learnt a new guitar chord, but has to stoop to \"your momma\" jokes. Cena shows it's all in how you angle your chin and make each word count. C'mon, Rocky, this is getting embarrasing.\nStevie:\nThe \"We Will Rock You\" thing was pretty embarrassing. But apart from that, The Rock is still worlds ahead of Cena when it comes to entertaining. Cena's rap was passable but didn't feel very natural any more. I oddly felt uncomfortable listening to him be so disrespectful and non-PC after playing this kiddie hero for so long. I guess it just keeps reinforcing the fact that \"Respect\" needs to be taken off his mantra, as it's not the reality of his character. The Rock was The Rock - fun, natural and out to have a good time. His character is that he's a hilarious dick - Cena's is that he's an inconsistent, angry boy. I know who's side I'm on.\nDavid:\nJohn Cena wins again, with a load of impact in very little time. His wasn't quite in the same line as when he performed \"Bad, Bad Man\" on RAW back in the day, but as far as the Rock Concerts go, the original was definitely better.\n3. Chris Jericho shocked CM Punk on RAW last week, revealing that he knew Punk\u2019s father was an alcoholic. What are your thoughts on the latest development in the Jericho and Punk feud?\nKirsty:\nI'm glad that Jericho is pulling out the big guns. It's way past time that someone challenged Punk over his Straight Edge philosophy - he shoved it down our necks a few years back. The comments about Punk's father are no revelation - ROH fans from way back will know because Punk talked about it himself, so it's always been out there. You've got two of the best talkers in this feud - make the most of them. And they are.\nLuke:\nJericho just turned the heat up on the feud. What a pipebomb! I think he based his promo off of a classic CM Punk promo from Ring of Honor where Punk talks about his father's alcoholism. I love where this is going and I think as far as wrestling goes at WrestleMania, this will be the show stopper.\nDion:\nBloody brilliant. That's the first time we've seen CM Punk rattled and vulnerable, and it brings a whole new element to this feud. Definitely an awesome move to what will be a great match.\nBlake:\nI'm glad that we're finally given a reason to care about this feud. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see these two battle in a 60 minute Ironman match as much as the next mark, but WrestleMania is meant to be the culmination of stories. There has barely been one here. Also, this should have happened about a month ago. What happened to great feuds? Oh yeah, script writers.\nSteph:\nI am EITHER aghast at bringing such a sensitive family issue into the ring, OR totally stoked that two of the best workers in WWE are getting a hard, gritty storyline. Depending on how smarkish I feel at the time.\nScott:\nLove it. It shows that Jericho realises he's outmatched when it comes to things he's normally best at - confidence, and wrestling ability. So he has to go for the cheap shot, the personal angle, to get on top of the champion. This plays into both men's characters perfectly, and just makes me want to see the match even more.\nStevie:\nBrilliant. We needed to see a vulnerable side to Punk's character and after hearing the audience get behind him after Jericho's promo, it's doing exactly what it needs to. This is what I'm looking forward to most at 'Mania. It doesn't matter that this has been brought up in the Indys, if anything that helps reinforce the reality of it all to people. It's classic Jericho too, as Scott said.\nDavid:\nOdd that Punk seemed so surprised, seeing as ROH watchers know this stuff. Seriously though, good. John Cena vs. The Rock has gotten a little too one-sided for me, so it's nice to see Punk and Jericho on a dangerously level playing field as WrestleMania comes ever closer.\n4. A-Train is rumoured to be on his way back to WWE. Do you have any interest in seeing him back in the ring? If not, are there any other former WWE stars you\u2019re holding out to see return?\nKirsty:\nNot much interest, no. I never really cared for him. As for who I'd like to see return, there are several, but top of the list would be John Morrison and Ken Anderson.\nLuke:\nI enjoyed A-Train's final run's in WWE so I am excited to see the big man back. I hope he is allowed to use his Benard Bomb though! That move is sick!\nDion:\nI was never a massive fan, but he's been doing well in Japan. It'll be interesting to see how much he's improved, and hopefully he'll be able to connect a lot better with U.S. audiences this time around.\nBlake:\nI'm pretty sure that any of my hundreds of loyal fans (you guys need to find a name for yourselves! And nothing like the MizFits X_X ), could write this section for me. Key words are \"has-been\", \"spotlight\", and \"ego\". If A-Train is willing to put guys over, he's still young enough for helping maintain the upper-midcard. If he just wants to keep jumping for the Championship, he shouldn't come back. Unless, he wins it by the end of next year; you have an expiration date Mr. Albert, and your time is nearly up.\nSteph:\nI have not encountered A-Train! But I'm always interested in Returning Hero storylines and how they play (heel-tease like Jericho? Predictable yet still awesome like Taker?) - I'm just not invested enough in anyone out there returning, especially now I can still see them on TV when they sign with TNA.\nScott:\nFrom what little I've seen of him over recent years, Albert's been on fire in Japan. He's in great shape and seemingly a great mental attitude. WWE's current big men are either getting to the end of their careers (Kane and Big Show) or are severely lacking in the charisma department (Ezekiel Jackson, anyone?). Matt Bloom will do well coming back to WWE, I'm sure.\nStevie:\nI always enjoyed his work and his Japan stint as Giant Bernard improved him no end. I look forward to what they'll be doing with him when he returns.\nDavid:\nHe just seems like such an odd choice to me. Sure, Giant Bernard's doing well enough in Japan, but this is a guy who spent heaps of his WWE career as the Hip-Hop Hippo. If they're looking to bring back a former star on good terms with the company who's been spending a bit of time in Japan, why not MVP? He'd have more name-recognition with today's audience, too.\n5. Evan Bourne's 60-day wellness policy violation suspension has finished. Are you looking forward to seeing Evan back in WWE? Is there even still a place for Bourne on the current WWE roster?\nKirsty:\nI like Evan Bourne, he's an exciting aerial competitor, but he clearly has some issues with the rules of the game. I hope he gets it together, it'd be a shame to see him go.\nLuke:\nN/A\nDion:\nDefinitely - Bourne is brilliant to watch in the ring. So much electricity and excitement and much, much more left in him. Hopefully bigger things on the horizon for him, too.\nBlake:\nThey've tried pushing Bourne in the singles division and then realised he had no personality. They've tried pushing Bourne in the tag team division, but he went and got high... twice. Until the end of the year, Bourne should not be mid-card or even low-card. Bourne should be enhancement talent and nothing more. If he sticks around and cleans up, they can begin working on him again, maybe as the face of a freshly launched cruiserweight division.\nSteph:\nI always look forward to Evan, especially when he's placed in a squash match so he can really demonstrate his ability to fall down. Seriously. To sound like a broken record, though, I think he'd do better in TNA's X-Division where he'd have a chance to really shine. And I'm a little annoyed he screwed up Air Boom because I had great hopes that something good was going to happen with the tag belts.\nScott:\nI give him sixty more days until he's out of there entirely.\nStevie:\nDude does take a hit better than anybody else in WWE. I used to be a supporter and I loved the Air Boom team. But the guy screwed up twice in short succession, ruining a bunch of stories and Kofi's push. I'm not really feeling it any more.\nDavid:\nI've enjoyed Bourne when I've seen him on WWE TV, but like Sin Cara, I haven't really missed him while he's been gone. Kingston's managed to do well enough without Evan on his side, too, so while I'll be fine to have him back on TV, I don't quite know where he fits in the scheme of things any more.\nUser Comments\nPlease enter your comment below.

The music \"is killing some people,\" the paper claimed. \"Some are going insane; others are losing their religion.\" The artists under attack were not rappers such as 50 Cent or Ludacris but Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. \"The young girls and boys who constantly take jazz every day and night are absolutely becoming bad, and some criminals,\" the (New York) Amsterdam News wrote in 1925.\nThere is a long but little-known history of African American leaders denouncing black popular music as self-destructive and an impediment to integration, a history that continues in the current campaign against rap. This is unfortunate because rap, like older forms of black popular music now considered to be \"America's classical music,\" is distinctive and important because it differs from the norms of \"respectable\" culture.\nLast month, when Lil' Kim was sentenced to prison for lying to a grand jury about a shooting, her raps were also indicted as an obstacle to black progress. \"Her music is laced with lyrics that glorify promiscuous sex and gratuitous violence,\" wrote DeWayne Wickham, a nationally syndicated columnist and former president of the National Assn. of Black Journalists. \"She is a Pied Piper of the worst kind \u2014 a diva of smut.\"\nThe criticisms of Lil' Kim were launched amid an anti-rap movement that began in March, soon after shots were fired by the rival entourages of 50 Cent and the Game outside a New York radio station. Al Sharpton demanded that the Federal Communications Commission ban violent rappers from radio and television, and he launched a boycott against Universal Music Group, which he accused of \"peddling racist and misogynistic black stereotypes\" through rap music. Sharpton expressed special concern about white perceptions of African Americans. Rappers and their corporate supporters \"make it easy for black culture to be dismissed by the majority,\" he said, and the large white fan base \"has learned through rap images to identify black male culture with a culture of violence.\"\nJesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition signed on to the boycott, as did Princeton professor Cornel West, who issued a statement claiming that music companies and rappers made it easy for whites to \"view black bodies and black souls as less moral, oversexed and less intelligent.\"\nThese critics argue that the \"damaging\" images of African Americans in rap discourage whites from opening the door to full citizenship. Yet a consideration of the troubled relationship between civil rights leaders and black popular music in the past might give pause to the opponents of contemporary rap, and, for that matter, to the proponents of integration. In fact, blues, jazz, rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues were all denounced by advocates for racial integration, and for the same reasons rap is now under attack.\nIn the 1920s, several civil rights leaders were so concerned about the sexual and violent content of popular blues and jazz songs that they established a record company to \"undertake the job of elevating the musical taste of the race.\" Promoted by W.E.B. DuBois and A. Philip Randolph, two of the most important civil rights leaders of the 20th century, Black Swan Records pledged to distribute \"the Better Class of Records by Colored Artists,\" which meant recordings of \"respectable\" European classical music.\nCivil rights leaders similarly opposed the next creations of African American musicians: rock 'n' roll and rhythm and blues. In the 1950s, Martin Luther King Jr. told African Americans to shun the new music, which, he said, \"plunges men's minds into degrading and immoral depths.\" Likewise, Randolph's Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which produced a great portion of the civil rights leadership, condemned rock and R&B for their overt sexuality and their \"degrading portrayal of Negro womanhood.\"\nThis history suggests that the cause of integration has always been at odds with what is now widely hailed as America's most important contribution to world culture. Many scholars argue that the creators of jazz, blues, rock and R&B were great because of their willingness and ability to work outside European cultural forms and to speak about elements of the human condition that white artists would not, such as sex and violence.\nThose who attack the latest form of black popular music for the sake of racial unity and \"respectability\" might stop to consider which side, in the history that will be written of this time, they wish to be on.\n"}, {"score": 1031.059, "uuid": "5747b2b3-2656-5bcc-bd9b-9aadaa656b91", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-69-17642", "target_hostname": "au.tv.ign.com", "target_uri": "http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/122/1220510p1.html", "page_rank": 1.1708217e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Wrestling Wrap Up: Cena <em>Raps</em>, The <em>Rock</em> <em>Rocks</em> - TV Feature at IGN", "snippet": "But now that the &quot;<em>rock</em> and <em>rap</em>&quot; concerts are over\u2026what else <em>is</em> there to say?

Then Cena says, at WrestleMania, he's going to s*** all over Rocky's chest and rub his testicles in his face. Now it's up to each of us, individually, to decide which of these options is the sexiest. The war of words continues!\nYes, the Rock/Cena feud has evolved/devolved into a retrovertigo snap fight, complete with momma jokes, gay jokes and dire threats involving hot feces. What a strange way to lead into 'Mania. Because while the Triple H/Undertaker match is using actual storyline-based promo work, The Rock and Cena have just become a traveling carnival of gags and goofs. I supposed it's good that there's that split, but I also feel like the Undertaker/Hunter match is getting overshadowed. I guess that just seems strange to me considering that it was the most anticipated 'Mania match last year. But maybe it's not the \"lack of jokes\" that's underselling the upcoming Hell in a Cell match. Maybe it's Undertaker's retirement home leisure wear. I've been thinking about this and I kind of actually feel like Taker's new bathrobe makes him seem frail. He looks like he should be handing out pamphlets in front of Comic-Con. I know he's still a beast, but that hooded get-up makes him look like a Hogwarts professor. A Hogwarts professor who would use the phrase \"get-up\" to describe someone's attire.\nAnyway, back to Rock and Cena. They're both entertaining. Yes, even Cena. Especially after he came out last night as \"2003 Cena,\" complete with his old entrance music, and raunchy freestyle rappin' action. Yes, it's sad thing to note that the last time Cena was as entertaining as he was last night was nine years ago. Now some might say that Cena won the night because Rock lost points during his clumsy sing-along to Queen's re-lyric'd \"We Will Rock You.\" Other's think that Rocky won based on quantity alone, pitting his 20 minute segment against Cena's five minute one. Plus the fact that freakin' 18 thousand in attendance loved The Rock. But then again, some wrestling fans took away points from Rock for dragging the names of Frodo and Chewbacca through the mud. Because the Rock better hope all the 42-year-old virgins out there dressed like Spock also like GI Joe and go see his damn movie. Qaplaaaaa!!!\nOh, and with all the insults The Rock's been hurling at Cena\u2026he hasn't made fun of the fact that his middle name is Felix? That just seems like gross oversight. Doesn't Felix rhyme with some part of the female anatomy? C'mon, Rocky. That's just shoddy craftsmanship there.\nBut now that the \"rock and rap\" concerts are over\u2026what else is there to say? Because you can only tell the world that Cena has a vagina so many times. Cena can't make fun of Rocky's wrist notes for another three weeks, can he? Yes, it's actually kind of fun to learn that these two have a general backstage disdain for each other, but we night need to take a break from the schoolyard s*** for a week. Just to try to keep it fresh. Oh, and these two guys are going to have to get in the ring together at some point. In separate matches or as one of those \"you hate each other\" tag teams.\n- WWE\nHmmm. Honey Roasted.\nAlso, I know both guys are calling each other out on real s*** now, but it still seemed odd that Rock mentioned Cena's wife. I'm not sure why really. It's just one of those weird things that we all know but are willing \"not to know\" for the sake of storyline stuff. Yes, there are some wrestlers whose wives get acknowledged, and even cast, like Orton . In TNA, it's all anyone can do to try to get all the old-school TNA'ers to shut the hell up about their wives and kids and including the fact that they're all hard working family men in each of their storylines. I think it just seemed odd because\u2026who was that comment for? Was it actually meant for people who thought the kiss between Eve and Cena was a real thing that happened in real life? That's like calling up Kiefer Sutherland's wife and telling on him because he had to kiss an actress in a scene on 24. Even if Cena wasn't married, we all knew that Kane didn't try to kidnap Eve! So it was like this weird backstage-y fact told to us as if we were idiots. Like we're going to say \"Dang, son. Cena's married? But he totally made out with Eve! After a giant masked man tried to abduct her in an ambulance! How did he ever explain that to Mrs. Cena? Uh oh.

Most adults just looked at us as if we were weird as they gave us candy, but when we got to one house, a young mother decided to give us \u201ca good talkin\u2019 to.\u201d\nShe went on and on about how we were too old to go out trick-or-treating, she accused us of being the ones that kept on ruining her yard and trenching her lawn with cars (even though most of us did not drive). We did nothing to merit the negative way in which she was treating us, so we decided to talk right back to her.\nNow, this was in the early 2000\u2032s, so rap music had already infiltrated the suburbs for more than a decade\u2026As soon as the woman closed the door (lol), a couple of us embraced the male chauvinistic nature of rap lyrics and shouted \u201cWhere\u2019s your halloween spirit, ya hoe?!\u201d\nI\u2019m sure that had this woman been our age, she would\u2019ve laughed it off, but no, the door opened back up and she said she was going to call the cops on us for sexual harassment.\nI never trick-or-treated in that neighborhood again.\nMore About The Artist\nNow it took us a minute to figure this out, so dont blame yourself (or us), if you just realized it as well, but Henry Dillard is Without A Face, and obviously vice versa. \u00a0The 20-something singer from Houston, Texas, is inspired by the likes of The Pixies, Radiohead, and Bob Dylan and despite at one point having multiple band members, he recently decided to roll solo.\nHe released his debut LP titled Worst Debut Album Ever last year (dont let the title fool you) and he recently served up his second offering, The First Album Was Better, earlier this year.\nYou can check him out using any of these links:\n"}, {"score": 1026.5166, "uuid": "aecef567-70cb-534f-81ba-b6d2b14686b5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1806wb-69-18337", "target_hostname": "beatmaker.net", "target_uri": "http://beatmaker.net/tag/rap-beats-2/", "page_rank": 2.2494575e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>Rap</em> Beats | Beat Maker", "snippet": "<em>Rap</em> and hip-hop are great musical genres because they\u2019re flexible enough to incorporate local, regional and cultural tastes, while still staying true to the music.

Bliss n Eso is actually a trio of musicians. MC Bliss, also known as Jonathan Notley, is an American. MC Eso, an Australian, is also known as Max MacKinnon, and DJ Izm, a Moroccan, known as Tarik Ejjamai, rounds out the group.\nTrio Takes To North America\nThe group met in high school and has performed together since that time. They occupy Australia\u2019s top spot in terms of hip-hop artists, in a field that\u2019s becoming more crowded every day. The group focuses on its lyrics and beats but has tried to avoid developing a predictable style.\nThey regularly perform live and still include traditional rap techniques like scratching and beatboxing to achieve their unique sound. While they\u2019ve moved around from label to label, the group has also opened for some of rap\u2019s most recognizable acts, including 50 Cent, G-Unit, and Lil Jon. Bliss and Eso have been nominated for ARIA awards, Australia\u2019s version of the Grammys.\nBliss n Eso aren\u2019t your typical hip-hop musical act, and have been very active in a number of charitable causes. The group\u2019s work has helped fund relief work in South Africa as well as in Victoria, Australia. They\u2019ve toured the US several times and have released four albums, one of which was certified gold and the group\u2019s most recent release, Running on Air, was certified platinum.\nIf any of this surprises you, it shouldn\u2019t. Hip-hop, as a musical artform, has demonstrated itself to be among the most culturally flexible, and has inspired musicians and artists from all over the world. New musicians find the genre to be welcoming, and relatively easy to break into, compared to other musical genres like rock.\nHip-hop, when combined with the ability to self-produce, self-publicize and self-distribute music, turns out to be highly appealing to listeners all over the world. There\u2019s no easier way to start in the music business today than by producing your own hip-hop and rap beats.\nUnlike other genres, it\u2019s both acceptable and expected that artists who are just trying to break into the music scene will create and distribute free mixtapes of their music.

This year, for the first time, more than 30 musical categories in which Grammy Awards had been issued, will no longer be eligible for special recognition. To be sure, rap beats won\u2019t be among those cut out of the action, but the move should shake up musicians and rap artists anyway.\nNew Generation Of Music\nFor some musicians, self-production is the way to get into the music scene. Most of the music genres being cut from the Grammy Awards this year will fall into the category of \u201cniche\u201d music. Rap isn\u2019t niche anymore; it\u2019s definitely mainstream.\nHowever, many of the genres that are being cut are filled with artists who self-produce their music, largely because big labels aren\u2019t interested in musicians with very small potential audiences. Self-produced music is a way of life for these folks. Self-produced music is growing in popularity, even among genres that can\u2019t be considered \u201cniche,\u201d like rap.\nIt\u2019s never been easier than it is today to get into the music business. With the excellent software tools that are on the market today, a novice can put together a debut album that has all the sound quality of a professional studio recording. Musicians also have a lot of control over their sounds.\nWith the tools of music self-production, artists can create music in their way, using their own equipment. Better still, up-and-coming performers can distribute their music to audiences inexpensively and without the need for studios. The Internet makes it possible to reach the audiences musicians are looking for, and it also makes it possible for listeners to find the musicians they\u2019re most interested in.\nWith products like Sonic Producer, musicians can make their own music. Sonic Producer also comes with thousands of royalty-free sample tracks and videos that can help new music producers make the most of their investment in Sonic Producer!\nSelf-production is a great way to reach the audience you\u2019re trying to find, and still maintain ultimate control of your music. You don\u2019t need to worry about recording contracts, paying royalties to other artists, or not having a distribution channel for your music. Sonic Producer provides you with the recording software you need to make your music, record your music into a digital file format, and package it for distribution among the many channels that are available to musicians today.\nDownload your copy of Sonic Producer today and get your beats up in the air!\n"}, {"score": 1021.82733, "uuid": "d810037e-1f88-5acd-921c-e8a2e7d633b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-42-28341", "target_hostname": "www.georgiariverfishing.com", "target_uri": "http://www.georgiariverfishing.com/GAarticles/TopRiverLures/ShadRap/ShadRap.htm", "page_rank": 1.1798436e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Shad <em>Rap</em>", "snippet": "Whenever the Shad <em>Rap</em> makes contact with wood <em>or</em> <em>rock</em>, stop reeling for a few seconds and let the lure rise a foot <em>or</em> so.

There is no other crankbait sold that looks more like a baitfish, runs as true straight out of the box, and hangs up as infrequently as the Shad Rap. While I am not a strong proponent of crankbaits in river situations (they get hung up too often), the Shad Rap is one of my favorite lures. I have caught everything from crappie to stripers on the Shad Rap, and virtually every type of fish in between. I even caught five catfish on a Shad Rap one day on the Coosawattee River. Shad Raps are great in clear water because they look so realistic and also cut the mustard in dingy water because they throw off a decent amount of flash and vibration. Shad Raps work well in slow water and outshine all other crankbaits in swifter water because they track straight as an arrow. They are easy to fish, too. The best retrieve is to throw them out and start reeling.\nEvery size of Shad Rap will catch fish, but I prefer the SR05, a 2\" model that will get down to around 6 or 7 feet on a fast retrieve. This is the smallest Shad Rap made, and is perfect for the clear, rocky streams found in northern Georgia, where redeye and spotted bass are waiting for a meal just about that size. The SR05 also might be the best lure in the world for white bass! Crappie, rock bass, largemouths, big bream, stripers, hybrids, and even the aforementioned catfish all have trouble turning down this tasty little offering. I've even caught a carp pushing seven pounds on a Shad Rap, which would put me in the running for the Dog River Carp king trophy! This smallest member of the Shad Rap family is probably not the best choice if you are targeting largemouths or stripers (they usually prefer a bigger mouthful) or bream or crappie (they usually like smaller meals), but for good all-around mixed-bag fishing, the Shad Rap is tough to beat.\nI have some pretty good reasons for choosing the small Shad Rap over larger models. The main reason is that I hate getting hung up when floating down a river, and larger Shad Raps (with bigger hooks) get hung up a good bit more than the SR05. Another reason I like the smaller version is that I can usually get the lure back when I do get hung because the lure normally runs at about six feet or less, allowing me to reach my rod tip down into the water and jiggle it free. These things cost $5 a pop, and the difference between getting hung up in six feet of water versus nine feet of water is very important to me on those early spring trips when I'd rather stay in the boat. Having said that, I rarely have a Shad Rap make it through an entire season without leaving it on some river. Despite the fact that they ride over logs and through branches better than any other type of diving lure, Shad Raps are still crankbaits and will get hung a bit more than other lures.\nBest Seasons and Situations\nShad Raps are tough to beat in the springtime when white bass and hybrids make their spawning runs. At left is a hybrid weighing at least four pounds and to the right is a white bass weighing about two pounds. Both were taken on the SR05 model in the shad finish.\nShad Raps are a great choice any time white bass are in the river, which is normally during the spring spawning runs. Traditionally, the most famous white bass lure is a white curly-tail grub, but I prefer the Shad Rap. White bass normally reside somewhere near the bottom while making their runs, and the Shad Rap will get close enough to do the job 99% of the time. Any time you feel the lure come into contact with the bottom or any other obstacle, all you have to do to avoid snags is to stop reeling for a second or two (allowing the buoyancy of the bait to raise it over snags) then commence reeling at a slower pace. It is easy to control the depth of the lure, even in swift current. Curly-tail jigs are tougher to fish because you must reel faster to keep them away from snags, and if they so much as touch a tree limb, they get hung. Jigs are also tougher to fish in swift current, because in order to get down to the fish, a heavier jig head is often required, and then you are really talking hang-up city!\nThe Shad Rap also shines in situations where redeye and spotted bass are likely targets. These fish are most commonly found in northern Georgia, where the rivers run fairly clear most of the year and there is not quite as much woody cover to deal with. You can get away with fishing a Shad Rap almost year-round for these bass if you remember to fish a little slower when its cold out. Despite it's small size, the Shad Rap will entice surprisingly large spotted bass into striking. I like to put on a Shad Rap on North Georgia streams during the spring and let the whites, spots, and redeyes fight over it! Another little tip: Trout in the Chattahoochee River will tear up a Shad rap in short order. This surprised me at first, because most people throw tiny flies and spinners at trout in the Hooch, but I've seen the Shad Rap catch too many limits not to mention it.\nTips and Techniques\nWhen bass fishing, I prefer to use the Shad Rap when the water is pretty clear. There are flashier and louder lures to use in murky water (though the Shad Rap is pretty good in stained water too!), and clear water allows me to spot potential snags in order to avoid hang-ups. The main reason though, is that fish in clear water are often a bit more selective in what they eat, and nothing looks as realistic wiggling through clear water as a Shad Rap! During the warmer months, if the fish refuse to hit topwater, the Shad Rap is often my second option, because it can be fished fairly quickly in the middle depths without getting hung up that often. When the sun is setting and I've still got two miles to float, the Shad Rap allows me to get there quickly and still have a great shot at catching fish.\nThe SR05 Shad Rap works best with medium-light spinning tackle and 6 lb.-test line. I feel that 8 pound line inhibits the action a bit too much and 4 pound line might not get that three-pound spot into the boat without some answered prayers. I normally just throw out and reel in, varying the retrieve speed until I find what works. Whenever the Shad Rap makes contact with wood or rock, stop reeling for a few seconds and let the lure rise a foot or so. Many times, when you start reeling again a bass will have eaten it. Every once in a while on a slow day in midsummer, a retrieve consisting of violent jerks and pauses will sometimes entice a few bass that must like it rough.\nI don't fish the Shad Rap much for largemouth or shoal bass anymore, but I have had great success on these species using the Shallow Shad Rap in the next size up (SSR07, 2 & 3/4\"). These lures get down as deep as five feet and run like a dream in fast shoal bass water or lazy largemouth hangouts. I have a friend that swears by one of the bigger Shad Raps for stripers, but I have not personally verified\u00a0 that claim yet.\nI haven't mentioned lure color yet, but since I normally fish Shad Raps in clear water or for fish (white bass) that like to chow on shad, I go with the shad finish. I would expect that the brighter finishes would be really effective in stained water and that the crawfish pattern might be good at times too. Rapala is also making jointed, rattling, and suspending versions of the Shad Rap that are made of plastic rather than balsa wood. My guess is that since Rapala makes them, they are probably pretty good lures, too. If you are a crankbait enthusiast, I would suggest you have a few different flavors to try.\u00a0 I am not a crankbait enthusiast, but the Shad Rap is slowly making a convert out of me. If Rapala ever comes out with a weedless version of the Shad Rap, this lure is headed straight for the top five!\nSuggestions?

(Each of the above screens must stand on its own; i.e., one \"good\" aspect of the music's nature cannot sanctify any of the others.) (Please refer to Eph. 5:18,19 and Col. 3:16 at the end of this report .)\n(a) Lyrics -- Our\nspiritual songs\nmust be sufficiently clear so as to convey the truth plainly, and must be consistent with Biblical revelation (i.e., sound doctrine) -- the words should focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ and encourage practical submission to God's order in all our personal affairs. Most contemporary Christian music (CCM) can be rejected on the basis of lyrics alone -- even when the lyrics are audibly clear, the predominance of false doctrine and/or the shallow view of the person and work of Jesus Christ is often appalling.\n(b) Score -- The meaning of the word\npsalms\noriginally denoted a striking or twitching with the fingers (on musical strings); only later did it come to mean a sacred song sung to musical accompaniment (\nVine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\n). Our\npsalms\n, or the arrangement of the musical notes, is a vital ingredient of the all-encompassing term we call \"music.\" This is because it is the area in which we are usually the most ignorant; i.e., medical research clearly supports the contention that musical tones and rhythms in and of themselves (i.e., without lyrics) can cause physical and \"emotional\" reactions over which the listener may have little or no control. Since the score of contemporary Christian rock music, with its syncopation and slurring of notes, is virtually indistinguishable from its secular counterpart, one has to wonder if spirituality is being eroded and carnality is being propagated. (One should always assess \"Christian\" music thusly: \"Does it stir the flesh to 'boogie,' or the spirit to praise the Lord?\")\n(c) Character -- Our\nhymns,\nor the character of the music, is its most obscure component. The character of much of what is called \"Christian\" music may best be characterized as charismatic , irreverent, universalist, socialist utopian idealistic, superficial religiousness, neo-evangelical , expressionistic, ostentatious, or in a myriad of other contexts (e.g.; What is the character of the music at a so-called Christian rock concert when whatever message is presented is punctuated by screaming guitars, smoke bombs, and a general atmosphere of frivolity?) And because the character of the music is not always readily apparent to the listener, it can have the most insidious effect on believers; i.e., tolerance or acceptance of false doctrine can arise from constant subjection to deficient and improper attitudes in music. The character of \"Christian\" music is easily adopted by listeners, which can then draw them away from the firm foundation of the Word. Music worthy of the name \"Christian\" ought to stimulate and simulate emotions compatible with true spirituality -- the appropriate response to God and His Word.\n-\u00a0 Larry Norman is frequently dubbed \"the father of Christian rock.\" Norman makes the incredulous statement that rock 'n' roll music originated in the Church hundreds of years ago, and that the devil stole it!! Therefore, Norman's battle cry is to \"take rock music back for Jesus' sake!\" (Since rock 'n' roll music did not even come into being until the early 1950s, Norman is obviously unable to provide one shred of evidence for this claim). Norman titles one of his songs, \"Why Should the Devil Have All The Good Music,\" and in another song he refers to Christ (at His return for His Church) as an \"Unidentified Flying Object.\" In still another song, he pitifully trivializes the Gospel of the Resurrection with the following lyrics:\nThey nailed Him to a cross;\nThey put Him in the ground;\nJust goes to show you;\nCan't keep a good Man down.\n-\u00a0 The origin of rock music and the term\nrock 'n' roll\nare interesting ones. In the early 1950s, a disk-jockey named Alan Freed was one of the first white people to be involved in \"rhythm & blues\" music, which was the direct forerunner of rock 'n' roll. (The complete genealogy of rock 'n' roll music is: voodoo to jazz to blues to rock 'n' roll [David Tame,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\npp. 187-204].) Rock 'n' roll was a kind of fusion between rhythm & blues and country & western music. Freed was one of the first white people to play this new rhythm & blues/country combination on his radio program, and was perplexed as to what to call it since it obviously needed a new name. Freed had been receiving bizarre reports concerning kids' reactions to this new music, so decided to name it after a ghetto term that black people used for pre-marital sex in the back seat of a car -- hence, the term \"rock 'n' roll\" was coined.\nContrast the above true account of the origin of rock 'n' roll music with that told us by the so-called \"Christian\" rock band Petra in the lyrics of one of their songs; i.e., that God was the source of rock 'n' roll!:\nGod gave rock 'n' roll to you,\nPut it in the soul of everyone,\nIf you love the sound,\nAnd don't forget the Source,\nYou can turn-a-round,\nYou can change your course.\n-\u00a0 There appears to be a parallel between the attempt today to \"Christianize\" rock music and the \"Christianization\" of various pagan religious practices in fourth century Rome. The Babylonian mystery religions were introduced into Christianity by Constantine in 313 A.D. as he tried to incorporate the pagans into the newly constituted \"Holy\" Roman Empire. The Constantine-led Roman church was willing to adapt and adopt pagan practices in order to make Christianity palatable to the heathen. The heathen festivals were adopted into Christianity, and then eventually, many of the associated pagan symbols and actions were reinterpreted in ways acceptable to Christian faith and practice. \"Christianization\" of pagan customs, symbols, etc., occurred as Christianity had to undergo a transformation so that pagans could \"convert\" without giving up their old beliefs and rituals.\nHas not the modern church of today done much of the same adoption, reinterpretation, and \"Christianization\" of what is called \"rock music\" in order to make Christianity more palatable to the \"teenaged\" lost? And does not this approach smack of the traditional Roman Catholic method of making converts from pagans? -- first adopt the pagan practices, and then reapply Biblical meaning to them. In this manner, the former pagans can retain their pagan idolatrous heritage by merely renaming the idols and changing the terminology used in the worship of them.\n-\u00a0 Those today who are able to clearly see the error and futility of \"Christianizing\" secular psychology and its psychotherapies by merely relabeling them as \"Christian\" psychology and \"Christian\" psychiatric clinics, somehow are unable to see that they have incorporated the same erroneous relabeling process by taking secular rock music, adopting \"Christian\" lyrics, and renaming it \"Christian\" rock. Since when does something become Christian by merely \"Christianizing\" the terminology and placing Christ's name in front of it? Are we not to call the lost out of the culture (world) to repentance and righteousness, rather than imitate the culture (world)?:\n(a) \"Christian rock [music] is the daughter of worldly rock. It tries to make the Christian message more appealing to the world by using a worldly medium. ... Charismatics and New Evangelicals have tried to Christianize demonic rock music, mixing holy with unholy, to reach today's young people. They said, 'To win them, we must speak their language.' But when they won them, what did they win them to? Whatever weak Gospel message [might be there] is lost in the process. May we similarly \"Christianize\" liquor by putting a Gospel message on the bottle label, and have Christians buy and promote it to reach drunks for Jesus? A good goal does not justify unscriptural methods\" (8/15/89,\nCalvary Contender\n).\n(b) \"For those whose eyes have not seen and whose ears have not heard, Contemporary Christian Music, or CCM as the insiders call it, is essentially conventional rock or pop music with the lyrics changed to protect the innocent\" (James Chute,\nThe Milwaukee Journal\n).\n(c) \"... what many in the church today seem to believe: you must have an angle to present the gospel to a hostile world ... It has opened the door to some bizarre evangelistic strategies. The church apes nearly every fad of secular society. Heavy metal rock, rap, graffiti, break dancing, body building, brick smashing, jazzercize, interpretive dance, and stand-up comedy all have been added to the evangelical repertoire. ... It is nothing but hedonism under the guise of religion. Many assume that without some gimmick, the gospel message just won't reach people, and unless we accommodate it to the fashion of our day, we can't hope for it to be effective. ... Thus modern churches feel they must plan and program for attracting unbelievers who cannot be persuaded with revealed truth ...\" (\nOur Sufficiency in Christ\n, pp. 145-146). (Emphasis added.) [Please don't take the use of this quote as an endorsement of the book's author or of his ministry.]\n-\u00a0 The advocates of the \"modern sound\" declare themselves to be in good company: \"Did not the [so-called] great church father, Martin Luther , take the tavern songs of the day and fit them out with Christian words, thus sanctifying the Devil's tunes for the Lord's work?\" This argument, often heard, borders on the ridiculous if one has any understanding of the situation in Luther's time. Carl Johansson, in a very fine and scholarly work, makes this observation (\nMusic and Ministry: A Biblical Counterpoint,\np. 50):\n\"But the thrust of the popular music of Luther's time and the thrust of our pop music is as different as night is from day. There was a systematic unity in the sixteenth century musical world which no longer exists in today's music. ... The popular music of the time had a folk-like character far removed from modern-day pop.\"\nSays another authority concerning those sixteenth century times [during which the culture was the church and the church the culture]: \"A difference between sacred and secular music hardly existed\" (Eric Bloom, ed.,\nGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians,\n5th edition, I, p. 848).\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock groups almost always state that the purpose of their music is for evangelism and/or entertainment. Although Scripture records various folk songs, work songs, battle songs, etc., the Bible teaches that the God-approved purpose or use of music is primarily for worship, praise, edification, and the teaching of doctrine (e.g., Exo. 15:1,2,20,21; I Chron. 15:27,28; 16:9,23; II Chron. 20:21,22; Psa. 95:2; 105:2; Acts 16:25; Eph. 5:18, 19; Col. 3:16). Over fifty psalms were dedicated to the chief musician to be used in worship, and in heaven the 24 elders and angelic beings will also be using music in worship (Rev. 5:8 ff.).\nAlthough godly music can have an evangelistic purpose or result (e.g., Psa. 96:1-3; 108:3), it is not used primarily for this in Scripture. In fact, nowhere in the Bible does it say, \"\nSing\nthe gospel of Christ.\" It says to\npreach\nit! God can certainly use music to bring somebody to Christ, but there has to be a presentation of the gospel somewhere along the line. Our music is primarily an expression of a Spirit-filled life, not really intended for the world's consumption. We seem to want so much to sing our songs to the world that we put them in the world's vernacular and think it's going to be evangelistic.\nSo even if one could find nothing wrong with the lyrics, the score, the character, and/or the effect of \"Christian\" rock music, one would still have to question why the modern day, self-proclaimed musical evangelists/entertainers persist in using their music in endeavors where there is no clear Biblical precedent; i.e., although mentioned over 800 times in Scripture, music is never used for entertainment or for direct evangelism or for any end within itself. Music in the Bible is used primarily in praise and in worship, either to God (e.g., I Chron. 16:9,23; II Chron. 29:30; Psa. 9:11; 30:4; 33:2,3; 47:6; 135:3; etc.) or to Satan (e.g., Dan. 3:4,5,7,10,15; Exo. 32:17,18).\n-\u00a0 Since the religious rockers almost always maintain that they are simply trying to reach people for Jesus, then why not go totally secular and leave out the appeal to the church altogether? Why bother with the crowd that's already saved? (Of course, since about 80% of religious rockers' income is derived through \"Christian\" bookstores, we already know the answer to that question.) It is our conviction that the religious rockers are not reaching the lost, but are instead making disciples to their rock music from the churched kids attending their concerts or playing their recordings. In fact, there is a good chance that the church could be losing the so-called \"found\" by bringing rock music into the sanctuary.\nJesus said that when He was lifted up, He would draw all men to Himself. Why then would the Holy Spirit need help today from the world's music in drawing people to Christ? Why do the \"musical soul-winners\" think they can attract people for God by using the world's standards and the world's music, when the net effect of the music is to basically stir the flesh and the emotions rather than stir a love for God?\n-\u00a0 When people generally speak of the evils of secular rock music, they often refer to the supposedly evil and/or satanic messages that are covertly placed in the minds of the listeners through a method called \"back-masking.\" The theory behind back-masking is that messages that are below the audio level (reversed messages in this case) will be received by the \"unconscious mind,\" thus bypassing conscious evaluation, and then at some time in the future, are able to affect the behavior of the listener. This idea of the unconscious receiving messages directly through finer perceptive mechanisms than available to the conscious mind is based upon Freud's thoroughly discredited theory of the unconscious -- discredited because the theory has not been supported either neurologically or practically. Moreover, the Freudian unconscious is in direct conflict with the Word of God, which is consciously and volitionally oriented. [See also a 9/96 AP story: researchers report that if there is any effect from subliminal messages , the influence on the mind is minimal, having a duration of 1/10 of a second at most! -- 9/20/96,\nThe Bloomington Herald-Times,\n\"Effect of subliminal messages extremely brief, scientists say,\" p. 12.]\nWe do not doubt that back-masked messages have in fact been recorded, but since there is no proof that the human mind is capable of even receiving these messages, their effect on human behavior must obviously be zero. (In fact, in a court case a number of years ago involving the British rock band Judas Priest, the band was accused of culpability in the suicide deaths of two teenagers who had allegedly killed themselves as a result of acting upon the back-masked \"subliminal\" messages on the band's recordings. The band was found not guilty, not because the subliminal messages were not recorded (they\nwere\nrecorded), but because the scientific evidence presented at the trial was overwhelmingly convincing that subliminal messages just don't work!)\nTherefore, it is quite disturbing to hear that so-called Christian musicians have also been getting involved with the back-masking of \"Christian messages\" on their recordings, under the guise of \"subliminal evangelism.\" Some have even made the incredulous claim that, unbeknownst to them, the Holy Spirit Himself did the back-masking!! Even assuming their ignorance of the non-efficacy of back-masking, are not these musicians in effect saying that the Holy Spirit needs to resort to trickery in order save sinners. Do they believe that the Word of God, preached clearly and without deceit, is no longer capable of convicting men and calling them out for salvation? (See\nPsychoHeresy Update,\nWinter 1991, for a more thorough discussion of subliminals and back-masking.)\n-\u00a0 That music can be used for evil is clear from Scripture. Lucifer was created with a wealth of musical talents, which were evidently to be used for directing the angelic host in the worship of God (Ezek. 28:13 [KJV]). Lucifer's fall (Ezek. 28:11-19) evidently led to the perversion of music (as well as to the perversion of most everything else), so that its improper use could actually be offensive to God (Amos 5:23; 6:5). That music can have a powerful influence on ones emotions, mood, or state of being is clearly taught in Scripture (e.g., I Samuel 16:15-17, 23; II Ki. 3:15).\nNevertheless, some so-called Christian music experts (e.g., Christians with university degrees in music) continue to say that music is amoral (rather than moral or immoral), and, thus, has\nno\npower to lead one into sin. This is said regardless of the Biblical record previously cited. Even the scientific research indicates otherwise. Some even say it is improper to quote an unbeliever's research regarding the moral or scientific effects of music. From the \"moral\" perspective, just as there is nothing inherently evil in the culture, even unbelievers know what is moral or not (Romans 2). Regarding science, we quote scientific research of believers and unbelievers alike. It should be perfectly clear that we do not place such scientific evidence above Biblical truth. Since Scripture needs no scientific verification or research support, the medical effects of music are cited for the same reason the Christian should be interested in the medical effects of drugs or certain foods or the effects of shock waves from an explosion -- mere exposure to these things can lead to unintended and unwanted physical side effects.\n-\u00a0 David Tame (an unbeliever), in his 1984 book,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\nnot only further demonstrates the moral nature of music, but he also reveals extensive medical research demonstrating the destructive effects of rock music (on both the mind [emotions] and the body): [See the abbreviated bibliography at the end of this report for additional reference materials that details some more of the extensive research (including scientific) that has been conducted concerning the effects of music.]\n(a) In commenting on the origin and the morality of rock music, Tame says, \"... a certain cross-fertilization was becoming apparent between the 'new music' and the general jazz and rock style. It came to be seen that the technical differences between 'serious' music, jazz, rock, or any other form of modern music were less important than the underlying factor that their philosophical basis was more or less one and the same: hedonism and anarchy\" (p. 103). (Emphasis added.)\n(b) \"In the rock industry, money is basically what it is all about; and thus music is directed, not upward ... but to the lowest common denominator. The question of questions is\nWill it sell?\nThe standard of artistry could not be less relevant\" (p. 116).\n(c) \"Were we to scour the globe in search of the most aggressively malevolent and unmistakably evil music is existence, it is more than likely that nothing would be found anywhere to surpass voodoo in these attributes ... as the rhythmic accompaniment to satanic rituals and orgies, voodoo is the quintessence of tonal evil. ... Its multiple rhythms [score], rather than uniting into an integrated whole, are performed in a certain kind of conflict with one another. ... What is certain is that to hear this music is to become instantly encompassed by the sound of its raw, livid power. ... Musicologists and historians are in no doubt that the drum rhythms of Africa were carried to America and were transmitted and translated into the style of music which became known as jazz. Since jazz and the blues were the parents of rock and roll, this also means that there exists a direct line of descent from the voodoo ceremonies of Africa, through jazz, to rock and roll and all the other forms of rock music today\" (pp. 189-190). (Emphasis added.)\n(d) \"In the one corner: the ancients and traditionalists; the conviction that music affects character and society, and that therefore the artist has a duty to be responsibly moral and constructive, not immoral and destructive. In the other corner: the materialists; disclaiming responsibility and the need for value judgments, paying no heed to the outcome of their sounds. The second camp contains not only the radical avant-garde, but the entire mass of the much more popular and culturally significant jazz and rock musicians. Who, then, is correct? ...\nDo life patterns follow music patterns or do they not?\n\" (p. 136). Tame goes on to cite extensive research that overwhelmingly supports the contentions of the traditionalists: that music in general can be, and rock music specifically is, a negative influence on both the physical body and moral nature of man.\n(e) \"To the question, 'Does music affect man's physical body?,' modern research applies in the clear affirmative.\nThere is scarcely a single function of the body which cannot be affected by musical tones\n[score] ... Investigation has shown that music affects digestion, internal secretions, circulation, nutrition and respiration. Even neural networks of the brain have been found to be sensitive to harmonic principles\" (p. 136). (Emphasis added.)\n(f) \"Researchers have discovered that consonant and dissonant chords, different intervals, and other features of music [score] all exert a profound effect upon man's pulse and respiration -- upon their rate and upon whether their rhythm is constant, or interrupted and jumpy. Blood pressure is lowered by sustained chords and raised by crisp, repeated ones. [It has also been found that the tension of the larynx is affected by melodies, that sound stimuli can have a negative effect upon the skeletal muscles, that rock rhythms cause the heart beat to lose its perfect rhythm, and that certain rhythms can even cause a rare malady known as \"musicogenic epilepsy\" (76 documented cases as of 1984), with which some of its victims have been tormented to the point of committing suicide or murder.] ... We can see, then, that music affects the body in two distinct ways: directly, as the effect of sound upon the cells and organs, and indirectly, by affecting the emotions, which then in turn influence numerous bodily processes\" (p. 137). (Emphasis added.)\nJulius Portnoy has also found that not only can music [score] \"change metabolism, affect muscular energy, raise or lower blood pressure, and influence digestion,\" but \"It may be able to do all these things more successfully ... than any other stimulants that produce those changes in our bodies\" (p. 138). Musicologist Alice Monsarrat points out that it \"is precisely at this point that rock 'n' roll ... becomes potentially dangerous. This is because, to maintain a sense of well-being and integration, it is essential that man is not subjected too much to any rhythms not in accord with his natural bodily rhythms\" (p. 199).\n(g) Extensive research has also been conducted on the effects of music upon non-human life, both animals and plants. Paradoxical as it may seem, plant experiments concerning the effects of music upon life are even more convincing than human experiments -- that music does affect life, including human life. This is because in plant experiments the effect of the mind's subjective preconditioning and subjective reaction to the music, or one's \"feeling\" for the music, or one's personal tastes in music, have obviously all been removed; i.e., if music [score] can be shown to affect plants, then such effects have to be due to the objective influence of the musical tones and rhythms directly upon the cells and processes of the life-form itself. (It is also easier to set-up a valid, scientifically controlled experiment with plant life than with human life.)\nThe plant research findings are solidly in the traditionalist camp: not only did rock music stunt the growth of a wide variety of plants, but if played long enough, the plants actually died. And even more startling were the findings of Dr. T.C. Singh, head of the Botany Department at Annamalia University, India. His experiments demonstrated that not only did certain forms of music and certain musical instruments (specifically, classical music and the violin) cause plants to grow at twice their normal speed, but that later generations of the seeds of musically stimulated plants carried on the improved traits of greater size, more leaves, etc.! Presumably, the same effect can result in the negative sense, from bad music. The possible significance of Dr. Singh's findings to human life is evident, and should be at least a little disconcerting to rock music fans (pp. 141-145).\n(h) \"Like human nature itself, music cannot possibly be neutral in its spiritual direction ... ultimately all uses of tone [score] and all musical lyrics can be classified according to their spiritual direction, upward or downward. ... To put it plainly, music tends to be of either the darkness or of the light\" (p. 187). In his famous work,\nLaws,\nPlato lamented the musical revolution of his time and its \"unmusical anarchy\": \"Through foolishness they deceived themselves into thinking that there was no right or wrong in music -- that it was to be judged good or bad by the pleasure it gave. By their work and their theories they infected the masses with the presumption to think themselves adequate judges. ... As it was, the criterion was not music, but a reputation for promiscuous cleverness and a spirit of lawbreaking\" (p. 189).\n(i) In his closing comments on the roots of music styles and rhythms, David Tame, with a keen \"spiritual\" insight often lacking in many believers today, takes particular offense with rock music: \"More than any other form of the misuse of sound, it is rock with which we must deal today. ... It is a global phenomenon; a pounding, pounding destructive beat which is heard from America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia. Its effect upon the soul is to make nigh-impossible the true inner silence and peace necessary for the contemplation of eternal verities. ... How necessary is it in this age for some to have the courage to be the ones who are 'different', and to separate themselves out from the pack who long ago sold their lives and personalities to this sound. ... I adamantly believe that rock in all its forms is a critical problem which our civilization\nmust\nget to grips. ... if it wishes long to survive\" (p. 204). (Emphasis added.)\nFor the world, it is impossible to separate from the lure of the pleasures of the flesh; they have no desire to do so nor do they have the power to do so if they did desire. But what reasons do we as Christians have to ignore our Lord's command to come out and be separate? Instead, we adopt the world's music in all its destructive forms [score and character], add Christian lyrics to it, and think we are being pleasing to the Lord and are a testimony of holiness to an unbelieving world. How pathetic!\n-\u00a0 More recent medical research (than that cited by Tame) also disputes the notion of the supposed \"neutrality\" of music:\n(a) Dr. John Diamond, a medical doctor, has conducted extensive research on the medical effects of music. He has noted that man is rhythmic in respiration, heartbeat, pulse, speech, and gait, and when the rhythm of music corresponds to the natural body rhythms, it produces feelings of ecstasy, alertness, and peace, and it energizes the mind and body, and facilitates balance and self-control. (These secular medical findings are also supported by Scripture [I Samuel 16:15-17,23]).\n(b) Dr. David Nobel, another medical doctor and an authority on music, has done extensive research on the value of music rhythms [score] corresponding to body rhythms. He writes that, \"None of these qualities accrue to the rock sound. Instead, rock contains harmonic dissonance and melodic discord while it accents rhythm with a big beat. In fact, the anapestic beat [two short beats, a long beat, then a pause] used by many rock musicians actually is the exact opposite of our heart and arterial rhythms [thereby causing an immediate loss of body strength].\"\n[Dr. Diamond confirms Dr. Nobel's findings and adds that the stopped anapestic rhythm \"heightens stress and anger, reduces output, increases hyperactivity, and weakens muscle strength.\" (Admittedly, the technological ability to objectively measure stress and anger is problematical at best, while the measurement of muscle strength is quite precise and meets all the requirements of scientific reliability and statistical significance.)]\n(c) The power of music to communicate is demonstrated in an article\n\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" by David Mazie, in the August 1992\nReader's Digest --\n\"Music reduces staff tension in the operating room,\" says Dr. Clyde L. Nash, Jr. ... \"and also helps relax the patient.\" [He uses classical music such as Vivaldi and Mozart.] Nash is one of many physicians around the country who are finding that music, used with conventional medical therapies, can help the sick in the healing process.\n(d) Clinical researchers at the U.C.L.A. School of Nursing in Los Angeles, and at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta, found that premature babies gained weight faster and were able to use oxygen more efficiently when they listened to soothing music mixed with voices or womb sounds. At Tallahassee (FL) Memorial Regional Medical Center, premature and low-birth-weight infants exposed to an hour and a half of soothing vocal music each day averaged only 11 days in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, compared with 16 days for a control group. At Baltimore's St. Agnes Hospital, classical music was provided in the critical-care units. \"Half an hour of music produced the same effect as ten milligrams of Valium,\" says Dr. Raymond Bahr, head of the coronary-care unit.\nHow does music help? Some studies show it can lower blood pressure, basal-metabolism and respiration rates, thus lessening physiological responses to stress. Other studies suggest music may help increase production of endorphins (natural pain relievers) and S-IgA (Salivary immunoglobulin A). S-IgA speeds healing, reduces the danger of infections, and controls the heart rate. Studies indicate both hemispheres of the brain are involved in processing music. Dr. Sacks explains, \"The neurological basis of musical responses is robust and may even survive damage to both hemispheres\" (\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" 8/92,\nReader's Digest\n).\n\"In conclusion, we can say that insofar as the physical body is concerned, the notion that music has no effect upon man, or that all music is harmless, is absolutely in error\" (Tame, p. 141). (Emphasis added.) \"No longer [can] modern musicians possibly claim that music is a matter of 'taste,' or that the musician should be allowed to perform anything he chooses ...\nEvery moment of music to which we subject ourselves may be enhancing or taking away our ... clarity of consciousness, increment by increment\n\" (Tame, p. 144).\nIn essence, what the medical experts are saying is that today's rock sound (irrespective of the lyrics tacked-on to it in order to classify it as either secular or \"Christian\") fights against the rhythmic nature of man's creation. In the face of such evidence, it is difficult to understand how anyone can maintain that the music itself is neutral.\n-\u00a0 In Tim Fisher's 1992 book,\nThe Battle for Christian Music,\nhe notes: \"Years ago I heard a tape of a man who was defending the neutrality of music in a public service. He walked over to the piano and played a C major chord. Then, he asked the audience if it was a good C major chord or an evil C major chord. After some scattered laughter, he said, 'See, there's no such thing as good or evil music.' He made a rather obvious mistake, however, in his reasoning: a C major chord isn't music! It is a building block of music -- and there's a big difference. ... Why are we willing to admit these facts when it comes to literature, art, sculpture, or any other form of creativity -- but not music? ... When you enter a freshman theory class as a music major in any discipline of music, among the first things you would study are the 'ingredients' (neutral elements) of music: melody, rhythm, and harmony. ... Eventually you would learn to combine these elements into a musical language that communicates what you desire. ... Music always affects us, because music is not neutral\" (pp. 60-63). Other quotes from this book:\n(a) \"Rock music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody is last. ... Rap is the logical extension of the direction in which rock music has been headed. Once you demote certain musical elements into relative unimportance, they will soon disappear altogether. Most of rock music did away with melodic interest a long time ago. Therefore, if melody is unimportant, why have it? This is exactly what rap 'music' has done. It has emphasized rhythm as the only important musical element, while de-emphasizing melody and harmony to the point where they are virtually non-existent. By every good definition of music, rap is not music! It is merely rhythmic entertainment\" (pp. 77,78).\n(b) \"Can you imagine Mozart being played in a bar? Not very likely -- because the music of Mozart isn't compatible with such an atmosphere. Can you imagine singing the Doxology to the tune of 'Stars and Stripes Forever'? Would you receive a blessing by singing the words of 'The Old Rugged Cross' to the Beatles' tune 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand'? These are ridiculous illustrations because the music is obviously incompatible with the message\" (p. 102).\n(c) \"The tragic truth is that most Christians judge the effectiveness of music based upon the yardstick of the flesh, rather than the yardstick of the Spirit. If a song thrills us, we like it. If it doesn't excite us, we don't like it. Too often our opinion of a song is not based on the musical, textual, or even biblical worth of it -- but rather on how it makes us feel. As in so many other areas of life, we take a sensual approach to music\" (p. 104).\n-\u00a0 By attending Christian rock concerts, does not one identify oneself with their ecumenism and their false doctrines and become a partaker of their evil deeds? (The Bible clearly teaches a theology of \"guilt by association\" -- see 2 John 10,11.) And since we will all be accountable to the Lord at the B\u00e9ma Seat for our stewardship with the resources He has entrusted to us while on this earth, how can anyone possibly justify allocating any resources to the support of rock music?\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock music offers no hope -- since it is Spiritless, it can give none. It does not offer heaven, for the music within itself produces a vacuum -- full of sound and fury, but no substance. It provides no foundation to the believer because its birth came from secular rock 'n' roll, which has no basis in God. The approaches of religious rockers all seem to suggest that, \"We must become the world to win the world.\" That method will not work simply because it is outside of God's plan for the proper balancing of Biblically-ordained modes of evangelism with Biblical principles of separation. If one believes at all in the Bible doctrine of \"separation\" from the world (Rom. 12:2), is it not logical to include the Christian's music?\n-\u00a0 Gordon Sears, in his booklet,\nIs Today's Christian Music \"Sacred\"?,\nasks six questions of those who think that CCM is indeed acceptable to God: If the new style and sound of music is of God then:\n(1) Why is it causing so much confusion and division among Christians?;\n(2) Why is it not received by all fundamental Bible-believing churches?;\n(3) Why is it readily accepted by the non-Christian world? The ungodly never accepted the old Christian hymns;\n(4) Why is it that Bible-denying universities and popular secular TV entertainment shows invite well-known Christian artists to give concerts with CCM? This never happened with the great spiritual hymns;\n(5) Why are there hundreds of churches with godly pastors across America that strictly reject it and forbid it in their services?; and\n(6) Why does it have such a strong effect upon the physical body? (As shown earlier, music does have a strong physical effect -- to ignore this would be negligent.)\n-\u00a0 What kind of music truly honors God? Ernest Pickering lists ten primary guidelines for Christians to follow (\nThe Kind of Music That Honors God,\npp. 11-12):\n1. Its message is Scriptural (Col 3:16). Good Christian music must present a message that is true to the Word of God and doctrinally sound.\n2. It should lead us to think in Biblical patterns and not be suggestive of evil either in message or in musical arrangement (Phil. 4:8). The text and music should not be cheap or tawdry.\n3. It should help us to honor God with our bodies (I Cor. 6:19-20). Music which tends to imitate the effects of godless rock upon the human body or which either destroys or impairs one's hearing is not Christian music.\n4. It will maintain a balance between \"spirit\" and \"understanding\" (I Cor. 14:15). Music that is primarily emotional froth would not fulfill this requirement.\n5. It will contain words that are full of beauty, dignity, reverence and simplicity, words that are worthy of the worship of a holy God (Isa. 6:1-6).\n6. It will be free of mental association with worldly musical styles and evidence a holy consecrated character (Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15). Music that seeks to \"copy\" the worldly approach is not honoring to God.\n7. It should be expressive of the peace that accompanies the Christian life, not the clamor, confusion, din, and turmoil of the world (Col. 3:15-16). The various forms of rock music do not contribute to peace of heart but partake of the constant jangle of the sinful world. Christ promises peace to His people (Jn. 14:27).\n8. It should be characterized by musical preciseness, finesse of poetic technique, and should evidence a structure of harmony and order. God is a God of order and not disorder (I Cor. 14:40).\n9. It should promote and accompany a life-style of godliness, modesty, and holy quietness, and not modish fashion, suggestive acts, or sexual aggressiveness (1 Pe. 1:16; Tit. 2:11-12).\n10. It should not contribute to the temptation of new or weak believers (Rom. 14:13,21; 15:2). Music that reminds newly-saved converts of their old life of sin is to be abhorred and rejected.\nThe erosion of musical standards among contemporary Christians parallels the erosion of convictions and practices in other areas as well. It denotes a spirit of compromise with the world which must be vigorously opposed by strong Christian leaders. As in all areas of our lives believers should ever follow the admonition of Paul: \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God\" (I Cor. 10:31).\n-\u00a0 It is our conviction that rock music cannot be used to communicate spiritual truth. (Often the melody in the \"Christian\" version of rock music is obscured and overpowered by the heavy beat -- the accompaniment is so predominant that it completely overpowers any message that might be present.) How can rock music, with its origins in demonic activities, and with its proven adverse medical and \"emotional\" effects, apply to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? Convictions must be based on the Word of God and not personal tastes, likes, and dislikes. Since most of religious rock, or so-called contemporary Christian music, has its roots in, and draws its inspiration from, secular rock 'n' roll, the result is worldliness in the music, and even worse, worldliness\nthrough\nmusic invading the church. Further, it \"authenticates\" the rock sound by having professing Christians playing the music. When one applies the standards of Scripture to this form of worldliness (e.g., II Cor. 6:17; I Thes.5:21, 22; Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15,16; Js.4:4; etc.), the wrongness of such music should be obvious to all who truly desire to please their Lord.\n-\u00a0 Being that the very term\nrock 'n' roll\nidentifies with fornication, and the fact that music for the Christian is deemed to be worship, then the test it must pass is found in Philippians 4:8 -- \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.\" It is difficult to understand how a believer, in good conscience, could partake in that which is, at best, highly questionable. Rock 'n' roll is also so much associated with ungodly and outright Satanic rebellion against God, it is a wonder believers would want to be identified with it in any way. One would think a proper understanding of Ephesians 4:17-24 would be helpful to professing believers involved in rock music:\nThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\nEph. 5:18,19 -- And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing and making melody [music] in your heart to the Lord;\nCol. 3:16 -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\nNote: What is Christian Music?\n(From an editorial response to an ACCC [American Council of Christian Churches] resolution on CCM)\n1. Music is an art. Because music is an art, it must be understood and evaluated in artistic and esthetic categories. Knowing what music is better is not a matter of taste, but of criticism. We may, and often do, develop tastes for things that are worse. Criticism exists to correct our tastes. Critical training and musical accomplishment, however, are different things: many fine performers are incompetent critics.\nStyle is not the major issue in evaluating music. Classicism and romanticism are not styles; fugues and sonatas are not styles; even jazz and rock are not styles. It is far more important to ask what a particular musical form exists to do, and whether a given composer has employed the form adequately for his purpose.\n2. Music is a language. In common with all good art, music is written to say something. Quite apart from any lyrics with which it may be associated, music carries meaning. Of the two, the music speaks more powerfully. The best lyrics can never redeem music which communicates a false message, though second-rate lyrics have often been elevated in the hands of a great composer. It is often pointed out that music communicates subjectively, as if this should preclude our evaluating it. But what is subjective is not therefore unreal. It may be a subjective assertion that sunsets are more pleasant than garbage dumps; it is also a truth. For a person to say that he prefers garbage dumps would alter our judgment of the person, but not of the garbage dump. The question is not what a piece of music means \"to me,\" the question is what it means. This judgment must precede all moral and religious judgments with regard to the composition.\n3. Music is a moral phenomenon. If music conveys meaning, then every musical composition may be judged in moral terms according to its truthfulness and propriety. Herein lies the error of those who claim that God has not revealed what \"style of music He prefers.\" To the contrary, God has clearly told us what He expects of our communications in general and of our worshipful communications in particular. To judge the meaning of a musical piece obligates us to judge its morality.\n4. Music is a Christian duty. This is emphasized, not only by New Testament teaching, but also by those psalms that call upon \"all that hath breath\" to praise God with music. Music is the one art that all God's peoples, in all times and places, are required to practice. Therefore, we had best take it seriously. It is not a public relations tool, nor does it serve a merely social function. It is with music that we worship God and edify one another. We dare not tolerate the tawdry, the base, or the thoughtless.\nThese same psalms name virtually every known category of instrument. We need not ask whether we can worship God with stringed instruments (e.g., guitars). The question is, which guitar: Christopher Parkening's or Jimmy Page's?\n5. Music is the church's heritage. Those who lack critical training must look to the church's past for direction. The apostles did not invent a new music, but adopted the musical heritage of Judaism. Generation by generation this heritage was handed down, elaborated, criticized, corrected, and developed. Medieval plainsong was a direct descendent, and its use led eventually to the development of the various polyphonic forms. The hymnody of the Reformation stands in this tradition, as do the hymns of the Pietists and the Awakeners.\nOnly after the Enlightenment did Christians assume that they could safely dispense with the heritage of the church. Chiefly in America did they wish to ground worship in forms which were separated from the culture of the church. When one speaks of what represents the Body of Christ, he ought to include the whole Body, and not merely the current generation.\nPurveyors of CCM are driven by this rejection of the Christian musical heritage in favor of popular forms. For the record, so were Victorian songwriters like Bliss and Doane, who are more closely related musically to Stryper and Petra than they are to Hassler or Mason. The question is about more than rock. But the breadth of the question should not prevent us from making definite musical choices.\n"}, {"score": 980.97833, "uuid": "96050ea7-c569-55d9-959c-c64137490d50", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1118wb-31-12031", "target_hostname": "rapidnet.com", "target_uri": "http://rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/rockm/satanic.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "&quot;Christian&quot; <em>Rock</em> Music - Christian <em>or</em> Satanic?", "snippet": "Music always affects us, because music <em>is</em> not neutral&quot; (pp. Other quotes from this book: (a) &quot;<em>Rock</em> music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody <em>is</em> last. ... <em>Rap</em> <em>is</em> the logical extension of the direction in <em>which</em> <em>rock</em> music has been headed.", "explanation": null, "document": "-\nChristian Rock?\nby Ric Llewellyn, published by Fundamental Evangelistic Association : This tract carefully details the Biblical screens any music must pass before it can be labeled as \"Christian\" (Eph. 5:18,19; Col. 3:16); i.e., the music must be a channel for correct doctrine, and (a) its lyrics should be edifying, spiritually oriented, clear, conforming to Biblical truth, and point our focus to Jesus Christ, (b) its score (the arrangement of the musical notes) should not overshadow the message conveyed by the lyrics, but should compliment it, and (c) its character (the \"attitudes\" in the music and of the performers) should be consistent with the purity of the message it claims to convey (reverence, worshipful, etc.). (Each of the above screens must stand on its own; i.e., one \"good\" aspect of the music's nature cannot sanctify any of the others.) (Please refer to Eph. 5:18,19 and Col. 3:16 at the end of this report .)\n(a) Lyrics -- Our\nspiritual songs\nmust be sufficiently clear so as to convey the truth plainly, and must be consistent with Biblical revelation (i.e., sound doctrine) -- the words should focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ and encourage practical submission to God's order in all our personal affairs. Most contemporary Christian music (CCM) can be rejected on the basis of lyrics alone -- even when the lyrics are audibly clear, the predominance of false doctrine and/or the shallow view of the person and work of Jesus Christ is often appalling.\n(b) Score -- The meaning of the word\npsalms\noriginally denoted a striking or twitching with the fingers (on musical strings); only later did it come to mean a sacred song sung to musical accompaniment (\nVine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\n). Our\npsalms\n, or the arrangement of the musical notes, is a vital ingredient of the all-encompassing term we call \"music.\" This is because it is the area in which we are usually the most ignorant; i.e., medical research clearly supports the contention that musical tones and rhythms in and of themselves (i.e., without lyrics) can cause physical and \"emotional\" reactions over which the listener may have little or no control. Since the score of contemporary Christian rock music, with its syncopation and slurring of notes, is virtually indistinguishable from its secular counterpart, one has to wonder if spirituality is being eroded and carnality is being propagated. (One should always assess \"Christian\" music thusly: \"Does it stir the flesh to 'boogie,' or the spirit to praise the Lord?\")\n(c) Character -- Our\nhymns,\nor the character of the music, is its most obscure component. The character of much of what is called \"Christian\" music may best be characterized as charismatic , irreverent, universalist, socialist utopian idealistic, superficial religiousness, neo-evangelical , expressionistic, ostentatious, or in a myriad of other contexts (e.g.; What is the character of the music at a so-called Christian rock concert when whatever message is presented is punctuated by screaming guitars, smoke bombs, and a general atmosphere of frivolity?) And because the character of the music is not always readily apparent to the listener, it can have the most insidious effect on believers; i.e., tolerance or acceptance of false doctrine can arise from constant subjection to deficient and improper attitudes in music. The character of \"Christian\" music is easily adopted by listeners, which can then draw them away from the firm foundation of the Word. Music worthy of the name \"Christian\" ought to stimulate and simulate emotions compatible with true spirituality -- the appropriate response to God and His Word.\n-\u00a0 Larry Norman is frequently dubbed \"the father of Christian rock.\" Norman makes the incredulous statement that rock 'n' roll music originated in the Church hundreds of years ago, and that the devil stole it!! Therefore, Norman's battle cry is to \"take rock music back for Jesus' sake!\" (Since rock 'n' roll music did not even come into being until the early 1950s, Norman is obviously unable to provide one shred of evidence for this claim). Norman titles one of his songs, \"Why Should the Devil Have All The Good Music,\" and in another song he refers to Christ (at His return for His Church) as an \"Unidentified Flying Object.\" In still another song, he pitifully trivializes the Gospel of the Resurrection with the following lyrics:\nThey nailed Him to a cross;\nThey put Him in the ground;\nJust goes to show you;\nCan't keep a good Man down.\n-\u00a0 The origin of rock music and the term\nrock 'n' roll\nare interesting ones. In the early 1950s, a disk-jockey named Alan Freed was one of the first white people to be involved in \"rhythm & blues\" music, which was the direct forerunner of rock 'n' roll. (The complete genealogy of rock 'n' roll music is: voodoo to jazz to blues to rock 'n' roll [David Tame,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\npp. 187-204].) Rock 'n' roll was a kind of fusion between rhythm & blues and country & western music. Freed was one of the first white people to play this new rhythm & blues/country combination on his radio program, and was perplexed as to what to call it since it obviously needed a new name. Freed had been receiving bizarre reports concerning kids' reactions to this new music, so decided to name it after a ghetto term that black people used for pre-marital sex in the back seat of a car -- hence, the term \"rock 'n' roll\" was coined.\nContrast the above true account of the origin of rock 'n' roll music with that told us by the so-called \"Christian\" rock band Petra in the lyrics of one of their songs; i.e., that God was the source of rock 'n' roll!:\nGod gave rock 'n' roll to you,\nPut it in the soul of everyone,\nIf you love the sound,\nAnd don't forget the Source,\nYou can turn-a-round,\nYou can change your course.\n-\u00a0 There appears to be a parallel between the attempt today to \"Christianize\" rock music and the \"Christianization\" of various pagan religious practices in fourth century Rome. The Babylonian mystery religions were introduced into Christianity by Constantine in 313 A.D. as he tried to incorporate the pagans into the newly constituted \"Holy\" Roman Empire. The Constantine-led Roman church was willing to adapt and adopt pagan practices in order to make Christianity palatable to the heathen. The heathen festivals were adopted into Christianity, and then eventually, many of the associated pagan symbols and actions were reinterpreted in ways acceptable to Christian faith and practice. \"Christianization\" of pagan customs, symbols, etc., occurred as Christianity had to undergo a transformation so that pagans could \"convert\" without giving up their old beliefs and rituals.\nHas not the modern church of today done much of the same adoption, reinterpretation, and \"Christianization\" of what is called \"rock music\" in order to make Christianity more palatable to the \"teenaged\" lost? And does not this approach smack of the traditional Roman Catholic method of making converts from pagans? -- first adopt the pagan practices, and then reapply Biblical meaning to them. In this manner, the former pagans can retain their pagan idolatrous heritage by merely renaming the idols and changing the terminology used in the worship of them.\n-\u00a0 Those today who are able to clearly see the error and futility of \"Christianizing\" secular psychology and its psychotherapies by merely relabeling them as \"Christian\" psychology and \"Christian\" psychiatric clinics, somehow are unable to see that they have incorporated the same erroneous relabeling process by taking secular rock music, adopting \"Christian\" lyrics, and renaming it \"Christian\" rock. Since when does something become Christian by merely \"Christianizing\" the terminology and placing Christ's name in front of it? Are we not to call the lost out of the culture (world) to repentance and righteousness, rather than imitate the culture (world)?:\n(a) \"Christian rock [music] is the daughter of worldly rock. It tries to make the Christian message more appealing to the world by using a worldly medium. ... Charismatics and New Evangelicals have tried to Christianize demonic rock music, mixing holy with unholy, to reach today's young people. They said, 'To win them, we must speak their language.' But when they won them, what did they win them to? Whatever weak Gospel message [might be there] is lost in the process. May we similarly \"Christianize\" liquor by putting a Gospel message on the bottle label, and have Christians buy and promote it to reach drunks for Jesus? A good goal does not justify unscriptural methods\" (8/15/89,\nCalvary Contender\n).\n(b) \"For those whose eyes have not seen and whose ears have not heard, Contemporary Christian Music, or CCM as the insiders call it, is essentially conventional rock or pop music with the lyrics changed to protect the innocent\" (James Chute,\nThe Milwaukee Journal\n).\n(c) \"... what many in the church today seem to believe: you must have an angle to present the gospel to a hostile world ... It has opened the door to some bizarre evangelistic strategies. The church apes nearly every fad of secular society. Heavy metal rock, rap, graffiti, break dancing, body building, brick smashing, jazzercize, interpretive dance, and stand-up comedy all have been added to the evangelical repertoire. ... It is nothing but hedonism under the guise of religion. Many assume that without some gimmick, the gospel message just won't reach people, and unless we accommodate it to the fashion of our day, we can't hope for it to be effective. ... Thus modern churches feel they must plan and program for attracting unbelievers who cannot be persuaded with revealed truth ...\" (\nOur Sufficiency in Christ\n, pp. 145-146). (Emphasis added.) [Please don't take the use of this quote as an endorsement of the book's author or of his ministry.]\n-\u00a0 The advocates of the \"modern sound\" declare themselves to be in good company: \"Did not the [so-called] great church father, Martin Luther , take the tavern songs of the day and fit them out with Christian words, thus sanctifying the Devil's tunes for the Lord's work?\" This argument, often heard, borders on the ridiculous if one has any understanding of the situation in Luther's time. Carl Johansson, in a very fine and scholarly work, makes this observation (\nMusic and Ministry: A Biblical Counterpoint,\np. 50):\n\"But the thrust of the popular music of Luther's time and the thrust of our pop music is as different as night is from day. There was a systematic unity in the sixteenth century musical world which no longer exists in today's music. ... The popular music of the time had a folk-like character far removed from modern-day pop.\"\nSays another authority concerning those sixteenth century times [during which the culture was the church and the church the culture]: \"A difference between sacred and secular music hardly existed\" (Eric Bloom, ed.,\nGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians,\n5th edition, I, p. 848).\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock groups almost always state that the purpose of their music is for evangelism and/or entertainment. Although Scripture records various folk songs, work songs, battle songs, etc., the Bible teaches that the God-approved purpose or use of music is primarily for worship, praise, edification, and the teaching of doctrine (e.g., Exo. 15:1,2,20,21; I Chron. 15:27,28; 16:9,23; II Chron. 20:21,22; Psa. 95:2; 105:2; Acts 16:25; Eph. 5:18, 19; Col. 3:16). Over fifty psalms were dedicated to the chief musician to be used in worship, and in heaven the 24 elders and angelic beings will also be using music in worship (Rev. 5:8 ff.).\nAlthough godly music can have an evangelistic purpose or result (e.g., Psa. 96:1-3; 108:3), it is not used primarily for this in Scripture. In fact, nowhere in the Bible does it say, \"\nSing\nthe gospel of Christ.\" It says to\npreach\nit! God can certainly use music to bring somebody to Christ, but there has to be a presentation of the gospel somewhere along the line. Our music is primarily an expression of a Spirit-filled life, not really intended for the world's consumption. We seem to want so much to sing our songs to the world that we put them in the world's vernacular and think it's going to be evangelistic.\nSo even if one could find nothing wrong with the lyrics, the score, the character, and/or the effect of \"Christian\" rock music, one would still have to question why the modern day, self-proclaimed musical evangelists/entertainers persist in using their music in endeavors where there is no clear Biblical precedent; i.e., although mentioned over 800 times in Scripture, music is never used for entertainment or for direct evangelism or for any end within itself. Music in the Bible is used primarily in praise and in worship, either to God (e.g., I Chron. 16:9,23; II Chron. 29:30; Psa. 9:11; 30:4; 33:2,3; 47:6; 135:3; etc.) or to Satan (e.g., Dan. 3:4,5,7,10,15; Exo. 32:17,18).\n-\u00a0 Since the religious rockers almost always maintain that they are simply trying to reach people for Jesus, then why not go totally secular and leave out the appeal to the church altogether? Why bother with the crowd that's already saved? (Of course, since about 80% of religious rockers' income is derived through \"Christian\" bookstores, we already know the answer to that question.) It is our conviction that the religious rockers are not reaching the lost, but are instead making disciples to their rock music from the churched kids attending their concerts or playing their recordings. In fact, there is a good chance that the church could be losing the so-called \"found\" by bringing rock music into the sanctuary.\nJesus said that when He was lifted up, He would draw all men to Himself. Why then would the Holy Spirit need help today from the world's music in drawing people to Christ? Why do the \"musical soul-winners\" think they can attract people for God by using the world's standards and the world's music, when the net effect of the music is to basically stir the flesh and the emotions rather than stir a love for God?\n-\u00a0 When people generally speak of the evils of secular rock music, they often refer to the supposedly evil and/or satanic messages that are covertly placed in the minds of the listeners through a method called \"back-masking.\" The theory behind back-masking is that messages that are below the audio level (reversed messages in this case) will be received by the \"unconscious mind,\" thus bypassing conscious evaluation, and then at some time in the future, are able to affect the behavior of the listener. This idea of the unconscious receiving messages directly through finer perceptive mechanisms than available to the conscious mind is based upon Freud's thoroughly discredited theory of the unconscious -- discredited because the theory has not been supported either neurologically or practically. Moreover, the Freudian unconscious is in direct conflict with the Word of God, which is consciously and volitionally oriented. [See also a 9/96 AP story: researchers report that if there is any effect from subliminal messages , the influence on the mind is minimal, having a duration of 1/10 of a second at most! -- 9/20/96,\nThe Bloomington Herald-Times,\n\"Effect of subliminal messages extremely brief, scientists say,\" p. 12.]\nWe do not doubt that back-masked messages have in fact been recorded, but since there is no proof that the human mind is capable of even receiving these messages, their effect on human behavior must obviously be zero. (In fact, in a court case a number of years ago involving the British rock band Judas Priest, the band was accused of culpability in the suicide deaths of two teenagers who had allegedly killed themselves as a result of acting upon the back-masked \"subliminal\" messages on the band's recordings. The band was found not guilty, not because the subliminal messages were not recorded (they\nwere\nrecorded), but because the scientific evidence presented at the trial was overwhelmingly convincing that subliminal messages just don't work!)\nTherefore, it is quite disturbing to hear that so-called Christian musicians have also been getting involved with the back-masking of \"Christian messages\" on their recordings, under the guise of \"subliminal evangelism.\" Some have even made the incredulous claim that, unbeknownst to them, the Holy Spirit Himself did the back-masking!! Even assuming their ignorance of the non-efficacy of back-masking, are not these musicians in effect saying that the Holy Spirit needs to resort to trickery in order save sinners. Do they believe that the Word of God, preached clearly and without deceit, is no longer capable of convicting men and calling them out for salvation? (See\nPsychoHeresy Update,\nWinter 1991, for a more thorough discussion of subliminals and back-masking.)\n-\u00a0 That music can be used for evil is clear from Scripture. Lucifer was created with a wealth of musical talents, which were evidently to be used for directing the angelic host in the worship of God (Ezek. 28:13 [KJV]). Lucifer's fall (Ezek. 28:11-19) evidently led to the perversion of music (as well as to the perversion of most everything else), so that its improper use could actually be offensive to God (Amos 5:23; 6:5). That music can have a powerful influence on ones emotions, mood, or state of being is clearly taught in Scripture (e.g., I Samuel 16:15-17, 23; II Ki. 3:15).\nNevertheless, some so-called Christian music experts (e.g., Christians with university degrees in music) continue to say that music is amoral (rather than moral or immoral), and, thus, has\nno\npower to lead one into sin. This is said regardless of the Biblical record previously cited. Even the scientific research indicates otherwise. Some even say it is improper to quote an unbeliever's research regarding the moral or scientific effects of music. From the \"moral\" perspective, just as there is nothing inherently evil in the culture, even unbelievers know what is moral or not (Romans 2). Regarding science, we quote scientific research of believers and unbelievers alike. It should be perfectly clear that we do not place such scientific evidence above Biblical truth. Since Scripture needs no scientific verification or research support, the medical effects of music are cited for the same reason the Christian should be interested in the medical effects of drugs or certain foods or the effects of shock waves from an explosion -- mere exposure to these things can lead to unintended and unwanted physical side effects.\n-\u00a0 David Tame (an unbeliever), in his 1984 book,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\nnot only further demonstrates the moral nature of music, but he also reveals extensive medical research demonstrating the destructive effects of rock music (on both the mind [emotions] and the body): [See the abbreviated bibliography at the end of this report for additional reference materials that details some more of the extensive research (including scientific) that has been conducted concerning the effects of music.]\n(a) In commenting on the origin and the morality of rock music, Tame says, \"... a certain cross-fertilization was becoming apparent between the 'new music' and the general jazz and rock style. It came to be seen that the technical differences between 'serious' music, jazz, rock, or any other form of modern music were less important than the underlying factor that their philosophical basis was more or less one and the same: hedonism and anarchy\" (p. 103). (Emphasis added.)\n(b) \"In the rock industry, money is basically what it is all about; and thus music is directed, not upward ... but to the lowest common denominator. The question of questions is\nWill it sell?\nThe standard of artistry could not be less relevant\" (p. 116).\n(c) \"Were we to scour the globe in search of the most aggressively malevolent and unmistakably evil music is existence, it is more than likely that nothing would be found anywhere to surpass voodoo in these attributes ... as the rhythmic accompaniment to satanic rituals and orgies, voodoo is the quintessence of tonal evil. ... Its multiple rhythms [score], rather than uniting into an integrated whole, are performed in a certain kind of conflict with one another. ... What is certain is that to hear this music is to become instantly encompassed by the sound of its raw, livid power. ... Musicologists and historians are in no doubt that the drum rhythms of Africa were carried to America and were transmitted and translated into the style of music which became known as jazz. Since jazz and the blues were the parents of rock and roll, this also means that there exists a direct line of descent from the voodoo ceremonies of Africa, through jazz, to rock and roll and all the other forms of rock music today\" (pp. 189-190). (Emphasis added.)\n(d) \"In the one corner: the ancients and traditionalists; the conviction that music affects character and society, and that therefore the artist has a duty to be responsibly moral and constructive, not immoral and destructive. In the other corner: the materialists; disclaiming responsibility and the need for value judgments, paying no heed to the outcome of their sounds. The second camp contains not only the radical avant-garde, but the entire mass of the much more popular and culturally significant jazz and rock musicians. Who, then, is correct? ...\nDo life patterns follow music patterns or do they not?\n\" (p. 136). Tame goes on to cite extensive research that overwhelmingly supports the contentions of the traditionalists: that music in general can be, and rock music specifically is, a negative influence on both the physical body and moral nature of man.\n(e) \"To the question, 'Does music affect man's physical body?,' modern research applies in the clear affirmative.\nThere is scarcely a single function of the body which cannot be affected by musical tones\n[score] ... Investigation has shown that music affects digestion, internal secretions, circulation, nutrition and respiration. Even neural networks of the brain have been found to be sensitive to harmonic principles\" (p. 136). (Emphasis added.)\n(f) \"Researchers have discovered that consonant and dissonant chords, different intervals, and other features of music [score] all exert a profound effect upon man's pulse and respiration -- upon their rate and upon whether their rhythm is constant, or interrupted and jumpy. Blood pressure is lowered by sustained chords and raised by crisp, repeated ones. [It has also been found that the tension of the larynx is affected by melodies, that sound stimuli can have a negative effect upon the skeletal muscles, that rock rhythms cause the heart beat to lose its perfect rhythm, and that certain rhythms can even cause a rare malady known as \"musicogenic epilepsy\" (76 documented cases as of 1984), with which some of its victims have been tormented to the point of committing suicide or murder.] ... We can see, then, that music affects the body in two distinct ways: directly, as the effect of sound upon the cells and organs, and indirectly, by affecting the emotions, which then in turn influence numerous bodily processes\" (p. 137). (Emphasis added.)\nJulius Portnoy has also found that not only can music [score] \"change metabolism, affect muscular energy, raise or lower blood pressure, and influence digestion,\" but \"It may be able to do all these things more successfully ... than any other stimulants that produce those changes in our bodies\" (p. 138). Musicologist Alice Monsarrat points out that it \"is precisely at this point that rock 'n' roll ... becomes potentially dangerous. This is because, to maintain a sense of well-being and integration, it is essential that man is not subjected too much to any rhythms not in accord with his natural bodily rhythms\" (p. 199).\n(g) Extensive research has also been conducted on the effects of music upon non-human life, both animals and plants. Paradoxical as it may seem, plant experiments concerning the effects of music upon life are even more convincing than human experiments -- that music does affect life, including human life. This is because in plant experiments the effect of the mind's subjective preconditioning and subjective reaction to the music, or one's \"feeling\" for the music, or one's personal tastes in music, have obviously all been removed; i.e., if music [score] can be shown to affect plants, then such effects have to be due to the objective influence of the musical tones and rhythms directly upon the cells and processes of the life-form itself. (It is also easier to set-up a valid, scientifically controlled experiment with plant life than with human life.)\nThe plant research findings are solidly in the traditionalist camp: not only did rock music stunt the growth of a wide variety of plants, but if played long enough, the plants actually died. And even more startling were the findings of Dr. T.C. Singh, head of the Botany Department at Annamalia University, India. His experiments demonstrated that not only did certain forms of music and certain musical instruments (specifically, classical music and the violin) cause plants to grow at twice their normal speed, but that later generations of the seeds of musically stimulated plants carried on the improved traits of greater size, more leaves, etc.! Presumably, the same effect can result in the negative sense, from bad music. The possible significance of Dr. Singh's findings to human life is evident, and should be at least a little disconcerting to rock music fans (pp. 141-145).\n(h) \"Like human nature itself, music cannot possibly be neutral in its spiritual direction ... ultimately all uses of tone [score] and all musical lyrics can be classified according to their spiritual direction, upward or downward. ... To put it plainly, music tends to be of either the darkness or of the light\" (p. 187). In his famous work,\nLaws,\nPlato lamented the musical revolution of his time and its \"unmusical anarchy\": \"Through foolishness they deceived themselves into thinking that there was no right or wrong in music -- that it was to be judged good or bad by the pleasure it gave. By their work and their theories they infected the masses with the presumption to think themselves adequate judges. ... As it was, the criterion was not music, but a reputation for promiscuous cleverness and a spirit of lawbreaking\" (p. 189).\n(i) In his closing comments on the roots of music styles and rhythms, David Tame, with a keen \"spiritual\" insight often lacking in many believers today, takes particular offense with rock music: \"More than any other form of the misuse of sound, it is rock with which we must deal today. ... It is a global phenomenon; a pounding, pounding destructive beat which is heard from America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia. Its effect upon the soul is to make nigh-impossible the true inner silence and peace necessary for the contemplation of eternal verities. ... How necessary is it in this age for some to have the courage to be the ones who are 'different', and to separate themselves out from the pack who long ago sold their lives and personalities to this sound. ... I adamantly believe that rock in all its forms is a critical problem which our civilization\nmust\nget to grips. ... if it wishes long to survive\" (p. 204). (Emphasis added.)\nFor the world, it is impossible to separate from the lure of the pleasures of the flesh; they have no desire to do so nor do they have the power to do so if they did desire. But what reasons do we as Christians have to ignore our Lord's command to come out and be separate? Instead, we adopt the world's music in all its destructive forms [score and character], add Christian lyrics to it, and think we are being pleasing to the Lord and are a testimony of holiness to an unbelieving world. How pathetic!\n-\u00a0 More recent medical research (than that cited by Tame) also disputes the notion of the supposed \"neutrality\" of music:\n(a) Dr. John Diamond, a medical doctor, has conducted extensive research on the medical effects of music. He has noted that man is rhythmic in respiration, heartbeat, pulse, speech, and gait, and when the rhythm of music corresponds to the natural body rhythms, it produces feelings of ecstasy, alertness, and peace, and it energizes the mind and body, and facilitates balance and self-control. (These secular medical findings are also supported by Scripture [I Samuel 16:15-17,23]).\n(b) Dr. David Nobel, another medical doctor and an authority on music, has done extensive research on the value of music rhythms [score] corresponding to body rhythms. He writes that, \"None of these qualities accrue to the rock sound. Instead, rock contains harmonic dissonance and melodic discord while it accents rhythm with a big beat. In fact, the anapestic beat [two short beats, a long beat, then a pause] used by many rock musicians actually is the exact opposite of our heart and arterial rhythms [thereby causing an immediate loss of body strength].\"\n[Dr. Diamond confirms Dr. Nobel's findings and adds that the stopped anapestic rhythm \"heightens stress and anger, reduces output, increases hyperactivity, and weakens muscle strength.\" (Admittedly, the technological ability to objectively measure stress and anger is problematical at best, while the measurement of muscle strength is quite precise and meets all the requirements of scientific reliability and statistical significance.)]\n(c) The power of music to communicate is demonstrated in an article\n\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" by David Mazie, in the August 1992\nReader's Digest --\n\"Music reduces staff tension in the operating room,\" says Dr. Clyde L. Nash, Jr. ... \"and also helps relax the patient.\" [He uses classical music such as Vivaldi and Mozart.] Nash is one of many physicians around the country who are finding that music, used with conventional medical therapies, can help the sick in the healing process.\n(d) Clinical researchers at the U.C.L.A. School of Nursing in Los Angeles, and at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta, found that premature babies gained weight faster and were able to use oxygen more efficiently when they listened to soothing music mixed with voices or womb sounds. At Tallahassee (FL) Memorial Regional Medical Center, premature and low-birth-weight infants exposed to an hour and a half of soothing vocal music each day averaged only 11 days in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, compared with 16 days for a control group. At Baltimore's St. Agnes Hospital, classical music was provided in the critical-care units. \"Half an hour of music produced the same effect as ten milligrams of Valium,\" says Dr. Raymond Bahr, head of the coronary-care unit.\nHow does music help? Some studies show it can lower blood pressure, basal-metabolism and respiration rates, thus lessening physiological responses to stress. Other studies suggest music may help increase production of endorphins (natural pain relievers) and S-IgA (Salivary immunoglobulin A). S-IgA speeds healing, reduces the danger of infections, and controls the heart rate. Studies indicate both hemispheres of the brain are involved in processing music. Dr. Sacks explains, \"The neurological basis of musical responses is robust and may even survive damage to both hemispheres\" (\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" 8/92,\nReader's Digest\n).\n\"In conclusion, we can say that insofar as the physical body is concerned, the notion that music has no effect upon man, or that all music is harmless, is absolutely in error\" (Tame, p. 141). (Emphasis added.) \"No longer [can] modern musicians possibly claim that music is a matter of 'taste,' or that the musician should be allowed to perform anything he chooses ...\nEvery moment of music to which we subject ourselves may be enhancing or taking away our ... clarity of consciousness, increment by increment\n\" (Tame, p. 144).\nIn essence, what the medical experts are saying is that today's rock sound (irrespective of the lyrics tacked-on to it in order to classify it as either secular or \"Christian\") fights against the rhythmic nature of man's creation. In the face of such evidence, it is difficult to understand how anyone can maintain that the music itself is neutral.\n-\u00a0 In Tim Fisher's 1992 book,\nThe Battle for Christian Music,\nhe notes: \"Years ago I heard a tape of a man who was defending the neutrality of music in a public service. He walked over to the piano and played a C major chord. Then, he asked the audience if it was a good C major chord or an evil C major chord. After some scattered laughter, he said, 'See, there's no such thing as good or evil music.' He made a rather obvious mistake, however, in his reasoning: a C major chord isn't music! It is a building block of music -- and there's a big difference. ... Why are we willing to admit these facts when it comes to literature, art, sculpture, or any other form of creativity -- but not music? ... When you enter a freshman theory class as a music major in any discipline of music, among the first things you would study are the 'ingredients' (neutral elements) of music: melody, rhythm, and harmony. ... Eventually you would learn to combine these elements into a musical language that communicates what you desire. ... Music always affects us, because music is not neutral\" (pp. 60-63). Other quotes from this book:\n(a) \"Rock music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody is last. ... Rap is the logical extension of the direction in which rock music has been headed. Once you demote certain musical elements into relative unimportance, they will soon disappear altogether. Most of rock music did away with melodic interest a long time ago. Therefore, if melody is unimportant, why have it? This is exactly what rap 'music' has done. It has emphasized rhythm as the only important musical element, while de-emphasizing melody and harmony to the point where they are virtually non-existent. By every good definition of music, rap is not music! It is merely rhythmic entertainment\" (pp. 77,78).\n(b) \"Can you imagine Mozart being played in a bar? Not very likely -- because the music of Mozart isn't compatible with such an atmosphere. Can you imagine singing the Doxology to the tune of 'Stars and Stripes Forever'? Would you receive a blessing by singing the words of 'The Old Rugged Cross' to the Beatles' tune 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand'? These are ridiculous illustrations because the music is obviously incompatible with the message\" (p. 102).\n(c) \"The tragic truth is that most Christians judge the effectiveness of music based upon the yardstick of the flesh, rather than the yardstick of the Spirit. If a song thrills us, we like it. If it doesn't excite us, we don't like it. Too often our opinion of a song is not based on the musical, textual, or even biblical worth of it -- but rather on how it makes us feel. As in so many other areas of life, we take a sensual approach to music\" (p. 104).\n-\u00a0 By attending Christian rock concerts, does not one identify oneself with their ecumenism and their false doctrines and become a partaker of their evil deeds? (The Bible clearly teaches a theology of \"guilt by association\" -- see 2 John 10,11.) And since we will all be accountable to the Lord at the B\u00e9ma Seat for our stewardship with the resources He has entrusted to us while on this earth, how can anyone possibly justify allocating any resources to the support of rock music?\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock music offers no hope -- since it is Spiritless, it can give none. It does not offer heaven, for the music within itself produces a vacuum -- full of sound and fury, but no substance. It provides no foundation to the believer because its birth came from secular rock 'n' roll, which has no basis in God. The approaches of religious rockers all seem to suggest that, \"We must become the world to win the world.\" That method will not work simply because it is outside of God's plan for the proper balancing of Biblically-ordained modes of evangelism with Biblical principles of separation. If one believes at all in the Bible doctrine of \"separation\" from the world (Rom. 12:2), is it not logical to include the Christian's music?\n-\u00a0 Gordon Sears, in his booklet,\nIs Today's Christian Music \"Sacred\"?,\nasks six questions of those who think that CCM is indeed acceptable to God: If the new style and sound of music is of God then:\n(1) Why is it causing so much confusion and division among Christians?;\n(2) Why is it not received by all fundamental Bible-believing churches?;\n(3) Why is it readily accepted by the non-Christian world? The ungodly never accepted the old Christian hymns;\n(4) Why is it that Bible-denying universities and popular secular TV entertainment shows invite well-known Christian artists to give concerts with CCM? This never happened with the great spiritual hymns;\n(5) Why are there hundreds of churches with godly pastors across America that strictly reject it and forbid it in their services?; and\n(6) Why does it have such a strong effect upon the physical body? (As shown earlier, music does have a strong physical effect -- to ignore this would be negligent.)\n-\u00a0 What kind of music truly honors God? Ernest Pickering lists ten primary guidelines for Christians to follow (\nThe Kind of Music That Honors God,\npp. 11-12):\n1. Its message is Scriptural (Col 3:16). Good Christian music must present a message that is true to the Word of God and doctrinally sound.\n2. It should lead us to think in Biblical patterns and not be suggestive of evil either in message or in musical arrangement (Phil. 4:8). The text and music should not be cheap or tawdry.\n3. It should help us to honor God with our bodies (I Cor. 6:19-20). Music which tends to imitate the effects of godless rock upon the human body or which either destroys or impairs one's hearing is not Christian music.\n4. It will maintain a balance between \"spirit\" and \"understanding\" (I Cor. 14:15). Music that is primarily emotional froth would not fulfill this requirement.\n5. It will contain words that are full of beauty, dignity, reverence and simplicity, words that are worthy of the worship of a holy God (Isa. 6:1-6).\n6. It will be free of mental association with worldly musical styles and evidence a holy consecrated character (Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15). Music that seeks to \"copy\" the worldly approach is not honoring to God.\n7. It should be expressive of the peace that accompanies the Christian life, not the clamor, confusion, din, and turmoil of the world (Col. 3:15-16). The various forms of rock music do not contribute to peace of heart but partake of the constant jangle of the sinful world. Christ promises peace to His people (Jn. 14:27).\n8. It should be characterized by musical preciseness, finesse of poetic technique, and should evidence a structure of harmony and order. God is a God of order and not disorder (I Cor. 14:40).\n9. It should promote and accompany a life-style of godliness, modesty, and holy quietness, and not modish fashion, suggestive acts, or sexual aggressiveness (1 Pe. 1:16; Tit. 2:11-12).\n10. It should not contribute to the temptation of new or weak believers (Rom. 14:13,21; 15:2). Music that reminds newly-saved converts of their old life of sin is to be abhorred and rejected.\nThe erosion of musical standards among contemporary Christians parallels the erosion of convictions and practices in other areas as well. It denotes a spirit of compromise with the world which must be vigorously opposed by strong Christian leaders. As in all areas of our lives believers should ever follow the admonition of Paul: \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God\" (I Cor. 10:31).\n-\u00a0 It is our conviction that rock music cannot be used to communicate spiritual truth. (Often the melody in the \"Christian\" version of rock music is obscured and overpowered by the heavy beat -- the accompaniment is so predominant that it completely overpowers any message that might be present.) How can rock music, with its origins in demonic activities, and with its proven adverse medical and \"emotional\" effects, apply to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? Convictions must be based on the Word of God and not personal tastes, likes, and dislikes. Since most of religious rock, or so-called contemporary Christian music, has its roots in, and draws its inspiration from, secular rock 'n' roll, the result is worldliness in the music, and even worse, worldliness\nthrough\nmusic invading the church. Further, it \"authenticates\" the rock sound by having professing Christians playing the music. When one applies the standards of Scripture to this form of worldliness (e.g., II Cor. 6:17; I Thes.5:21, 22; Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15,16; Js.4:4; etc.), the wrongness of such music should be obvious to all who truly desire to please their Lord.\n-\u00a0 Being that the very term\nrock 'n' roll\nidentifies with fornication, and the fact that music for the Christian is deemed to be worship, then the test it must pass is found in Philippians 4:8 -- \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.\" It is difficult to understand how a believer, in good conscience, could partake in that which is, at best, highly questionable. Rock 'n' roll is also so much associated with ungodly and outright Satanic rebellion against God, it is a wonder believers would want to be identified with it in any way. One would think a proper understanding of Ephesians 4:17-24 would be helpful to professing believers involved in rock music:\nThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\nEph. 5:18,19 -- And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing and making melody [music] in your heart to the Lord;\nCol. 3:16 -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\nNote: What is Christian Music?\n(From an editorial response to an ACCC [American Council of Christian Churches] resolution on CCM)\n1. Music is an art. Because music is an art, it must be understood and evaluated in artistic and esthetic categories. Knowing what music is better is not a matter of taste, but of criticism. We may, and often do, develop tastes for things that are worse. Criticism exists to correct our tastes. Critical training and musical accomplishment, however, are different things: many fine performers are incompetent critics.\nStyle is not the major issue in evaluating music. Classicism and romanticism are not styles; fugues and sonatas are not styles; even jazz and rock are not styles. It is far more important to ask what a particular musical form exists to do, and whether a given composer has employed the form adequately for his purpose.\n2. Music is a language. In common with all good art, music is written to say something. Quite apart from any lyrics with which it may be associated, music carries meaning. Of the two, the music speaks more powerfully. The best lyrics can never redeem music which communicates a false message, though second-rate lyrics have often been elevated in the hands of a great composer. It is often pointed out that music communicates subjectively, as if this should preclude our evaluating it. But what is subjective is not therefore unreal. It may be a subjective assertion that sunsets are more pleasant than garbage dumps; it is also a truth. For a person to say that he prefers garbage dumps would alter our judgment of the person, but not of the garbage dump. The question is not what a piece of music means \"to me,\" the question is what it means. This judgment must precede all moral and religious judgments with regard to the composition.\n3. Music is a moral phenomenon. If music conveys meaning, then every musical composition may be judged in moral terms according to its truthfulness and propriety. Herein lies the error of those who claim that God has not revealed what \"style of music He prefers.\" To the contrary, God has clearly told us what He expects of our communications in general and of our worshipful communications in particular. To judge the meaning of a musical piece obligates us to judge its morality.\n4. Music is a Christian duty. This is emphasized, not only by New Testament teaching, but also by those psalms that call upon \"all that hath breath\" to praise God with music. Music is the one art that all God's peoples, in all times and places, are required to practice. Therefore, we had best take it seriously. It is not a public relations tool, nor does it serve a merely social function. It is with music that we worship God and edify one another. We dare not tolerate the tawdry, the base, or the thoughtless.\nThese same psalms name virtually every known category of instrument. We need not ask whether we can worship God with stringed instruments (e.g., guitars). The question is, which guitar: Christopher Parkening's or Jimmy Page's?\n5. Music is the church's heritage. Those who lack critical training must look to the church's past for direction. The apostles did not invent a new music, but adopted the musical heritage of Judaism. Generation by generation this heritage was handed down, elaborated, criticized, corrected, and developed. Medieval plainsong was a direct descendent, and its use led eventually to the development of the various polyphonic forms. The hymnody of the Reformation stands in this tradition, as do the hymns of the Pietists and the Awakeners.\nOnly after the Enlightenment did Christians assume that they could safely dispense with the heritage of the church. Chiefly in America did they wish to ground worship in forms which were separated from the culture of the church. When one speaks of what represents the Body of Christ, he ought to include the whole Body, and not merely the current generation.\nPurveyors of CCM are driven by this rejection of the Christian musical heritage in favor of popular forms. For the record, so were Victorian songwriters like Bliss and Doane, who are more closely related musically to Stryper and Petra than they are to Hassler or Mason. The question is about more than rock. But the breadth of the question should not prevent us from making definite musical choices.\n"}, {"score": 980.18274, "uuid": "e9bf75fb-94c6-5bf8-9962-0a342e173914", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-53-20643", "target_hostname": "www.rapidnet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rapidnet.com/%7Ejbeard/bdm/Psychology/rockm/satanic.htm", "page_rank": 1.1912511e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "&quot;Christian&quot; <em>Rock</em> Music - Christian <em>or</em> Satanic?", "snippet": "Music always affects us, because music <em>is</em> not neutral&quot; (pp. Other quotes from this book: (a) &quot;<em>Rock</em> music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody <em>is</em> last. ... <em>Rap</em> <em>is</em> the logical extension of the direction in <em>which</em> <em>rock</em> music has been headed.", "explanation": null, "document": "-\nChristian Rock?\nby Ric Llewellyn, published by Fundamental Evangelistic Association : This tract carefully details the Biblical screens any music must pass before it can be labeled as \"Christian\" (Eph. 5:18,19; Col. 3:16); i.e., the music must be a channel for correct doctrine, and (a) its lyrics should be edifying, spiritually oriented, clear, conforming to Biblical truth, and point our focus to Jesus Christ, (b) its score (the arrangement of the musical notes) should not overshadow the message conveyed by the lyrics, but should compliment it, and (c) its character (the \"attitudes\" in the music and of the performers) should be consistent with the purity of the message it claims to convey (reverence, worshipful, etc.). (Each of the above screens must stand on its own; i.e., one \"good\" aspect of the music's nature cannot sanctify any of the others.) (Please refer to Eph. 5:18,19 and Col. 3:16 at the end of this report .)\n(a) Lyrics -- Our\nspiritual songs\nmust be sufficiently clear so as to convey the truth plainly, and must be consistent with Biblical revelation (i.e., sound doctrine) -- the words should focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ and encourage practical submission to God's order in all our personal affairs. Most contemporary Christian music (CCM) can be rejected on the basis of lyrics alone -- even when the lyrics are audibly clear, the predominance of false doctrine and/or the shallow view of the person and work of Jesus Christ is often appalling.\n(b) Score -- The meaning of the word\npsalms\noriginally denoted a striking or twitching with the fingers (on musical strings); only later did it come to mean a sacred song sung to musical accompaniment (\nVine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\n). Our\npsalms\n, or the arrangement of the musical notes, is a vital ingredient of the all-encompassing term we call \"music.\" This is because it is the area in which we are usually the most ignorant; i.e., medical research clearly supports the contention that musical tones and rhythms in and of themselves (i.e., without lyrics) can cause physical and \"emotional\" reactions over which the listener may have little or no control. Since the score of contemporary Christian rock music, with its syncopation and slurring of notes, is virtually indistinguishable from its secular counterpart, one has to wonder if spirituality is being eroded and carnality is being propagated. (One should always assess \"Christian\" music thusly: \"Does it stir the flesh to 'boogie,' or the spirit to praise the Lord?\")\n(c) Character -- Our\nhymns,\nor the character of the music, is its most obscure component. The character of much of what is called \"Christian\" music may best be characterized as charismatic , irreverent, universalist, socialist utopian idealistic, superficial religiousness, neo-evangelical , expressionistic, ostentatious, or in a myriad of other contexts (e.g.; What is the character of the music at a so-called Christian rock concert when whatever message is presented is punctuated by screaming guitars, smoke bombs, and a general atmosphere of frivolity?) And because the character of the music is not always readily apparent to the listener, it can have the most insidious effect on believers; i.e., tolerance or acceptance of false doctrine can arise from constant subjection to deficient and improper attitudes in music. The character of \"Christian\" music is easily adopted by listeners, which can then draw them away from the firm foundation of the Word. Music worthy of the name \"Christian\" ought to stimulate and simulate emotions compatible with true spirituality -- the appropriate response to God and His Word.\n-\u00a0 Larry Norman is frequently dubbed \"the father of Christian rock.\" Norman makes the incredulous statement that rock 'n' roll music originated in the Church hundreds of years ago, and that the devil stole it!! Therefore, Norman's battle cry is to \"take rock music back for Jesus' sake!\" (Since rock 'n' roll music did not even come into being until the early 1950s, Norman is obviously unable to provide one shred of evidence for this claim). Norman titles one of his songs, \"Why Should the Devil Have All The Good Music,\" and in another song he refers to Christ (at His return for His Church) as an \"Unidentified Flying Object.\" In still another song, he pitifully trivializes the Gospel of the Resurrection with the following lyrics:\nThey nailed Him to a cross;\nThey put Him in the ground;\nJust goes to show you;\nCan't keep a good Man down.\n-\u00a0 The origin of rock music and the term\nrock 'n' roll\nare interesting ones. In the early 1950s, a disk-jockey named Alan Freed was one of the first white people to be involved in \"rhythm & blues\" music, which was the direct forerunner of rock 'n' roll. (The complete genealogy of rock 'n' roll music is: voodoo to jazz to blues to rock 'n' roll [David Tame,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\npp. 187-204].) Rock 'n' roll was a kind of fusion between rhythm & blues and country & western music. Freed was one of the first white people to play this new rhythm & blues/country combination on his radio program, and was perplexed as to what to call it since it obviously needed a new name. Freed had been receiving bizarre reports concerning kids' reactions to this new music, so decided to name it after a ghetto term that black people used for pre-marital sex in the back seat of a car -- hence, the term \"rock 'n' roll\" was coined.\nContrast the above true account of the origin of rock 'n' roll music with that told us by the so-called \"Christian\" rock band Petra in the lyrics of one of their songs; i.e., that God was the source of rock 'n' roll!:\nGod gave rock 'n' roll to you,\nPut it in the soul of everyone,\nIf you love the sound,\nAnd don't forget the Source,\nYou can turn-a-round,\nYou can change your course.\n-\u00a0 There appears to be a parallel between the attempt today to \"Christianize\" rock music and the \"Christianization\" of various pagan religious practices in fourth century Rome. The Babylonian mystery religions were introduced into Christianity by Constantine in 313 A.D. as he tried to incorporate the pagans into the newly constituted \"Holy\" Roman Empire. The Constantine-led Roman church was willing to adapt and adopt pagan practices in order to make Christianity palatable to the heathen. The heathen festivals were adopted into Christianity, and then eventually, many of the associated pagan symbols and actions were reinterpreted in ways acceptable to Christian faith and practice. \"Christianization\" of pagan customs, symbols, etc., occurred as Christianity had to undergo a transformation so that pagans could \"convert\" without giving up their old beliefs and rituals.\nHas not the modern church of today done much of the same adoption, reinterpretation, and \"Christianization\" of what is called \"rock music\" in order to make Christianity more palatable to the \"teenaged\" lost? And does not this approach smack of the traditional Roman Catholic method of making converts from pagans? -- first adopt the pagan practices, and then reapply Biblical meaning to them. In this manner, the former pagans can retain their pagan idolatrous heritage by merely renaming the idols and changing the terminology used in the worship of them.\n-\u00a0 Those today who are able to clearly see the error and futility of \"Christianizing\" secular psychology and its psychotherapies by merely relabeling them as \"Christian\" psychology and \"Christian\" psychiatric clinics, somehow are unable to see that they have incorporated the same erroneous relabeling process by taking secular rock music, adopting \"Christian\" lyrics, and renaming it \"Christian\" rock. Since when does something become Christian by merely \"Christianizing\" the terminology and placing Christ's name in front of it? Are we not to call the lost out of the culture (world) to repentance and righteousness, rather than imitate the culture (world)?:\n(a) \"Christian rock [music] is the daughter of worldly rock. It tries to make the Christian message more appealing to the world by using a worldly medium. ... Charismatics and New Evangelicals have tried to Christianize demonic rock music, mixing holy with unholy, to reach today's young people. They said, 'To win them, we must speak their language.' But when they won them, what did they win them to? Whatever weak Gospel message [might be there] is lost in the process. May we similarly \"Christianize\" liquor by putting a Gospel message on the bottle label, and have Christians buy and promote it to reach drunks for Jesus? A good goal does not justify unscriptural methods\" (8/15/89,\nCalvary Contender\n).\n(b) \"For those whose eyes have not seen and whose ears have not heard, Contemporary Christian Music, or CCM as the insiders call it, is essentially conventional rock or pop music with the lyrics changed to protect the innocent\" (James Chute,\nThe Milwaukee Journal\n).\n(c) \"... what many in the church today seem to believe: you must have an angle to present the gospel to a hostile world ... It has opened the door to some bizarre evangelistic strategies. The church apes nearly every fad of secular society. Heavy metal rock, rap, graffiti, break dancing, body building, brick smashing, jazzercize, interpretive dance, and stand-up comedy all have been added to the evangelical repertoire. ... It is nothing but hedonism under the guise of religion. Many assume that without some gimmick, the gospel message just won't reach people, and unless we accommodate it to the fashion of our day, we can't hope for it to be effective. ... Thus modern churches feel they must plan and program for attracting unbelievers who cannot be persuaded with revealed truth ...\" (\nOur Sufficiency in Christ\n, pp. 145-146). (Emphasis added.) [Please don't take the use of this quote as an endorsement of the book's author or of his ministry.]\n-\u00a0 The advocates of the \"modern sound\" declare themselves to be in good company: \"Did not the [so-called] great church father, Martin Luther , take the tavern songs of the day and fit them out with Christian words, thus sanctifying the Devil's tunes for the Lord's work?\" This argument, often heard, borders on the ridiculous if one has any understanding of the situation in Luther's time. Carl Johansson, in a very fine and scholarly work, makes this observation (\nMusic and Ministry: A Biblical Counterpoint,\np. 50):\n\"But the thrust of the popular music of Luther's time and the thrust of our pop music is as different as night is from day. There was a systematic unity in the sixteenth century musical world which no longer exists in today's music. ... The popular music of the time had a folk-like character far removed from modern-day pop.\"\nSays another authority concerning those sixteenth century times [during which the culture was the church and the church the culture]: \"A difference between sacred and secular music hardly existed\" (Eric Bloom, ed.,\nGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians,\n5th edition, I, p. 848).\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock groups almost always state that the purpose of their music is for evangelism and/or entertainment. Although Scripture records various folk songs, work songs, battle songs, etc., the Bible teaches that the God-approved purpose or use of music is primarily for worship, praise, edification, and the teaching of doctrine (e.g., Exo. 15:1,2,20,21; I Chron. 15:27,28; 16:9,23; II Chron. 20:21,22; Psa. 95:2; 105:2; Acts 16:25; Eph. 5:18, 19; Col. 3:16). Over fifty psalms were dedicated to the chief musician to be used in worship, and in heaven the 24 elders and angelic beings will also be using music in worship (Rev. 5:8 ff.).\nAlthough godly music can have an evangelistic purpose or result (e.g., Psa. 96:1-3; 108:3), it is not used primarily for this in Scripture. In fact, nowhere in the Bible does it say, \"\nSing\nthe gospel of Christ.\" It says to\npreach\nit! God can certainly use music to bring somebody to Christ, but there has to be a presentation of the gospel somewhere along the line. Our music is primarily an expression of a Spirit-filled life, not really intended for the world's consumption. We seem to want so much to sing our songs to the world that we put them in the world's vernacular and think it's going to be evangelistic.\nSo even if one could find nothing wrong with the lyrics, the score, the character, and/or the effect of \"Christian\" rock music, one would still have to question why the modern day, self-proclaimed musical evangelists/entertainers persist in using their music in endeavors where there is no clear Biblical precedent; i.e., although mentioned over 800 times in Scripture, music is never used for entertainment or for direct evangelism or for any end within itself. Music in the Bible is used primarily in praise and in worship, either to God (e.g., I Chron. 16:9,23; II Chron. 29:30; Psa. 9:11; 30:4; 33:2,3; 47:6; 135:3; etc.) or to Satan (e.g., Dan. 3:4,5,7,10,15; Exo. 32:17,18).\n-\u00a0 Since the religious rockers almost always maintain that they are simply trying to reach people for Jesus, then why not go totally secular and leave out the appeal to the church altogether? Why bother with the crowd that's already saved? (Of course, since about 80% of religious rockers' income is derived through \"Christian\" bookstores, we already know the answer to that question.) It is our conviction that the religious rockers are not reaching the lost, but are instead making disciples to their rock music from the churched kids attending their concerts or playing their recordings. In fact, there is a good chance that the church could be losing the so-called \"found\" by bringing rock music into the sanctuary.\nJesus said that when He was lifted up, He would draw all men to Himself. Why then would the Holy Spirit need help today from the world's music in drawing people to Christ? Why do the \"musical soul-winners\" think they can attract people for God by using the world's standards and the world's music, when the net effect of the music is to basically stir the flesh and the emotions rather than stir a love for God?\n-\u00a0 When people generally speak of the evils of secular rock music, they often refer to the supposedly evil and/or satanic messages that are covertly placed in the minds of the listeners through a method called \"back-masking.\" The theory behind back-masking is that messages that are below the audio level (reversed messages in this case) will be received by the \"unconscious mind,\" thus bypassing conscious evaluation, and then at some time in the future, are able to affect the behavior of the listener. This idea of the unconscious receiving messages directly through finer perceptive mechanisms than available to the conscious mind is based upon Freud's thoroughly discredited theory of the unconscious -- discredited because the theory has not been supported either neurologically or practically. Moreover, the Freudian unconscious is in direct conflict with the Word of God, which is consciously and volitionally oriented. [See also a 9/96 AP story: researchers report that if there is any effect from subliminal messages , the influence on the mind is minimal, having a duration of 1/10 of a second at most! -- 9/20/96,\nThe Bloomington Herald-Times,\n\"Effect of subliminal messages extremely brief, scientists say,\" p. 12.]\nWe do not doubt that back-masked messages have in fact been recorded, but since there is no proof that the human mind is capable of even receiving these messages, their effect on human behavior must obviously be zero. (In fact, in a court case a number of years ago involving the British rock band Judas Priest, the band was accused of culpability in the suicide deaths of two teenagers who had allegedly killed themselves as a result of acting upon the back-masked \"subliminal\" messages on the band's recordings. The band was found not guilty, not because the subliminal messages were not recorded (they\nwere\nrecorded), but because the scientific evidence presented at the trial was overwhelmingly convincing that subliminal messages just don't work!)\nTherefore, it is quite disturbing to hear that so-called Christian musicians have also been getting involved with the back-masking of \"Christian messages\" on their recordings, under the guise of \"subliminal evangelism.\" Some have even made the incredulous claim that, unbeknownst to them, the Holy Spirit Himself did the back-masking!! Even assuming their ignorance of the non-efficacy of back-masking, are not these musicians in effect saying that the Holy Spirit needs to resort to trickery in order save sinners. Do they believe that the Word of God, preached clearly and without deceit, is no longer capable of convicting men and calling them out for salvation? (See\nPsychoHeresy Update,\nWinter 1991, for a more thorough discussion of subliminals and back-masking.)\n-\u00a0 That music can be used for evil is clear from Scripture. Lucifer was created with a wealth of musical talents, which were evidently to be used for directing the angelic host in the worship of God (Ezek. 28:13 [KJV]). Lucifer's fall (Ezek. 28:11-19) evidently led to the perversion of music (as well as to the perversion of most everything else), so that its improper use could actually be offensive to God (Amos 5:23; 6:5). That music can have a powerful influence on ones emotions, mood, or state of being is clearly taught in Scripture (e.g., I Samuel 16:15-17, 23; II Ki. 3:15).\nNevertheless, some so-called Christian music experts (e.g., Christians with university degrees in music) continue to say that music is amoral (rather than moral or immoral), and, thus, has\nno\npower to lead one into sin. This is said regardless of the Biblical record previously cited. Even the scientific research indicates otherwise. Some even say it is improper to quote an unbeliever's research regarding the moral or scientific effects of music. From the \"moral\" perspective, just as there is nothing inherently evil in the culture, even unbelievers know what is moral or not (Romans 2). Regarding science, we quote scientific research of believers and unbelievers alike. It should be perfectly clear that we do not place such scientific evidence above Biblical truth. Since Scripture needs no scientific verification or research support, the medical effects of music are cited for the same reason the Christian should be interested in the medical effects of drugs or certain foods or the effects of shock waves from an explosion -- mere exposure to these things can lead to unintended and unwanted physical side effects.\n-\u00a0 David Tame (an unbeliever), in his 1984 book,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\nnot only further demonstrates the moral nature of music, but he also reveals extensive medical research demonstrating the destructive effects of rock music (on both the mind [emotions] and the body): [See the abbreviated bibliography at the end of this report for additional reference materials that details some more of the extensive research (including scientific) that has been conducted concerning the effects of music.]\n(a) In commenting on the origin and the morality of rock music, Tame says, \"... a certain cross-fertilization was becoming apparent between the 'new music' and the general jazz and rock style. It came to be seen that the technical differences between 'serious' music, jazz, rock, or any other form of modern music were less important than the underlying factor that their philosophical basis was more or less one and the same: hedonism and anarchy\" (p. 103). (Emphasis added.)\n(b) \"In the rock industry, money is basically what it is all about; and thus music is directed, not upward ... but to the lowest common denominator. The question of questions is\nWill it sell?\nThe standard of artistry could not be less relevant\" (p. 116).\n(c) \"Were we to scour the globe in search of the most aggressively malevolent and unmistakably evil music is existence, it is more than likely that nothing would be found anywhere to surpass voodoo in these attributes ... as the rhythmic accompaniment to satanic rituals and orgies, voodoo is the quintessence of tonal evil. ... Its multiple rhythms [score], rather than uniting into an integrated whole, are performed in a certain kind of conflict with one another. ... What is certain is that to hear this music is to become instantly encompassed by the sound of its raw, livid power. ... Musicologists and historians are in no doubt that the drum rhythms of Africa were carried to America and were transmitted and translated into the style of music which became known as jazz. Since jazz and the blues were the parents of rock and roll, this also means that there exists a direct line of descent from the voodoo ceremonies of Africa, through jazz, to rock and roll and all the other forms of rock music today\" (pp. 189-190). (Emphasis added.)\n(d) \"In the one corner: the ancients and traditionalists; the conviction that music affects character and society, and that therefore the artist has a duty to be responsibly moral and constructive, not immoral and destructive. In the other corner: the materialists; disclaiming responsibility and the need for value judgments, paying no heed to the outcome of their sounds. The second camp contains not only the radical avant-garde, but the entire mass of the much more popular and culturally significant jazz and rock musicians. Who, then, is correct? ...\nDo life patterns follow music patterns or do they not?\n\" (p. 136). Tame goes on to cite extensive research that overwhelmingly supports the contentions of the traditionalists: that music in general can be, and rock music specifically is, a negative influence on both the physical body and moral nature of man.\n(e) \"To the question, 'Does music affect man's physical body?,' modern research applies in the clear affirmative.\nThere is scarcely a single function of the body which cannot be affected by musical tones\n[score] ... Investigation has shown that music affects digestion, internal secretions, circulation, nutrition and respiration. Even neural networks of the brain have been found to be sensitive to harmonic principles\" (p. 136). (Emphasis added.)\n(f) \"Researchers have discovered that consonant and dissonant chords, different intervals, and other features of music [score] all exert a profound effect upon man's pulse and respiration -- upon their rate and upon whether their rhythm is constant, or interrupted and jumpy. Blood pressure is lowered by sustained chords and raised by crisp, repeated ones. [It has also been found that the tension of the larynx is affected by melodies, that sound stimuli can have a negative effect upon the skeletal muscles, that rock rhythms cause the heart beat to lose its perfect rhythm, and that certain rhythms can even cause a rare malady known as \"musicogenic epilepsy\" (76 documented cases as of 1984), with which some of its victims have been tormented to the point of committing suicide or murder.] ... We can see, then, that music affects the body in two distinct ways: directly, as the effect of sound upon the cells and organs, and indirectly, by affecting the emotions, which then in turn influence numerous bodily processes\" (p. 137). (Emphasis added.)\nJulius Portnoy has also found that not only can music [score] \"change metabolism, affect muscular energy, raise or lower blood pressure, and influence digestion,\" but \"It may be able to do all these things more successfully ... than any other stimulants that produce those changes in our bodies\" (p. 138). Musicologist Alice Monsarrat points out that it \"is precisely at this point that rock 'n' roll ... becomes potentially dangerous. This is because, to maintain a sense of well-being and integration, it is essential that man is not subjected too much to any rhythms not in accord with his natural bodily rhythms\" (p. 199).\n(g) Extensive research has also been conducted on the effects of music upon non-human life, both animals and plants. Paradoxical as it may seem, plant experiments concerning the effects of music upon life are even more convincing than human experiments -- that music does affect life, including human life. This is because in plant experiments the effect of the mind's subjective preconditioning and subjective reaction to the music, or one's \"feeling\" for the music, or one's personal tastes in music, have obviously all been removed; i.e., if music [score] can be shown to affect plants, then such effects have to be due to the objective influence of the musical tones and rhythms directly upon the cells and processes of the life-form itself. (It is also easier to set-up a valid, scientifically controlled experiment with plant life than with human life.)\nThe plant research findings are solidly in the traditionalist camp: not only did rock music stunt the growth of a wide variety of plants, but if played long enough, the plants actually died. And even more startling were the findings of Dr. T.C. Singh, head of the Botany Department at Annamalia University, India. His experiments demonstrated that not only did certain forms of music and certain musical instruments (specifically, classical music and the violin) cause plants to grow at twice their normal speed, but that later generations of the seeds of musically stimulated plants carried on the improved traits of greater size, more leaves, etc.! Presumably, the same effect can result in the negative sense, from bad music. The possible significance of Dr. Singh's findings to human life is evident, and should be at least a little disconcerting to rock music fans (pp. 141-145).\n(h) \"Like human nature itself, music cannot possibly be neutral in its spiritual direction ... ultimately all uses of tone [score] and all musical lyrics can be classified according to their spiritual direction, upward or downward. ... To put it plainly, music tends to be of either the darkness or of the light\" (p. 187). In his famous work,\nLaws,\nPlato lamented the musical revolution of his time and its \"unmusical anarchy\": \"Through foolishness they deceived themselves into thinking that there was no right or wrong in music -- that it was to be judged good or bad by the pleasure it gave. By their work and their theories they infected the masses with the presumption to think themselves adequate judges. ... As it was, the criterion was not music, but a reputation for promiscuous cleverness and a spirit of lawbreaking\" (p. 189).\n(i) In his closing comments on the roots of music styles and rhythms, David Tame, with a keen \"spiritual\" insight often lacking in many believers today, takes particular offense with rock music: \"More than any other form of the misuse of sound, it is rock with which we must deal today. ... It is a global phenomenon; a pounding, pounding destructive beat which is heard from America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia. Its effect upon the soul is to make nigh-impossible the true inner silence and peace necessary for the contemplation of eternal verities. ... How necessary is it in this age for some to have the courage to be the ones who are 'different', and to separate themselves out from the pack who long ago sold their lives and personalities to this sound. ... I adamantly believe that rock in all its forms is a critical problem which our civilization\nmust\nget to grips. ... if it wishes long to survive\" (p. 204). (Emphasis added.)\nFor the world, it is impossible to separate from the lure of the pleasures of the flesh; they have no desire to do so nor do they have the power to do so if they did desire. But what reasons do we as Christians have to ignore our Lord's command to come out and be separate? Instead, we adopt the world's music in all its destructive forms [score and character], add Christian lyrics to it, and think we are being pleasing to the Lord and are a testimony of holiness to an unbelieving world. How pathetic!\n-\u00a0 More recent medical research (than that cited by Tame) also disputes the notion of the supposed \"neutrality\" of music:\n(a) Dr. John Diamond, a medical doctor, has conducted extensive research on the medical effects of music. He has noted that man is rhythmic in respiration, heartbeat, pulse, speech, and gait, and when the rhythm of music corresponds to the natural body rhythms, it produces feelings of ecstasy, alertness, and peace, and it energizes the mind and body, and facilitates balance and self-control. (These secular medical findings are also supported by Scripture [I Samuel 16:15-17,23]).\n(b) Dr. David Nobel, another medical doctor and an authority on music, has done extensive research on the value of music rhythms [score] corresponding to body rhythms. He writes that, \"None of these qualities accrue to the rock sound. Instead, rock contains harmonic dissonance and melodic discord while it accents rhythm with a big beat. In fact, the anapestic beat [two short beats, a long beat, then a pause] used by many rock musicians actually is the exact opposite of our heart and arterial rhythms [thereby causing an immediate loss of body strength].\"\n[Dr. Diamond confirms Dr. Nobel's findings and adds that the stopped anapestic rhythm \"heightens stress and anger, reduces output, increases hyperactivity, and weakens muscle strength.\" (Admittedly, the technological ability to objectively measure stress and anger is problematical at best, while the measurement of muscle strength is quite precise and meets all the requirements of scientific reliability and statistical significance.)]\n(c) The power of music to communicate is demonstrated in an article\n\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" by David Mazie, in the August 1992\nReader's Digest --\n\"Music reduces staff tension in the operating room,\" says Dr. Clyde L. Nash, Jr. ... \"and also helps relax the patient.\" [He uses classical music such as Vivaldi and Mozart.] Nash is one of many physicians around the country who are finding that music, used with conventional medical therapies, can help the sick in the healing process.\n(d) Clinical researchers at the U.C.L.A. School of Nursing in Los Angeles, and at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta, found that premature babies gained weight faster and were able to use oxygen more efficiently when they listened to soothing music mixed with voices or womb sounds. At Tallahassee (FL) Memorial Regional Medical Center, premature and low-birth-weight infants exposed to an hour and a half of soothing vocal music each day averaged only 11 days in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, compared with 16 days for a control group. At Baltimore's St. Agnes Hospital, classical music was provided in the critical-care units. \"Half an hour of music produced the same effect as ten milligrams of Valium,\" says Dr. Raymond Bahr, head of the coronary-care unit.\nHow does music help? Some studies show it can lower blood pressure, basal-metabolism and respiration rates, thus lessening physiological responses to stress. Other studies suggest music may help increase production of endorphins (natural pain relievers) and S-IgA (Salivary immunoglobulin A). S-IgA speeds healing, reduces the danger of infections, and controls the heart rate. Studies indicate both hemispheres of the brain are involved in processing music. Dr. Sacks explains, \"The neurological basis of musical responses is robust and may even survive damage to both hemispheres\" (\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" 8/92,\nReader's Digest\n).\n\"In conclusion, we can say that insofar as the physical body is concerned, the notion that music has no effect upon man, or that all music is harmless, is absolutely in error\" (Tame, p. 141). (Emphasis added.) \"No longer [can] modern musicians possibly claim that music is a matter of 'taste,' or that the musician should be allowed to perform anything he chooses ...\nEvery moment of music to which we subject ourselves may be enhancing or taking away our ... clarity of consciousness, increment by increment\n\" (Tame, p. 144).\nIn essence, what the medical experts are saying is that today's rock sound (irrespective of the lyrics tacked-on to it in order to classify it as either secular or \"Christian\") fights against the rhythmic nature of man's creation. In the face of such evidence, it is difficult to understand how anyone can maintain that the music itself is neutral.\n-\u00a0 In Tim Fisher's 1992 book,\nThe Battle for Christian Music,\nhe notes: \"Years ago I heard a tape of a man who was defending the neutrality of music in a public service. He walked over to the piano and played a C major chord. Then, he asked the audience if it was a good C major chord or an evil C major chord. After some scattered laughter, he said, 'See, there's no such thing as good or evil music.' He made a rather obvious mistake, however, in his reasoning: a C major chord isn't music! It is a building block of music -- and there's a big difference. ... Why are we willing to admit these facts when it comes to literature, art, sculpture, or any other form of creativity -- but not music? ... When you enter a freshman theory class as a music major in any discipline of music, among the first things you would study are the 'ingredients' (neutral elements) of music: melody, rhythm, and harmony. ... Eventually you would learn to combine these elements into a musical language that communicates what you desire. ... Music always affects us, because music is not neutral\" (pp. 60-63). Other quotes from this book:\n(a) \"Rock music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody is last. ... Rap is the logical extension of the direction in which rock music has been headed. Once you demote certain musical elements into relative unimportance, they will soon disappear altogether. Most of rock music did away with melodic interest a long time ago. Therefore, if melody is unimportant, why have it? This is exactly what rap 'music' has done. It has emphasized rhythm as the only important musical element, while de-emphasizing melody and harmony to the point where they are virtually non-existent. By every good definition of music, rap is not music! It is merely rhythmic entertainment\" (pp. 77,78).\n(b) \"Can you imagine Mozart being played in a bar? Not very likely -- because the music of Mozart isn't compatible with such an atmosphere. Can you imagine singing the Doxology to the tune of 'Stars and Stripes Forever'? Would you receive a blessing by singing the words of 'The Old Rugged Cross' to the Beatles' tune 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand'? These are ridiculous illustrations because the music is obviously incompatible with the message\" (p. 102).\n(c) \"The tragic truth is that most Christians judge the effectiveness of music based upon the yardstick of the flesh, rather than the yardstick of the Spirit. If a song thrills us, we like it. If it doesn't excite us, we don't like it. Too often our opinion of a song is not based on the musical, textual, or even biblical worth of it -- but rather on how it makes us feel. As in so many other areas of life, we take a sensual approach to music\" (p. 104).\n-\u00a0 By attending Christian rock concerts, does not one identify oneself with their ecumenism and their false doctrines and become a partaker of their evil deeds? (The Bible clearly teaches a theology of \"guilt by association\" -- see 2 John 10,11.) And since we will all be accountable to the Lord at the B\u00e9ma Seat for our stewardship with the resources He has entrusted to us while on this earth, how can anyone possibly justify allocating any resources to the support of rock music?\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock music offers no hope -- since it is Spiritless, it can give none. It does not offer heaven, for the music within itself produces a vacuum -- full of sound and fury, but no substance. It provides no foundation to the believer because its birth came from secular rock 'n' roll, which has no basis in God. The approaches of religious rockers all seem to suggest that, \"We must become the world to win the world.\" That method will not work simply because it is outside of God's plan for the proper balancing of Biblically-ordained modes of evangelism with Biblical principles of separation. If one believes at all in the Bible doctrine of \"separation\" from the world (Rom. 12:2), is it not logical to include the Christian's music?\n-\u00a0 Gordon Sears, in his booklet,\nIs Today's Christian Music \"Sacred\"?,\nasks six questions of those who think that CCM is indeed acceptable to God: If the new style and sound of music is of God then:\n(1) Why is it causing so much confusion and division among Christians?;\n(2) Why is it not received by all fundamental Bible-believing churches?;\n(3) Why is it readily accepted by the non-Christian world? The ungodly never accepted the old Christian hymns;\n(4) Why is it that Bible-denying universities and popular secular TV entertainment shows invite well-known Christian artists to give concerts with CCM? This never happened with the great spiritual hymns;\n(5) Why are there hundreds of churches with godly pastors across America that strictly reject it and forbid it in their services?; and\n(6) Why does it have such a strong effect upon the physical body? (As shown earlier, music does have a strong physical effect -- to ignore this would be negligent.)\n-\u00a0 What kind of music truly honors God? Ernest Pickering lists ten primary guidelines for Christians to follow (\nThe Kind of Music That Honors God,\npp. 11-12):\n1. Its message is Scriptural (Col 3:16). Good Christian music must present a message that is true to the Word of God and doctrinally sound.\n2. It should lead us to think in Biblical patterns and not be suggestive of evil either in message or in musical arrangement (Phil. 4:8). The text and music should not be cheap or tawdry.\n3. It should help us to honor God with our bodies (I Cor. 6:19-20). Music which tends to imitate the effects of godless rock upon the human body or which either destroys or impairs one's hearing is not Christian music.\n4. It will maintain a balance between \"spirit\" and \"understanding\" (I Cor. 14:15). Music that is primarily emotional froth would not fulfill this requirement.\n5. It will contain words that are full of beauty, dignity, reverence and simplicity, words that are worthy of the worship of a holy God (Isa. 6:1-6).\n6. It will be free of mental association with worldly musical styles and evidence a holy consecrated character (Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15). Music that seeks to \"copy\" the worldly approach is not honoring to God.\n7. It should be expressive of the peace that accompanies the Christian life, not the clamor, confusion, din, and turmoil of the world (Col. 3:15-16). The various forms of rock music do not contribute to peace of heart but partake of the constant jangle of the sinful world. Christ promises peace to His people (Jn. 14:27).\n8. It should be characterized by musical preciseness, finesse of poetic technique, and should evidence a structure of harmony and order. God is a God of order and not disorder (I Cor. 14:40).\n9. It should promote and accompany a life-style of godliness, modesty, and holy quietness, and not modish fashion, suggestive acts, or sexual aggressiveness (1 Pe. 1:16; Tit. 2:11-12).\n10. It should not contribute to the temptation of new or weak believers (Rom. 14:13,21; 15:2). Music that reminds newly-saved converts of their old life of sin is to be abhorred and rejected.\nThe erosion of musical standards among contemporary Christians parallels the erosion of convictions and practices in other areas as well. It denotes a spirit of compromise with the world which must be vigorously opposed by strong Christian leaders. As in all areas of our lives believers should ever follow the admonition of Paul: \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God\" (I Cor. 10:31).\n-\u00a0 It is our conviction that rock music cannot be used to communicate spiritual truth. (Often the melody in the \"Christian\" version of rock music is obscured and overpowered by the heavy beat -- the accompaniment is so predominant that it completely overpowers any message that might be present.) How can rock music, with its origins in demonic activities, and with its proven adverse medical and \"emotional\" effects, apply to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? Convictions must be based on the Word of God and not personal tastes, likes, and dislikes. Since most of religious rock, or so-called contemporary Christian music, has its roots in, and draws its inspiration from, secular rock 'n' roll, the result is worldliness in the music, and even worse, worldliness\nthrough\nmusic invading the church. Further, it \"authenticates\" the rock sound by having professing Christians playing the music. When one applies the standards of Scripture to this form of worldliness (e.g., II Cor. 6:17; I Thes.5:21, 22; Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15,16; Js.4:4; etc.), the wrongness of such music should be obvious to all who truly desire to please their Lord.\n-\u00a0 Being that the very term\nrock 'n' roll\nidentifies with fornication, and the fact that music for the Christian is deemed to be worship, then the test it must pass is found in Philippians 4:8 -- \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.\" It is difficult to understand how a believer, in good conscience, could partake in that which is, at best, highly questionable. Rock 'n' roll is also so much associated with ungodly and outright Satanic rebellion against God, it is a wonder believers would want to be identified with it in any way. One would think a proper understanding of Ephesians 4:17-24 would be helpful to professing believers involved in rock music:\nThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\nEph. 5:18,19 -- And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing and making melody [music] in your heart to the Lord;\nCol. 3:16 -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\nNote: What is Christian Music?\n(From an editorial response to an ACCC [American Council of Christian Churches] resolution on CCM)\n1. Music is an art. Because music is an art, it must be understood and evaluated in artistic and esthetic categories. Knowing what music is better is not a matter of taste, but of criticism. We may, and often do, develop tastes for things that are worse. Criticism exists to correct our tastes. Critical training and musical accomplishment, however, are different things: many fine performers are incompetent critics.\nStyle is not the major issue in evaluating music. Classicism and romanticism are not styles; fugues and sonatas are not styles; even jazz and rock are not styles. It is far more important to ask what a particular musical form exists to do, and whether a given composer has employed the form adequately for his purpose.\n2. Music is a language. In common with all good art, music is written to say something. Quite apart from any lyrics with which it may be associated, music carries meaning. Of the two, the music speaks more powerfully. The best lyrics can never redeem music which communicates a false message, though second-rate lyrics have often been elevated in the hands of a great composer. It is often pointed out that music communicates subjectively, as if this should preclude our evaluating it. But what is subjective is not therefore unreal. It may be a subjective assertion that sunsets are more pleasant than garbage dumps; it is also a truth. For a person to say that he prefers garbage dumps would alter our judgment of the person, but not of the garbage dump. The question is not what a piece of music means \"to me,\" the question is what it means. This judgment must precede all moral and religious judgments with regard to the composition.\n3. Music is a moral phenomenon. If music conveys meaning, then every musical composition may be judged in moral terms according to its truthfulness and propriety. Herein lies the error of those who claim that God has not revealed what \"style of music He prefers.\" To the contrary, God has clearly told us what He expects of our communications in general and of our worshipful communications in particular. To judge the meaning of a musical piece obligates us to judge its morality.\n4. Music is a Christian duty. This is emphasized, not only by New Testament teaching, but also by those psalms that call upon \"all that hath breath\" to praise God with music. Music is the one art that all God's peoples, in all times and places, are required to practice. Therefore, we had best take it seriously. It is not a public relations tool, nor does it serve a merely social function. It is with music that we worship God and edify one another. We dare not tolerate the tawdry, the base, or the thoughtless.\nThese same psalms name virtually every known category of instrument. We need not ask whether we can worship God with stringed instruments (e.g., guitars). The question is, which guitar: Christopher Parkening's or Jimmy Page's?\n5. Music is the church's heritage. Those who lack critical training must look to the church's past for direction. The apostles did not invent a new music, but adopted the musical heritage of Judaism. Generation by generation this heritage was handed down, elaborated, criticized, corrected, and developed. Medieval plainsong was a direct descendent, and its use led eventually to the development of the various polyphonic forms. The hymnody of the Reformation stands in this tradition, as do the hymns of the Pietists and the Awakeners.\nOnly after the Enlightenment did Christians assume that they could safely dispense with the heritage of the church. Chiefly in America did they wish to ground worship in forms which were separated from the culture of the church. When one speaks of what represents the Body of Christ, he ought to include the whole Body, and not merely the current generation.\nPurveyors of CCM are driven by this rejection of the Christian musical heritage in favor of popular forms. For the record, so were Victorian songwriters like Bliss and Doane, who are more closely related musically to Stryper and Petra than they are to Hassler or Mason. The question is about more than rock. But the breadth of the question should not prevent us from making definite musical choices.\n"}, {"score": 979.8764, "uuid": "fe12c72d-99f5-5493-af53-7f1a5141ee17", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-22-02793", "target_hostname": "www.rapidnet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/rockm/satanic.htm", "page_rank": 1.2096699e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "&quot;Christian&quot; <em>Rock</em> Music - Christian <em>or</em> Satanic?", "snippet": "Music always affects us, because music <em>is</em> not neutral&quot; (pp. Other quotes from this book: (a) &quot;<em>Rock</em> music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody <em>is</em> last. ... <em>Rap</em> <em>is</em> the logical extension of the direction in <em>which</em> <em>rock</em> music has been headed.", "explanation": null, "document": "-\nChristian Rock?\nby Ric Llewellyn, published by Fundamental Evangelistic Association : This tract carefully details the Biblical screens any music must pass before it can be labeled as \"Christian\" (Eph. 5:18,19; Col. 3:16); i.e., the music must be a channel for correct doctrine, and (a) its lyrics should be edifying, spiritually oriented, clear, conforming to Biblical truth, and point our focus to Jesus Christ, (b) its score (the arrangement of the musical notes) should not overshadow the message conveyed by the lyrics, but should compliment it, and (c) its character (the \"attitudes\" in the music and of the performers) should be consistent with the purity of the message it claims to convey (reverence, worshipful, etc.). (Each of the above screens must stand on its own; i.e., one \"good\" aspect of the music's nature cannot sanctify any of the others.) (Please refer to Eph. 5:18,19 and Col. 3:16 at the end of this report .)\n(a) Lyrics -- Our\nspiritual songs\nmust be sufficiently clear so as to convey the truth plainly, and must be consistent with Biblical revelation (i.e., sound doctrine) -- the words should focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ and encourage practical submission to God's order in all our personal affairs. Most contemporary Christian music (CCM) can be rejected on the basis of lyrics alone -- even when the lyrics are audibly clear, the predominance of false doctrine and/or the shallow view of the person and work of Jesus Christ is often appalling.\n(b) Score -- The meaning of the word\npsalms\noriginally denoted a striking or twitching with the fingers (on musical strings); only later did it come to mean a sacred song sung to musical accompaniment (\nVine's Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\n). Our\npsalms\n, or the arrangement of the musical notes, is a vital ingredient of the all-encompassing term we call \"music.\" This is because it is the area in which we are usually the most ignorant; i.e., medical research clearly supports the contention that musical tones and rhythms in and of themselves (i.e., without lyrics) can cause physical and \"emotional\" reactions over which the listener may have little or no control. Since the score of contemporary Christian rock music, with its syncopation and slurring of notes, is virtually indistinguishable from its secular counterpart, one has to wonder if spirituality is being eroded and carnality is being propagated. (One should always assess \"Christian\" music thusly: \"Does it stir the flesh to 'boogie,' or the spirit to praise the Lord?\")\n(c) Character -- Our\nhymns,\nor the character of the music, is its most obscure component. The character of much of what is called \"Christian\" music may best be characterized as charismatic , irreverent, universalist, socialist utopian idealistic, superficial religiousness, neo-evangelical , expressionistic, ostentatious, or in a myriad of other contexts (e.g.; What is the character of the music at a so-called Christian rock concert when whatever message is presented is punctuated by screaming guitars, smoke bombs, and a general atmosphere of frivolity?) And because the character of the music is not always readily apparent to the listener, it can have the most insidious effect on believers; i.e., tolerance or acceptance of false doctrine can arise from constant subjection to deficient and improper attitudes in music. The character of \"Christian\" music is easily adopted by listeners, which can then draw them away from the firm foundation of the Word. Music worthy of the name \"Christian\" ought to stimulate and simulate emotions compatible with true spirituality -- the appropriate response to God and His Word.\n-\u00a0 Larry Norman is frequently dubbed \"the father of Christian rock.\" Norman makes the incredulous statement that rock 'n' roll music originated in the Church hundreds of years ago, and that the devil stole it!! Therefore, Norman's battle cry is to \"take rock music back for Jesus' sake!\" (Since rock 'n' roll music did not even come into being until the early 1950s, Norman is obviously unable to provide one shred of evidence for this claim). Norman titles one of his songs, \"Why Should the Devil Have All The Good Music,\" and in another song he refers to Christ (at His return for His Church) as an \"Unidentified Flying Object.\" In still another song, he pitifully trivializes the Gospel of the Resurrection with the following lyrics:\nThey nailed Him to a cross;\nThey put Him in the ground;\nJust goes to show you;\nCan't keep a good Man down.\n-\u00a0 The origin of rock music and the term\nrock 'n' roll\nare interesting ones. In the early 1950s, a disk-jockey named Alan Freed was one of the first white people to be involved in \"rhythm & blues\" music, which was the direct forerunner of rock 'n' roll. (The complete genealogy of rock 'n' roll music is: voodoo to jazz to blues to rock 'n' roll [David Tame,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\npp. 187-204].) Rock 'n' roll was a kind of fusion between rhythm & blues and country & western music. Freed was one of the first white people to play this new rhythm & blues/country combination on his radio program, and was perplexed as to what to call it since it obviously needed a new name. Freed had been receiving bizarre reports concerning kids' reactions to this new music, so decided to name it after a ghetto term that black people used for pre-marital sex in the back seat of a car -- hence, the term \"rock 'n' roll\" was coined.\nContrast the above true account of the origin of rock 'n' roll music with that told us by the so-called \"Christian\" rock band Petra in the lyrics of one of their songs; i.e., that God was the source of rock 'n' roll!:\nGod gave rock 'n' roll to you,\nPut it in the soul of everyone,\nIf you love the sound,\nAnd don't forget the Source,\nYou can turn-a-round,\nYou can change your course.\n-\u00a0 There appears to be a parallel between the attempt today to \"Christianize\" rock music and the \"Christianization\" of various pagan religious practices in fourth century Rome. The Babylonian mystery religions were introduced into Christianity by Constantine in 313 A.D. as he tried to incorporate the pagans into the newly constituted \"Holy\" Roman Empire. The Constantine-led Roman church was willing to adapt and adopt pagan practices in order to make Christianity palatable to the heathen. The heathen festivals were adopted into Christianity, and then eventually, many of the associated pagan symbols and actions were reinterpreted in ways acceptable to Christian faith and practice. \"Christianization\" of pagan customs, symbols, etc., occurred as Christianity had to undergo a transformation so that pagans could \"convert\" without giving up their old beliefs and rituals.\nHas not the modern church of today done much of the same adoption, reinterpretation, and \"Christianization\" of what is called \"rock music\" in order to make Christianity more palatable to the \"teenaged\" lost? And does not this approach smack of the traditional Roman Catholic method of making converts from pagans? -- first adopt the pagan practices, and then reapply Biblical meaning to them. In this manner, the former pagans can retain their pagan idolatrous heritage by merely renaming the idols and changing the terminology used in the worship of them.\n-\u00a0 Those today who are able to clearly see the error and futility of \"Christianizing\" secular psychology and its psychotherapies by merely relabeling them as \"Christian\" psychology and \"Christian\" psychiatric clinics, somehow are unable to see that they have incorporated the same erroneous relabeling process by taking secular rock music, adopting \"Christian\" lyrics, and renaming it \"Christian\" rock. Since when does something become Christian by merely \"Christianizing\" the terminology and placing Christ's name in front of it? Are we not to call the lost out of the culture (world) to repentance and righteousness, rather than imitate the culture (world)?:\n(a) \"Christian rock [music] is the daughter of worldly rock. It tries to make the Christian message more appealing to the world by using a worldly medium. ... Charismatics and New Evangelicals have tried to Christianize demonic rock music, mixing holy with unholy, to reach today's young people. They said, 'To win them, we must speak their language.' But when they won them, what did they win them to? Whatever weak Gospel message [might be there] is lost in the process. May we similarly \"Christianize\" liquor by putting a Gospel message on the bottle label, and have Christians buy and promote it to reach drunks for Jesus? A good goal does not justify unscriptural methods\" (8/15/89,\nCalvary Contender\n).\n(b) \"For those whose eyes have not seen and whose ears have not heard, Contemporary Christian Music, or CCM as the insiders call it, is essentially conventional rock or pop music with the lyrics changed to protect the innocent\" (James Chute,\nThe Milwaukee Journal\n).\n(c) \"... what many in the church today seem to believe: you must have an angle to present the gospel to a hostile world ... It has opened the door to some bizarre evangelistic strategies. The church apes nearly every fad of secular society. Heavy metal rock, rap, graffiti, break dancing, body building, brick smashing, jazzercize, interpretive dance, and stand-up comedy all have been added to the evangelical repertoire. ... It is nothing but hedonism under the guise of religion. Many assume that without some gimmick, the gospel message just won't reach people, and unless we accommodate it to the fashion of our day, we can't hope for it to be effective. ... Thus modern churches feel they must plan and program for attracting unbelievers who cannot be persuaded with revealed truth ...\" (\nOur Sufficiency in Christ\n, pp. 145-146). (Emphasis added.) [Please don't take the use of this quote as an endorsement of the book's author or of his ministry.]\n-\u00a0 The advocates of the \"modern sound\" declare themselves to be in good company: \"Did not the [so-called] great church father, Martin Luther , take the tavern songs of the day and fit them out with Christian words, thus sanctifying the Devil's tunes for the Lord's work?\" This argument, often heard, borders on the ridiculous if one has any understanding of the situation in Luther's time. Carl Johansson, in a very fine and scholarly work, makes this observation (\nMusic and Ministry: A Biblical Counterpoint,\np. 50):\n\"But the thrust of the popular music of Luther's time and the thrust of our pop music is as different as night is from day. There was a systematic unity in the sixteenth century musical world which no longer exists in today's music. ... The popular music of the time had a folk-like character far removed from modern-day pop.\"\nSays another authority concerning those sixteenth century times [during which the culture was the church and the church the culture]: \"A difference between sacred and secular music hardly existed\" (Eric Bloom, ed.,\nGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians,\n5th edition, I, p. 848).\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock groups almost always state that the purpose of their music is for evangelism and/or entertainment. Although Scripture records various folk songs, work songs, battle songs, etc., the Bible teaches that the God-approved purpose or use of music is primarily for worship, praise, edification, and the teaching of doctrine (e.g., Exo. 15:1,2,20,21; I Chron. 15:27,28; 16:9,23; II Chron. 20:21,22; Psa. 95:2; 105:2; Acts 16:25; Eph. 5:18, 19; Col. 3:16). Over fifty psalms were dedicated to the chief musician to be used in worship, and in heaven the 24 elders and angelic beings will also be using music in worship (Rev. 5:8 ff.).\nAlthough godly music can have an evangelistic purpose or result (e.g., Psa. 96:1-3; 108:3), it is not used primarily for this in Scripture. In fact, nowhere in the Bible does it say, \"\nSing\nthe gospel of Christ.\" It says to\npreach\nit! God can certainly use music to bring somebody to Christ, but there has to be a presentation of the gospel somewhere along the line. Our music is primarily an expression of a Spirit-filled life, not really intended for the world's consumption. We seem to want so much to sing our songs to the world that we put them in the world's vernacular and think it's going to be evangelistic.\nSo even if one could find nothing wrong with the lyrics, the score, the character, and/or the effect of \"Christian\" rock music, one would still have to question why the modern day, self-proclaimed musical evangelists/entertainers persist in using their music in endeavors where there is no clear Biblical precedent; i.e., although mentioned over 800 times in Scripture, music is never used for entertainment or for direct evangelism or for any end within itself. Music in the Bible is used primarily in praise and in worship, either to God (e.g., I Chron. 16:9,23; II Chron. 29:30; Psa. 9:11; 30:4; 33:2,3; 47:6; 135:3; etc.) or to Satan (e.g., Dan. 3:4,5,7,10,15; Exo. 32:17,18).\n-\u00a0 Since the religious rockers almost always maintain that they are simply trying to reach people for Jesus, then why not go totally secular and leave out the appeal to the church altogether? Why bother with the crowd that's already saved? (Of course, since about 80% of religious rockers' income is derived through \"Christian\" bookstores, we already know the answer to that question.) It is our conviction that the religious rockers are not reaching the lost, but are instead making disciples to their rock music from the churched kids attending their concerts or playing their recordings. In fact, there is a good chance that the church could be losing the so-called \"found\" by bringing rock music into the sanctuary.\nJesus said that when He was lifted up, He would draw all men to Himself. Why then would the Holy Spirit need help today from the world's music in drawing people to Christ? Why do the \"musical soul-winners\" think they can attract people for God by using the world's standards and the world's music, when the net effect of the music is to basically stir the flesh and the emotions rather than stir a love for God?\n-\u00a0 When people generally speak of the evils of secular rock music, they often refer to the supposedly evil and/or satanic messages that are covertly placed in the minds of the listeners through a method called \"back-masking.\" The theory behind back-masking is that messages that are below the audio level (reversed messages in this case) will be received by the \"unconscious mind,\" thus bypassing conscious evaluation, and then at some time in the future, are able to affect the behavior of the listener. This idea of the unconscious receiving messages directly through finer perceptive mechanisms than available to the conscious mind is based upon Freud's thoroughly discredited theory of the unconscious -- discredited because the theory has not been supported either neurologically or practically. Moreover, the Freudian unconscious is in direct conflict with the Word of God, which is consciously and volitionally oriented. [See also a 9/96 AP story: researchers report that if there is any effect from subliminal messages , the influence on the mind is minimal, having a duration of 1/10 of a second at most! -- 9/20/96,\nThe Bloomington Herald-Times,\n\"Effect of subliminal messages extremely brief, scientists say,\" p. 12.]\nWe do not doubt that back-masked messages have in fact been recorded, but since there is no proof that the human mind is capable of even receiving these messages, their effect on human behavior must obviously be zero. (In fact, in a court case a number of years ago involving the British rock band Judas Priest, the band was accused of culpability in the suicide deaths of two teenagers who had allegedly killed themselves as a result of acting upon the back-masked \"subliminal\" messages on the band's recordings. The band was found not guilty, not because the subliminal messages were not recorded (they\nwere\nrecorded), but because the scientific evidence presented at the trial was overwhelmingly convincing that subliminal messages just don't work!)\nTherefore, it is quite disturbing to hear that so-called Christian musicians have also been getting involved with the back-masking of \"Christian messages\" on their recordings, under the guise of \"subliminal evangelism.\" Some have even made the incredulous claim that, unbeknownst to them, the Holy Spirit Himself did the back-masking!! Even assuming their ignorance of the non-efficacy of back-masking, are not these musicians in effect saying that the Holy Spirit needs to resort to trickery in order save sinners. Do they believe that the Word of God, preached clearly and without deceit, is no longer capable of convicting men and calling them out for salvation? (See\nPsychoHeresy Update,\nWinter 1991, for a more thorough discussion of subliminals and back-masking.)\n-\u00a0 That music can be used for evil is clear from Scripture. Lucifer was created with a wealth of musical talents, which were evidently to be used for directing the angelic host in the worship of God (Ezek. 28:13 [KJV]). Lucifer's fall (Ezek. 28:11-19) evidently led to the perversion of music (as well as to the perversion of most everything else), so that its improper use could actually be offensive to God (Amos 5:23; 6:5). That music can have a powerful influence on ones emotions, mood, or state of being is clearly taught in Scripture (e.g., I Samuel 16:15-17, 23; II Ki. 3:15).\nNevertheless, some so-called Christian music experts (e.g., Christians with university degrees in music) continue to say that music is amoral (rather than moral or immoral), and, thus, has\nno\npower to lead one into sin. This is said regardless of the Biblical record previously cited. Even the scientific research indicates otherwise. Some even say it is improper to quote an unbeliever's research regarding the moral or scientific effects of music. From the \"moral\" perspective, just as there is nothing inherently evil in the culture, even unbelievers know what is moral or not (Romans 2). Regarding science, we quote scientific research of believers and unbelievers alike. It should be perfectly clear that we do not place such scientific evidence above Biblical truth. Since Scripture needs no scientific verification or research support, the medical effects of music are cited for the same reason the Christian should be interested in the medical effects of drugs or certain foods or the effects of shock waves from an explosion -- mere exposure to these things can lead to unintended and unwanted physical side effects.\n-\u00a0 David Tame (an unbeliever), in his 1984 book,\nThe Secret Power of Music,\nnot only further demonstrates the moral nature of music, but he also reveals extensive medical research demonstrating the destructive effects of rock music (on both the mind [emotions] and the body): [See the abbreviated bibliography at the end of this report for additional reference materials that details some more of the extensive research (including scientific) that has been conducted concerning the effects of music.]\n(a) In commenting on the origin and the morality of rock music, Tame says, \"... a certain cross-fertilization was becoming apparent between the 'new music' and the general jazz and rock style. It came to be seen that the technical differences between 'serious' music, jazz, rock, or any other form of modern music were less important than the underlying factor that their philosophical basis was more or less one and the same: hedonism and anarchy\" (p. 103). (Emphasis added.)\n(b) \"In the rock industry, money is basically what it is all about; and thus music is directed, not upward ... but to the lowest common denominator. The question of questions is\nWill it sell?\nThe standard of artistry could not be less relevant\" (p. 116).\n(c) \"Were we to scour the globe in search of the most aggressively malevolent and unmistakably evil music is existence, it is more than likely that nothing would be found anywhere to surpass voodoo in these attributes ... as the rhythmic accompaniment to satanic rituals and orgies, voodoo is the quintessence of tonal evil. ... Its multiple rhythms [score], rather than uniting into an integrated whole, are performed in a certain kind of conflict with one another. ... What is certain is that to hear this music is to become instantly encompassed by the sound of its raw, livid power. ... Musicologists and historians are in no doubt that the drum rhythms of Africa were carried to America and were transmitted and translated into the style of music which became known as jazz. Since jazz and the blues were the parents of rock and roll, this also means that there exists a direct line of descent from the voodoo ceremonies of Africa, through jazz, to rock and roll and all the other forms of rock music today\" (pp. 189-190). (Emphasis added.)\n(d) \"In the one corner: the ancients and traditionalists; the conviction that music affects character and society, and that therefore the artist has a duty to be responsibly moral and constructive, not immoral and destructive. In the other corner: the materialists; disclaiming responsibility and the need for value judgments, paying no heed to the outcome of their sounds. The second camp contains not only the radical avant-garde, but the entire mass of the much more popular and culturally significant jazz and rock musicians. Who, then, is correct? ...\nDo life patterns follow music patterns or do they not?\n\" (p. 136). Tame goes on to cite extensive research that overwhelmingly supports the contentions of the traditionalists: that music in general can be, and rock music specifically is, a negative influence on both the physical body and moral nature of man.\n(e) \"To the question, 'Does music affect man's physical body?,' modern research applies in the clear affirmative.\nThere is scarcely a single function of the body which cannot be affected by musical tones\n[score] ... Investigation has shown that music affects digestion, internal secretions, circulation, nutrition and respiration. Even neural networks of the brain have been found to be sensitive to harmonic principles\" (p. 136). (Emphasis added.)\n(f) \"Researchers have discovered that consonant and dissonant chords, different intervals, and other features of music [score] all exert a profound effect upon man's pulse and respiration -- upon their rate and upon whether their rhythm is constant, or interrupted and jumpy. Blood pressure is lowered by sustained chords and raised by crisp, repeated ones. [It has also been found that the tension of the larynx is affected by melodies, that sound stimuli can have a negative effect upon the skeletal muscles, that rock rhythms cause the heart beat to lose its perfect rhythm, and that certain rhythms can even cause a rare malady known as \"musicogenic epilepsy\" (76 documented cases as of 1984), with which some of its victims have been tormented to the point of committing suicide or murder.] ... We can see, then, that music affects the body in two distinct ways: directly, as the effect of sound upon the cells and organs, and indirectly, by affecting the emotions, which then in turn influence numerous bodily processes\" (p. 137). (Emphasis added.)\nJulius Portnoy has also found that not only can music [score] \"change metabolism, affect muscular energy, raise or lower blood pressure, and influence digestion,\" but \"It may be able to do all these things more successfully ... than any other stimulants that produce those changes in our bodies\" (p. 138). Musicologist Alice Monsarrat points out that it \"is precisely at this point that rock 'n' roll ... becomes potentially dangerous. This is because, to maintain a sense of well-being and integration, it is essential that man is not subjected too much to any rhythms not in accord with his natural bodily rhythms\" (p. 199).\n(g) Extensive research has also been conducted on the effects of music upon non-human life, both animals and plants. Paradoxical as it may seem, plant experiments concerning the effects of music upon life are even more convincing than human experiments -- that music does affect life, including human life. This is because in plant experiments the effect of the mind's subjective preconditioning and subjective reaction to the music, or one's \"feeling\" for the music, or one's personal tastes in music, have obviously all been removed; i.e., if music [score] can be shown to affect plants, then such effects have to be due to the objective influence of the musical tones and rhythms directly upon the cells and processes of the life-form itself. (It is also easier to set-up a valid, scientifically controlled experiment with plant life than with human life.)\nThe plant research findings are solidly in the traditionalist camp: not only did rock music stunt the growth of a wide variety of plants, but if played long enough, the plants actually died. And even more startling were the findings of Dr. T.C. Singh, head of the Botany Department at Annamalia University, India. His experiments demonstrated that not only did certain forms of music and certain musical instruments (specifically, classical music and the violin) cause plants to grow at twice their normal speed, but that later generations of the seeds of musically stimulated plants carried on the improved traits of greater size, more leaves, etc.! Presumably, the same effect can result in the negative sense, from bad music. The possible significance of Dr. Singh's findings to human life is evident, and should be at least a little disconcerting to rock music fans (pp. 141-145).\n(h) \"Like human nature itself, music cannot possibly be neutral in its spiritual direction ... ultimately all uses of tone [score] and all musical lyrics can be classified according to their spiritual direction, upward or downward. ... To put it plainly, music tends to be of either the darkness or of the light\" (p. 187). In his famous work,\nLaws,\nPlato lamented the musical revolution of his time and its \"unmusical anarchy\": \"Through foolishness they deceived themselves into thinking that there was no right or wrong in music -- that it was to be judged good or bad by the pleasure it gave. By their work and their theories they infected the masses with the presumption to think themselves adequate judges. ... As it was, the criterion was not music, but a reputation for promiscuous cleverness and a spirit of lawbreaking\" (p. 189).\n(i) In his closing comments on the roots of music styles and rhythms, David Tame, with a keen \"spiritual\" insight often lacking in many believers today, takes particular offense with rock music: \"More than any other form of the misuse of sound, it is rock with which we must deal today. ... It is a global phenomenon; a pounding, pounding destructive beat which is heard from America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia. Its effect upon the soul is to make nigh-impossible the true inner silence and peace necessary for the contemplation of eternal verities. ... How necessary is it in this age for some to have the courage to be the ones who are 'different', and to separate themselves out from the pack who long ago sold their lives and personalities to this sound. ... I adamantly believe that rock in all its forms is a critical problem which our civilization\nmust\nget to grips. ... if it wishes long to survive\" (p. 204). (Emphasis added.)\nFor the world, it is impossible to separate from the lure of the pleasures of the flesh; they have no desire to do so nor do they have the power to do so if they did desire. But what reasons do we as Christians have to ignore our Lord's command to come out and be separate? Instead, we adopt the world's music in all its destructive forms [score and character], add Christian lyrics to it, and think we are being pleasing to the Lord and are a testimony of holiness to an unbelieving world. How pathetic!\n-\u00a0 More recent medical research (than that cited by Tame) also disputes the notion of the supposed \"neutrality\" of music:\n(a) Dr. John Diamond, a medical doctor, has conducted extensive research on the medical effects of music. He has noted that man is rhythmic in respiration, heartbeat, pulse, speech, and gait, and when the rhythm of music corresponds to the natural body rhythms, it produces feelings of ecstasy, alertness, and peace, and it energizes the mind and body, and facilitates balance and self-control. (These secular medical findings are also supported by Scripture [I Samuel 16:15-17,23]).\n(b) Dr. David Nobel, another medical doctor and an authority on music, has done extensive research on the value of music rhythms [score] corresponding to body rhythms. He writes that, \"None of these qualities accrue to the rock sound. Instead, rock contains harmonic dissonance and melodic discord while it accents rhythm with a big beat. In fact, the anapestic beat [two short beats, a long beat, then a pause] used by many rock musicians actually is the exact opposite of our heart and arterial rhythms [thereby causing an immediate loss of body strength].\"\n[Dr. Diamond confirms Dr. Nobel's findings and adds that the stopped anapestic rhythm \"heightens stress and anger, reduces output, increases hyperactivity, and weakens muscle strength.\" (Admittedly, the technological ability to objectively measure stress and anger is problematical at best, while the measurement of muscle strength is quite precise and meets all the requirements of scientific reliability and statistical significance.)]\n(c) The power of music to communicate is demonstrated in an article\n\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" by David Mazie, in the August 1992\nReader's Digest --\n\"Music reduces staff tension in the operating room,\" says Dr. Clyde L. Nash, Jr. ... \"and also helps relax the patient.\" [He uses classical music such as Vivaldi and Mozart.] Nash is one of many physicians around the country who are finding that music, used with conventional medical therapies, can help the sick in the healing process.\n(d) Clinical researchers at the U.C.L.A. School of Nursing in Los Angeles, and at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta, found that premature babies gained weight faster and were able to use oxygen more efficiently when they listened to soothing music mixed with voices or womb sounds. At Tallahassee (FL) Memorial Regional Medical Center, premature and low-birth-weight infants exposed to an hour and a half of soothing vocal music each day averaged only 11 days in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, compared with 16 days for a control group. At Baltimore's St. Agnes Hospital, classical music was provided in the critical-care units. \"Half an hour of music produced the same effect as ten milligrams of Valium,\" says Dr. Raymond Bahr, head of the coronary-care unit.\nHow does music help? Some studies show it can lower blood pressure, basal-metabolism and respiration rates, thus lessening physiological responses to stress. Other studies suggest music may help increase production of endorphins (natural pain relievers) and S-IgA (Salivary immunoglobulin A). S-IgA speeds healing, reduces the danger of infections, and controls the heart rate. Studies indicate both hemispheres of the brain are involved in processing music. Dr. Sacks explains, \"The neurological basis of musical responses is robust and may even survive damage to both hemispheres\" (\"Music's Surprising Power to Heal,\" 8/92,\nReader's Digest\n).\n\"In conclusion, we can say that insofar as the physical body is concerned, the notion that music has no effect upon man, or that all music is harmless, is absolutely in error\" (Tame, p. 141). (Emphasis added.) \"No longer [can] modern musicians possibly claim that music is a matter of 'taste,' or that the musician should be allowed to perform anything he chooses ...\nEvery moment of music to which we subject ourselves may be enhancing or taking away our ... clarity of consciousness, increment by increment\n\" (Tame, p. 144).\nIn essence, what the medical experts are saying is that today's rock sound (irrespective of the lyrics tacked-on to it in order to classify it as either secular or \"Christian\") fights against the rhythmic nature of man's creation. In the face of such evidence, it is difficult to understand how anyone can maintain that the music itself is neutral.\n-\u00a0 In Tim Fisher's 1992 book,\nThe Battle for Christian Music,\nhe notes: \"Years ago I heard a tape of a man who was defending the neutrality of music in a public service. He walked over to the piano and played a C major chord. Then, he asked the audience if it was a good C major chord or an evil C major chord. After some scattered laughter, he said, 'See, there's no such thing as good or evil music.' He made a rather obvious mistake, however, in his reasoning: a C major chord isn't music! It is a building block of music -- and there's a big difference. ... Why are we willing to admit these facts when it comes to literature, art, sculpture, or any other form of creativity -- but not music? ... When you enter a freshman theory class as a music major in any discipline of music, among the first things you would study are the 'ingredients' (neutral elements) of music: melody, rhythm, and harmony. ... Eventually you would learn to combine these elements into a musical language that communicates what you desire. ... Music always affects us, because music is not neutral\" (pp. 60-63). Other quotes from this book:\n(a) \"Rock music elevates rhythm as the most stressed element, then harmony-melody is last. ... Rap is the logical extension of the direction in which rock music has been headed. Once you demote certain musical elements into relative unimportance, they will soon disappear altogether. Most of rock music did away with melodic interest a long time ago. Therefore, if melody is unimportant, why have it? This is exactly what rap 'music' has done. It has emphasized rhythm as the only important musical element, while de-emphasizing melody and harmony to the point where they are virtually non-existent. By every good definition of music, rap is not music! It is merely rhythmic entertainment\" (pp. 77,78).\n(b) \"Can you imagine Mozart being played in a bar? Not very likely -- because the music of Mozart isn't compatible with such an atmosphere. Can you imagine singing the Doxology to the tune of 'Stars and Stripes Forever'? Would you receive a blessing by singing the words of 'The Old Rugged Cross' to the Beatles' tune 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand'? These are ridiculous illustrations because the music is obviously incompatible with the message\" (p. 102).\n(c) \"The tragic truth is that most Christians judge the effectiveness of music based upon the yardstick of the flesh, rather than the yardstick of the Spirit. If a song thrills us, we like it. If it doesn't excite us, we don't like it. Too often our opinion of a song is not based on the musical, textual, or even biblical worth of it -- but rather on how it makes us feel. As in so many other areas of life, we take a sensual approach to music\" (p. 104).\n-\u00a0 By attending Christian rock concerts, does not one identify oneself with their ecumenism and their false doctrines and become a partaker of their evil deeds? (The Bible clearly teaches a theology of \"guilt by association\" -- see 2 John 10,11.) And since we will all be accountable to the Lord at the B\u00e9ma Seat for our stewardship with the resources He has entrusted to us while on this earth, how can anyone possibly justify allocating any resources to the support of rock music?\n-\u00a0 \"Christian\" rock music offers no hope -- since it is Spiritless, it can give none. It does not offer heaven, for the music within itself produces a vacuum -- full of sound and fury, but no substance. It provides no foundation to the believer because its birth came from secular rock 'n' roll, which has no basis in God. The approaches of religious rockers all seem to suggest that, \"We must become the world to win the world.\" That method will not work simply because it is outside of God's plan for the proper balancing of Biblically-ordained modes of evangelism with Biblical principles of separation. If one believes at all in the Bible doctrine of \"separation\" from the world (Rom. 12:2), is it not logical to include the Christian's music?\n-\u00a0 Gordon Sears, in his booklet,\nIs Today's Christian Music \"Sacred\"?,\nasks six questions of those who think that CCM is indeed acceptable to God: If the new style and sound of music is of God then:\n(1) Why is it causing so much confusion and division among Christians?;\n(2) Why is it not received by all fundamental Bible-believing churches?;\n(3) Why is it readily accepted by the non-Christian world? The ungodly never accepted the old Christian hymns;\n(4) Why is it that Bible-denying universities and popular secular TV entertainment shows invite well-known Christian artists to give concerts with CCM? This never happened with the great spiritual hymns;\n(5) Why are there hundreds of churches with godly pastors across America that strictly reject it and forbid it in their services?; and\n(6) Why does it have such a strong effect upon the physical body? (As shown earlier, music does have a strong physical effect -- to ignore this would be negligent.)\n-\u00a0 What kind of music truly honors God? Ernest Pickering lists ten primary guidelines for Christians to follow (\nThe Kind of Music That Honors God,\npp. 11-12):\n1. Its message is Scriptural (Col 3:16). Good Christian music must present a message that is true to the Word of God and doctrinally sound.\n2. It should lead us to think in Biblical patterns and not be suggestive of evil either in message or in musical arrangement (Phil. 4:8). The text and music should not be cheap or tawdry.\n3. It should help us to honor God with our bodies (I Cor. 6:19-20). Music which tends to imitate the effects of godless rock upon the human body or which either destroys or impairs one's hearing is not Christian music.\n4. It will maintain a balance between \"spirit\" and \"understanding\" (I Cor. 14:15). Music that is primarily emotional froth would not fulfill this requirement.\n5. It will contain words that are full of beauty, dignity, reverence and simplicity, words that are worthy of the worship of a holy God (Isa. 6:1-6).\n6. It will be free of mental association with worldly musical styles and evidence a holy consecrated character (Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15). Music that seeks to \"copy\" the worldly approach is not honoring to God.\n7. It should be expressive of the peace that accompanies the Christian life, not the clamor, confusion, din, and turmoil of the world (Col. 3:15-16). The various forms of rock music do not contribute to peace of heart but partake of the constant jangle of the sinful world. Christ promises peace to His people (Jn. 14:27).\n8. It should be characterized by musical preciseness, finesse of poetic technique, and should evidence a structure of harmony and order. God is a God of order and not disorder (I Cor. 14:40).\n9. It should promote and accompany a life-style of godliness, modesty, and holy quietness, and not modish fashion, suggestive acts, or sexual aggressiveness (1 Pe. 1:16; Tit. 2:11-12).\n10. It should not contribute to the temptation of new or weak believers (Rom. 14:13,21; 15:2). Music that reminds newly-saved converts of their old life of sin is to be abhorred and rejected.\nThe erosion of musical standards among contemporary Christians parallels the erosion of convictions and practices in other areas as well. It denotes a spirit of compromise with the world which must be vigorously opposed by strong Christian leaders. As in all areas of our lives believers should ever follow the admonition of Paul: \"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God\" (I Cor. 10:31).\n-\u00a0 It is our conviction that rock music cannot be used to communicate spiritual truth. (Often the melody in the \"Christian\" version of rock music is obscured and overpowered by the heavy beat -- the accompaniment is so predominant that it completely overpowers any message that might be present.) How can rock music, with its origins in demonic activities, and with its proven adverse medical and \"emotional\" effects, apply to the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? Convictions must be based on the Word of God and not personal tastes, likes, and dislikes. Since most of religious rock, or so-called contemporary Christian music, has its roots in, and draws its inspiration from, secular rock 'n' roll, the result is worldliness in the music, and even worse, worldliness\nthrough\nmusic invading the church. Further, it \"authenticates\" the rock sound by having professing Christians playing the music. When one applies the standards of Scripture to this form of worldliness (e.g., II Cor. 6:17; I Thes.5:21, 22; Rom. 12:2; I Jn. 2:15,16; Js.4:4; etc.), the wrongness of such music should be obvious to all who truly desire to please their Lord.\n-\u00a0 Being that the very term\nrock 'n' roll\nidentifies with fornication, and the fact that music for the Christian is deemed to be worship, then the test it must pass is found in Philippians 4:8 -- \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.\" It is difficult to understand how a believer, in good conscience, could partake in that which is, at best, highly questionable. Rock 'n' roll is also so much associated with ungodly and outright Satanic rebellion against God, it is a wonder believers would want to be identified with it in any way. One would think a proper understanding of Ephesians 4:17-24 would be helpful to professing believers involved in rock music:\nThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ; If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.\nEph. 5:18,19 -- And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing and making melody [music] in your heart to the Lord;\nCol. 3:16 -- Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms [score] and hymns [character] and spiritual songs [lyrics], singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.\nNote: What is Christian Music?\n(From an editorial response to an ACCC [American Council of Christian Churches] resolution on CCM)\n1. Music is an art. Because music is an art, it must be understood and evaluated in artistic and esthetic categories. Knowing what music is better is not a matter of taste, but of criticism. We may, and often do, develop tastes for things that are worse. Criticism exists to correct our tastes. Critical training and musical accomplishment, however, are different things: many fine performers are incompetent critics.\nStyle is not the major issue in evaluating music. Classicism and romanticism are not styles; fugues and sonatas are not styles; even jazz and rock are not styles. It is far more important to ask what a particular musical form exists to do, and whether a given composer has employed the form adequately for his purpose.\n2. Music is a language. In common with all good art, music is written to say something. Quite apart from any lyrics with which it may be associated, music carries meaning. Of the two, the music speaks more powerfully. The best lyrics can never redeem music which communicates a false message, though second-rate lyrics have often been elevated in the hands of a great composer. It is often pointed out that music communicates subjectively, as if this should preclude our evaluating it. But what is subjective is not therefore unreal. It may be a subjective assertion that sunsets are more pleasant than garbage dumps; it is also a truth. For a person to say that he prefers garbage dumps would alter our judgment of the person, but not of the garbage dump. The question is not what a piece of music means \"to me,\" the question is what it means. This judgment must precede all moral and religious judgments with regard to the composition.\n3. Music is a moral phenomenon. If music conveys meaning, then every musical composition may be judged in moral terms according to its truthfulness and propriety. Herein lies the error of those who claim that God has not revealed what \"style of music He prefers.\" To the contrary, God has clearly told us what He expects of our communications in general and of our worshipful communications in particular. To judge the meaning of a musical piece obligates us to judge its morality.\n4. Music is a Christian duty. This is emphasized, not only by New Testament teaching, but also by those psalms that call upon \"all that hath breath\" to praise God with music. Music is the one art that all God's peoples, in all times and places, are required to practice. Therefore, we had best take it seriously. It is not a public relations tool, nor does it serve a merely social function. It is with music that we worship God and edify one another. We dare not tolerate the tawdry, the base, or the thoughtless.\nThese same psalms name virtually every known category of instrument. We need not ask whether we can worship God with stringed instruments (e.g., guitars). The question is, which guitar: Christopher Parkening's or Jimmy Page's?\n5. Music is the church's heritage. Those who lack critical training must look to the church's past for direction. The apostles did not invent a new music, but adopted the musical heritage of Judaism. Generation by generation this heritage was handed down, elaborated, criticized, corrected, and developed. Medieval plainsong was a direct descendent, and its use led eventually to the development of the various polyphonic forms. The hymnody of the Reformation stands in this tradition, as do the hymns of the Pietists and the Awakeners.\nOnly after the Enlightenment did Christians assume that they could safely dispense with the heritage of the church. Chiefly in America did they wish to ground worship in forms which were separated from the culture of the church. When one speaks of what represents the Body of Christ, he ought to include the whole Body, and not merely the current generation.\nPurveyors of CCM are driven by this rejection of the Christian musical heritage in favor of popular forms. For the record, so were Victorian songwriters like Bliss and Doane, who are more closely related musically to Stryper and Petra than they are to Hassler or Mason. The question is about more than rock. But the breadth of the question should not prevent us from making definite musical choices.\n"}, {"score": 976.68646, "uuid": "65620d01-8ca3-5f38-97f9-69bf641af86c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0813wb-29-10260", "target_hostname": "imaginationsoup.net", "target_uri": "http://imaginationsoup.net/2010/11/i-love-educational-rap-music/", "page_rank": 1.2118705e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "I Love Educational <em>Rap</em> Music", "snippet": "Music and learning so totally <em>rock</em>.

These are the projects that really fire me up, and allow the creative juices to flow.\n[Click here to check out the audio James refers to in the article.]\nInterview: Doug Harris, Creative Animal International, Houston, TX\nBy Jerry Vigil\nSince 1983, Harris has been working his special magic at radio stations across the country, creating powerful, promotions-driven ratings and revenue plans for satisfied station owners and thriving on the challenge of keeping radio listeners entertained and advertisers happy.\nDuring his eleven year tenure at heritage AOR station KLOL-FM in Houston, Harris demonstrated his bigger-than-life approach to station activities and his special flair for producing uncomplicated events with seemingly global impact. From a box of autographed photos and albums, Harris created the KLOL Rock-n-Roll Auction, which enjoyed a ten year run and raised over $500,000 for Houston area charities. A simple shopping mall blood drive became the Rock-n-Roll Up Your Sleeve Blood Drive, garnering a national award for the station and a series of record collection years for the blood bank. The Rock-n-Roll Softball Championship of the World, the KLOL Street Machine Nationals, and Houston Music Awards \u2014 all produced by Harris \u2014 became revenue producing benchmarks on the KLOL promotional calendar.\nDuring his career, he has given away, among other things, an oil well, a breast enlargement operation, a ton of kitty litter, over thirty cars and trucks, and roughly $1,000,000 in cash. He once claimed Halley\u2019s Comet as Texas sovereign territory, named a Texas Ambassador to Australia, and sent him to Sydney to \"bring it back.\" He has awarded trips to destinations around the world, including a chance to spend Halloween night in Dracula\u2019s castle in Transylvania, Romania and over the years has employed a \"street\" fleet of novelty vehicles including a three-wheeled spaceship, an ambulance, a 1957 Rolls Royce, a Bigfoot truck, and even a forty-foot brassiere on roller skates.\nDuring his last years at KLOL, Harris branched out to provide consulting services for stations outside of Houston. Most notably, Harris and the programming team of Ted Edwards and Virgil Thompson engineered the rebirth of KISS-FM in San Antonio, taking the station from an Arbitron 12+ rating of .4 to a 5.6 in a single book \u2014 all on a marketing budget of $1800. A dramatic success at River City Broadcasting\u2019s \"The Point\" in St. Louis followed, and gave Harris his first experience in the modern rock format. Additional projects in New Orleans and Dallas broadened his level of expertise with various formats, which now included Newstalk, Oldies, Contemporary Hits, New Age Jazz, AOR, and Classic Rock.\nHis professional accolades include Billboard Magazine\u2019s Promotion Director of the Year, numerous regional ADDY\u2019s, and three Promax Gold Medallion Awards for Marketing Excellence.

Everything was humming right along until it got a question from a user that forced it to shut down. The question in the novel was \"Why?\" When it was grappling with all the day-to-day stuff, it was fine, but when somebody asked it to explain the purpose of life, it simply couldn\u2019t come up with any kind of meaningful answer. Now, I\u2019m not going to try to answer that question here. I have a hard enough time trying to figure out how to get my audio on the RAP CD. (More on that later.) However, I got the BIG question from a fellow producer last week that I\u2019d like to tackle.\n[Click here to check out the audio Dave references in this month's column.]\nFeature: Sound Thinking - A Good Writer's Values\nBy Tim Miles\nIn honor of being a recent guest in the hometown of the Busch family, we presented a 12-pack of tools at the Missouri Broadcasters\u2019 Convention that writers could take home to be a gooder writer. Our first three mental beers were the three values innate in such a person.\nRadio Hed: Radio Improv - Worse Off/Better Off\nBy Jeffrey Hedquist\nHere are two improv games that can give us useful formats for commercials. \"Worse Off\" is a version of the \"When I was your age\u2026\" stories older members of your family would recite. In this game, each character tries to elicit sympathy or admiration from the others by exaggerating reminiscences of how much worse they had it.\nFeature: Of Migraines, Bifocals, and Adobe Audition 2.0\nBy Ed Thompson\nI got laid up with a migraine headache the other day. I\u2019ve dealt with them for most of my adult life. For me, migraines don\u2019t come on gradually like the changing of the seasons. They are a radical, immediate, and painful invasion of my cranium. Every neuron fires at once while all the blood vessels that intertwine my brain constrict and restrict the flow of oxygen through this huge melon they call my head. I cry like a little girl.\n...And Make It Real Creative:\nBy Trent Rentsch\nLittle things really do mean a lot. The little thing that means the most to me at the moment seems to have disappeared. It\u2019s a little notebook, black cat on the cover, the Toulouse-Lautrec poster. I found it in an Import shop. My wife saw me looking at it and bought it for me. For that reason alone I don\u2019t want to lose it, but at the moment there\u2019s another reason that has me turning my studio upside down searching for it. The reason is inside the notebook, one little word... or maybe 2 or 3, I don\u2019t remember. I knew I wouldn\u2019t remember, which is why I wrote it (or them) in my precious little notebook. Because I would NEVER lose that. Right...\nThe Monday Morning Memo: Before You Begin Writing Those Ads...\nBy Roy H.

The father, noticing his son\u2019s amusement, taps the coins together. A rhythm develops. Spellbound, the child\u2019s fingers dance along.\nFor Gal \u201cJames\u201d Sivan, this was his earliest encounter with drumming. \u201cI loved listening to that,\u201d he recalls. On the ground, his foot bounces, in tempo, against his Columbia Business School backpack.\nIn many ways, Sivan \u201910BUS is your typical MBA student. He keeps eye contact, sits up straight, and speaks directly. But how many of his classmates in Corporate Finance or Marketing Strategy could say they once performed in front of 50,000 people, or opened for Run-D.M.C.? Flash to 1994. Sivan, then 19, was finishing his mandatory service in the Israeli army. \u201cI was in Lebanon, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, but for just one night each,\u201d says Sivan, who was the drummer in the army\u2019s jazz band. \u201cWe would show up, perform, and then leave,\u201d he explains, likening the visits to Marilyn Monroe singing for American GIs in Korea (all members of the army\u2019s jazz band were exempt from combat).\nIn the U.S., Rolling Stone had just run a cover of rap artists Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. The Beastie Boys were headlining the Lollapalooza festival, and Notorious B.I.G. was in Manhattan\u2019s D&D Studios, recording his seminal album, Ready to Die. Hip-hop had arrived. But Israel, like the rest of the world, had yet to catch up.\nA couple of rap-loving high-school friends in the town of Yavne decided to change that. Their group, called Shabak Samech, was looking for a new drummer. Sivan auditioned and made an impression. \u201cBecause of my jazz training, I could learn a song after hearing it once,\u201d says Sivan, smiling. \u201cThey weren\u2019t used to that.\u201d Four days later, with Sivan on drums, the group performed at the farewell concert for a popular Tel Aviv rock club. The show was broadcast on the army\u2019s radio station Galgalatz, one of the most popular stations in Israel. It was Shabak\u2019s big break. \u201cFor the first time in my life, people were telling me I was amazing,\u201d says Sivan. \u201cI was never the same.\u201d Yossi Fine, a bassist who has worked with David Bowie and Lou Reed, and who was Shabak\u2019s fi rst producer,recalls Sivan\u2019s transformation: \u201cHe used to stop the show, come up to the mic and say, \u2018I\u2019m the best drummer around\u2019 \u2014 and then he really became it.\u201d\nSix months later, the group released the single \u201cShabak Samech Imperia\u201d from their self-titled album, and Israeli music was forever changed. \u201cShabak was the first group to combine hip-hop and rock in Israel \u2014 to popularize it,\u201d says Loolwa Khazzoom \u201991BC, who chronicled the rise of Israeli hip-hop for Rolling Stone.\nThe video for \u201cImperia\u201d shows Sivan at his drum set, wearing a surgical mask and a chain-link necklace. A mob of youths in baggy pants and backward baseball caps parade through the sandy streets of Jaffa, a mixed Arab-Jewish district of Tel Aviv. Eventually, for no apparent reason, they carjack an old Cadillac sedan, smash the windows, and fl ip it over. \u201cWe were,\u201d says Sivan, \u201cone of the first groups to curse in Hebrew.\u201d\nThis attitude, along with the name, cemented Shabak\u2019s raucous reputation with Israeli audiences (in Hebrew, \u201cShabak\u201d is a deliberate misspelling of the acronym for the Israel Security Agency, which is analogous to the FBI). While most Israeli rap addresses political issues, Shabak\u2019s early songs talked about parties, fun, and, of course, ladies. One lyric from \u201cImperia\u201d loosely translates to, \u201cShabak Samech is an empire / See how all the females get hysterical.\u201d Not exactly Yehuda Amichai, but the kids loved it.\nThen, as in many bands, competing personalities led to conflict. \u201cYou know, we made a revolution,\u201d says Sivan. \u201cIt\u2019s like Robespierre. You do your damage, and then you end up under the guillotine.\u201d After seven years and four albums, Shabak broke up in 2000.\nSivan is now in his mid-30s. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in your 20s,\u201d he says, \u201cyou think that in order to play music, you have to be a musician. Now, I still play drums, but I play because I enjoy it.\u201d Post-Shabak, Sivan pursued his fi rst love, engineering, at Ben\u2013 Gurion University in Be\u2019er Sheva. After a few years developing applications for mobile platforms, he applied to business school to become better suited for management.\nAlthough Sivan cut his once rock star\u2013 length hair (he\u2019s now a consultant for Booz & Company), every so often, during long hours in Uris Hall, he would look to his hip-hop days for guidance. \u201cShabak made me realize the value of creating a safe environment for ideas. Spending five minutes brainstorming and not dismissing everyone else\u2019s ideas is hard to do in a band and in business school. A group can\u2019t always identify from the start the value of what it\u2019s doing.\u201d\nHe pauses, and taps a couple of coins together in his pocket. \u201cBut if you let go and listen, what you think is nothing can turn into something.\u201d\nFeatured Article:\n"}, {"score": 965.80475, "uuid": "759c9f05-3acf-57ab-90a2-1768ffd02ad4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-15-09105", "target_hostname": "news.qthemusic.com", "target_uri": "http://news.qthemusic.com/2011/11/big_boi_wants_to_work_with_kat.html", "page_rank": 1.1889276e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Here&#x27;s 10 notable moments in <em>rap</em>-<em>rock</em> - Features -", "snippet": "Girls Aloud and the Sugababes may have done their best to tarnish Walk This Way&#x27;s memory, but the original collaboration <em>is</em> still the yard stick for all <em>rap</em>-<em>rock</em> alliances.", "explanation": null, "document": "Kate Bush's new album 50 Words For Snow has received praise from all quarters, not least from the unlikely source of Big Boi , one half of flamboyant hip-hop duo Outkast.

Some meetings between hip hop and rock have made musical history, others though have been epic failures as some of the world's most respected artists have disgraced themselves. Surfing a fine line between genius and insanity James Dielhenn highlight some notable collaborations between rockers and rappers.\nAerosmith & Run DMC\nGirls Aloud and the Sugababes may have done their best to tarnish Walk This Way's memory, but the original collaboration is still the yard stick for all rap-rock alliances. Aerosmith released it in 1975 with limited success, but a 1986 remix that included the voracious vocals of Run DMC helped put rap music on the map and laid the foundations for future blends of the two musical styles.\nColdplay & Jay-Z\nWe all know how Chris Martin, Jay-Z and their megastar wives are best pals, so it's nice to know their friendship translates to their music. Coldplay's track Lost! has taken several different forms since its original release, one of which includes New York's hip-hop heavyweight. After countless sold-out arena shows featuring Martin's band and Jay-Z, recording this well-executed remix was the least they could do.\nKorn & Nas\nNot all rap-rock collaborations become genre-transcending anthems, though. Nu-metallers Korn must have thought they were onto a winner by enlisting the help of rap veteran Nas, but their 2003 track Play Me has been largely forgotten by both fans of rap and rock.\nAnthrax & Public Enemy\nRappers joining forces with rock bands is one thing, but goodness knows what Chuck D and Flavour Flav must have thought when they got a call from pioneering thrash metallers Anthrax.\nWhat ensued was a cover of Public Enemy's Bring The Noise which led to a joint tour by both bands.\nh=\"500\" height=\"369\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/iVbWw3RKg1w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen>\nAnthrax, Public Enemy\nBlakroc (Black Keys & Damon Dash)\nThis project that attracts a great deal of mainstream attention in either genre, but Blakroc shouldn't be overlooked. Blues rock duo, The Black Keys, and Roc-A-Fella co-founder Damon Dash were the brains behind the album with saw the band hitting the studio with the likes of Raekwon, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Ludacris.\nPuff Daddy & Jimmy Page\nWhen Diddy, or Puff Daddy as he was known then, received approval to remix Led Zeppelin's Kashmir, a rap-rock legend should have been in progress. Chuck in Jimmy Page himself and production from Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello and how could they go wrong? Somehow they did, and the less said about the 1997 remix, renamed Come With Me, the better. Maybe this is why Daddy become Diddy?\nMarilyn Manson & Eminem\nEminem's The Way I Am featured a scathing attack on the media who blamed shock-rocker Marilyn Manson for the death of one of his fans.\nSo when Manson joined Slim Shady onstage at the Reading Festival in 2001 to add extra meaning to the song, a rap-rock iconic moment was created.\nSlash, Fergie & Cypress Hill\nRemember this version of Guns'N'Roses' Paradise City? Didn't think so. Trying to carve out a solo career, Slash recruited Cypress Hill and Fergie, she of the Black Eyed Peas, to record a new version of his classic track. It only succeeded in giving his fans an appetite for destruction (boom, and indeed boom) for copies of the disappointing remake.\nAdam Levine & Kanye West\nHeard 'Em Say was a more sophisticated and softly spoken foray into rap-rock's history books, but it was critically acclaimed by the masses. Kanye's friendship with the Maroon 5 frontman was the driving force after the rapper had previously remixed the band's trademark song, This Love.\nArctic Monkeys & Dizzee Rascal\nUnfortunately, Temptation Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend may well be forever remembered for the Glastonbury sound-system failing during Arctic Monkey's headline set, but recorded version by both acts (a b-side for the band and remix for the rapper's album) proves Brits can do rap-rock too.\n10:45 AM | 25/11/2011\n"}, {"score": 965.43335, "uuid": "a978eb1f-dc2a-5039-9c99-2fac8e6a8228", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-69-16423", "target_hostname": "www.nunesmagician.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nunesmagician.com/2012/2/21/2813300/the-syracuse-basketball-rap-song-are-you-the-rapper-to-rap-it", "page_rank": 1.1819147e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "- Troy Nunes <em>Is</em> An", "snippet": "Any commercial use <em>or</em> distribution without the express written consent of Associated Press and Getty Images <em>is</em> strictly prohibited.", "explanation": null, "document": "Print\nIf there is any glaring omission from the 2011-2012 Syracuse Orange basketball season, it's the stunning lack of a hip-hop theme song.\n2010 had Shut It Down . 2011 had Unfinished Business .

Def Jux's website sort of implies El-P and some other Jukies will be there.\nSo, let's take a second to look at the state of white rappers.\nEminem . He's got it all figured out. Maybe he's doesn't have the most abstract, brain-bending lyrics, but he's got a perfect ear and narrative style. Looks like he's moving behind the boards now, which hopefully will yield some interesting projects -- but if his gift is for assonance, don't we want him to stay on the mic? Em: try to keep 50 out of trouble.\nThe Beasties . They're getting old. What are they working on? They had that peacenik single last spring, but what else? I want the hiatus to be over.\nEl-P. His record company, Definitive Jux is a gift to the world. El's producing some of the most talented guys out there -- Cannibal Ox, C. Rayz Walz, RJD2 -- and still putting out brilliant albums of his own. Has there been a recent hip-hop album better than El's Fantastic Damage ? If so, El probably produced it himself. Which leads us to:\nAesop Rock . New album, Bazooka Tooth, came out last month. Maybe he's not as innately skilled as his Def Jux cohorts, but he's still better than nearly everyone else you hear, althoguh he does sort of come across like the lost Beastie Boy...a little uncomfortable in his own skin.\nBubba Sparxxx . Plays up his crackerdom more than Ted Nugent. Redneck rap was a genre waiting to happen, so it's good he came along. You can listen to all of his new album, Deliverance, over at BET (ironically), where they spell the name of the album wrong. Bubba would kick my ass for saying so, but even Timbaland's production can't save it.\nMC Paul Barman . Brown-educated Jewish intellectual potty-mouthed rap was another genre waiting to be born. Too clever for his own good, but it works, maybe because he's so filthy, and because he combines words in a way that you don't understand until 5 minutes after you hear it. New album came out a year ago, is somehow more foul-minded than his first.\nThere are others, but this will suffice.\n"}, {"score": 938.8878, "uuid": "bd257486-8d4b-5a75-8f07-8f5126b8bdd8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1907wb-29-19546", "target_hostname": "www.edmflavor.com", "target_uri": "http://www.edmflavor.com/tag/rap/", "page_rank": 1.3585746e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Rap</em> | Flavor", "snippet": "Touch: Everything we have <em>is</em> just as good, if not <em>better</em>, than the first album.

CDBaby is kind of cool, they send our music out to all of the digital distributors and people can buy it off of them. We also sell CD\u2019s and merchandise at our shows, but we don\u2019t get to do a whole lot of them. Touch has released a solo album so he has done a few more shows solo.\nTouch: There are just so many MC\u2019s and rap groups out there right now that the opportunities for live shows are few and far between. Also, we don\u2019t like performing unless we have some new material and can keep it fresh anyways.\nFlavor: So how long have you guys been doing this?\nNato: Well, we\u2019ve been together since 2003 but Touch has been involved since around the early 90\u2019s probably. I heard about him through a friend when I was growing up and when I got the chance to meet him in 2002 he liked my beats and it just took off from there.\nTouch: Yeah I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time haha, but since we have started working together we released an album in 2007 and we putting the finishing touches on a second album right now.\nFlavor: What do you guys think of this new album compared to the first one?\nTouch: Everything we have is just as good, if not better, than the first album. But there is a lot more pressure this time, when the first album is good, the second album is the hardest to make.\nNato: The climate of the industry has also changed a lot. CD sales are down, there are a lot more people trying to make it, and one thing I\u2019ve especially noticed is that everyone is doing videos for almost every song. In 2007 we had one video and we were one of the only groups with a good video.\nTouch: It just goes to show that the music has to be that much better now. You also need to plan a strategic release. There are so many groups out there right now releasing everything they make left, right, and center. Sometimes they even give their albums and everything away for free just to create buzz, but were not here just to create a little buzz so we have to be smart about it.\nFlavor: So what are your guys\u2019 immediate goals going forward?\nTouch: Right now I think we just want to work on the label, and make sure our album turns out good.\nNato: We really aren\u2019t trying to make money right now, we are just trying to put ourselves in a position to break even and eventually make some money at some point.\nTouch: A good immediate goal would to be able do our own tour and have people show and make a little bit of profit off of it.\nFlavor: Is anything different on the promotion side of things for this album?\nTouch: I think we definitely need to make a few more videos. We had one video for our first album but the climate has changed so much and we think we\u2019ll need more videos like that to stay relevant. But we still want to be original and do something different, just like our first video. We\u2019ll take another angle, whether it be comedy again or a different niche market.\nNato: Yeah it seems like everyone can videos now and there is a lot of emulation. It\u2019s like, \u201cHow can I make my video seem just as good as that guys so I can make people think I\u2019m like this or that?\u201d. We never front that we are ballin\u2019 or anything like that. We like to remain honest about ourselves and we\u2019ll actually make fun of ourselves if we have the opportunity. I think that\u2019s why our last video was so funny.\nFlavor: You guys seem to rep Edmonton a lot, like you\u2019re really proud to be from here. And I remember that conversation from the first song on your album about getting out of here, has there been any real thought about that?\nTouch: That conversation has just happened so many times and I thought it was perfect way to start the album. There have been a lot of rappers from Edmonton who have moved to Toronto, and I\u2019ve kept tabs and watched what they are doing. I\u2019ve just never felt like there was a time where that had to be the move. If it came to that point then I wouldn\u2019t be against it, but it just hasn\u2019t got there for me yet. It\u2019s always weird too because it\u2019s people from Edmonton asking me when I\u2019m going to leave, I was born here, this my home and I\u2019m like \u201cAre you kicking me out?\u201d\nNato: You can make music anywhere and it\u2019s still going to be heard. It seems like people think that the support for hip-hop just isn\u2019t here in Edmonton, and no one can really figure out why. But we seem to be doing ok.\nTouch: I understand this city, and I know that it is a hard place to be a rapper. But that all feeds into the product, I wouldn\u2019t rap like this if the city wasn\u2019t like this, and people like our product.\nFlavor: Is your biggest fan base here in Edmonton then?\nNato: We really have fans all over the world, they are so spread out that we can\u2019t really say where our biggest fan base is other than here maybe. We\u2019ve had people respond to our YouTube video from Denmark saying that they can relate to us because it seems like we have similar climates and cultures and stuff like that.\nTouch: People don\u2019t realize that if you are honest about your situation can connect with a lot of people from all over the world. A lot of people aren\u2019t honest about their situation and they are being broadcasted all over the world and all it\u2019s doing is creating and excuse for other people to be dishonest. If you can break through that barrier you are going to find people everywhere that are like \u201cI can dig these guys, they seem legit.\u201d\nNato: Yeah it really seems like the saying \u201cKeep it real\u201d got twisted into \u201cI\u2019m going to keep it real like they kept it real\u201d. There so much copying in the industry now that it\u2019s not \u201cKeep it real\u201d anymore so we just try to keep it honest.\nTouch: There have been so many evolutions of hip-hop to the point where it was unrecognizable. I remember in 2007, when we released our album, people were saying hip-hip was dead. And I was like \u201cWe didn\u2019t get that memo? This shit is banging and people like it haha.\u201d\nFlavor: How do you guys manage to do this on the side while having other careers?\nNato: Music is a passion and it\u2019s something that is a huge part of my life, it\u2019s not something you stop. It never started as an industry, it turned into an industry.\nTouch: It\u2019s tough but it just has to be done. But regardless of where I am in my life, music will always be a part of it. People always ask me \u201cOh you\u2019re still doing that?\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cWell I\u2019m still alive aren\u2019t I?\u201d. Whether I\u2019m actively involved in the industry or not, I will always be involved with music.\nFlavor: Is the obvious end goal to be doing this full time?\nNato: We just want to create full time, and be appreciated for it. We wouldn\u2019t want to do it if we weren\u2019t able to do what we wanted either, so that\u2019s tough.\nTouch: I don\u2019t see an end date, like we need to have everything done by this time. I just see certain pieces to the puzzle that will eventually get us there. It\u2019s a process.\nFlavor: One last question that we probably should have asked earlier, what was your guys\u2019 inspiration?\nTouch: For me it was just something about a hip-hop beat, I know that was my first inspiration. I think it was an Ice-T\u00a0 song, and I knew from that moment I needed more of that. After that you just make it a priority to find it.\nNato: My inspiration probably came from having a musical upbringing, and partly from being a little bit of a rebel. When I first heard aggressive rap music when I was in grade 5 I just really took to it and want to learn how I could create something like it.\n"}, {"score": 936.4349, "uuid": "786d76e0-a5d0-5559-a39b-793551cf1c1a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1108wb-45-10094", "target_hostname": "berkeleyplace.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://berkeleyplace.wordpress.com/category/rap/", "page_rank": 1.2381776e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Rap</em> \u00ab Berkeley Place", "snippet": "I was gonna start this post by writing, \u201cI listen to a lot of <em>rap</em> . .\u201d But the truth <em>is</em>, I listen to <em>rap</em> a lot, but not a lot of different rappers.

Most of us radio prod geeks use the Internet in some form or another, either writing stuff for our respective stations' sites, or writing stuff for our own personal sites. Or, we just sit in our studios with the doors locked and look at porno sites. However, many of us have discovered that the Internet can be an invaluable research tool for commercial writing purposes.\nInterview: Jim Cook - Clear Channel Atlanta\nBy Jerry Vigil\nThe convergence of consolidation and technology is having a huge impact on radio production. That super producer on the east coast is now all of a sudden available to you on the west coast. Wide area networks offer high quality production elements, free of charge and ready for you to download and use on your next promo. Tomorrows production departments are beginning to take shape, and Clear Channels Jim Cook is one of the people helping to shape them. In this months RAP Interview, Jim shares some insights into this new world of radio production and gives us a glimpse of how Clear Channels five Atlanta stations are taking care of business.\nFeature: Client Voiced Commercials: A Time Wasting Chore, or Your Opportunity to Shine?\nBy Craig Jackman\nOne part of radio production that I've had success with over the years is client voiced\nspots. Everybody has to do these, but not all of them sound like there was the same amount of effort involved. In fact, I would venture that most client voiced commercials sound like crap. Clients who want to voice their own spots generally fall into 2 categories: those who want to stroke their own ego, and those who feel that only they can truly represent their business. I really don't care which category they fall into, its our job to make them sound believable.\nTest Drive: Lexicon MPX500 Dual Channel Processor\nBy Steve Cunningham\nLexicon is to reverb as Xerox is to photocopies, and they've established themselves as the market leaders for quality reverb processors. The company produced the first commercial digital delay line (the Delta-T 101) back in 1971, and it has always been known for their high-end studio effects. Back when I was a degenerate rock musician, I drooled regularly over the Lexicon Prime Time delays and 224 reverbs we used in recording studios. I was fortunate to acquire a couple Lexicons in the mid-80s at fire-sale prices a used Model 200 reverb (circa 1983, list $5000) and a new PCM-70 (circa 1987, list $2500). I still have them both and they're among my favorites, in some cases besting some fancy software plug-in reverbs.\nSo when the editor of RAP told me there was an MPX500 on its way to me for review, I was more than ready. What I was not ready for was how much Lexicon sound you can get today for a list price of $599.\nProduction Libraries: TA&A - Deep Impact & Rock Impact\nBy John Pellegrini\nBarter production library packages are all the rage right now in the radio industry. The concept of trading a couple of commercials per day in order to gain extra production beds and audio candy is quite appealing to many stations. Most of the barter packages offer bi-weekly CD updates of music beds, stagers, sweepers, and montages of audio to fit particular formats. Some even go so far as to offer fully produced imaging promos that can either be aired intact or used as idea starters. These are all great supplements to a stations existing library packages.\nYet the question can occasionally be heard echoing throughout the lonely end of the station hall down where the production person makes his or her nest, \"why dont the production library companies offer their actual music libraries on barter?\" The answer: welcome to TA&A. Toby Arnold & Associates have launched a barter program for their entire production and imaging library. Not just a few music beds every 2 weeks; were talking the entire catalog of CDs under the TA&A banner.\nQ It Up: The RAP Network Speaks - Archiving Commercials from Multiple Sources\nBy Jerry Vigil\nQ It Up: Not so many years ago, archiving spots was easy. Pretty much everything arrived on reel easy to label, file and retrieve. Now, stations get spots delivered on reel, the occasional cassette, CD, MiniDisc, DAT, via an FTP site, as an e-mail attachment, on the DGS box, on floppy or Zip discs, and the folks at Audiosonix, Spot Taxi, and similar services are knocking at the door. Do you have an efficient system for saving and cataloging spots from all these different sources so salespeople and production people can easily find them down the road? If so, please describe your system, and please include any other comments you might have on the subject.\nRadio Hed: Inside Story\nBy Jeffrey Hedquist\nYes, its improv time again. Remember when this column used to be about radio? It still is. If the world of improv can contribute just one more technique to help us create better radio, then it will have been worth it.\nWrite a dialogue spot. The two characters interact, but their \"real\" thoughts are spoken by their own voices filtered and/or echoed, or by one or two other voices playing the \"inside\" voice(s). Each time a main character speaks, the \"inside\" voice says what the character is \"really\" thinking.\nPersonal Computing: You've Got E-Mail\nBy Reid Goldsborough\nDespite flashiness of the Web, e-mail is and has always been the Internets killer app. E-mail is the primary reason people go online, followed by research, according to a survey by Louis Harris & Associates. More than 1.6 billion noncommercial e-mail messages are sent each day in the U.S., which is nearly three times the number first-class postal mailings, according to an analysis by eMarketer, an Internet market research firm in New York City.\nWay Off The Mark: Make My Day\nBy Mark Margulies\nA mans got to know his limitations\" Dirty Harry\nThe line is from one of the early Dirty Harry movies, starring Clint Eastwood, but it just as well may have been written for us in the radio business as a warning. That's because this is a business where the tendency to over-promise starts at the very top, works its way down through sales, and ends up, finally, with us, in the writing and production end. That's where a Production Director and creative specialist have to keep that great line in mind know your limitations. Its the key to helping to prevent tune-out during stop sets.\n...And Make It Real Creative: Brainstorming\nBy Trent Rentsch\nDone properly, a Brainstorming session can give you a ton of great ideas for your current, and even future clients. Brainstorms can also be a great bonding experience with the rest of the staff. Done properly, you'd be amazed what wonderful, gifted, funny, FUN people you work with!\nRAP Forum: Are Your Spots Super Bowl Caliber?\nBy Shawn Kelly\nLast year, on January 31, 2000.

While I\u2019m not about to debate feminism pro or con, I think this phrase can also be used to illustrate a common problem in advertising, which I alluded to last year in the June issue of RAP (\"The Nature of Sound\"). Inappropriate advertising. Spots that have absolutely no value whatever in promoting the client\u2019s business or services. Are your commercials guilty of this problem? Do you find yourself writing commercials that are as helpful to your client as a bicycle is to a fish?\nInterview: Steve McKenzie, NextMedia, Chicago\nBy Jerry Vigil\nThis year\u2019s RAP Awards competition had lots of close races, except in the category of Large Market Commercials. Steve McKenzie\u2019s spot for Pirro Brother\u2019s Pizza beat out its closest competition by a 3 to 1 margin. Steve also managed to capture the 2nd Runner-up award in the same category. As Corporate Production Director for the Chicago area NextMedia group, Steve makes home base at WZSR-FM where he handles the commercial production for the group\u2019s cream of the crop accounts. They\u2019re in good hands.\nTest Drive: Tascam US-428 - USB Interface Controller\nBy Steve Cunningham\nIn the beginning, there was the reel-to-reel tape recorder and the mixing console. These had buttons and faders and knobs. We used them every day, and we all became fast and accurate with them. We could adjust the mid EQ on the music channel without even looking at the board. We could dead pot the VO channel at the right moment while watching only the meters. We were the equivalent of touch-typists, and it was good.\nThen came the digital audio workstation with its keyboard, mouse, and monitor. It had no buttons, no faders, and no knobs. There were some exceptions, but those workstations that had buttons, faders, and knobs generally cost our station owners dearly. So many of us had to abandon our friendly controls, because yea and verily we lacked budget. We had to adapt, and we did.\nRecently several companies have brought forth control surfaces to lead us out of the fader-less desert and into the promised land. Among these is Tascam with their US-428 Digital Audio Workstation controller.\nRadio Hed: Contrast\nBy Jeffrey Hedquist\nThe use of contrast in a radio commercial will draw attention, make it interesting, create the unexpected and keep listeners from falling asleep. Too often commercials are all one flavor - sea of audio beige.\nTry juxtaposing silence and noise or two widely different music cuts to tell the story of two aspects of a product or service.\nProduction Libraries: Noise II & Reaxion from Omega Productions\nBy John Pellegrini\nOmega Productions has been around for 10 years, primarily focused as an imaging company for numerous radio and TV clients around the world. They offer voice-over, production, sweepers, commercial production, and sound effect and music libraries. Their services can be heard on major market stations in the USA, Canada, UK, and Greece. In the music and sound effects category, they offer six CDs (called libraries, here), with a large variety of sound effects, sweepers, stingers, promo beds and commercial beds. Because they\u2019re a newer company they have the advantage of not having their music tracks burned out all over the American airwaves, which is appealing for those of you who are always looking for something that no one else is using. For this review, they sent copies of their two newest discs, Noise II, and Reaxion. Both are perfect for Alternative Rock, Rhythmic CHR, Hot AC, Hot CHR, Urban, Sports, or any dance format.\nQ It Up: The RAP Network Speaks - Monitoring Your Mixes - Part 2\nBy Jerry Vigil\nQ It Up: How do you monitor your mix? When mixing a promo, commercial, or any other voice over music/sfx type project, do you mix with the monitors turned up loud, down low, or somewhere in the middle? Do you use near-field monitors, or do you use large monitors hanging from the ceiling? Maybe you use them both. How do you prefer to monitor your mixes? Also, if you know, tell us what brand and model of monitors you use and/or which ones you prefer to use. Any other thoughts you have on monitoring mixes are welcome.\n...And Make It Real Creative:\nBy Trent Rentsch\nI\u2019ve been lying to you. If you\u2019ve read this column for any length of time, you\u2019ve endured several columns on personal change. On and on I\u2019ve babbled about how wonderful it is, what a growing, learning experience changing job and place can be, how it frees the Creative mind. What a load of crap. The fact is, I have always hated change. The uncertainty of it scared the hell out of me. Like the majority of humanity, I am a creature of habit, and enjoy all the creature comforts it brings. That does not mean that habit is a good thing, and in my case it was becoming a miserable cycle\u2014more on that later. The bottom line is, while I\u2019ve been scared of change in the past, a fresh start has been long over-due.\nWay Off the Mark: If Every Industry Thought Like Radio Executives Think\nBy Mark Margulies\nI\u2019ve been in this business almost 20 years, and yet, I am still constantly amazed at the complete disdain for what we write and produce as professionals. The prevailing thought is, it\u2019s an expensive luxury that can be done by others just as well, if not better. In fact, many stations PREFER their salespeople write the copy. The idea is, of course, they have the day-to-day contact with the client. They\u2019re in the trenches. They\u2019re asking the questions. They\u2019re listening to the client\u2019s wants, needs, likes and dislikes. They should be the ones best suited to draft the message the public hears because they understand it best.\nKind of makes me wonder what other industries would be like if they took radio\u2019s mentality and applied to their fields.\nRadio And Production Magazine --- PO Box 630071, Irving, TX 75063-0071 USA\nTelephone 972-432-8100 Fax 972-432-8102 E-mail: editor@rapmag.com .\n\u00a91988-2012 Novasound Productions.

The characters are fun, and the dancing, singing, and energetic music make this a very entertaining DVD. There is a segment with the familiar Marko the Pencil, which explains what multiplication is. The graphics and animation are excellent, as is the audio quality. The intro is relatively short and jumps right into the multiplication exercises. Each exercise has a different look and song, making the content less repetitive than it could be. The company has done a great job in making a learning DVD entertaining and educational.\u201d \u2014reviewer, iParenting Media Awards, 2009\n\u201cThe multiplication rap DVD was fun to watch. The children enjoyed the graphics, the music, and the rapping made it fun to learn. My children seemed to have better recall of their multiplication facts.\u201d \u2014 reviewer, iParenting Media Awards, 2009\n\u201cThe songs were fun and a great way to put the facts into memory. The delay answers give children time to answer the question. The characters held the attention of the children for something that can be rote and boring. While this would be an added benefit to the classroom, often teachers do not have enough time in the day to add supplemental items to the curriculum, that is why it is a great idea to also promote this to parents to use at home.\u201d \u2014 reviewer, iParenting Media Awards, 2009\nYou may also like:\n"}, {"score": 930.6621, "uuid": "5c4ba79d-6d68-558a-9023-242452e8c97d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1105wb-35-04702", "target_hostname": "commrap.colorado.edu", "target_uri": "http://commrap.colorado.edu/hall-activities/", "page_rank": 1.3116694e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Communication <em>RAP</em> | Hall Activities", "snippet": "IN an effort to become <em>better</em> aware of the ways that space and place communicate things about the larger cultures of <em>which</em> we are [...] Send an email listing COMM <em>RAP</em>&#x2F;Buckingham Hall as your residence hall preference to: reservations@colorado.edu", "explanation": null, "document": "Program Activities\nHall Activities\nOne benefit of being part of a living-learning community is that there are lots of opportunities to engage with other students and faculty both inside and outside the classroom.\nHere are the activities that the program has hosted:\nWomen\u2019s Self Defense Workshop (November 6, 2011)\u2013The Women\u2019s Self Defense class took place on Sunday, Novembr 6th at 7:00pm where students learned a bunch of moves to help protect themselves against various types of attacks.

It\u2019s the time of year to break out the shallow cranks, and the Rapala #5 & #7 Original balsa Shad Rap is what I reach for.\nThis little crankbait is a real fish catcher but it\u2019s often overlooked. You can search long and hard and not find a better cold water crankbait than the Rapala Shad Rap. When water temps dip into the Low 60's it\u2019s time to tie it on.\nThese baits have a very tight wiggle and I consider them to be a finesse type crankbait. When the shock of cooler water hits a body of water, fishing pressure picks up or the fishing is just generally tough and you need those few extra keepers for a limit, the Shad Rap is your crankbait.\nLike all crankbaits or treble hook baits they will hang up in heavy cover but there are a few things you can do to keep this to a minimum. Use a gentle pull or sweep of the rod when you feel your bait coming into contact with cover. Often the bait will deflect and bounce off of the cover. These baits really shine in the 3 - 6 feet range.\nA steady, slow retrieve works under most conditions and I really like a technique I call the \"sweep and reel\".\u00a0 I start cranking for about 10 handle turns and then I sweep or pull the rod tip slowly to the side and reel up the slack. I keep tension on the line and lure so it doesn\u2019t float up while I reel up the slack. This really works well when the water temps cool down to 48 to 50 degrees. I always use a slow gear ratio reel like a 5:1 or 5.3:1. You may think you can slow down enough with a 6:1 but trust me; you can't.\nThe #5 Shad Rap may be tough for beginners to throw with a bait caster. You may want to start out with spinning gear. I know lots of my buddies do it and it works great for them. I am more comfortable with bait casting. The wind can wreak havoc on these light baits and bait casting gear so be mindful of your cast when the wind blows.\nEven though I am throwing these baits on bait casting gear I still use lighter lines because I feel the lure action is much better with lighter line. I start with 10lb test and go up to 12lb if I am fishing a river or lake known for big fish. I may go down to 8lb for clear water or sparse cover.\u00a0If it is sparse cover, clear water and gravel or rock cover I use fluorocarbon. If the terrain is mostly wood then I use mono. I feel that the mono allows the bait to bounce or deflect off of the wood cover better because of the stretch in the line. Fluorocarbon, having less stretch, seems to make the bait dig into the wood more and hang up. That is my opinion on the lines. Do what works best for you.\nI like some type of cranking rod design when I use shallow cranks. I use a Dobyns 684 crankbait rod (6' 8\"\u00a0power #4). It has a great tip which allows fish to really inhale the bait and it\u2019s excellent for fighting them when they get up close to the boat. This rod is good for more than just crankbaits; it\u2019s great for sammy poppers and jerkbaits as well.\nBait color for me is pretty simple. I use four colors almost exclusively. In no particular order:\n1. Silver (black back & silver sides)\n2. Shad (I call it The Natural)\n3. Crawdad\n4. Firetiger\nThese four colors will work in whatever lake condition or water color you may be faced with. Clear or clean water and high sunny skies will find me using the silver and the natural. When the water is a little dirty or the skies are overcast I use the crawdad and the firetiger.\nThe only thing I do to modify these baits is change the hooks. On the #5 I put on Owner ST-36\u00a0treble hooks in size 6, and on the #7 Shad Rap I use Owner ST-36 in size 4. These hooks are very sharp, to the point of being \"sticky\" to the touch. This is great when a fish swipes at the bait but does not eat it completely. Additionally, I may add a suspend dot or two for added weight and I may add a red gill mark with a permanent marker.\nWith a well-stocked tackle box of Rapala #5 & #7 Shad Raps and these helpful tips you may find yourself ahead of some of your competitors this winter season. And if you want to just catch fish for fun you will most certainly need your pliers for plenty of hook removal. Have fun and give these balsa wood crankbaits a try!\nJoomla Templates and Joomla Extensions by ZooTemplate.Com\nLast Updated on Wednesday, 01 December 2010 11:40\n"}, {"score": 918.9054, "uuid": "815054e3-f5b5-5b10-acdd-87ce31d27877", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1416wb-72-10567", "target_hostname": "schweitz.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://schweitz.wordpress.com/tag/rap/", "page_rank": 1.2036714e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>rap</em> \u00ab Schweitz Design", "snippet": "Through the creative and recording processes of Spoken Word, Hip-Hop, <em>Rock</em> and Gospel music, Chosen Instrument aims to foster a positive atmosphere that allows artists to express themselves in ways that serve to <em>better</em> themselves, their community, their region and beyond.", "explanation": null, "document": "Chosen\u00a0Instrument\n01/09/2009, 4:28 pm\nFiled under: branding | Tags: bible , branding , chosen instrument , gospel , hip hop , identity , logo , music , note , positive , productions , R & B , rap , uplifting , wing , youth\nI recently completed the identity for Chosen Instrument Productions.

Through the creative and recording processes of Spoken Word, Hip-Hop, Rock and Gospel music, Chosen Instrument aims to foster a positive atmosphere that allows artists to express themselves in ways that serve to better themselves, their community, their region and beyond.\nIt was with this spirit and message in mind that the Chosen Instrument Productions logo was crafted. The logo is comprised of the Chosen Instrument Productions text and the \u201cWinged Note\u201d logo mark. The main text and mark were crafted in a graffiti-style that captures the energy and vibrancy of youth while maintaining professional sensibilities such as legibility. The overall appearance of the logo is edgy and yet accessible and is very much geared towards the youth demographic that Chosen Instrument is driven by.\nThe \u201cWinged Note\u201d icon was crafted to represent the idea of creating music that is upliftng. The \u201cWinged Note\u201d represents the power of music to \u201cfly above\u201d the typical negative stereotypes associated with hip-hop and rock music and reinforce the idea that Chosen Instrument creates music that is thematically and philosophically positive.\nThe Chosen Instrument Productions logo speaks to and reflects the ideals of the organization; it represents music as a powerful force through which creative and inspired youth may cultivate, create and record a unique, positive message.\n"}, {"score": 915.35254, "uuid": "747bc4f0-4949-5c6a-87d3-12f9aae7ff21", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0204wb-36-17565", "target_hostname": "www.insurancenetworking.com", "target_uri": "http://www.insurancenetworking.com/blogs/insurance_technology_social_networking_business_networking-24185-1.html", "page_rank": 1.3495817e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Which</em> Comes First, Social Networking <em>or</em> Openness?", "snippet": "Can Lindsay Lohan\u0097<em>or</em> the Insurance Industry\u0097be Saved?

Anyone who wants to better understand where this emerging force will take our businesses should read this article.\nThere are always questions about the business value of a new paradigm or technology, and social networking is no exception. Many executives claim that their organizations simply are not yet \u201cready\u201d for social networking approaches.\nThat raises a variation of the classic chicken-and-egg question: Will social networking help transform an organization to become more open and collaborative, or does an organization need to have an open and collaborative culture to adopt social networking in the first place?\nJeanne Meister and Karie Willyerd, authors of an upcoming book titled, The 2020 Workplace (forthcoming in spring), say yes, to some degree, an organization may need to be ready for social networking to make it work. They offer scenarios where things don't quite work out as planned: an executive blogging about a downsizing may invite criticism or even lawsuits from expelled employees, or a manager takes down a site because of critical comments about products or services.\nOr, consider what employees may be posting from home. What if they are posting negative things about the company, or people within the company? How many companies have policies on that?\nIt's possible an organization may not quite be ready to handle being open and transparent to employees, customers and partners, Meister and Willyerd say companies need to gradually immerse themselves in social networking strategies\u2014not dashing in an all-at-once fashion. One way to start is through pilot projects addressing specific business needs, such as employee communications and document sharing. They even recommend a one-day \u201cInnovation Jam\u201d involving the entire workforce.\nBill has a quote from Celent analyst Jeff Goldberg, who captures the challenge very well: \u201cTechnology is less well adopted when its an entirely new thing\u2014it's all about building into a process somebody is already using on a day-to-day basis.\u201d\nJoe McKendrick is an author, consultant, blogger and frequent INN contributor specializing in information technology.\nReaders are encouraged to respond to Joe using the \u201cAdd Your Comments\u201d box below.

Or how about those mythically beautiful creatures that tried to lure Odysseus to his death?\nWhoever said a picture is worth a thousand words is a deranged lunatic. As I wrote in \"Show Vs.

And each picture is different to each human who perceives it because each of us has a different mental image of what the word is describing.\nInterview: Ned Spindle - Q101, Chicago\nBy Jerry Vigil\nIf you like theatre of the mind production and the freedom to get a little crazy with your ideas, the Alternative Rock format is a good home for you.

The man keeping the station on the imaging edge is Ned Spindle, another one of those guys that found out people actually pay you \"for goofing off and having a wandering mind.\"\nFeature: The Best Workstation\nBy Dave Foxx\nA favorite recurring topic among broadcast producers concerns digital workstations. Which one is the fastest, easiest to use, allows the greatest flexibility, makes the best sounding production? I've heard SAW owners say they envy the Pro Tools users and Pro Tools users say they envy Audicy users. Of course those were far fewer than the SAW users who say SAW is tops and Audicy users who claim their system is best. The simple fact is, they're all the best. Now, before you English majors get on my case to explain how superlatives work, let me tell a little story. It might seem a bit off topic, but the payoff makes it work.\nTest Drive: Ozone from iZotope\nBy Craig Jackman\nI like compression. I like compression a lot. Its an effect that makes what I do sound better, although its all too easy to overuse. Even though I like compression, I've never really been head over heels in love with any of the compressors I've used - hardware or software. Of all of the ones I've used my favorite is the Waves C4 multi-band compressor/limiter. As the final touch on a mix that has to blast through the clutter, its one that I've reached for. When I heard that the ingenious young people at iZotope were working on a multi-band compressor/limiter with EQ called Ozone, I was looking forward to seeing what it could do. In case you've forgotten, iZotope is the company that makes Vinyl, the free software plug-in that emulates a turntable. Handy for CDs and turntable-less studios and its the most enjoyable bit of code I've come across in a long time.\nRadio Hed: The Straw Man Cometh\nBy Jeffrey Hedquist\nCreate a straw man. Invent a competitor, create a fanatic, a lunatic, an eccentric, a devils advocate, an overblown skeptic, or an out-of-control situation to position the advertiser as hero.\nDon't make the examples so unbelievable that the audience discounts the point you're trying to make. Example: if your client owns a car wash, don't create someone who sandblasts his car whenever it gets dirty. Maybe have a conversation with someone who collects a years worth of dirt on his car and views it as art, or a great procrastinator who waits for a rainstorm to wash off the accumulated dirt.\nQ It Up: The RAP Network Speaks - Handling Last Minute Digital Deliveries - Part 2\nBy Jerry Vigil\nQ It Up: One of the advertiser benefits of digital delivery systems such as SpotTaxi, SpotTraffic, DGS and others, as well as direct email and FTP download, is that the advertiser can get their commercials to the radio stations, literally, at the last minute. Newspapers and TV stations can take advantage of this and provide timely and topical commercials produced only a couple of hours before they're scheduled to air. And for any advertiser, its possible to make \"instant\" revisions. These \"benefits\" however, can sometimes have a negative effect on your production department as it scrambles to handle last minute production orders. There's also the increased chance of spots being missed because the commercial arrived too late, which can result in lost revenue as that avail disappears. If you use these digital delivery systems, how much are you and your department/station(s) affected by this last minute capability? If this creates problems for you and your station(s), how do you deal with them? Please add any further comments you might have on the subject.\n...And Make It Real Creative:\nBy Trent Rentsch\nAnimosity is an ugly thing on many levels. Working together becomes difficult, communication impossible. Yet here we are, on the same team, all trying to make the radio station a success, working together like one big dysfunctional family. Little wonder that a salesperson might make a claim that a client can use the latest Britney song on their commercial without paying royalties. Odds are said salesperson was never told the rules, what with the lack of communication in the building.\nPersonal Computing: Keeping Hackers Away With Personal Firewalls\nBy Reid Goldsborough\nOn any given day hackers try to breach my Internet-connected computers a half dozen or more times, looking for a \"server\" to use to launch attacks against others or trying to plant \"trojan\" or \"zombie\" programs on my PCs to take control of them. I'm not alone. If you have a full-time Internet connection, you're probably being probed continually as well. The media has had its hands full lately reporting high-profile computer break-ins. You'd think we were in the midst of an all-out info-war.\nThe Drawing Board: Build or Kill Creativity\nBy Tim Hopwood\nCreativity is a funny thing. Some people can sit down with a pad and pen and \"decide\" to be creative. Soon after their pen touches the paper, they have the makings of a great spot. I have worked with many production talents who can work in this magnificent manner. I have often wondered what makes these guys different from the guys who constantly run into creative roadblocks. Do they think differently? Did they inherit a \"creative gene\" that others were not fortunate enough to endure? Wait a minute -- maybe they ate their vegetables as a child -- instead of secretly slipping them to Duke, the family dog. Everyone thinks differently, but that doesn't mean you cant be creative -- even if it doesn't come when you call for it.\nMonday Morning Memo: Sneak Past the Security Guard\nBy Roy H. Williams\nDoubt is what happens when the security guard of the rational, logical left-brain isn't sure whether to accept an idea or not. But unlike his left-brain counterpart, the right-brain doesn't make judgments at all. He isn't concerned in the least about the plausibility of an idea; that's the left-brains job. So when your idea is rejected at the door of the left-brain, just knock on Righty's door. Hell let anyone in. Once inside the mind, your idea can scoot over to the logical left-brain on the waterslide of symbolic thought.\nRadio And Production Magazine --- PO Box 630071, Irving, TX 75063-0071 USA\nTelephone 972-432-8100 Fax 972-432-8102 E-mail: editor@rapmag.com .\n\u00a91988-2012 Novasound Productions.

Before or since. The station averaged over a 30-share of the Southern California audience for over six years until Chuck left to form his own creative services company.\nThe Chuck Blore Company has won over 400 major radio and television awards making it, what Adweek Magazine called, \"Probably the most honored company in the history of broadcast advertising.\" In 1976 he created \"The Remarkable Mouth\" TV commercials for radio stations which have been on the air, somewhere in the world ever since. 2001 marked the 25th year of continuous exposure for \"The Mouth.\" That's gotta be a record.\nChuck is the only person ever to have won both of the most coveted awards the Television Promotion Industry can bestow: The Professional Achievement Award and induction into the Hall of Fame. The radio industry also honored him with the Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into The Hall of Fame.\nImaging, branding, and corporate positioning are other arenas in which the work of CBC has been honored. The launch campaign for The Learning Channel swept the International Film Festival Awards in Houston winning the Gold, Silver and Bronze awards. Corporate Films for Tri-Star, Columbia and ABC TV have been recognized for the \"Level of significant achievement.\" NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, DISCOVERY, TLC, CNBC, TLN, and many others have used the creative services of CBC.\nThe Chuck Blore Company expanded into program production in 1995, when Chuck wrote, produced and directed (with a little help form some friends) a 60-minute TV special, \"The New Adventures of Mother Goose\" featuring Sally Struthers and Emmanuel Lewis. Chuck received an Emmy nomination for \"Best Directorial Achievement.\"\nChuck has taught at UCLA, USC, and CSUN. He has spoken to advertising, broadcast and cable groups in every major city in America and in almost every English speaking country in the world where there is commercial broadcasting.\nThere's a lot more stuff but that's probably enough for now. This months RAP Interview gets some insight into both the programming and production side of Chucks legendary career. And we get a sneak peek at Chucks latest offering, Chucks Kids, a library of voice tracks and more from Chucks amazing archive of commercials involving child voice talents, a library that puts the core elements of some of Chucks most successful radio commercials into the hands of producers everywhere.\nRead, assimilate, create.\nRadio Hed: Slice of Lifestyle\nBy Jeffrey Hedquist\nSince the most effective radio commercials are stories about your intended audience, the more you know about that audiences lifestyle, the more convincing your story will be. Unfortunately, most of the commercials they hear sound like commercials. So if you can create a story so that the listener says to themselves, \"Yeah, that's what its like,\" or \"Hey, that's me!\" you will have established some immediate rapport with them. That's the first step.\nTest Drive: Vegas Video 3.0 from Sonic Foundry\nBy Steve Cunningham\nWhy would anyone involved in radio production ever consider using a software editor with the word \"Video\" in its name? If the product is from Sonic Foundry, purveyors of the industry-standard Sound Forge stereo audio editor, you'd know enough to consider it. Even given that the products full moniker is Vegas Video, Ill bet that you'd give it a go, and you'd be right to do so.\nProduction 212: Compression De-mystified\nBy Dave Foxx\nFor the last couple of months, we've been soliciting people to let us critique their work in future issues. So far, the response has been about 300 requests for private critiques and 0 for public. {sigh} I guess we should have seen that one coming. However, there is an interesting thread I've noticed throughout the private sessions. Just about every response I've made has mentioned compression. Some have been all about compression; some mentioned it in passing. It seems that most people need more. So, lets talk a bit about what compression really is and what it really does because I'm learning that a lot of people really don't know.\nQ It Up: The RAP Network Speaks - Dealing with Agency/Client Scripts Requiring Kids' Voices - Part 2\nBy Jerry Vigil\nQ It Up: What do you do when the client or agency comes up with a script that has children in it? Do you explain the child labor laws in your area, which prevent you from having a child on staff, and make them change the script? Do you drag your kids in from school to cut the spot?

Or do you put that pitch shifter to good use?\nProduction Library Review: Organism III from Alien Imaging\nBy John Pellegrini\nFrom Jeff Schmidt at KFOG comes a new package of production elements that should be considered for use at any Alternative or Active Rock station around the globe. Though you could also make a strong case in using this package for Urban, CHR, Rhythmic CHR, Hot AC, Modern AC, and Jeff says he's even sold one to a Classic Rocker. ORGANISM III (more on that number in a bit) from Alien Imaging (Jeff's production service company) is a collection of 240 wild elements that can add loads of just the right weirdness to anyone's sound. They're all on one 98 track CD, with proper indexing for ease of access.\n...And Make It Real Creative:\nBy Trent Rentsch\nFunny how even familiar things can cause so much fear and anxiety. The act of pushing past the boundaries of our comfort zone, trying new things and accepting new challenges can scare the hell out of us. even in a place that's been home, with characters who have been a part of our lives for a long time. For a Creative, trying new things should be a way of life, but there's still that inbred human fear of the unknown that can get in the way. \"What if this comes back to bite me?\" \"What if I screw up?\" \"What if I look stupid?\" \"What if I lose any shred of credibility I've ever had?\" You know what? \"What ifs\" are just stop signs our minds put up that keep us from trying to get better. Yes, we all make mistakes and some attempts beyond ones comfort zone will be horrible, but even those attempts are a learning and growing experience.\nRadio And Production Magazine --- PO Box 630071, Irving, TX 75063-0071 USA\nTelephone 972-432-8100 Fax 972-432-8102 E-mail: editor@rapmag.com .\n\u00a91988-2012 Novasound Productions.

The enlightenment served to cripple the intolerance of incisive religious and government leaders, but did not obliterate censorship altogether. Instead, the job of expurgating unacceptable ideas has simply fallen into new hands using new tactics. Censors now assume the guise of capitalist retailers and distributors, special-interest groups, and less influential but still passionate religious and government authorities. Their new techniques are market-censorship (dominating the marketplace), constituitive censorship (the control of language), power-knowledge (restricting knowledge), as well as the traditional regulative censorship (law). These new forces can be as equally effective as the forces of remote history. We notice the effect of post-enlightenment civilization as early as the nineteenth-century in the great Russian humanist Aleksandr Herzin. Herzin left his native country in protest of Czarist censorship only to feel profound disillusionment with the extremely narrow limits of permission imposed on freedom of expression by market censorship in the West (Jansen 1991). This author will explore how these forces are affecting the free expression of musicians and lyricists of popular music in the United States, show how censorship has failed to work as planned, and provide a solution to the problem. Music as Literature and Art Music lyrics are essentially composed as poems, ballads, monologues, and the like, and set to music. They may take the form of actual spoken or sung sounds or of written words, as literature does. Any form of literature can be sung with musical accompaniment and become lyrics. Remove the music and we are left with literature. Lyrics are therefore a form literature. All the concepts that apply to literature can therefore apply to lyrics. This author shall employ such concepts, including laws regarding public speech and public press, in my analysis of music censorship. Censors throughout history are familiar with this association of music and the press, attacking each in similar fashion. Jeremy Collier, a seventeenth-century Englishman, thought that music was almost as dangerous as gunpowder and might require looking after no less than the press (Rodnitzky 1972). Lyrics also constitute an art form. Musicians are artists who create something new using a certain amount of creativity. The result displays an aesthetic quality, though it may also have other emotional and analytical attributes. Lyrics can then be considered art and concepts concerning art may be applied to them, as this author chooses to do. The Importance of Art Before this author can discuss how and why music is being censored, it is vital to explain the significance of art in our lives. Picasso said, All art is a lie that helps us to see the truth better. All art is a lie in that it attempts to imitate truth or to reveal something about reality outside the piece of art. Art can be a window, a passage way for our minds to perceive the external world. Art can also be a mirror, a way of looking out and perceiving ourselves. It is important for the images in the mirror to keep changing so they may accurately reflect ourselves. Peter Michelson said: The responsibility of society, if it accepts poetry as a mode of knowledge, is to remain open to what poets of all genres, including the pornographic, have to say. Otherwise all mirrors will soon reflect the same imbecilic smile (Michelson 1971). Someone once said, Fish will be the last animal to discover water, simply because they are always immersed in it. Sometimes truth can be hard to examine because we have difficulty in recognizing it. We have difficulty in recognizing truth because we are constantly subjected to it and gradually become numb to it. Art, whether it be literature, theatre, visual arts, or music, by way of its difference from reality, gives us a mental pinch so that we may awake and perceive the truth with new eyes. Art can communicate in ways that other media cannot. By manipulating the environment, art can link directly to the emotions. Sue Curry Jansen explained: ...it is also frequently the ragged cutting edge of emancipatory communication, for even in the most permissive times the artful evocations and contra-factuality of Aesopean mischief have a freer range than the language of theory (Jansen 1991). And Herbert Marcuse noted: Art breaks open a dimension inaccessible to other experience, a dimension in which human beings, nature, and things no longer stand under the law of the established reality principle. Subject and objects encounter the appearance of the autonomy which is denied them in their society. The encounter with the truth of art happens in the estranging language and images which make perceptible, visible, and audible that which is no longer or not yet, perceived, said, and heard in everyday life (Marcuse 1978). Some may say that the music they consider offensive, rock n' roll and rap music, is not art at all because it is of a lesser quality and is therefore a lower form of entertainment. This opinion relies on the musical taste of the individual and is too subjective to concede. Besides, rap and rock n' roll, being within the genre of popular music, will have many more subjective patrons than will styles of high art, such as classical music. Even if we accepted this view, based on the general complexity of classical music verses popular music, there is still a case to be made for simplicity: ...the danger exists then of assuming that the other audience, the audience one does not converse with, is more passive, more manipulated, more vulgar in taste, than may be the case. One can easily forget that things that strike the sophisticated person as trash may open new vistas for the unsophisticated; moreover, the very judgment of what is trash may be biased by one's own unsuspecting limitations, for instance, by one's class position or academic vested interest (Riesman 1950). On a less profound, but no less important point, people gain pleasure from the arts. Indeed, to some people, art's sole purpose is to provide pleasure. Philosophers from Aristotle to Immanuel Kant to John Stuart Mill have argued that happiness is our ultimate goal, the end to all our means. As Americans, we proclaim the pursuit of happiness is an inalienable right included in our Declaration of Independence. Music can improve the quality of our life and inspire great feelings within ourselves. Thoreau said, When I hear music I fear no danger. I am invulnerable. I see no foe. I am related to the earliest times and to the latest (Rodnitzky 1972). The Importance of Art to Artists The desire or need to invoke expressions unusual in everyday life is a passion for some artists. It is not present in everyone, and not everyone who feels this passion has the talent neccessary to succeed as an artist. So then, the artist is a minority among professions, a small voice with a delicate product. This great desire or need to create and share with those in everyday life is important enough for a person to pursue the profession of an artist, a career of spiritual as well as economic need. Once an artist, an individual produces art, something that may be thought of as a commodity. A censor who seeks to limit the distribution of this commodity not only harms the artist economically, but also professionally, because the artist cannot share her best work as she feels the need. The actions of the censor become a dual hardship for the artist. Laurie Anderson, an influential singer/songwriter, summed up her feelings on the subject: What's this morality play about? Mostly about fear. I'm an artist because it's one of the few things you can do in this country that has no rules, and the idea of someone writing rules for that makes me crazy. Ideas can be crushed, artists can be crushed, and I think this is an emergency (Flanagan 1990). On Censorship My ideas on the necessity of free expression are guided in part by the ideas of George Bernard Shaw found in his essay, On Censorship. Shaw views censorship as an inherently conservative action, that is, performed by those who desire to preserve tradition. He pointed out that morality is a phenomenon dependent on the majority: Whatever is contrary to established manners and customs is immoral. An immoral act or doctrine is not necessarily a sinful one: on the contrary, every advance in thought and conduct is by definition immoral until it has converted the majority. For this reason it is of the most enormous importance that immorality should be protected jealously against the attacks of those who have no standard except the standard of custom, and who regard any attack on custom - that is, on morals - as an attack on society, on religion, and on virtue. Henry Miller, whose novel, Tropic of Cancer, was banned in the United States for some time, cited the difficulty an artist faces when dealing with the morality of the majority: The artist must conform to the current, and usually hypocritical, attitude of the majority. He must be original, courageous, inspiring, and all that - but never too disturbing. He must say Yes while saying No (Miller 1947). Shaw conceded the need for morality in those that are not capable of original ethical judgment, for they have no other means for guiding their lives. But for the rest of us, It is immorality, not morality, that needs protection: it is morality, not immorality that needs restraint; for morality, with all the dead weight of human inertia and superstition to hang on the back of the pioneer, and all the malice of vulgarity and prejudice to threaten him, is responsible for many persecutions and many martyrdoms. For Shaw, as well as John Stuart Mill, immoral doctrines lead us in new directions that may bring us truth, and which we would not find if it were not for dissenting opinions. Without the writings of Thomas Paine and Henry Miller, the theories of Charles Darwin and Galileo, and even the blasphemy of Jesus, our civilization would be less cultured and truthful than it is. Shaw said ...an overwhelming case can be made out for the statement that no nation can prosper or even continue to exist without heretics and advocates of shockingly immoral doctrines. To those who said that some ideas may harm society in the same manner as other crimes, Shaw said there is even more harm done by the censor: whereas no evil can conceivably result from the total suppression of murder and theft, and all communities prosper in direct proportion to such suppression, the total suppression of immorality, especially in matters of religion and sex, would stop enlightenment... Shaw also recognized the interpretation that says freedom of expression should entail some kind of good sense in what is expressed. There have been several examples of this view through history. Plato wrote that art should display socially acceptable, responsible messages. In the 1950s, Michigan Representative Charles C. Digge thought the altering of lyrics was just a matter of good taste (Volz 1991). Recently, a letter by Tipper Gore of the Parents Music Resource Group asked the record industry for self-restraint (Haring 1990). And an editorial in The New Republic defines freedom through contradiction: ...it really is wise restraints that make us genuinely free... (Norwood 1989). Shaw rejected these views as hopelessly relative and bias: ...what he means by toleration is toleration of doctrines that he considers enlightened, and, by liberty, liberty to do what he considers right... The First Amendment to our Constitution allows us freedom of speech and press provided we do not violate any other laws in the process. As we shall see, there are no laws providing for music censorship. Music Censorship Throughout the history of music, would-be censors have primarily targeted controversial lyrics as a problem, but there have been efforts to blame the actual music for causing society\u0092s ills. Every unusual advancement has met with disputes, whether it be Johann Sebastian Bach\u0092s complex counterpoint or heavy metal\u0092s distorted guitars. In this century, jazz, bebop, swing, rock n' roll, and rap have all had detractors. Such attacks have traditionally been initiated by adults ready to attribute juvenile delinquency on a musical form that appeals almost exclusively to young people and which few of its detractors comprehend (Epstein 1990). There is definitely a factor of time at work here chiseling away at society\u0092s standards of morality. When once Elvis\u0092 pelvic gyration would not be televised, it is now an accepted entertainment technique. Bach\u0092s adventuresome textures that threatened his employment can sound boring now. Today we become offended by explicit sex or violence or language pertaining to such threats to morality. Robert L. Gross pointed out: ...this controversy is a replay of the age old generation gap, in a new and, perhaps, more striking form. Iron Maiden may strike today\u0092s adults as alien to their culture, but the author suspects that a similar reaction occurred when adults first heard the lyrics to Good Golly, Miss Molly (Gross 1990). At one time these attacks were even racially motivated: In the 50s, petitions were circulated which said, Don\u0092t allow your children to buy Negro records. The petitions referred to the raw unbridled passion of screaming people with dark skin who were going to drive our children wild. Some things never go out of fashion in certain ideological camps. They are like tenets of the faith (Zappa 1988). There are claims that contemporary efforts to censor music are racist, and this author has encountered more incidents involving black-oriented rap music than white-oriented hard rock music, where the second greatest number of attacks have been aimed. But when trying to ascertain such a prejudice, there is a difficulty in separating the number of attacks on each style of music from the overall content of each style. Rap music may be cited more often because it contains a greater amount of offensive material overall. A claim in either direction would require an independent study. None of these music-related claims have been popularly accepted, largely due to the difficulty in providing tangible proof. Instances of Satanism have been attributed to drug abuse rather than music (Epstein 1990). Congressional subcommittee hearings of 1955 trying to associate rock music with juvenile delinquency were unsuccessful, as were the 1973 Buckley report on rock music and drug abuse and the 1985 senate hearings on obscenity in popular music (Epstein 1990). The 1970 Commission on Obscenity and Pornography (C.O.P.) report asserted that it is obviously not possible, and never could be possible, to state that never on any occasion, under any conditions, did any erotic material ever contribute in any way to the likelihood of any individual committing a sex crime. Indeed, no such statement could be made about any kind of nonerotic material (Oboler 1974). An extensive study encompassing psychology, physiology, behavioral studies, sociology, and music would have to be done to prove a form of music is capable of causing harm. The researchers would have to be trained not only in research methods but in all these fields and the music involved. A willing, impartial musicologist proficient in the music of subcultures might be a rare find. Given these reasons it is clear why, to my knowledge, such a study has not been performed. The effects of music are still debatable. Lyrics Where music is subject to vague interpretations and may alienate people according to subculture, lyrics are a more concrete form of expression. Lyrics are words that are sung or spoken with musical accompaniment, or sung without accompaniment. Lyrics embody the sentiment the writer is trying to convey in a ridged manner, with less free interpretation and more definitive meaning than in music alone. Only knowledge of the language is needed to understand the words, if not the ideas also, and therefore to construct a sensible, believable dialog on their value or non-value. In 1986, the Meese Commission on Pornography recommended that spoken words not be challenged for obscenity (Holland 1989), and the C.O.P. report recommended, the repeal of existing federal legislation which prohibits or interferes with consensual distribution of 'obscene' materials to adults (Oboler 1974), but challenges on music lyrics continue through 1991. Because of this conflict, lyrical content is the subject that this author will address. Realism Musicians are often cited for using obscene language, ideas, and imagery in their lyrics. What is labeled obscene is usually a documentation of real people and real events expressed through language suited to the report. It has been said that, The difference - and it\u0092s an important difference - is that today\u0092s salacious lyrics are not the exception to otherwise generally accepted sexual standards and community values, but a symbol of their collapse (Gross 1990). Admittedly, lyrics can be shocking, but they describe the reality of our lives in our world. Frank Zappa, a musician of strong influence on early rock music, noted that ...if one wants to be a real artist in the United States today and comment on our culture, one would be very far off the track if one did something delicate or sublime. This is not a noble, delicate, sublime country (Zappa 1988). Explicit sex, violence, pain, suffering, and unusual human acts are characteristics of the human drama. Lyrical content is now censored when relating to ...explicit sex, explicit violence, or explicit substance abuse (Baker 1989). Sexual acts, in particular, are commonly accepted in our society, but the language that denotes these acts is not. Perhaps it is the actual acts that the censors wish to curb, especially in youth, and by censoring the symbols for sex - language - they hope to censor the reality of sex. The logic is that without knowledge, there will be no corresponding action. But this logic is backwards, for it is the action that comes first, which is then symbolized through language. Regarding the censorship of the symbols, this author agrees with Goethe's view: It would be a bad state of affairs if reading had a more immoral effect than life itself, which daily develops scandalous scenes in abundance, if not before our eyes than before our ears. Even with children we need not by any means be too anxious about the effects of a book or a play. As I have said, daily life is more effective than the most effective book (Goethe 1832). Sex, violence, and substance abuse are certainly real factors of society. If a musician cannot relate explicit information on these topics without being censored, then he or she may feel the need to hold something back. The next logical conclusion is that by withholding explicit information the musician would be sacrificing accuracy. An inaccurate piece of art may still have aesthetic value, but may not contain the message that the musician wanted to express and that the listener may have needed to hear. It is a popular opinion within the artistic sphere that [Musicians] should be able to sing about drugs and the gang culture and teenage sexuality and a whole list of issues that need to be sung about (Holland 1989). How can we learn from our history if we do not know the whole story and the lessons learned from it? We need to know what issues face us now and suggestions for dealing with them. We need to foresee issues of the future that must be addressed in the present. A dialogue on our societal issues in poetic but inaccurate terms will do us no good when trying to cope in the real world. Gorky summed up the association of art and reality: Myth is invention. To invent means to extract from the sum of a given reality its cardinal idea and embody it in imagery - that is how we got realism. But if to the idea extracted from the given reality we add - completing the idea, by the logic of hypothesis - desired, the possible, and thus supplement the image, we obtain that romanticism which is at the basis of myth and is highly beneficial in that it tends to provoke a revolutionary attitude to reality, an attitude that changes the world in a practical way (Gorky 1934). The same reasons for censoring views on sex, violence and substance abuse are the same reasons these views should be heard: because they are controversial. John Stuart Mill asserted that the truth is most likely to emerge from a conflict of opinions. A censored opinion, whether true or false, sidesteps conflict and secures our distance in the truth. In a court case involving censorship of the band Dead Kennedys, Barry Lynn, the Legislative counsel to the national American Civil Liberties Union, revealed the symbiotic relationship of controversy and censorship: ...Dead Kennedy material and visual art in general lampoons the conformism of American society. That is preeminently political speech. We know it works because it annoyed the authorities enough to try to intimidate their critics into submission by calling them obscene (Kennedy 1990). Importance of Lyrics as a Medium of Information The same segment of the population that censorship usually aims to protect is the same segment controversial music is intended for: teenagers and young adults. Often these controversial issues are new to or directly affect young people. There is little recognition by parents and particularly by censors of the way music is used by young people in America. The attitudes and ideas embodied in lyrics may act as a catalyst for change from childhood to adulthood. Censors only focus on the aspects they consider to be offensive. David Riesman sees the cause of this as a lack of structure: Such a youth movement differs from the youth movement of other countries in having no awareness of itself, as such, no direct political consciousness, and, on the whole, no specialized media of communication (Riesman 1950). Youth has no universal link with itself; instead of ideas traveling from the youth to their peers, they travel from musician to youth. Youth therefore need to be educated and informed in some way, and music is a strong link to their lifestyle. Studies have shown that the average teenager listens to rock music about four hours a day (Mann 1988). Musicians can act as the youth\u0092s journalists, reporting the events of the day in a manner that appeals to them more than conventional news. Popular music can inspire a radical mentality, it is a major political weapon urging youth to improve their world (Rodnitzky 1972). Henry Thoreau labeled music the arch-reformer. Chuck D. of the popular Rap group Public Enemy asserts, Rap is the only way to communicate with black youth anymore. We\u0092re the TV station, the six o\u0092clock news. We\u0092ve got to tell the truth (DiLeo 1989). Rapper Ice Cube works from the assumption that Rap music is a form of education (Cole 1991). Often it is a moral education that lyricists offer, one that is not always taught in school. A 1972 study said, Their songs constitute a radical influence, but, more importantly, they supply examples of conscience and principle to a society which has increasingly been unable to provide its youth with credible examples of either conscience or principle (Rodnitzky 1972). After their original album cover was censored, the rock group Jane's Addiction released another cover with only Article 1 of the Bill of Rights on it, and inside was a message addressed to the Mosquitoes: We have more influence over your children than you do, but we love your children. Most of you love them too, very much. You want what's best for them. Consider them when planning the future. Right? Oh, mother, father, your blindness to our most blessed gift, NATURE, leaves us with the overwhelming task of correcting your utter mess....I understand why they want to protect their children, but for their own good, let me point out that though you may have to explain subjects to your children that you perceive as wrong, it is better to have the freedom to explain it in your own words than be silenced under a government that has the power to squash anyone who opposes their views....Try to restrict our freedoms and we will fight even harder to preserve them (Farrell 1990). Principles are not only offered by offensive artists, Establishment organizations also try to contribute their share of wisdom. The national collegiate group Campus Crusade for Christ has sponsored a touring folk-rock group (Rodnitzky 1972), and in the 1980s Christian groups have gained popularity, among them the heavy metal group Stryper and the rapper M.C. Hammer. The rock group U2 discredits South Africa\u0092s policy of apartheid. Sting, a popular singer/songwriter, promotes environmental awareness through his music and through his own company. The 10,000 Maniacs, a rock group, has breached the subject of domestic violence. The list goes on. Often explicit language is needed when describing valid opinions and important observations about our world through one of the few means of communication attended to by young people. Labeling Since 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) has been the pressuring force in music censorship. The PMRC was founded by Susan Baker, wife of Secretary of State James Baker, and Tipper Gore, wife of Tennessee senator Albert Gore. The Center is a nonprofit organization whose purpose is to educate parents about media messages. Although they object to some music lyrics, they have not tried to have them removed from recordings. In order to help parents monitor the content of music their children listen to, the PMRC supports ...a voluntary, nonrestrictive consumer labeling plan for albums... but they ...do not support censorship (Baker 1989). After senate hearings on porn rock in 1985, the PMRC reached an agreement with the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) to place a sticker on certain music albums. The following is RIAA\u0092s policy statement of lyric content: To facilitate the exercise of parental discretionon behalf of younger children, participating RIAA member recording companies will identify future releases of their recordings with lyric content relating to explicit sex, explicit violence, or explicit substance abuse. Such recordings, where contractually permissible, either will be identified with a packaging inscription that will state:\u0091Explicit Lyrics - Parental Advisory\u0092...or such recordings will display printed lyrics (Baker 1989). RIAA record companies include Atlantic, Arista, A&M, Chrysalis, Compleat, Crescendo, Capitol-EMI, Columbia, Mike Curb Productions, Epic, Elektra, MCA, Motown, Manhattan [now EMI], PolyGram, RCA, Solar, Scotti, Tabu, and Warner Bros. Together they account for 80% of recorded music sales worldwide (Holland 1989). Ignoring this agreement, 22 states were still proposing legislation to label albums at the beginning of 1990. These bills were offered in spite of the RIAA\u0092s survey that showed only 22% of parents were in favor of labeling and 24% of parents opposed labeling(Marsh 1990). F. Joseph Loeper, Pennsylvania\u0092s senate majority leader, says his mail tallied 4-1 against his state\u0092s labeling bill (Marsh 1991). After persistent lobbying failed to head off legislation, the RIAA agreed to adopt a standard label for use by all member companies and to apply them more consistently than in the past. This action caused 13 states to drop their proposals and quelled the PMRC, who had complained that some albums were slipping through the system. Whether it was the PMRC\u0092s intention or not, warning labels have become a tool for censorship. Labels Failure to Avoid Censorship - Retailers In April of 1990 a large retail music chain, WaxWorks, announced it would no longer stock albums bearing warning stickers (Verna 1990). Other retail stores and some music distributors have adopted the same policy. WaxWorks operates approximately 110 Disc Jockey stores in 37 states and 25 Music Express departments in Montgomery Ward stores. Their action effectively limited access to materials because of the warning sticker, which was designed to resolve objections to explicit language without censorship. In the Midwest, where WaxWorks and Wal-Mart, another company with a similar policy, are the only major music retailers, access to some albums was essentially cut. Later in 1990, WaxWorks repealed its policy prohibiting stickered product with the exception of 2 Live Crew\u0092s As Nasty As They Wanna Be album, which was only carried in its clean version - one with explicit language removed. Instead, WaxWorks has instituted a new policy of examining the content themselves and making a decision whether or not to stock an album, although warning stickers, by informing without censoring, should have made such policies unnecessary. An instance of censorship is clearly present here in light of the fact that over 1000 stores, including WaxWorks, already restrict certain albums to an 18-to-buy section (Goldberg 1990). The refusal to stock other albums restricts access by all music buyers, regardless of age. The adults-only policy is not prompted by law but only by the retailer\u0092s sense of morality, which the consumer is forced to adopt. One example of a censored album is 100 Miles and Runnin\u0092 by N.W.A., a Rap group. WaxWorks has decided not to stock the album based on content. Other retailers have made this same decision because of the album\u0092s warning sticker. Not even the three music mail order houses - Columbia, BMG, and Bose - carry N.W.A. at all. These policies are not instituted for business reasons. An album released by a major record company that sells 200,000 units is considered firmly profitable for the record company and for the distributor. Sales figures for the 100 Miles and Runnin\u0092 album have gone over 600,000 units where it is available (Verna 1990). Richard Griffin\u0092s album has been pulled from Record World, a chain of 80 stores. Record Bar, a chain of 170 stores, does not stock any 2 Live Crew Albums. Griffin and 2 Live Crew are even more popular than N.W.A., and these three artists are among the most popular rap groups. Censorship of a very popular artist is obviously not done for business reasons; such recordings can be quite profitable. These actions can be abridged with the term market-censorship. The dissemination of ideas of the artist is restricted in the marketplace because some persons think these ideas may be harmful. Labels have failed in their goal of educating parents without censoring. The Tacitean Principle The Technical Report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography stated: ...efforts to restrict or censor have the psychological effect of increasing the desirability of the material. Increasing the difficulty of obtaining erotic materials, harassing and punishing pornographers and purveyors of pornography, setting minimum age limits for the purchase of these materials, and so on, may have the unwanted effect of increasing interest in the materials, rendering them more desirable, and producing a greater impact on the recipients, than if none of these measures were utilized (Broch 1971). When a piece of literature or art is censored, people have a natural curiosity in the offensive material. The relationship is of direct proportions, first recorded by the historian Tacitus under the rule of Emperor Nero: the popularity of books would invariable rise whenever they were censored; they would eventually fall into into oblivion when there was no difficulty in obtaining them (Jansen 1991). With the advent of the press, books were more easily distributed, and by then the authority of the censor changed hands from the Romans to the Roman Catholic Church, which published (and still does) a list of forbidden books. This list naturally encouraged the Tacitean Principle: ...[The list] provided Protestant firms with a list of profit making titles and free advertising while alerting potential Catholic purchasers to the existence of forbidden fruit (Eisenstein 1979). Today the censor is in the form of the PMRC and their warning stickers will obviously have the same effect. The President of Giant Records noted that one group, Too Much Joy, has given consent their album to be labeled for marketing reasons (Flanagan 1991). Although the RIAA disagrees with such usage, some artists have even used the label to their advantage. The comedian George Carlin peers over an oversized parental advisory logo on his album cover and uses the warning as a title. A rap compilation album issued by Priority Records uses a blown-up version of the label as cover art and replaces the word lyrics with rap (Rosen 1990). Representatives from the record companies readily admit the logo can be a useful marketing ploy. Another factor of the Tacitean Principle is the publicity often associated with controversial art. Reports in the media of explicit recordings have sent buyers to independent record stores, where sales of stickered product have increased compared to sales of non-stickered product. Sales have also increased faster than at chain stores where stickered product is not available (Haring 1990). Teenagers, who often display a tendency towards rebellion, are a perfect breading ground for the Tacitean Principle. Any substance or activity labeled as a characteristic of a cult or a subculture by disapproving parents is sure to attract attention from youth. Robert L. Gross pointed out how this phenomena relates to heavy metal: The resistance of organized groups and parents to the cult of heavy metal actually reinforces this belief [in the power of rebellion]. The lowly ignored teenager is amazed at how quickly adults' feathers can become ruffled.... The amount of negative attention focused on the heavy metal subculture has probably won more new converts to the cause than anything else! (Gross 1990). Warning labels have failed to produce a singular result of educating parents. Labels have also increased interest in explicit materials in the merely curious and therefore spread the influence of these materials. Record Companies The companies that release this music to the public are also involved in censorship. The precedent of modern corporations appeared in the 1850s when the libretto of Giuseppe's Verdi\u0092s opera La Traviata was altered by each regional opera company in Italy. The line He took the desired prize, in the arms of love was considered too suggestive and revised, not by Verdi, but by each opera company\u0092s director and without Verdi\u0092s consent (Volz 1991). Today the primary producers of popular music are record companies. Frank Zappa, who has been recording Rock n\u0092 Roll for 30 years, sees the arrangement between record company and musician as a rather dismal catch-22: Today rock n\u0092 roll is about getting a contract with a major company, and pretty much doing what the company tells you to do. ...they inflict their taste on the people who actually make the music. To be a big success, you need a really big company behind you because really big companies can make really big distribution deals (Zappa 1988). To spread your message to the masses, you need the help of a record company to record, manufacture, and distribute your work. Although it may appear that the record companies are in control, this is not always the case. Record companies face a conflict because of pressure from outside parties. Companies weigh the risk of controversy that may damage the image of the entire company against the potential profit of a few albums, and the albums have been losing. John Mitchell, attorney for the National Association of Record Manufacturers, points out: If you can be prosecuted and the whole corporation put at risk because of one extremist [censor] in one area, American consumers are going to find that suppliers are going to be very gunshy at providing that product anywhere in the country (Marsh 1991). Rock music critic Dave Marsh offers the corporate profit-principle view: Anybody who thinks that record companies are going to continue signing and recording bands whose music can\u0092t be sold in major record chains doesn\u0092t understand why record companies exist (Marsh 1990). What consumers buy is a piece of vinyl, tape, or aluminum, what they pay for is the sounds and ideas recorded therein. Record companies do not deal in goods or services, they essentially deal in ideas, musical and otherwise. By censoring the artist, they censor their own product, even though this censorship may subtract from the quality of the product. It has been shown above that this is not done for profit. Besides the submission to the PMRC in the labeling issue, Executive Vice President of RCA records Rick Dobbis has implied that his firm may have to go further to compromise with outside pressure to censor: We recognize that we have a responsibility, and if we don\u0092t put our own house in order, someone else will (Terry 1989). Dobbis\u0092 statement hints towards a fear of controversy that has seemingly become a company policy. RCA President Bob Buziak says he is ...not for censorship, but his actions prove otherwise: ...Buziak says he asked one of his new acts to remove the word mother*censored*er from an old blues song the band recorded for a debut album. The group ended up dropping the song entirely (Goldberg 1990). On contracting artists, Buziak says, ...we don\u0092t go out looking to sign N.W.A. or metal bands that advocate sodomy or bestiality (Goldberg 1990). Bob Krasnow, Chairman of Elektra records, says he will not contract groups like Guns n\u0092 Roses and Public Enemy because of their racist and anti-semitic comments and lyrics (Goldberg 1990). A committee has been established at MCA Records to review music for potentially objectionable lyrics. Other companies, Arista, Atlantic, Columbia, Elektra, Epic, EMI, and RCA, will explain to the artist the possible consequences of their material (Marsh 1990). Power-Knowledge This pressure to present widely acceptable ideas of expression comes from special-interest groups who aim to protect their own point of view, even if it means suppressing other\u0092s ideas. Throughout history, events such as the Inquisition and the Star Chamber were essentially censorships whose purpose was to eliminate dissenting opinions by establishing and enforcing one correct opinion. Some special-interest groups consist of the extremists within a majority, and of themselves, more often than not, constitute a minority. This minority may not accurately represent the views of the majority. Today, special-interest groups, by lobbying lawmakers and by picketing, have made record companies uncomfortable about their products. Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center referred to Ice Cubes new album as a cultural Molotov cocktail (Cole 1991). The Center is trying to bar the album from being sold because they feel it expresses ideas contrary to their cause. Ice Cube raps that his former manager, a white Jew, should be shot. In general, his may not be a socially desirable opinion, but believing and expressing such an opinion is a legal and allowable act. Similarly, Cardinal O\u0092Connor, head of the New York City Catholic Diocese, blames Heavy Metal for the rise of Satanism in that city (Marsh 1990). Again, the majority of people may think Satanism is a harmful practice, but Satanists are simply enjoying the same First Amendment right to freedom of religion that Catholics enjoy. In fact, Justice William O. Douglas wrote a decision which stated, ...literature should not be suppressed merely because it offends the moral code of the censor (Douglass 1957). One record company, Geffen Records, realizes the impact of this concept. President David Geffen states, ...I think if you\u0092re going to work in the arts, the question is, is this considered good work? It would be a terrible thing if we all conspired to keep them from being able to make a record because we disagreed with what they have to say. That would be terrible (Goldberg 1990). Special-interest groups advance their own cause by trampling other causes, without regard to Constitutionality. The hard boots of the courts will not fit their feet, rather, they ironically use language to stand on. When a person in a position of power, such as Cardinal O\u0092Connor, denounces Satanism, those people within his sphere of influence tend to accept his opinion as a fact to be acknowledged and possibly even acted upon. These people may not know anything of or have ever experienced Satanism, but because this person says it is something evil they take him on his word because it is his word. He can use his power to negatively redefine words. Author Sue Curry Jansen describes this as the phenomenon of power-knowledge and points out the importance of correct, consistent language: The powerful require knowledge to preserve, defend, and extend their advantage. For them, knowledge is power. The way the powerful say things are is the way they are, or the way they usually become because the powerful control the power to name. ...we know because we need to know. We have a vested interest in knowing. Knowledge may help us to rule or survive the rule of others (Jansen 1991). Jansen explains that without power, an individual has no means of gaining experience. One needs experience in order to become knowledgeable, and knowledge is vital to assuming even an introductory level of power. The censor halts this circular motion by limiting one's knowledge. Brian Turner, President of Priority Records, recognizes this power struggle and uses the Tacitean Principle in his defense: This [warning] sticker actually came about because of this music. ...because of rap music and how threatening it is to the white establishment. I couldn't imagine a more perfect way of marketing that type of music (Rosen 1990). If the unpowerful have an opinion that is important to them they must guard the definitions of their ideas which others may wish to suppress. Government In this light, branches of the government can be considered special interest-groups also. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1971 informed rock music radio stations that broadcast material \u0091promoting\u0092 or \u0091glorifying\u0092 the use of drugs could endanger station licenses (Volz 1991). This threat was made without the backing of law or precedent. Although the FCC is a federal power, it is not an elected body and is not answerable to Congress, so in theory the amount of power it exercises is indeterminate. Since 1971, the FCC has established restrictions on language that can be broadcast. The FCC defines indecency as ...language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs (Pareles 1989). In 1989, the FCC imposed a fine of $2,000 on WTZA radio in Miami for broadcasting indecent material. WTZA\u0092s penalty came as a result of playing Penis Envy, a song by the folk trio Uncle Bonsai. The offensive lyrics read: If I had a penis, I\u0092d still be a girl/ But I\u0092d make much more money and rule the world. The station\u0092s encroachment only borders on \u0091depicting sexual organs,\u0092 and is more political than sexual. Doctor Ruth\u0092s popular call-in sexual advice program of the mid-1980s may not be allowed on the air today, at least not before midnight. The problem is exasperated by the lack of specific guidelines; a program director will not know what his community\u0092s standards are until he has overstepped them and been fined. Further enforcement of this law will restrict the dissemination of ideas on any subject even remotely sexual for fear of being economically penalized. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) decided music was within its realm of concern in 1989 when it sent a letter on Department of Justice stationary to Brian Turner, president of Priority Records. Priority released a song by the rap group N.W.A. entitled ---- tha Police (the dashes are part of the title.) The letter, written by F.B.I. chief spokesman Milt Ahlerich, says the song encourages violence against and disrespect for the law enforcement officer. It continues, I wanted you to be aware of the F.B.I.\u0092s position relative to the song and it\u0092s message. I believe my views reflect the opinion of the entire law enforcement community (Pareles 1989). Although the letter contains no specific threat, one need only remember the F.B.I.\u0092s involvement in suppressing alternative newspapers in the 1960s and 70s to realize what kind of fear the F.B.I. is capable of inducing. As a result of Ahlerich\u0092s letter, local police departments have been reluctant to provide security officers for N.W.A. concerts, resulting in the cancellation of shows. The Bureau\u0092s action was its first pertaining to a work of art, but not its biggest. N.W.A. was treated lightly compared to actions taken against photographer Robert Mappelthorpe and the art gallery his works were displayed in. An analogous action in music would be the removal of an artist\u0092s records from stores and the confiscation of any works in progress. Political Philosophy Statements on free expression such as the F.B.I.\u0092s were rejected by the composers of our Constitution. They are reminiscent of Thomas Hobbes\u0092 political theory that expression must be controlled in order to keep the peace. Our government is instead founded on John Locke\u0092s theory which says rulers may be every bit as corrupt as the citizens, and checks must be placed on the government. This is an important concept when dealing with the press because the press not only acts as a medium of expression, it may also act as the check on government. By criticizing the ruling party, the press (in our case, music recordings) can inspire change and improvement. By censoring the press, the government (the FCC and the F.B.I., for instance) preserves their own ideas; ensuring power-knowledge. Eli M. Oboler extends this application from the way the government rules to the way the people rule: The democratic philosophy is based on man's presumed ability to reason, to decide for himself in his own best interest. It relies on man's educability and his free exercise of conscience in moral issues. Censorship represents the complete denial of all of these, and is, therefore, both anti-democratic and pro-totalitarian (Oboler 1974). Conclusion Throughout this essay are reasons against the effectiveness of censorship and reasons why censorship should not be tolerated. They are condensed below. Art is important to us. Art lets us see the world in new ways, and gives us pleasure. It is a unique language in which we can say things that cannot be said otherwise, regardless of quality. Music lyrics are of value because they are an artform and because they comment on reality. The specific issues that popular music comments on are of particular value to youth, the age group whose access is most restricted. For an artist, the sharing of artwork is a matter of pride and self-worth; it is an individual's contribution to civilization. It is also one's profession, a vital mean of self-support. The labeling of music albums has had undesirable effects. In some cases it has limited access to materials not only to minors, but also to adults. Contrary to the censor's wishes, labels have served to increase interest in controversial ideas. Record companies, whose assistance is vital to a writer of popular music, enforce artistic and market-censorship out of fear for their economic welfare. Special-interest groups generate this fear through intimidation. The definition of what is obscene or profane is determined by the majority and is used to suppress the views of the minority. The watchdogs from the majority are often extremists, themselves a minority that may not accurately express the views of the majority. This minority consists of special-interest groups that assert their own notions of morality to confine other's right to freedom of expression. By limiting an individual's expression, the knowledge which is necessary to overcome such oppression is not disseminated. These groups use this method to guard their own power and to paralyze the power of others. The actions which these suppressed ideas denote may be the censor's actual target. Censorship is contrary to the political philosophy on which the United States was founded. The Bill of Rights ensures an individual's right to free expression. The use of this freedom to criticize the ruling party agrees with the Constitutional conviction that there must be checks on government. A democracy assigns the individual the task of choosing the most appropriate manner of life. Censorship restricts these choices, and is therefore in conflict with democracy. A Solution It is now clear that censorship is unacceptable to American individuals and to America as a nation. What should also be made clear is that censorship doesn't work, even if the intentions are noble and accepted. The censor's effort is ultimately futile, defeated by three factors: the desire for freedom of expression, time, and the Tacitean Principle. History has shown that the desire for freedom has won, and is winning, many battles against oppressors. Religion and government have been severely weakened in their power to censor. Even in the past when these forces were powerful they did not completely crush ideas, they just delayed their flowering. The words of Jesus, Galileo, and Darwin have escaped initial condemnation, and there is no reason why contemporary words will not do likewise, given time. The desire to hear and express these words has led to modern liberal nations such as the United States. It is presently weakening Apartheid in South Africa, dismantling the Soviet Union, and reunifying Germany as well. The desire to express oneself is a deeply rooted characteristic of the human persona. The example cited from Verdi's La Traviata demonstrates that morality is not what it used to be. Time serves to erode moral standards regardless of the censor's efforts. There have been censors since Aristotle with the power to torture and to kill, but controversial ideas have emerged anyway, along with their respective influence on our lives. The Tacitean Principle ultimately overcomes the censor because the censor unknowingly encourages it. The harder the censor works the brighter the Principle will shine, illuminating the offensive material for all to see. A more acute censor would quietly suppress a work, but fortunately in our society it is rarely possible to quietly overcome legal constraints and artistic spirit. Allowing an artwork to fall into obscurity by itself would be more effective censorship than drawing attention to it through controversy. Independently of the censor, we must decide for ourselves whether or not music lyrics are beneficial to us. There is no proof that they are harmful, so it would be wrong to censor them. Then again, they may be harmful and we are simply ignorant to this fact. In this case, as is shown above, censorship would not be the solution. History has shown that censors do not change the course of music, music itself does. Great artists and their ideas influence other artists. Bob Dylan pioneered the protest song. Miles Davis, Led Zeppelin, and Run D.M.C. did the same for bebop, heavy metal, and rap, respectively. These forms of music were successful because they prevailed upon other artists and because consumers found them interesting. Within our culture are people who want to provide for a safe, rational, and happy society and who see some music as a threat to this goal. Changing the course of music through censorship is not a viable solution. So if these people wish to reach their goal, they must find another way to influence artists as well as the buying public. The way to do this is to become artists themselves; to enter their own music and ideas into the pool of the marketplace. If their product is good (interesting, truthful, popular, influential), then other artists and consumers will absorb it, enjoy it, buy it, and/or let it influence them. If their product is not good, then, just like other artists throughout history whose work was not good, it will not be an influential force. This would be a more probable and historically-precedented way of protecting society. This solution relies on the humanistic idea that people know what is best for them. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote in a famous 1919 decision that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market (Steinbauer 1991). This concept is the cornerstone of the whole democratic system. Paramount to this system is access to a wide variety of choices. Market-censorship should be confined as much as possible to allow many different ideas into the market. Consumers can then decide for themselves what they will absorb and what they will reject. If we cannot avoid all market censorship, or if we choose to accept it as an unfortunate by-product of an otherwise good capitalist system, then we should at least let the consumers decide from what has reached the market and refrain from the censorship of influential minorities.

It's two o'clock in the morning, and Pavlov is emerging from the \"Master\" disco, where his rap group has just performed. The rest of the group has beaten him to the street, where they are anxiously trying to flag down taxis to take them home out of the swirling snow.\nPavlov pauses theatrically on the steps outside the disco. \"Where are my people?\" he thunders in his bizarre blend of Russian-accented, street-hip homeboy English. He grins at the ensuing silence, cocks his head to one side, and demands again, \"Hey! Where are my people?!\"\nGood question. Or better yet: Who are Alexei Pavlov's people? Russian, rapper, Hare Krishna devotee, rock/jazz drummer, vegetarian: Alexei -- aka \"MD&C Pavlov\" (formerly MC Pavlov) -- is an exotic and unprecedented blend, one of the colorful and very un-Russian characters that have sprouted in the artistic hothouse that is modern Moscow.\nWhich is not to say that Pavlov is simply riding the wave of eclecticism sweeping Russia's capital. He is a true original, having found his love for rap, R&B, soul and funk music in the pre-perestroika days, before the surge of hipness that freedom, money, and MTV brought to Moscow. He is the \"godfather of Russian rap,\" a man far ahead of the musical curve in a country where, he says, \"People don't understand rhythm; they only know how to clap on the first and third beat.\n\"But they will learn,\" he says with a knowing grin. \"There's a huge musical void in Russia right now, but we're gonna fill it.

Bliss n Eso is actually a trio of musicians. MC Bliss, also known as Jonathan Notley, is an American. MC Eso, an Australian, is also known as Max MacKinnon, and DJ Izm, a Moroccan, known as Tarik Ejjamai, rounds out the group.\nTrio Takes To North America\nThe group met in high school and has performed together since that time. They occupy Australia\u2019s top spot in terms of hip-hop artists, in a field that\u2019s becoming more crowded every day. The group focuses on its lyrics and beats but has tried to avoid developing a predictable style.\nThey regularly perform live and still include traditional rap techniques like scratching and beatboxing to achieve their unique sound. While they\u2019ve moved around from label to label, the group has also opened for some of rap\u2019s most recognizable acts, including 50 Cent, G-Unit, and Lil Jon. Bliss and Eso have been nominated for ARIA awards, Australia\u2019s version of the Grammys.\nBliss n Eso aren\u2019t your typical hip-hop musical act, and have been very active in a number of charitable causes. The group\u2019s work has helped fund relief work in South Africa as well as in Victoria, Australia. They\u2019ve toured the US several times and have released four albums, one of which was certified gold and the group\u2019s most recent release, Running on Air, was certified platinum.\nIf any of this surprises you, it shouldn\u2019t. Hip-hop, as a musical artform, has demonstrated itself to be among the most culturally flexible, and has inspired musicians and artists from all over the world. New musicians find the genre to be welcoming, and relatively easy to break into, compared to other musical genres like rock.\nHip-hop, when combined with the ability to self-produce, self-publicize and self-distribute music, turns out to be highly appealing to listeners all over the world. There\u2019s no easier way to start in the music business today than by producing your own hip-hop and rap beats.\nUnlike other genres, it\u2019s both acceptable and expected that artists who are just trying to break into the music scene will create and distribute free mixtapes of their music.

The one that you like the best.\nLook at my poetry example and study it:\nWalking down the street checkin\u0092 the scene\nIntimidating the opposition with eyes looking\u0092 so mean\nWith the coke in my hand looking\u0092 around\nI need a place to relax, so I\u0092ll go to a lounge\nWaking up in the morning I see the sun\nFully rested I feel like one of the young\nSummer has come now that school is out\nI cannot enjoy the day because of the rain clouds\nHere are more examples of hooks in which I would encourage you to listen on a recording which you can easily find on youtube:\nA.

Kanye West, Robocop:\nCause I don\u0092t want no Robocop\nYou moving like a Robocop\nWhen did you become a Robocop\nSomebody please make her stop\n*Notice how the first three lines end with Robocop. You can use imitation in your choruses. Ad libs are also tools that you can use to spice up your rap songs when it comes to hooks and verses. You basically insert ad libs into the gaps of your lyrics or have them overlap your lines, you will hear them when you listen to hip hop songs.\n*Check out the outro in Robocop. An outro is the conclusion to a song,unlike an intro. An outro is optional and you do not always need to put one in.\nD.

Running the Potato Empire and writing gobs of production music has left little time to proselytize. I apologize.\nWriting: I think there are two things that make for a sassy script: Great writing and getting the voice talent(s) to interpret your words the way you hear them in your head. Let\u2019s start with the second part of the writing conundrum first. As I wrote in \"Writing For Your Station Voice\" (Radio And Production, March 1995), use markings in your scripts! We get TONS of scripts every month for our various voice talents, and nearly everyone is typed in CAPS with no other markings other than periods and commas. Just goes to show you how effective the article was, huh?\nInterview: Dave Lee, WAMZ-FM, Louisville, Kentucky\nBy Jerry Vigil\nIf you\u2019ve been in production for at least a decade, you remember the rapid spread of CHR-type production into other formats. In Country radio, this style of imaging first made a big noise at WAMZ in Louisville, Kentucky. The noise-maker was Dave Lee, who arrived at WAMZ over eleven years ago with a rock and roll resume in one hand and a Brown Bag library in the other. With the legendary Coyote Calhoun in the PD\u2019s chair, Hot Country was born. Dave was and is relentless in his pursuit of perfection, and WAMZ faithfully remains Louisville\u2019s hottest radio station.\nTest Drive: Voxbox From Manley Laboratories\nBy Steve Cunningham\nVoice processors that combine a mic preamp, a compressor, some EQ, and a limiter have become quite popular. They give you all the tools you need to produce great voice tracks in one box, without all the connection hassles of using a mixer and outboard processing. In addition, the quality of the individual sections in a vocal processor is usually better than what you\u2019ll find in a typical mixer and outboard gear combo, and the whole business is much easier and more convenient to use.\nHaving said that, describing the Manley Voxbox as just a vocal processor is a bit like saying the Porsche Boxster is a good transportation car. The all-tube Voxbox is not just good, it\u2019s astonishingly good. In fact, every audio block in this product is astonishingly good.\nQ It Up: The RAP Network Speaks - The Home Studio Part 2\nBy Jerry Vigil\nThe Home Studio, once a dream for most, now a reality at incredibly affordable prices.

Not sur-prisingly, the way government works, we are still there, waiting. Some inter-company planning had begun however. CHEZ-FM and sister station CFMO-FM have switched consultants to the ones used by Rogers Broadcasting stations. General Accounting was being handled with the assistance of the Rogers head office in Toronto. Also, the Engineering staffs of both stations are looking at (among other things) expanding the Production area at CHEZ-FM as part of a complete renovation and expansion of the current building (which was just renovated and moved into 2 years ago).\nRadio HED: Brainstorming\nBy Jeffrey Hedquist\nHaving trouble breaking writers\u2019 block?

Suffice to say,\u00a0this commute that I started in 2001 has\u00a0always tempted me to write to Top Gear and suggest they do a feature on the most dangerous\u00a0drive to work (I don\u2019t think I\u2019d win because\u00a0I\u2019m sure they\u2019d find some\u00a0poor chap who has to drive to work through Gaza in a Lancia) but this road would give the Stig a good run for his money.\nThe point being, I learned long ago that certain music\u00a0encouraged me to drive with my heel embedded in the mat beneath the acceleratrix and this has led to the loss of 4 perfectly good tyres and three wheel rims (a pricey business in these recession fuelled days). So, to reduce costs,\u00a0I have built up a \u201cbanned from the commute\u201d batch of CDs. These represent the most aggressive music \u2013 not the loudest necessarily \u2013 but there\u2019s something about these particular CDs that gets the blood running if you ask me, and therefore, they must remain under lock and key in the CD vault.\nThe first of these are some crazy Space Rockers called Monster Magnet:\nNow I don\u2019t remember how these guys entered my life, but enter they did (perhaps through my nightmares like Pinhead in Hellraiser) and they\u2019re still going. They\u2019re heavy but not metal and they have some genuinely great songs ( Spacelord being a perfect example of what they do). But when I put on these guys they just pump me up, it\u2019s the lyrics by Dave Wyndorf I think \u2013 they\u2019re just, well,\u00a0nasty, and he sings along with\u00a0his guitar riffs which drives the songs\u00a0relentlessly forward. \u201c Heads Explode \u201d and \u201cBummer\u201d on their Greatest Hits just kill me \u2013 but doing 100km/h on the Newport Road will kill you for sure so Monster Magnet must stay under the bed. Highly recommend them though if you\u2019re not driving or had a day where you just don\u2019t care.\nNow the next banned\u00a0(sic) really just need a pic to highlight the problem\u00a0- so here it is:\nI regret to say that I think I hit (and most likely killed) a cat on my commute several years ago whilst listening to \u201c Killing in the Name of \u201d from this album by Rage Against the Machine. Tom Morello\u2019s\u00a0guitar work on this album is stunning \u2013 equally as stunning as Zack de la Rocha\u2019s ranting vocals. This is where Rap met Metal and it never, ever, ever got any better (and don\u2019t let that Rap/Metal tag\u00a0put you off -\u00a0if you\u2019ve never tried it, you\u2019ll like it in a dirty, dirty way). For pure aggression\u00a0that will make you jump around (yes, even whilst driving and yes, even whilst being much too old for it) there can be nothing better than \u201cBombtrack\u201d or \u201cKnow Your Enemy\u201d from this,\u00a0one of the greatest debut albums of all time. If you have frustrations in life (if???) then you need this tonic, trust me. But it will dull your ability to respond quickly to something jumping out in front of your car\u00a0(which I think was de la Rocha\u2019s point all along\u2026)\nFinally for now (and yes I know this blog is too long). May I submit to you The Workhorse Movement . Now I don\u2019t know how Monster Magnet entered my life but I do know that the Workhorse Movement snuck in with them around the same time. They had one album and one song especially (the brilliant \u201c Keep the Sabbath Dream Alive \u201d in honour of Black Sabbath \u2013 we\u2019ll come to them another day) and I totalled my car last February on some black ice near Clonmel to the strains of that very song. Oh well, this earned them a ban even though I wasn\u2019t going very fast (officer) and it probably wasn\u2019t their fault that the temperature dropped, but they were close to taking Rage Against the Machine\u2019s mantel in the Rap/Metal arena for a while \u2013 great one-off album if you fancy something a bit more \u201cstreet-cred\u201d. That one song is a cast iron Avensis killer though\u2026\n"}, {"score": 876.3709, "uuid": "a2a60d9d-e93b-5bcd-8679-6b0a69e3c550", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-01-11674", "target_hostname": "manuelmarino.com", "target_uri": "http://manuelmarino.com/rap-a-lot-greatest-hits/", "page_rank": 1.1909977e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Rap</em>-a-Lot Greatest Hits", "snippet": "Since then, it has maintained its success and focus on gangsta and southern <em>rap</em>.

Yet the notion can't be too shocking. After all, Reynols' 1995 debut, Gordura Vegetal Hidrogenada, was a \"dematerialized CD\": an empty jewel box (having never seen a copy, it would good to know if the case still featured artwork, tracks listings, liner notes, acknowledgments [shout-outs]... you know, all the necessary appendages of contemporary record releases). Their reasoning: \"That CD is everything, everywhere... You see, everybody has that record, even people who haven't been born yet. Napoleon has that record, Plato has the record, Jim Morrison has the record.\" [ Interview with Dan Warburton / March, 2003 ].\nReynols has played street guerilla gigs with their guitars plugged not into amps but (non-smashing) pumpkins and given performances for an \"audience\" consisting of (presumably sublimating) dry ice. Their drummer and \"spiritual leader\" is Miguel Tomasin, a differently abled individual (Down's Syndrome) who is also a former pupil of Reynols founders / special educators Alan Courtis and Roberto Conlazo. They've collaborated with Pauline Oliveros as well as the residents of a pollo ranch. They've \"written\" a piece for \"baritone, tenor, contralto and soprano whistling kettles\" that does in fact have some relationship to String Quartet literature. They've made field recordings of places imaginary -- a M\u00e1rquez-esque outpost in Tomasin's imagination over which the banner of \"Minecxio\" flies (shades of Christian Vander's prog-sludge Magma...) -- microcosmic -- the forces of attraction binding magnetized particles to spooled strips of plastic polymers (Blank Tapes on Trente Oiseaux) -- and vastly banal -- the installation of a hole in a street in Buenos Aires (Rampotanza Ronil Rempelente).\nMore than anything, though, artists like Reynols cause me to sort out a nice long list of questions related both to conceptualism in music and pranksterism in art. Can one appreciate the intentions behind some of these Reynolian endeavors while, at the same time, being of the opinion that the instantiation of said notions is only utterly unlistenable racket? Talk about your cognitive dissonance -- or maybe even divided loyalties. Try to close the distance between what Reynols describes when they talk about their music and the actual sounds that they produce. What is really being represented when Reynols \"records\" NASA -- not at NASA, mind you, but the essence of actual agency itself? Is all the teleological talk generated by Reynols more in the vein of P.T. Barnum than Marcel Duchamp?\nWe can talk about art as a kind of container for ideas, but, to me, that leaves the relationship between form and content too ambiguous and too enervated. Isn't it fair to cry \"bullshit\" when you perceive that the ostensible significance of a given piece of music is not bound within the work itself, but tacked on outside. Like some lame excuse, a, \"What I MEANT to say was...\" Then again, where does the experience of art begin, and where does it end? Demarcations are permanently established neither by the will of the artist nor by decisions made by the auditor / reader / viewer, etc. So-called environmental art from Walter De Maria's \"Lightning Field\" to a piece of music such as Weather Sky requires a certain revision of how we understand the interface of natural materials, fundamental principles and human intent in aesthetic experience. But I would also say that when we talk about some works of art as being \"haunting\", we are still making reference to this issue.\nMeanwhile, cultural pranks -- examples of Zizek-ian kynicism -- usually have a leveling effect, and effects perhaps more powerful and lasting than anything the old-fashioned avant-garde has ever produced. It was not long before the Impressionists were running the Academy. Of course, the belief that jokes, as well as the various butts of those jokes, can be considered works of art may be avant-garde in and of itself. Ponder this too (or not): the members of Reynols inhabit an environment shaped by the forces of globalization: rapid exchange of commodities, permeable borders, information overload. Psychedelic rock bands that have turned nearly 40 years of jamming into lofty profit margins made a sham of shamanism long before these Argentines did. Stunts, put-ons, antics, leg-pullings, raspberries: these are acts of inclusion and exclusion. What if everyone is in on the joke? The only music, maybe, is to be heard in massed laughter.\nPosted by joe on February 2, 2004 7:25 AM\n"}, {"score": 865.25104, "uuid": "005c3cbf-c2e0-569b-a425-6c247c1e66fc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-28-20709", "target_hostname": "holyculture.net", "target_uri": "http://holyculture.net/?p=http://holyculture.net/?p=49159", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": ", <em>Rap</em> Reviews, Hip", "snippet": "Lifetime: The <em>Rock</em> vs John Cena.", "explanation": null, "document": "Featured Articles\nReach Records Introduces \u201cThe Robot Factory\u201d Video Game\nContinue to fight against the status quo with Trip and stand for all former robots in \u2014The Robot Factory: the video game.

Granted, I got no love for these studio 'gangsta' rappers being pushed so hard by the music industry, but even if I did this album would be extremely bad! In fact this album is so weak I have to tackle its' shortcomings in sections. (A) Content: I won't bother going into detail about the subject matter which consist of fantasies about selling incredible amounts of drugs, getting brains in one of his 10 million European luxury cars, and shooting people with pistols that don't even exist. I will simply direct you to the 2nd track on the album, \"Show Discipline\", which features a hook (recited by NAS-shame on him) that goes as follows: \"Now gangstas live, gangstas die/Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!) /Kill ya moms, Kill ya pops, Kill ya seed/Kill ya girl (Its principle nigga!)/ Sell ya crack, Sell ya coke,Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustlin nigga!)/ Grab ya nine, Grab ya pound/Grab ya tec, Grab ya pump (you bustin at niggaz!, wha)\". I guess Jadakiss is just 'keepin' it real', but if that's the case then I will continue to be fake. (B) Production: Kiss the Game Goodbye names a bunch of big name producers as having worked on the album, such as DJ Premier, Timbaland, The Neptunes , but a closer look reveals that each of them only produced one song (and those were suspect too). I can't help but wonder who was in the studio nodding their head to this shit when they were recording it. Kiss the Game Goodbye is filled with ill-conceived samples and song ideas like \"Kiss is Spittin\"(same as Warren G - \"Regulators\") and \"Jada's Got a Gun\" (Aerosmith - \"Janie's Got a Gun\") as well as corny, poorly SUNG hooks like on \"I'm a Gangsta\" and \"Nasty Girl\". You could remove just about any song, skit, etc from this album except \"We Gone Make It\" (same music Ras Kass used for \"Home Sweet Home\"), \"Put Your Hands Up\", and the \"Jay Jerkin\" skit, and you would not even notice. (C) Repetitious: I have also come to the conclusion that Jadakiss is extremely overrated lyrically. He says the same thing on every song regardless of what the song is supposed to be about; his storytelling ability is lacking; he has 1 style (rhymes the same way all the time), and after listening to him solo for 70+ minutes I was ready to slit my wrist. (D) Hypocrisy: After all the bitchin', whinin', and moaning that Jadakiss did about Puff Daddy, commercialism and getting off of Bad Boy Records I see no difference in the pre and post-Bad Boy Jadakiss except possibly that his lyrics have become slightly more ignorant. There is definitely no shortage of weak commercial crossover attempts on this LP. Maybe 'Kiss' should have spent more time working on his album instead of trying to dis' Puffy, Jay-Z, and Beanie Sigel on mix tapes, but if he took this long and this was all he could come up with I doubt another 10 years would have made a difference.\nOverall: F :Review by Eyecalone\nJa Rule - Pain is Love\nLyrics: B-\n"}, {"score": 860.0187, "uuid": "7ada2271-f8ca-585a-bd67-5b2a839a379a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0207wb-15-01990", "target_hostname": "www.pauseandplay.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pauseandplay.com/kidrock.htm", "page_rank": 1.1769912e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Kid <em>Rock</em>", "snippet": "This <em>is</em> the best record I&#x27;ve made, even though there&#x27;s going to be even <em>better</em> ones to come.

I love the Wallflowers, but I don't see them as rock 'n' roll. Matchbox 20 isn't rock 'n' roll. I see Tupac as rock 'n' roll, I see Monster Magnet as rock 'n' roll. It's the attitude.\"\nKid Rock, born Bob Ritchie in the mostly white Detroit suburb of Romeo, Mich., has had plenty of attitude since the mid-1980s when he had a revelation at his first Beastie Boys concert.\n\"I used to be the one of the only white kids at all these rap shows,\" he said, \"and I remember walking into Cobo Hall and seeing these three white kids onstage and my heart stopped. It's like, 'Oh, my god, somebody beat me to it.' I knew I had to do what they did but with my own touch.\"\nHe had a conspicuous start in 1990 when \"Yodeling in the Valley,\" a track off his Jive Records debut album \"Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast,\" made national headlines. The Federal Communications Commission handed out the largest fine ever for a college radio station, $23,750, against WSUC-FM at the State University of New York at Cortland for airing the \"obscene\" song about oral sex.\n2 Live Crew made a career out of that sort of notoriety, but the Cortland case - which eventually was thrown out - neither hurt nor helped Kid Rock's career.\n\"It just gave everybody something to write about for a while,\" Kid Rock said. \"My feeling was, 'If you don't wanna hear that kind of song, turn the dial.' I thought at the time, 'This is sweet, I'm gonna sell some records.' It didn't.\"\nHe didn't give up. Kid Rock toured with such rap giants as Ice Cube and Too $hort and released two more albums and an EP through his Top Dog indie label before signing last year with Lava/ Atlantic . His label debut, \"Devil Without a Cause\" (released Aug. 18), isn't going to threaten the Beasties' supremacy, but it does have its share of fist-pumpin' anthems and rapid-fire rhymes, particularly the revved-up leadoff track \"Bawitdaba.\" Backed by his Twisted Brown Trucker band, he marches a hip-hop beat through rock-oriented twists and turns.\n\"I'm all over the place ... country, rock, metal, rap, hip-hop,\" Kid Rock said. \"I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd, Hank Williams, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, all the outlaws. I also love Run-D.M.C. and Whodini, but I don't go out of my way to be influenced by anything. Anything that hits me, I go for it, whether it's country rock or hip-hop. I didn't go out one day and say, 'I want to listen to country music.' It was just something came through in the course of my life and hit me. I listened to country music back then as much I did rap.\"\nKid Rock had the time of his life during the recording sessions, which included a guest appearance by Detroit bluesman Robert Bradley (on \"I Got One For Ya' \"), but when push came to shove, he took matters into his own hands.\n\"I basically finished the record in seven days,\" he said. \"I kicked everybody out of the studio, sent the producer home, locked myself in the room and did it all myself, after everybody had helped a whole lot, don't get me wrong.\n\"I think I've gotten everything right finally. This is the best record I've made, even though there's going to be even better ones to come. The timing's right, with 311, Rage (Against the Machine) and the Beasties out there.\"\n"}], [{"score": 858.4023, "uuid": "ca4446b5-c5b8-5a01-a41f-86bb5d825e9c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-38-06506", "target_hostname": "holyculture.net", "target_uri": "http://holyculture.net/?p=http://holyculture.net/?p=49338", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": ", <em>Rap</em> Reviews, Hip", "snippet": "KJ-52\u2032s New Album &quot;Dangerous&quot; <em>Is</em> Out Now!

Henderson\nTo take part in the African revolution it is not to write a revolutionary song; you must fashion the revolution with the people. And if you fashion it with the people, the songs will come by themselves, and of themselves. ... In order to achieve real action, you must yourself be a living part of Africa and of her thought; you must be an element of that popular energy which is entirely called for the freeing, the progress, and the happiness of Africa. There is no place outside that fight for the artist or for the intellectual who is not himself concerned with and completely at one with the people in the great battle of Africa and of all suffering humanity.\nSekou Tour\u00e9 1\nIn this paper, I examine some major nationalist trends in rap music (or hip-hop), its development and the implications of its future growth. I argue that rappers should return to the nationalistic focus of hip-hop if the industry is to become a base for African centered politico-economic and cultural development. This Afrocentric rendering could help promote a national culture to replace the popular (faddish) culture of violence and sexism, and both wed African Americans to the best in their culture and allow them to more directly profit from their cultural product.\nAdditionally the promotion of Afrocentric national culture may help to create a standard of behavior and a new rites of passage away from guns, dope, sexism, and violence, and toward more African-centered definitions of manhood and womanhood rooted in righteous behavior, support for liberation struggles and political prisoners, Afrocentric community building, and good entertainment. Asante (1993, p. 124) maintains that \"it is only a centeredness born of knowledge of our history and consciousness of our predicament that will lead us out of the abyss of violence.\"\nFurther, rap must be insulated from White supremacist criticism from outside the community. Euro-Americans cannot stand as the moral authority in this country\u0097their hands are too bloody. The moral vanguard of this country has always been the Black, Brown, and Red communities. However, too many in the Black community, their White supremacy intact, simply parrot the Euro-American condemnation of hip-hop. This is baseless, and is reminiscent of the facile criticism of be-bop. This group of White supremacists in Black face simply wait for White sanction of culture before giving their seal of approval. They admonish, inter alia, that rap music causes violence. That makes about as much sense as arguing that \"Love Child\" by the Supremes caused teen pregnancy. These senseless assertions are not pursued in this article.\nThe larger point is that the reality of the baselessness of these condemnations does not absolve African Americans, especially Black nationalists from criticizing hip-hop. Karenga (1993) reminds us that rap music does not have a martyrs immunity against criticism. However, we do not condemn hip-hop, but we challenge it to rise to the level of the best of its potential. I argue that its nationalistic focus points the direction toward, and encompasses, the best of this potential, which is the fusion of Black popular and national culture.\nThe Origins of Hip-hop\nRap music has had a profound impact on the African American community in the United States. Its greatest significance, to my mind, derives from the fact that it has fostered a profound nationalism in the youth of Black America. Arguably, hip-hop has become a conduit for African American culture to a greater extent than even jazz. Where the latter could, though its polyrhythmic syncopations, embrace both the nuances and jagged edges of the collective Black experience, it could not self-consciously energize the nationalist ethos in quite the way the more lyrically focused hip-hop does. To present these jagged edges, jazz, or be-hop, needed the uncompromising lyric of the poet. Also, poets, with their jagged edges intact, still required the talking drum of instrumentation to fully capture the Black ethos of struggle, resistance, righteousness, exploitation, and creativity in Black America. Hip-hop fused the two\u0097poetry and jazz\u0097in such a way as to render itself the most conductive source of the current of African American culture.\nHip-hop, or rap music, began in the early 1970's. The first synthesis of self-conscious poetry and music can be traced, most directly, to the Black nationalist Last Poets. Their albums The Last Poets, Chastisements, This is Madness, and others have become classics in the African American community. When one member who separated from the group, with the stage name \"Lightning Rod,\" used a musical score provided by Kool & The Gang as a backdrop to his lyrical narrative of a day in the life of two hustlers, he had no idea he was laying the basis for an entirely new musical genre. This album, Hustler's Convention, was a mainstay in the album collection of a South Bronx DJ named Kool Herc.\nHerc credited Lightning Rod and James Brown with providing the foundation for hip-hop, but it was Herc who gave it life. Herc was deft at the early art of mixing and fading one record into the next without missing a beat in the interchange. He did this mostly by ear. His vast repertoire of music, including some reggae beats that though loved in the streets were very hard to find, and his thundering speaker system known as \"The Herculords\" made his music highly danceable, rhythmical, and unavoidable. The thundering sounds of the Herculords remains legendary.\nMeanwhile, an electronic genius of a young man, J. Saddler, had developed a more accurate way of mixing music from two turntables. Grand Master Flash, as he became known, originated the \"clock method,\" whereby DJs used the face of the album as a sort of reckoning tool by which one could remember one's place on a record more exactly. This was necessary because Flash would not simply \"mix\" the records, but he would \"scratch\" them: Using the needle in the groove as an instrument to make the grating though rhythmical sound for which rap has become famous. Although a hip-hop prodigy, Grand Wizard Theodore, reportedly discovered this technique while under Flash's tutelage, it was Flash who perfected it. Flash is credited with giving hip-hop its face\u0097the deft, smooth and creative DJ. The battles between Flash and Herc became legendary. But even Herc would have to admit that none were faster than the original \"Grand Master.\"\nThe face of rap in its early days was definitely the DJ. The body of rap was the urban wasteland that was the South Bronx. Here gangs of New York youth were encased in what could only be described as a war zone. After the Black power movement, the Vietnam War, and the FBI COINTELPRO against positive Black community organizations, gangs were almost alone as the one institution in the Black community offering a cogent message to Black youth. That message was, \"join and survive.\" The largest of these New York Black gangs was the Black Spades, and its youthful leader would rise phoenix-like from the ashes of the South Bronx. He transformed the Black Spades into the Zulu Nation, and he transformed himself into a hip-hop legend. Afrika Bambataa. With the coming of Bambataa the mind of hip-hop was turned to Black nationalism, positive creativity, vision, and healing. Some of his messages would not take root until as late as 1981 when his early rival, Flash, convinced his MC Melle Mel to co-author \"The Message,\" the first nationally recognized \"progressive\" rap statement on the condition of Black America.\nHip-Hop As A Conduit For Political Culture\nHip-hop is much more than the names and faces of individual practitioners of the genre. Inter alia, it has the potential to fill a transitional void of cross-generational cultural transmission within Black culture by providing a new lyric to an old tune, in some cases literally. When Public Enemy dropped \"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos,\" they were not only providing an anthem for incarcerated Black youth, but they were doing so in the context of regurgitating \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedaelamistic,\" a 1970s Isaac Hays tune from the album Hot Buttered Soul. It is the sampling aspect of hip-hop that allows for creative synthesis in the context of cross-generational cultural transmission. Not only was this tying together of generations important in the aesthetic sense, but it was more significant because the nexus was established between a relatively apolitical generation of the 1970s and 1989s with the staunch Black nationalist African American subculture of the 1960s. Kool Herc made the most of this potential in hip-hop for cross-generational cultural transmission. In one sense, this was epitomized through his early use of James Brown (\"Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud\"), the Black nationalist Last Poets, and Rastafarian reggae. Reggae, especially in the hands of Bob Marley, picked up the nationalist torch laid down with the death of jazz great John Coltrane. Black nationalism was incubated in reggae before the coming of hip-hop, and to this day the best of reggae maintains its Garveyite elements.\nBecause the early era of hip-hop (1973\u00961979) was dominated by the DJ, the spun records had to speak for themselves. DJs like Herc and later Hollywood, just threw some catchy phrases over the mix; however, there wasn't much to the actual \"rap\" element of hip-hop. Melle Mel, Grandmaster Caz, The Treacherous Three, Lovebug Starski, and Hollywood were important progenitors of the era of MC dominance in hip-hop. MCs demonstrated their verbal acrobatics over \"def\" DJ mixes. This was epitomized in \"Rapper's Delight,\" the Sugarhill Gang's expropriation of some of Grandmaster Caz's old raps, which nonetheless made rap a national phenomenon. The phrasing was classic hip-hop, but simplistic. Within two years, Melle Mel let the world know that living could sometimes be \"like a jungle.\" This was \"The Message.\" Although it was different from the hip-hop then in vogue, it evoked the nationalist roots of rap better than anything before\u0097or since. It was cutting edge. It was in the best tradition of what KRS-ONE would later describe as \"edutainment,\" but it was not as pretentious as the latter. This brand of nationalism was rooted in the commonality of oppression, and \"The Message\" made it plain. Later rap artists like Public Enemy and X-Clan would attempt to provide a more explicitly political and cultural analysis of the black condition without compromising the basic hip-hop aspects of their raps.\nThe Foci of Nationalism\nKarenga (1980, p.15) defines Black nationalism as the political belief and practice of African Americans as a distinct people with a distinct historical personality who politically should develop structures to define, defend, and develop the interests of Blacks as a people. This entails a redefinition of reality in Black images and interests, providing a social corrective by building institutional and organizational structures that house Black aspirations, and it provides a collective vocation of nation building among Black people as a political end. Beyond Karenga's definition lies the issue of the motivation, or justification, for the emergence of Black nationalism within the African American community. There appear to be three such justifications for the emergence of Black nationalism.\nFirst is that brand of nationalism that emerges from identification rooted in a perceived commonality of oppression. Another emerges from a recognition of a convergence of political purpose, objectives, and goals. Third is that brand of nationalism that rests on the justification of a commonality of culture. The first type, though superficially based, can be quite lasting. In the Black community it rests on the recognition of the common caste identity of Blacks in White supremacist America. In its vulgar, though popular, aspect, it promotes a form of skin color nationalism that disregards the diversity within the Black community especially around issues of class, gender, and cultural identification. In this sense, it is inherently reactive, rooted in the specious Eurocentric concept of race under which the very people who promote this brand of nationalism have been relegated.\nIn the second variant, nationalism emerges from a common agenda. This form is usually representative of a more sophisticated analysis beyond purely skin color considerations. However, what actually emerges is a collective agenda among those filtered into the process by skin color considerations. Here where Black skin is viewed as necessary, though not sufficient, a type of interest group focus or specialization occurs where the nationalist group orients itself around a particular ideology and political program and offers itself as an appropriate vehicle for the realization of Black aspirations. There is a wide continuum ranging from the Black nationalist conservatism of Washington through the bourgeois nationalism of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to the revolutionary Black nationalism of the Republic of New Afrika (RNA).\nIn the last case, where nationalism emerges from culture considerations, the reactive and purely skin color considerations are bypassed. Nationalism that emerges from a cultural perspective takes on self-defining aspects of the culture group itself and does not derive from reactive definitions. Because culture is an inclusive concept, it incorporates gender, class, and other diverse components of society within its construct. It does not rely on the Eurocentric concept of race, however, it realizes that people of a common African culture in this society are also primarily those we consider Black people. Also, this nationalism suggests that whereas African Americans constitute a distinguishable culture group\u0097a people\u0097then that people should have a common agenda because, historically people have developed as groups and, presently, African Americans have been subjugated as a group into a caste in the United States. Notice here that though a commonality of oppression is recognized in this approach, it is not the primary for this, an African-centered nationalism. Only this justification leads to the synthesis of nationalist thought and practice suggested by Karenga's (1993) definition of Black nationalism. Much of the early nationalism in hip-hop had as its justification a commonality of oppression. There later emerged a nationalism based in the second type; a commonality of interests and agenda. It was only later, especially with the rise of X-Clan that the third type began to develop.\nIt is clear that nationalism, whatever its justification, has, inter alia, political, cultural, psychic, and economic elements. Rappers began to articulate all these perspectives in their music. Entertainment was the raison d'\u00eatre, but entertainment could be couched in nationalism and could become Afrocentric and transformative. Asante (1987) asserted the connection between Black aesthetics, from orature to dance, and Afrocentrism. This Afrocentrism could then infuse the best image and interests of Black peoples into the popular culture and allow it to fuse into a liberating national culture . 2\nThis was the central focus of the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s . 3 The potential for the development of such a liberating process was all the more important because hip-hop up to the time of Run DMC's \"King of Rock\" was strictly playing to a Black audience. Of course all hip-hop was not nationalistic, or even political, for that matter. Many rap artists were as apolitical as their counterparts in mainstream music. I would argue, however, that from its inception the nationalist ethos has been present in hip-hop. In fact, this Black nationalism has structured hip-hop in the past and continues to do so. It is important that we understand how and why this has occurred.\nA Nationalist Conduit: The Zulu Nation\nNationalism in hip-hop does not emerge exclusively from the lyrics of early rap music. In the early days of hip-hop in the 1970s, this nationalism developed from the collective ethos of the Black community that spawned this new genre. In this respect, the very framework of the hip-hop community suggested, fostered, and allowed to flourish a collectivist nationalist praxis. This is because hip-hop was incubated in the Black community's house parties, public parks, housing projects, and local jams. These sites in the Black community were often under the immediate influence of the dominant territorial gangs in the areas. The gangs made security a chief concern for both would-be rappers and those coming to jams. For their own benefit, gangs could insure the safe conduct of a party, at some cost, functioning as traditional security. In this some gangs could find their own commercial success.\nThe presence of gangs also motivated performers to enlist their own crews for security, especially when they performed outside of their own home base, because much of the hip-hop scene was done through house parties . 4 One such famous crew provided security for Grand Master Flash. The Casanova Crew, as they were called, had a reputation; according to Grandmaster Caz: \"They were kicking nigger's asses .\" 5\nThe movement into different territories also facilitated the spread of hip-hop . 6 This process also moved gangs into more commercial and less territorial postures as the prospect for wealth beyond nickel and diming over turf presented itself in the form of commercial security enterprises. It also suggested the transformation of crews and gangs in a manner that would reflect the collective ethos that hip-hop, even with its famous \"battles,\" nonetheless promoted . 7 This suggested a linkage around commonality instead of differences. The most obvious commonality within the emergent hip-hop community was the fact that it was exclusively Black. Any commonality that emerged would have to emerge within that context. The result was a reaffirmation of the basic aspects of Black cultural nationalism framed in the context and aspirations of a young gifted and Black core of hip-hop talent. This was the Zulu nation.\nZulu is really a youthful expression of cultural unity. As such it does not go in and out of style. People may be down with particular crews or not, but the unity associated with the cultural aspects of hip-hop operate independently of folks going down with this crew or not. Caz captures this notion when he points out that \"it's [Zulu's] not a record, and it's not something that gets hot and not hot. You might be up on it now and not hear about it later, but to people that's down it's always there\" (Eure & Spady, 1991, p. xv). Zulu brought cultural focus to the hip-hop community because its chief leader was himself among the earliest sources of hip-hop: Afrika Bambataa. Although Bambataa had emerged from the Black Spades, one of the largest Black gangs in New York, the ethos that he brought forth was inclusive. In response to the question, \"Did Zulu play a part in bringing about the unity [in hip-hop]?\" Grandmaster Caz responded:\nDefinitely, because Bambataa ... everybody was down with Zulu, even if you down with the crew, even if you wasn't down with [Africa] Islam and the Funk Machine, and Bambataa and the Soulsonic Force, you was still down with Zulu. You was down with Bam, you know what I'm saying. So that came from everybody just being down with Bam. None of that shit was happening when Bam was around, it was a respect kind of thing. Like down at the Roxy, that was Bam's shit. I mean, Bam was the first major person talking about unity, or people being together. (Eure & Spady, 1991, pp. iv\u0096xv)\nBambataa had an organization, a legacy as one of the early progenitors of hip-hop, and when he and his group, the Soul Sonic Force, in 1982 scored a major hit record with \"Planet Rock,\" the Zulu ethos began to inundate hip-hop nationally.\nNationalism and the Nationalizing of Hip-Hop's Appeal: Run DMC\nThe nationalist ethos that was evident in the music of Flash and Bambataa did not dominate hip-hop. The young genre drew even more on the diverse aspects of the creative community that had spawned it. It was not until the middle 1980s that mega rap stars Run DMC made an overtly Black nationalist statement in rap form with the release of \"I'm Proud to Be Black.\" Interestingly this recording appeared on an album, Raising Hell, where the rappers performed with White, Aerosmith, in a rap and roll version of the rock group's \"Walk This Way.\" What had occurred in the interim is that hip-hop began to more overtly incorporate the flavor of New Wave, Techno, and House music. Hip-hop had always relied on R&B, jazz, funk, reggae, and rock samples. But not before Run DMC did hip-hop have both a national White audience and a hard rock sampling face. Run DMC did not begin this way. They, guided by the managerial and marketing genius of Russell Simmons, parlayed the B-boy image of hip-hop into million-dollar record sales. Their nihilistic reflections on the hardship of ghetto life captured the ethos of urban Black youth. Their hit, \"It's Like That,\" became an anthem of Black youth, so much of which was isolated in the inner cities. Isolated from the more bourgeois elements of emerging Black suburbia as well as the Black middle class whose aspirations were more consistent with the roles found in the Cosby Show and the mood captured later in Bobby Mcferrin's, \"Don't Worry Be Happy,\" DMC's message reflected and legitimized the B-boy lifestyle, and the Fresh Fest tours that they headlined showed major labels as well as the entire country that hip-hop was and would remain a powerful force in music.\nRun DMC's hard edge rap was coupled with guitar riffs that would put the best rock guitarists to shame. But coupled with the uncompromising bass and talking drum of the R&B and funk traditions, this made for an incredible rhythmical bouncing B-boy style. This wasn't Led Zeppelin. It was more like Cream meets P-funk meets the Last Poets, with as much of a mixture of frivolity, humor, fantasy, and conscience. But at the stage of \"King of Rock,\" it appeared that hip-hop was playing to a Black (and increasingly Hispanic) audience while beginning to attract Whites. It was not, however, self-consciously crossing over to insure White appeal. That appeared to be, at best, secondary. However, with the unheard of commercial success of \"King of Rock.\" the crossover appeal was so great that Run DMC appeared to cross over and out of the mainstream of hip-hop (African American), and they have never really been accepted back, on a national level, by their previously loyal Black rap fans . 8\nThe Germinating Context for a More Focused Nationalism\nIf we move beyond hip-hop's spatial locus (urban centers beginning in New York) and turn to its temporal locus, we begin to understand better it's wedding to Black nationalism. The national emergence of hip-hop is contemporaneous with the rise of reactionary republicanism in the Reagan-Bush years that would persist for no less than 12 years. The multiple recessions of the late 1970s and early 1980s were depressionary for Black people and especially Black youth. From 1979 to 1981, the Black community of the United States was transfixed on the Atlanta Child Murders, and few were convinced or assuaged by the conviction of Wayne Williams. In the late 1970s, Louis Farrakahn split with Warith Deen Muhammad's American Muslim Mission and reformed the Nation of Islam (NOI) under the former Black supremacist concepts abandoned by the son of Elijah Muhammad with the death of the self-proclaimed \"messenger of Allah\" in 1975. Coupled with the rise of the Farrakhan led NOI was the political rise of Jesse Jackson and his presidential runs in 1984 and 1988. Although Jackson has never espoused nationalism beyond its expediency for realizing his integrationist aims, the attacks on Jackson by the White media and his White coaspirants served to galvanize Black nationalist support around him and to result in positive sentiment for his campaign even among those who did not support his populist platform.\nWhen Jackson received the NOI's Fruit of Islam as his own security force, the convergence of the integrationist and nationalist hearkened back to the days of King and Malcolm. At this volatile point, only hip-hop spoke to the times (with the constant exception of Gil-Scott Heron). In these times, hip-hop 's sociopolitical consciousness was bared proudly for all suckers to see. Hip-hop spoke to the realities, perceptions, misperceptions, and aspirations that for too long lay stillborn on ghetto streets or aborted by conditions that waylaid hopes that even in death found no audience outside of the tenement walls or the unmarked boundaries that separated where you could go in the city and where the sun bet not set on you. George (1988) observes that in his lyrics,\nMelle Mel would praise Jesse Jackson's run for the presidency (\"Jesse\") while mainstream Black acts avoided singing about this historic event, make allusions to Hitler in discussing America's attitude toward the poor (\"Beat street Breakdown\"), and anticipate by several years the antidrug movement of the mid-eighties (\"White Lines\"). (p. 193)\nUnfortunately, nationalism also took the patriarchal focus of the 1960s and took a very misogynist approach to Black womanhood. Although from its earliest days hip-hop has had its female DJs and MCs, its center stage was mainly male oriented. By the time of the rise of Sugarhill, acts like Angie B began to emerge through the hip-hop ranks. For the most part, females would perform ancillary roles as dancers, and they were relegated, as performers, to novelty raps such as in the case of the Real Roxanne or to response raps such as those by Shante. The true marketing and recording potential of female acts was unheralded until the monumental success of Salt n Pepa's \"Push It.\" Beyond representation, from a womanist perspective, what was as bad was and is the continued objectification of Black women as bitches and hoes or other types of property, as male rappers pursue White supremacist patriarchal visions of Stagolee. This is epitomized in the straight up B-boy lines of LL cool J as well as in most of the gansta rap from early Boogie Down Productions (BDP), Ice-T, NWA, The Geto Boys, Treach, Tupac, and less successful would-be ganstas up to the pimp daddy mack appeals of Too Short and his aspirants. Undoubtedly the most notorious acts in this vein have emerged from the stables of Luke Productions.\nBut nationalism doesn't survive simply on the articulation of sentiment. It must be wedded to at least two other elements: image and organization. To a large extent, Russell Simmons provided an organizational basis for Black acts through his Def Jam Productions and Rush Management. But Simmons as a businessman, along with Tick Rubin, saw the potential of White acts as well as Black. In fact he produced the first White rap group with national appeal, The Beastie Boys. Interestingly he signed and produced this White group although it would be more than 5 years before he would sign a Black female rap act (Nikki D). So the nationalism that Simmon's activities engendered were more incidental to his overall aim of moving rap music into the mainstream of national and international markets in terms of volume sold. However, he provided an organizational focus for rap's Black business interests. The emergent independent Black rap labels found it difficult to compete with the hegemonic budgets of the major labels, and many were bought out or opted to hook up with the majors. Although the majors were late in seeing the commercial potential of hip-hop, they nonetheless developed hip-hop arms within their organizations to sop up the emergent talent. Under these influences, rap moved away from the call response pairs epitomized by RUN DMC, incorporating live bands, and huge MC Hammer stage shows.\nNow the image of hip-hop has gone on to encompass much of the older elements but now includes the consummate producers of hip-hop who have fused the best of the genre with more traditional elements of Black music. These include but are not limited to Dr. Dre and funk, Pete Rock and jazz, the Bomb Squad and rock and R&B, and so on. The central point is that the image of hip-hop has been transformed to include rap's super producers and promoters, rap movie and television stars, raptivists, emergent Black womanist artists, respected Mexican and Caribbean American artists like Kid Frost, The Latin Alliance, and Cypress Hill, \"suckerducktricktypewannabe\" acts like Serch, House of Pain, Marky Mark, Vanilla Ice, as well as new geographic etrep\u00f4ts in the West, South, and Midwest.\nThe Transformation of the Image of Hip-Hop: BDP\nThis image of hip-hop was largely the B-boy and Fly Girl images of urban Black youth. These images were perpetuated in the burgeoning music video industry. Getting paid, drinking forties, rolling, stupid sex, beepers, fly gear, a dope sound system in the helluva ride\u0097all were part of the impulse and imitation that continued to move Black youth that flocked to hip-hop in droves. This was the image of hip-hop. But the reality included much of the post-teen Black audience that was turned off by the pretensions of R&B and less inspired nouveau technojazz of the Wynton Marsalis ilk. For them, hip-hop continued the best of the funk and soul traditions that disco failed to project beyond the dance halls and cabarets. The hip-hop sampling, the danceable beats, and the infectious rhymes made rap attractive, but the substantive content\u0097its focus on gangs, drugs, community involvement, and giving something back\u0097hit a nerve for post-teens emerging from one type of disillusionment in the teen years and facing a new kind in the 20s and the decreased prospects for success, not just on an individual level, but as a people. For them, the image of hip-hop was not epitomized in the B-boy image so much as it was epitomized in the community interest. As the White media and its Black surrogates began to paint hip-hop as inherently violent, the unifying force of a perceived alien enemy galvanized the rap audience. It seemed as though hip-hip would be attacked, that concerts, bookings, and dollars would be lost under the guise of preventing the violence that hip-hop \"naturally\" spawned. It seemed as if, in the final analysis, it was hip-hop against the world. And that meant Black folks against the world.\nOn a national level, KRS-ONE, the rapper of martyred DJ Scott LaRock, who between them formed BDP, promoted a different hip-hop image. The image he promoted remained, in some respects, in the context of B-boys, but importantly he began to push the image of a politically conscious \"underclass.\" Here was a young gifted rapper, formerly homeless, whose DJ was murdered, promoting a perspective akin in some ways to that proffered by the early Black Panther Party (BPP). In this sense, the Black underclass was seen as a more lumpen proletariat class, in the sense of Fanon, the class with the most propitious prospects for organizing and producing revolution out of colonization. KRS-ONE's By All Means Necessary is a self-consciously Malcolm X inspired imaging of hip-hop and its potential as a force for Black self-determination. In this album, he implores Blacks, inter alia, that because many are educated, they must open their mouths and speak. Later KRS-ONE used some of the Afrocentric perspectives of Yosef ben Jochannnan in his anthem \"You Must Learn\" and argued for the teaching of Afrocentric history and provided in a video positive depictions of Blacks, including Black biblical figures such as Moses.\nAfter imaging Minister Malcolm and invoking the Black Power Movement, he then rallied around him some of the most potent rappers in the business to attack the violent image of rap. The Stop the Violence Movement drew youthful Black consciousness to the impact of violence of Black people and to a large extent remade the image of hip-hop from the ceaseless violence of criminal gangs and stick-up kids to the responsibilities of young Black men and women intent on breaking them off something in a society that had denied them so much. Importantly, what was gaining play was not so much a Black nation as a \"hip-hop nation.\" That is to say, the hip-hop nation invoked Black nationalism in a superficial way, but practice was something different. Hip-hop resurrected some deceased African American images, particularly Malcolm X, but it didn't seem to elevate those leaders present today. Politics was too often reduced to showing Malcolm X or Martin King in a video instead of incorporating their precepts into praxis on the part of the rappers who evoked the images of these African American leaders. Too many rappers didn't even bother to make their lyrics, much less their actions, consistent with the philosophies or even the sound bites of these leaders and teachers.\nThere is a larger requirement for the Black artist because they are asserting their creativity within the context of their people being oppressed. Whatever they purportedly do in the community, the music must speak to this consistently in that it is the vehicle whereby much of their philosophy or lack of philosophy gets transmitted. What emerges from hip-hop should be a much different lyric and different music than that which germinates from the non-oppressed elements in this country, and because legitimate hip-hop emerges from the Black cultural context and its conceptual and geographical landscape, and because this is almost completely foreign to European Americans, then these White folks may not be able to produce legitimate hip-hop, to the extent that their cultural, caste, and class foci speaks to a different reality. On the other hand, it may be that so-called Hispanics can speak to a sentiment and agency that more consistently parallels those processed that devolved from the Black experience and ethos. From this line of reasoning it looks like Native American hip-hop \"gonna be a @&#%$*.\"\nThe hip-hop nation, as opposed to the Black nation, promoted a \"myth of action\" whereby political responsibility, knowledge, and activity was garnered by proclamation and not by demonstration. This created a condition where people could practice one thing and preach another. This created the prospects for disillusionment among hip-hop fans who witnessed the stifling of their \"revolutionary\" performers when called to task by their primarily White bosses. This was perceived as the case with Public Enemy on the issue of Professor Griff, and most noticeably in the case of Ice-T and the Cop Killer dispute.\nThe Centrality of Public Enemy to \"Nation Conscious Rap\"\nIt is impossible to consider the Black nationalist element in hip-hop without recognizing the seminal influence of Public Enemy. Planting nationalist seeds in their first album in the righteous piece \"Rightstarter,\" their second album exploded the nationalist image as they stood flanked by their security forces, and invoking the religious and political Black nationalism of the Farrakhan led NOI, they provided the standard for \"nation conscious rap.\" Importantly, unlike KRS-ONE who promoted disparate strands and strains of nationalist sentiment without a community-grounded institution, Public Enemy broke out with one of the most heralded and respected institutions in the Black community\u0097the NOI. This fusion of rap and Black nationalist political organization promoted through his lyrics the nationalist sentiment but also provided through his community activity a distinguishable practice of communitarian responsibility.\nAs rallies and public interest focused on the murders of Howard Beach, the lynching of Michael Donald, the attacks on Eleanor Bumpers, the Tawanna Brawley case, and the student uprising at Columbia and the University of Michigan, Public Enemy focused youthful Black energy and consciousness in a way that no rap act ever had. Overtly promoted by and promoting Louis Farrakhan, Public Enemy helped bring thousands of young Blacks to the political philosophy of Black nationalism. For example, in \"Party for your Right to Fight,\" a side from their second album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back, Public Enemy transforms the title of the party rap from the Beastie Boys (\"Fight for you Right to Party\") into a powerful, though cursory, exegesis of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (i.e., the party for you right to fight). Here is evinced a movement away from the oppression-inspired nationalism of \"The Message\" toward a more self-determination-focused nationalism.\nNo other rap, this side of the joint, captured the ethos of Blacks in captivity in quite the way of \"Black Steel in the Hour Chaos .\" 9 Beyond the message to those physically incarcerated, the lyric was reminiscent of Malcolm X's assertion that simply to be Black in America, whether one was incarcerated of not, was to be in prison. Chuck D pushed this line of nationalism into the heralded \"Fight the Power.\" But the overall sentiment that emerged from the religious-based nationalism of the NOI contrasted with the lumpen appeal of hip-hop for the young generation who, although they respected the so-called Black Muslims, had no intention of organizing with them. Principally, this motivation, or lack thereof, may be rooted in what Kelley (1992) refers to as a \"Ghettocentric\" view that predominates in many inner city communities . 10 More to the point, it actually reflects the subcultural locus of interests that emerge from the caste dynamic of U.S. society where inner city African Americans find themselves cast out of mainstream national culture and are forced to derive for themselves some requisite paradigm of interpreting a very different world than that contained in the paradigm of the dominant culture (i.e., it ain't the American dream).\nWhat has emerged among the small cohort that is the hip-hop community in these urban centers (as opposed to the more lasting institutions that African Americans have built as life-giving and life-sustaining institutions in these same communities since the great migration) is a rather nihilistic and self-destructive set of tenets that emerge from the drive for survivalism in these inner city communities, which are usually not grounded in overtly African-centered dynamics or in disciplined religious formulations like those found in the NOI program. Also, at the same time, prior to the Dopebusters Program and the organizing of the NOI National Security as a business institution, the NOI was not prepared to organize with groups other than Black Muslims. Following Malcolm more than Muhammad, Farrakhan is attempting to overcome this rigidity.\nThe image of Malcolm X, more a caricature at times, holding his carbine peering through a curtained window captured the hip-hop nation and demanded less as a cost of followership than the rigid discipline of the NOI. And with the riff between Chuck D and Professor Griff\u0097who was among the most vocal adherents of NOI philosophy within Public Enemy\u0097resulting in Griff's dismissal from the group, hip-hop followers used this cleavage to abrogate any responsibility of followership beyond proclamations of being \"down.\" Further, the mysticism of NOI philosophy, the centering of Yacub's history, the making of a messiah/god out of a non-Black Farad Muhammad, countered the more cultural-based nationalism and revolutionary black nationalism of an emergent and philosophically thirsty Black youth.\nWhat was missing in the Public Enemy appeal was the same elements missing in the NOI: a cultural focus on African tradition and practice as opposed to a pseudo-Asiatic/Arab and/or Muslim foci, as well as a transformative philosophy rooted in Black agency, action, and representation, and not awaiting a messiah. A group centered on the stylings and flavor of the son of a legendary Black community activist organized around these very precepts emerged and helped change the face of hip-hop. This was X-Clan.\nX-Clan fused aspects of Karenga's (1980) Kawaida and aspects of revolutionary Black nationalism. X-Clan grounded their Black nationalism in Black culture and in protest that was present day and not simply hearkening back to dead heroes. The overtly Kemetic (Egyptian) imagery and philosophy were much more studied and apparent in X-Clan was forthright in their Black nationalism. They coupled their rap with the organizational focus of The Blackwatch Movement, which is a Black nationalist organization seeded in several cities. With the boycott of Korean grocers and the explosion of the Black and White communities following the murder of Yusuf Hawkins in Bensonhurst, Blacks organized \"Days of Outrage\" as a form of protest. X-Clan gave expression to both the sentiment and the activities that both fostered and resulted from continued attacks on Black self-determination.\nX-Clan not only positioned Black nationalism in its political aspect at the center of hip-hop, it pushed nationalist rap stars, including Public Enemy, back to a more political, as opposed to a religious, Black nationalism following what some considered a weaker almost integrationist sentimentalizing in Public Enemy's third album, Fear of a Black Planet. In this album, although the first release, \"Welcome to the Terrordome\" was vintage PE (Public Enemy), Chuck appeared to be responding more to attacks on him from Whites, particularly European-Jewish Americans, and was not so much pushing the nationalist position. The next album, Apocalypse 91: The Empire Strikes Black, resurrected the politically based nationalist position of PE, especially in what I consider to be the album's three core cuts \"Can't Truss It,\" \"By the Time I Get to Arizona,\" and the exceptional \"Shut Em Down.\"\nThe imagery that was portrayed in the videos of these three cuts was exceptional. In the first, present-day conditions of African Americans, especially following the attacks on Rodney King, are juxtaposed against the era of the Holocaust of Enslavement: slave auctions analogized to employment lines, agricultural plantations analogized to industrial plants, rape on the plantation to sexual harassment in the workplace, and finally lynching to the beating of Rodney King. The video's effect is heightened by the fact that it is filmed in Black and White. \"By the Time I Get to Arizona\" provides narrative for a concerted attempt to assassinate the legislative leadership of a state that fails to officially sanction and recognize the Martin Luther King holiday.\nHere PE takes the prototypic symbol of nonviolence, Martin Luther King, and depicts retribution for the sufferings visited upon African Americans before, during, and after the movements that he helped to lead. In so doing, PE asserts all African Americans' right to put history in our own image and interests. They are not forced to only invoke what Martin King invoked. They are not forced to only \"dream\" the way that the White media as well as the Black integrationist \"leadership\" attempts to constrain thought, analysis, or interpretations of Martin King. Although King went to his death as an apostle of nonviolence, that does not mean that all we can learn from King is nonviolence. This is the relevance of PE. We have a duty and obligation as heirs and custodians of a powerful legacy to both remember and interpret history, but to also cast it in a liberating light so that we may construct vehicles and institutions to perpetuate the best of us as a people.\nFor nationalists, we can accept aspects of King's leadership and his philosophy, but even in our analysis of him, and much more of the movement, we are not limited by this. White supremacists, Black and White, have great difficulty with this aspect of self-determination, primarily because it attacks their authority as the definers of truth, righteousness, historical accuracy, and morality. The parade of integrationist Negroes that chastised PE's video stand is testament to the prevalence and enduring nature of White supremacy.\nFinally, \"Shut Em Down\" moved the imagery of Black nationalism beyond the simply caricaturing of Malcolm X. In this video, also done in Black and White, PE depicts some of the greatest heroes of the Black power movement over a pulsing bass line and Chuck D's hailing baritone invoking the Black masses to shut down those elements and institutions that do not provide for and promote Black community development. To my mind, in all three videos, PE attempts to redefine and reposition Black nationalism around demystified and responsible historical interpretation. This is most evident in \"Can't Truss It\" and \"By the Time I Get to Arizona.\" PE also shows respect and homage for the heroes of Black nationalism while acknowledging responsible community praxis. Implicit in \"Shut Em Down\" is PE's admonition to rappers to join in struggle with their communities. This was as much the result, I would argue, from the push of X-Clan as it was from the evolving political maturity of Public Enemy.\nA Challenge to Those Who Assume a Nationalist Posture\nThis longer treatment of PE over other acts is not to suggest that as goes PE, so goes Black nationalist hip-hop. PE's centrality insofar as promoting Black nationalism, however, is widely respected even among those who are not recognized for being politically conscious . 11 What is important in the development of PE is that it parallels much of the development of Black nationalism in hip-hop\u0097good and bad. Much of the positive side has been stated, but on the other side, PE has also been responsible for promoting a \"politics as theater\" approach to nationalism. This aspect of the melodramatizing of political action was taken up by the White rap group 3rd Bass, who made a parody of the precision fancy drill of PE's security forces in their rap \"Gas Face.\" Moreover, PE helped to promote another rather deleterious aspect of nationalist hip-hop: the myth of action. The myth of action, a term borrowed from Maulana Karenga, promotes proclamation over demonstration. That is, real community organizing and political grounding are forsaken, or never undertaken. Pursued instead is a sort of fantasizing of abstracting of action that usually is no more than hollow melodrama that nonetheless passes, in some circles, for positive political action.\nInterestingly it was PE prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u00e9 Sister Souljah who, after earning a reputation as a community organizer especially of community oriented hip-hop concerts, promoted the \"raptivist\" image of rap star and activist. She gained national attention, not from her raps, or from her appearances in PE's as well as her own videos, but as the brunt of Bill Clinton's attack on the Rainbow Coalition in his attempt to further distance himself and in many ways renounce Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and his perceived leftist populism to ensure Clinton the \"Bubba\" vote among the White middle-income groups in the country. Souljah used this national attention and responded in concert with much of the nationalist audience in repudiation of both Clinton and his right to position himself as a moral teacher for her personally and for Black people as a whole. But the nationalist community's last national images of PE were its video with White heavy metal rock group Anthrax performing \"Bring The Noise.\" Somehow I don't think the nationalist audience assumed that the noise PE was talking about bring was performing with a White metal band.\nBut this is the same course that Los Angeles gangsta rapper Ice-T pursued. Going even further, he put together a metal band, known as Body Count, and performed at metal sites such as CBGB's and then performed on the Lollapolluza tour. Ice-T has at one time or another promoted an image of a pimp daddy mack, a dope peddler, a businessman, a political teacher, a gangsta, and a revolutionary. Reality casts Ice-T in a much different light than any of these: He is a professional performer, an entertainer, and as such he is quite interesting and even good. However, for a revolutionary, or even a reformer, he makes for a good rapper. Ice-T is not so much nationalist but gangsterish. Ice-T's nationalism may have emerged from his producer Afrika Islam who is also down with the Zulu Nation and who went out west to produce Ice-T.\nThe gangsta posture took some of the focus off the emergent nationalism epitomized in KRS-ONE and PE in the East. It also was the bread and butter of west coast hip-hop. This was due to the fact that the territorial gang element in the West, especially in Los Angeles, is more defining than that same element in the Northeast home of hip-hop. Like their East Coast predecessors before them, the West Coast \"all stars\" came together with a concerted nationalist focus around the issue of violence in hip-hop and in the Black community. This was undertaken in the track entitled \"We're All in the Same \" 12 Earlier, Ice-T had made a very lucid point about the use and abuse of the term violence when it came to hip-hop. He pointed out in \"Squeeze the Trigger,\" in his Rhyme Pays that rap music did not cause violence any more than soccer matches, hockey games, or nuclear peace rallies\u0097all the sites of some form of violence. The larger and important point was that youth live in a violent society, and at its best, the music that captured this ethos would evoke violent images. Therefore it is foolish to assume, as many policy makers did, that rap music was causing violence as opposed to reflecting the violence within many urban communities.\nIce-T moved from what could be considered the petty gangsterism that was evocative of the original Hustler's Convention to Power, which though good musically, showed more that people who operate at the margins of power understand very little about real power. Although attempting to promote both the gangsta and intelligent hoodlum image, as well as a nationalist one, Ice-T instead put himself in a position to publicly admonish LL Cool J for much of what he himself proclaimed in his first album, and in many ways in all of his albums. LL Cool J was the biggest hip-hop act going at the time. He responded to Ice-T's dis powerfully and humorously and Grandmaster Caz and probably Afrika Islam and the Zulu Nation mediated the dispute (Eure & Spady, 1991, p. xv).\nBut the real significance of the Ice-T episode in regards to nationalism and activism is the response he chose for the activity of the police departments against his \"Cop Killer\" album. For all his proclamation, Ice-T simply succumbed to public pressure. Not only that, he went down proclaiming his defense of Warner Brothers, a multibillion dollar enterprise. As Maulana Karenga (1993) pointed out, When has a multibillion dollar industry needed a Black man to defend it? Others proclaimed that Ice-T went out like a sucker. After promoting the myth of cop killer and peeling suckers' caps back and taking out cops in defense of righteous Black peoples, he stood up to \"defend\" one of the same companies that has been accused of ripping off Black talent, destroying Black competition in independent record companies, and stifling Black commercial development in distribution and other nonperformance aspects of the recording industry. He, like Ice Cube, later would proclaim all sorts of activism from the safety of nice homes of movie sets.\nIce Cube, who, after leading the gangsta rap group NWA, hooked up with the NOI, lost his jheri curl. and found himself in Blackness. and who almost teary eyed on national television speaking out on the violence of the Los Angeles revolt and his personal worry about his personal loss and his personal friends, promoted himself months later and found no remorse in proclaiming himself and his crew as the \"pride of Africa\" and \"Guerrillas in da Midst\" and as \"wicked\" revolutionaries all over south central during the burning. It's incredible the selective amnesia that some of these rappers would want us to have. Like Souljah and her armed bands of \"revolutionaries,\" Ice Cube's \"Lench Mob\" are the urban guerrillas intent on hastening the \"revolution\" that is sure to come. Souljah, one of the most community grounded among the \"raptivists,\" nonetheless, irresponsibly (vis-\u00e0-vis our Black liberation history) evokes images of herself leading armed revolutionaries in urban centers because the Black nation is, by her account, \"at war,\" though she still finds time from the battlefield to make music videos and promote her own image over those of people who did and are doing the actual fighting, such as sister Assata, Jalil Muntaquin, Sekou Odinga, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, and nameless others who struggle determinedly, persistently. Somehow I don't think this is what Geronimo Pratt or even brother Nat and sister Queen Mother Moore envisioned.\nA corollary to the above is the major pretension of many rappers\u0097nationalist and otherwise\u0097who proclaim their depictions of wanton violence and sexism are nonetheless appropriate because they are speaking the reality that they see every day. This rationalization is vacuous on two levels. First, despite notions of being \"true to the game,\" many of these rappers are speaking a \"reality\" that is not theirs\u0097though it may be \"real\" and prevalent to others\u0097and is constantly exaggerated, glamorized, and hyped. There is no better example than the Detroit born rapper \"Boss,\" Lichelle Laws, who has to be one of the most hypocritical \"voices of the street.\" She reportedly grew up in a middle-class Detroit neighborhood where she attended ballet and piano class and private schools through high school. Nonetheless, the 24-year-old was making a handsome living spewing some of the most virulent and violent \"gangsta\" rap. Either ballet classes are much more violent today than in the past or many rappers simply parrot and parley the racist image of Black thuggery to mislead Black youths and eager White audiences ready to consume this modern minstrel.\nAnother and probably deeper point is that raised by Karenga (1993). He attacks the notion that rappers are just interpreting their reality. Notwithstanding the earlier point concerning whose reality it is, rappers have, according to Karenga, a responsibility beyond simply mirroring \"reality.\" He analogizes the situation of the Black community and rappers to that of a drowning man who is shown a mirror. He argues that the person showing the drowning man the mirror is showing the man reality. However, Karenga maintains, that person holding the mirror has a greater responsibility to the drowning men than that of \"interpreting\" his reality. There is the added responsibility of changing that reality, in this case giving him a hand or throwing a rope. Rappers, who are making their pockets fatter helping themselves, are not, for the most part, transforming reality, or even understanding their responsibility to change it. And to the extent that the Black community is drowning, the requirement for change is not for mirror holders with sagging pants, who tout guns, flout responsibility, and disrespect women, all the while invoking hollow phrases of being pro Black and down with the people. Further, the nihilism in much of rap only glamorizes further violence and sexism instead of a social practice of African-centered liberation to transform Black communities. This is the minimum requirement for would-be liberation, [and from] those who invoke images of Malcolm, the BPP, and King. This is far beyond the empty rhetoric of \"by any means necessary.\" And for those who argue that their efforts are righteous because they get paid, we must counter that there must be some things that we will not do for money. People were paid for the holocaust of enslavement, but that did not make it correct. Infiltrators were paid to betray liberation struggles. It is a nihilism bordering on inhumanity that allows both the manufacturing of misogynist products and celebration of people dancing to their own degradation. Much of the nihilistic imaging, in reality, is promoted, if not created, by White industry executives as well as by miseducated blacks masquerading as chroniclers of the \"Black experience.\"\nThe real shame of this is that in all their hollow theatrics is lost the lesson that there have been in our Black community those who have righteously, when they found it necessary, taken up arms to fight against the inhumanity and injustice that White supremacists have visited upon us. These are among our greatest heroes in this country. They go back as far as the Seminole and maroon warriors, Nat Turner, Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Lucy Parsons, Ida B. Wells Barnett, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth, and they include but are not limited to those among us today in the person of Queen Mother Moore, Chris Alston, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Dhoruba Bin Wahad, Geronimo Pratt, Assata Shakur, Sundiata Acole, Albert \"Nuh\" Washington, Ahmed Rahman, Cicero Love, Safiya Bukhari-Alston, Jalil Muntaquin, Ruchell Magee, Sharif Willis, Falaka Fattah, Marian Nzinga Stammps, Jamil Amin, Kwame Tour\u00e9, Aneb Kgotsile, Akua Njeri, Imari Obadele, Maulana Karenga, Chokwe Lumumba, General Baker, The BPP, RNA, US (as opposed to them), NOI, New African People's Organization (NAPO), Black Liberation Army (BLA), and all those who have taken up arms in revolt and otherwise risked their lives in the name of their people. The hollow imaging of these Black rap acts does not resurrect the images of the best of our Black community, it bastardizes it. It spits on the grave of Boyd, Brown, and Bethune, Marx Essex, Fred Hampton, Twyman Myers, Zayd Shakur, Mark Clark, Jake Winters, and a litany of others. These actions are self-serving and self-aggrandizing and as such should be severely criticized if not condemned. The true potential in rap is to be discovered in the fact that even with these shortcomings, rappers as entertainers have remained far more central and focused than their contemporaries in R&B. Comparisons of rappers with other entertainers is appropriate; however, the present attempt to compare their hollow theatrics with political organization does a great disservice to the legacy of those who struggled for our liberation.\nA Future For Nationalism in Hip-Hop\nThese rappers should be appreciated as entertainers but criticized as political leaders or spokespersons. The media itself promotes in them man aura of leadership most of them do not warrant and have not cultivated; however, what is promising is that many have linked up to the positive nationalist organizational elements in the Black community and have become more grounded in their political exegeses. The future is promising in this regard. Young rappers need to learn, not only from the older rap counterparts and community organizers but also from the old jazz acts like Billie Holliday, John Coltrane, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone, McCoy Tyner, Earl Van Dyke, and Miles Davis, Gil Scott Heron, Bilal Sunni Ali, to name just a few. They also must ground with the community and organize with some of our veterans such as those mentioned above, as well as those in the movements around Afrocentrism reparations, and peace. Such grounding ensures political sophistication and proscribes this fantasy island type nationalism surrounded by a myth of action. Rappers must continually confront the questions Fanon (1968) posed to us as the fundamental questions that Africans must deal with every day: (a) Who am I? (b) Am I who I think I am? and (c) Am I all that I ought to be? The real answers to these questions may surprise them.\nIt is my position that it's going to be local not the national acts that resupply the nationalistic vigor that many have either forsaken or given lip service to. This is due to the demands of big-time groups to overfantasize and overly indulge themselves and their reputations while decreasing their accessibility to the local community. The result is that they are no longer grounded in anything but the superficial and faddish concerns of their (now abandoned) community. Moreover, the effective nationalist organizers are more often grassroots members who are in the very communities that the rap stars have since left or become out of touch with. Remember even when acts stay in communities, it is possible to no longer be able to relate to that community because success and money many times blind people to anything but their own myopic misperceptions of reality. For nationalism to remain in hip-hop and become a grounding for a more effective expression of African American national culture and institution building, local acts with this focus should be promoted and national acts should both legitimize extant nationalist organizations and our nationalist leaders and also promote new nationalist and Africa-centered institutions among the hip-hop community itself.\nFinally, it should be understood that the nihilism in hip-hop and the glamorization of hip-hop \"culture\" really represents the absence of national culture (African-centered culture) among those claimants. It also promotes the lumpen image, or the criminal image as the image of African Americans. Minister Malcolm is instructive in this regard. He pointed out on one occasion that it was not a shame to have been a criminal, but it is a shame to remain a criminal. This glamorization of negative imaging is all the more telling in light of the fact that much of rap, especially so-called gangsta rap, increasingly plays to a White audience (Samuels, 1991) and is widely consumed by White youths who find little difficulty accepting the stereotypical criminality of Black youth and the denegration of Black women.\nMany African American youth are struggling around issues of manhood and womanhood. These definitions are rooted in identity. Identities are derived from culture. Definitions of manhood and womanhood (more specific identities) are derived from culture. If, as in the African American community, you have people who have been denied their culture by White supremacism, and youth who believe they have no culture, the African American community will devise one for themselves. Therefore, you will have a \"hip-hop\" culture full of youth with definitions of their identity and the rites of passage into manhood/womanhood defined by Euro-American guns, drug retailing, foreign made gym shoes, White distributed music, 40s, sexism, and misguided pronouncements of righteousness. Moreover, you will have the glamorization of the killing of other African Americans. Youth will know Tupac Shakur and glamorize or rationalize his self-destructive \"thug life\" but remain ignorant of Mutulu and Afeni Shakur . 13 It is not hip-hop's responsibility to change all of this; that burden falls upon us all. It is the responsibility of all artists of oppressed groups to speak meaningfully in their art, sometime, someplace, to the liberation of their people.\nIn the final analysis, it's up to us to educate our youth and to demand of our youth an appropriate respect for their true heritage, legacy, and the responsibility that accompanies both. We must be the example. And that example is best demonstrated by our everyday practice and grounding with them in our own communities first, and in every situation that we may find ourselves.\n(This paper appeared in the Journal of Black Studies/January 1996.)\n______________________________\nErrol A.

On the relationship between national culture and popular culture, Cabral (1973) argued that within culture is found the seed of opposition that leads to the fashioning of the liberation movement. Asante (1993, p. 120) suggest the prospect in Afrocentrism is to recenter the \"decentered, dislocated, and disoriented youth.\" Karenga (1993, p. 414) maintains that part of the relevance of rap music is its promotion of a sense of community among Black youth centered on a nationalist consciousness raising. Unfortunately rap's mixed messages of positive consciousness are often muted by its sexism, lumpen glorification, and at times hypocritical pronouncements of Black activism. Return\n3. See Madhubuti (1973, 1978). Return\n4. However, for performers, having a home base did not preclude the need for security. Herc was among the first to have his own home base whereas others were primarily restricted to house parties. He had the Hevalo on Jerome Avenue during 1974 before moving around the block to the Executive Playhouse, which since changed its name to Sparkle. Even with a home base, in one infamous incident, Herc was attacked and knifed at a performance. Return\n5. See interview with Grandmaster Caz in Eure and Spady's (1991) Nation Conscious Rap. Charles Henry's (1992, p. 34) Culture and African American Politics makes the point that\nRap music developed out of local block parties in the Black ghetto. These parties, often in housing projects, were associated with gangs who occupied their turf. To protect themselves and keep the peace at their parties, all well-known rap crews became affiliated with \"security forces.\" Membership in security force crews like the Casanova Crew, the Nine Crew, and the Zulu Nation ranged from six hundred to thousands. Most rappers were forced to find security from local \"stick up kids.\" Security forces themselves were largely composed of hoodlums, although their energies were channeled into rap competition. Black gang warfare declined dramatically during this period (1978\u009681). Return\n6. Caz makes the point that early on there wasn't much unity in hip-hop, but then \"We brought Brooklyn to Manhattan. Cause you would never see anybody from Brooklyn nowhere but in Brooklyn. You would never see too many people go to Brooklyn either, cause they was ... everybody stuck to their shit. But the hip-hop movement got everybody traveling (Eure & Spady, 1991, p. xiv). Return\n7. Here we mean the spirited and hyped competition between rappers and DJs. Return\n8. Their recent marriage with Pete Rock and CL Smooth seemed to have allowed for renewed acceptance of the former kings. Additionally, it could be argued that Run DMC's crossover ambivalence was evident in the choice of title for their anthem: \"King of Rock,\" instead of what may have been the more apropos title of \"King of Rap.\" Although the former, it could be argued, rightly appropriates for African American artists the mantle of rock and roll music, which was spawned by Black legends dating back to Big Mama Thorton, we could also make the point that the rap artists should have promoted their own genre, explicitly, as an authentic and culturally grounded articulation of African American music and worthy of its own, at least figuratively, sire. Return\n9. As opposed to incarceration, captivity denotes imprisonment that is primarily the result of political activity and not explicitly criminal activity. Or, closer to the truth, it is incarceration that is the result of the criminalization of self-determination under conditions of oppression: Therefore, Geronimo Pratt, Ahned Rahman, Dhoruba bin-Wahad, Assata Shakur, Jalil Muntaquin, George Jackson, Huey Newton, Maulana Karenga, Imari Obadele, Panther 21, Wilmington 10, RNA 11, and many others were or are in captivity. Return\n10. Kelly (1992, p. 39) defines Ghettocentric as \"the identity in which the specific class, race and gendered experiences in late capitalist urban centers coalesce to crate a new identity\u0097'Nigga'.\" Further, he states that \"nigga is not merely another work for Black; it encompasses a specific class, spatial, and to a large degree, gendered subject position.\" He goes on to make the obvious point that \"the experiences of young Black men in the inner city are not universal to all Black people, and in fact they recognize that some African Americans play a role in perpetuating their oppression\" (p. 40). Kelly misses the point that what he calls \"Ghetocentric\" is only part of the focus that emerges from the perceptions of many youth in the inner city that comes from their disillusionment with the national culture that has designated them outcastes but appeals to them, nonetheless, through White supremacism as a constituent, though denatured part of the American whole. It is within this casts relationship that the African centeredness of the African American has been incubated and through which it persists. This is not simply an urban phenomenon but is a diasporic phenomenon (Henderson, 1995).\nNigga is nothing more than a variant of nigger with the same White supremacist connotations, it is not deeper than that. To attempt to derive other meanings is about as useful as saying that a \"bitch\" is not intended to be degrading but only implies \"beautiful intelligent teachers of cultural heritage.\" Rappers Bytches With Problems nonsensically maintain the assertive \"positive\" characteristic of the term. This is no more nonsensical than Tupac's assertion that nigga represents \"Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished.\" It is not that nigga has to have any positive connotation at all. It obviously does not invoke a racial response among many Blacks as between Blacks and Whites, but this is because it has, most notably, been used as a White supremacist statement. However, when used by members of the same race, that racist motivation is not as apparent and is in many cases ignored. What is important to understand is that this identification is rooted in the dominance of the White supremacist culture and its infusion into all the captured national groups in the United States (Obadele, 1986). The \"Ghettocentric\" hip-hopsters are not immune to this process, and they are similarly ingrained with much of the White supremacism that is the driving force of the dominant culture in this country, their proclamations to the contrary notwithstanding. Return\n11. On their album, Can't Hold Us Black, the self-style ghetto gangsters, the Geto Boys, present PE an apocryphal award for being so \"dam\" Black. Return\n12. Whereas the East Coast track ended with Chuck D's shrill lyric that called for unity and love, the West Coast version, although theatrically more engaging, ended with the late Eazy-E's warning to stay off the streets as well as his characterization of himself as \"the violent hero.\" Return\n13. It ironic that Tupac Shakur, presently serving a prison sentence for a rape conviction, has only with that conviction begun to promote favorable images of his mother's Black Panther Party legacy in his music videos. Additionally, he has repudiated his \"thug life\" style. This may not suggest any transformation on the part of the rapper but only indicate the great difficulty in portraying that image in a prison among serious \"thugs\" as opposed to portraying it in the media. Worse, though, has been the failure of many in the \"hip-hop nation\" to hold him accountable for the totality of his destructive message. Only with his recent attempt to character assassinate associates present at the incident where he was shot (see Freddy, 1995) have rappers and some fans begun to admonish, criticize, and righteously hold accountable this would-be, and self-proclaimed, thug/revolutionary/family man/spokesman for a generation ... and so on.

Stated like that, it's a simple, elegant theory that's a fairly useful predictor of overall musical quality in a given year, although it can't explain, say, the shittiness that was rap in 2008.\nWhat Questlove actually said in this interview in The Believer is a little more nuanced:\nMy theory is that nine times out of ten, if there\u2019s a depression, more a social depression than anything, it brings out the best art in black people. The best example is, Reagan and Bush gave us the best years of hiphop.... No matter how far back in time people wanna go it works. Start with King Oliver or Ma Rainey or Louis Armstrong. The worse the social conditions, the better the black music. I\u2019m not sayin strictly, a Republican has to be in office. Social depression, financial depression, and an overall hopelessness brings the best of art. Gospel starts in slavery. The blues start around the Depression. Jazz starts in the post-Depression period. At the beginning of the civil rights movement you had doo-wop, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, and soul. The glue that held that together was a spiritual bond. That\u2019s what\u2019s missing from today. That\u2019s what made hiphop great in the eighties. Now, with Bush in office and the war and al-Qaeda and everything goin on we should be seeing the best music.\nI'm not a particularly big fan of the Roots-- although I like some of their records -- but as someone who spends way too much time thinking about rap music history, I think Questlove's formulation is pretty much genius.\nAnyhow, I was moved to track the quote down because I've been feeling like rap music is about to get good again and I think the economy being in the toilet has something to do with it. I've got no problem with escapist bullshit per se-- the first time I heard a broke rapper boast about owning a jet I probably chuckled at the audacity-- but repetitive bullshit is another story and I'm glad the economy has given rappers something to rap about besides having money, clothes, strippers, guns, drugs and rapping.\nI think credit for kicking off the trend has to go to Young Jeezy, who back in the summer had the foresight to name his album The Recession and to call the election months before either was a sure thing. (Maybe there's room for him on Obama's Council of Economic Advisers; no wait, I hear Commerce Secretary is open-- birds in every kitchen!) Since then, it's begun to snowball-- so we're treated to things like a formerly pretend-rich rapper racing to get out in front of it:\n"}, {"score": 848.8164, "uuid": "cdb97321-f0f0-5c8b-8569-12bf0c66efeb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1806wb-70-24732", "target_hostname": "beatmaker.net", "target_uri": "http://beatmaker.net/tag/royalty-free-rap-beats/", "page_rank": 1.2287921e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Royalty-free <em>Rap</em> Beats | Beat Maker", "snippet": "Tags: beatmaker software, hip hop beats, music production software, royalty-free <em>rap</em> beats, self-produced music * Beastie Boys Inducted Into <em>Rock</em> and Roll Hall Of Fame", "explanation": null, "document": "Friday, February 25th, 2011 | Beat Maker Software , Hip Hop , Music Production , Self-Produced Music | pauly\nXXL Magazine Names 2011 Freshman List For Hip Hop Beats\nXXL Magazine has debuted its list of the \u201cmost promising hip hop beats , rhymes, artists, labels and more.\u201d The April 2011 issue, which has been in the works for months, features 11 hip hop artists whom you may not have heard of before.

You\u2019re likely to be hearing a lot more about these performers and their hip hop beats in the coming months. Being an XXL Freshman comes along with a lot of publicity. To be sure, there are a few acts that don\u2019t make it, but the staff at XXL have done a pretty good job of picking out the future stars of the hip hop genre each year.\nThese freshmen also demonstrate that it\u2019s possible to break into the hip hop music scene with not a lot more than some fresh hip hop beats and a lot of determination.

Wishes can be as unique as the children themselves and whether a child wants to go on a family holiday; visit Disneyworld in Florida; own an iPad; be a ballerina, or a fireman; or meet a favourite celebrity, Rays of Sunshine works hard to make that wish come true. Wishes are referred from around 150 hospitals, hospices and specialist schools across the country. The charity aims to grant 650 wishes in 2012 and will also organise several events for large groups of seriously ill children throughout the year including, \u2018The Sunshine Concert\u2019, trips to theme parks and Christmas parties. https://www.raysofsunshine.org.uk/\nThe Streetwyze community youth music project was set up in 2009 as a NGO. http://www.streetwyze.org/\nThe British Red Cross is a volunteer-led humanitarian organisation that helps people in crisis, whoever and wherever they are.

But the recent ravings against rock and rap add to the growing evidence that Uzbek media is moving beyond simply providing glowing state-approved versions of events at home and abroad and vilifying those the state calls enemies.\nUzbek media are increasingly telling people, especially the country's youth, how they should behave, what they should wear, and most importantly, who and what to avoid.\nThe latest example was seen in the documentary film \"Melody and Calamity,\" aired on Uzbek TV's Second Channel.\n\"This satanic music was created by evil forces to bring youth in Western countries to total moral degradation,\" the documentary declared.\nAccording to the documentary, rock music \"originated from African hunting rituals.\" Rap was invented by \"inmates in prisons,\" the film said, concluding: \"that's why rap singers wear wide and long trousers.\"\nLocal Roots\nDavron Goipov is an award-winning Uzbek musician who has been playing rock music since the 1980s. He disagrees with the TV program's portrayal of the musical form, which he says has roots that extend to traditional local music.\n\"Some people should read up on the subject,\" he says. \"To say this is satanic music is simply not true. If we look at rock 'n' roll music, we can hear rhythms familiar from Central Asia. If you listen to [former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie] Blackmore, you can hear our [Central Asian] rhythms.\"\nGoipov says it is possible to hear in some of Pink Floyd's music the rhythm of the shashmaqam -- six modes -- classical music of Central Asia that dates back to the 16th century. But Goipov would have a difficult time getting his views heard on state television these days.\n'Whirlpool Of Death'\nConsidering Uzbekistan's proximity to Afghanistan and the multiplying number of opposition groups in the Central Asian region rallying under the banner of Islam, perhaps it should not be surprising that Uzbek media dedicate programs and articles denouncing and warning about \"alien ideas.\"\nThe Uzbek radio program \"Awareness,\" discussing religious extremism in early 2008, warned of \"alien ideas which do not suit our national ideology\" and \"develop evil and aggression in a person's character.\" Uzbek TV aired a program later that year called \"Whirlpool Of Death,\" which described attempts in the eastern city of Andijon to recruit young Uzbek men for militant camps in Pakistan's Waziristan region.\nIn January 2009, the state newspaper \"Halq Sozi\" (People's Word) warned women about wearing veils, writing: \"Wearing the hijab is nothing other than blindly imitating Arab women. Our women should recognize this, and the sooner the better.\"\nIncreasingly, it is not Islamic extremists and Islamic clothing that state media criticize, but Western culture and technology. The same \"Halq Sozi\" article that urged Uzbek women to forego the veil ended by saying, \"Unfortunately, we have been observing girls wearing skirts with a hemline above the knees or revealing clothes showing their navels without being ashamed. This type of dressing style is not only alien to our centuries-old national and spiritual traditions, but also directly harmful to women's health.\"\nIt is interesting to note that Uzbek President Islam Karimov's eldest daughter, Gulnara, designs clothing for fashion shows in Europe and, in her incarnation as a musician, releases CDs and videos.\n'Disgusting Acts'\nState media's admonitions about Western culture go far beyond clothing and music.\n\"Uzbekistan Ovozi\" (Uzbekistan's Voice) wrote in January 2009 that \"mass culture is more dangerous than terrorism.\" The newspaper said that while terrorism could affect the lives of people in a localized area, \"mass culture is aimed at carrying out disgusting acts of completely eliminating the identities, images, and values of all nationalities and peoples of the world.\"\n\"Halq Sozi\" in April 2009 pointed out that \"modern ideological and spiritual attacks are dangerous by seeming to be harmless. Attacks of this kind may be carried out just through music, some cartoons, or advertisements.\"\nThe newspaper \"Inson va Konun\" (People and the Law) in May 2010 warned the country's parents about their children's \"habits of spending hours having meaningless talks on mobile phones, using frivolous mobile phone services, and listening to meaningless songs or to play computer games day and night.\"\n\"Inson va Konun\" warned parents that unless they ignored mass culture, they would raise a child \"who has no dignity and ideas, or sense of family and motherland in his heart, and will become a marionette that is a tool in the hands of evil forces.\"\nAnd then there is the great modern threat against all authoritarian states.\nSecond Channel, which serves as Uzbek TV's youth outlet, cautioned in July that \"the Internet has become a tool of evil forces.\" The specific threat, the channel said on the \"Niqob\" (Mask) program, in this case was Islamic extremist groups. But broader comments such as \"destructive ideas on websites are widely promoted\" could just as easily refer to sites in Western countries.\n"}, {"score": 839.0217, "uuid": "3a3c4871-76aa-5ecf-8a87-a3e6a0a60e5c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0605wb-67-07027", "target_hostname": "www.mightyape.co.nz", "target_uri": "http://www.mightyape.co.nz/Music/R-and-B/Underground-Alt-Rap/All/", "page_rank": 1.171562e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Underground&#x2F;Alt <em>Rap</em> Music CDs - Buy Underground&#x2F;Alt <em>Rap</em> Music CDs at Mighty", "snippet": "Shot In The Nite <em>is</em> spaced-out banger beats from San Francisco\u2019s glitch duo Lazer Sword &quot;Lando Kal &amp; Low Limit&quot;, <em>which</em> fuses <em>rap</em>, electro, dubstep &amp; grime with an old soul vocal sample, sounding like Hudson Mohawke <em>or</em> Flying Lotus.", "explanation": null, "document": "1 used from $5.00 See all Marketplace listings\n20.\nBy Wiley\nWiley returns with easily his best album yet, a mix of beats and rhymes that compliment each other so well it\u2019s like seeing an old friend!

Most teams know their respective postseason fates. Many will be playing fairly meaningless games as they prep for playoffs, or try to end the season on a positive note.\nThe Pennsbury ice hockey team is a major exception to that rule. The Falcons have two games this week that are very important, both for completely different reasons.\nOn Wednesday, the Falcons will participate in their second annual Pink Out Game when they face Delran at 7:20 p.m. at Grundy Ice Arena. The game will benefit Pennsbury\u2019s Wink-4-Pink Club and all proceeds will help raise awareness for, and funds to help fight breast cancer.\n\u201cThis is the second year we\u2019ve been involved in this and it seems to have really grown in just one year,\u201d said Pennsbury coach John Bria. \u201cThe kids really, really get involved with it. They\u2019ll have pink laces, pink tape on their sticks, wear a pink jersey with a white ribbon. Delran\u2019s going to wear a white jersey with a pink ribbon.\u201d\nEntrance fee for the game will be $5. Additional fundraisers include a raffle for a Flyers basket, the Wink-4-Pink Club selling apparel, and for $20, fans can take a piece of the action home with them.\n\u201cAt the end of the game, you can actually buy one of the kids\u2019 jerseys off their backs,\u201d Bria said. \u201cThis game has been getting so much help and support from the community. With the school and everybody donating their time and efforts, it\u2019s really special.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s a big game for the kids. Everybody circles the game on the calendar. Last year, after the kids graduated, when you look at the senior bios, a lot of them said their favorite memory was this game.\u201d\nLast season, the teams received an excellent turnout from fans and community members helping to support the cause. A big crowd is expected on Wednesday as well to watch a good hockey game and support a great cause.\n\u201cThe place should be packed,\u201d Bria said. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to play in front of a packed house.\u201d\nOne day later, the Falcons return to Grundy Ice Arena for an 8:55 p.m. showdown with Council Rock North. Pennsbury sits in third place in the National Division at 8-6-3 for 19 points (14-10-3 overall). Council Rock North is 8-8-1 for 17 points (11-10-2 overall). The winner of Thursday\u2019s clash will secure third place in the division and take the automatic bid into the playoffs. The loser will earn the wildcard bid.\nDespite the massive implications of the final game of the season, Bria said the Falcons are calm, cool and collected.\n\u201cThe kids are loose, they\u2019re funny that way,\u201d Bria said. \u201cI think once we get to game time, we\u2019ll be ready. Practices the past couple weeks have been pretty smooth and we expect the same thing this week, too. We\u2019re staying focused on what we need to do, and the senior leadership takes care of that.\u201d\nThe conference rivals met for the first time this season on Dec. 23. Pennsbury took a 4-0 win in that contest, a game that was 1-0 until the third period. Bria expects this game to be much like those first two periods of the last meeting.\n\u201cCouncil Rock North has been playing much better, and we\u2019ve been decimated with injuries, but you have to expect those kinds of things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect it to be a real tough, real tight game.\u201d\nAnd while the Falcons (as well as the Indians) are playoff-bound win or lose, it\u2019s always preferable to head into the postseason on a roll.\n\u201cYou always want to control a little bit of your own destiny and at least know you finished top three,\u201d Bria said. \u201cWe want to get some momentum, get into playoffs and see what kind of damage we can do once we get there.\u201d\nCARDINALS FLY INTO SECOND \u2026 Points have been tough to come by in the American Division. Lansdale Catholic cruised to the first place in the division at 8-1 for 16 points (11-10-1 overall), leaving three teams battling for positioning.\nWith Hatboro-Horsham ineligible for postseason play, the three remaining teams in the division, Upper Dublin, Upper Moreland and Wissahickon, were guaranteed of a playoff spot.\nAs the weeks have worn on and none of those three teams have taken control, the race for playoff positioning became more and more interesting. Heading into the final two weeks, Upper Dublin had one chance to jump from fourth into second place in the division. First, it needed Wissahickon to lose its league game to Lansdale Catholic, while the Cardinals had to defeat Upper Moreland, which had defeated the Cardinals two weeks earlier. On Feb. 1, Upper Dublin handily defeated Upper Moreland, 6-2. Two days later, Wissahickon fell to LC by a 6-4 count. That set up the Feb. 10 showdown between the neighborhood rivals for second place.\nWissahickon scored first on Joey Sutow\u2019s 17th of the season, but Upper Dublin responded with four straight goals, and added three straight in the third period to roll to a 7-2 victory.\nWissahickon scored first on Joey Sutow\u2019s 17th of the season, but Upper Dublin responded with four straight goals, and added three straight in the third period to roll to a 7-2 victory. Seven different players scored for Upper Dublin and Ben Hoffmann had a goal and three assists.\nThe victory meant both Upper Dublin and Wissahickon sported identical 3-5-1 league records, and the teams went 1-1-1 against each other during the season. The tiebreaker puts Upper Dublin into second place, with Wissahickon in third. The two teams will face each other in the first round of the SHSHL Class A playoffs, while Upper Moreland will face Lansdale Catholic.\nONE MORE WEEK \u2026 On Friday, the final game for the league\u2019s SHSHL Class A and AA teams will be played. That means you\u2019ve got one more week of regular-season hockey before the playoffs begin. Just because all of the playoff berths have been claimed doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some good hockey in the final week of the season.\nPennridge at North Penn, 7:20 p.m. Feb. 15 at Hatfield Ice. While both teams are guaranteed a top-3 finish in the Continental Division, both the Rams and Knights have two games this week to decide exactly where they\u2019ll finish. The Rams are in second place at 10-3-2 (22 points), while the Knights are 9-3-3 (21 points).\nDelran at Pennsbury, 7:20 p.m. Feb. 15 at Grundy Ice Arena.

There\u2019s nothing on the line in this one. South has secured the top spot in the National Division. Souderton has earned a wildcard berth. Still, this should be a solid game.\nCentral Bucks East at North Penn, 7:20 p.m. Feb. 16 at Hatfield Ice. North Penn\u2019s second game of the week, the Knights take on an inconsistent but always dangerous Patriots team that has nothing to lose.\nCouncil Rock North at Pennsbury, 8:55 p.m. Feb. 16 at Grundy Ice Arena. Does it get better than when the last game of the season has huge playoff implications for both teams? Sometimes, the hockey gods really do get it right. The winner of this game takes the third seed from the National Conference. The loser gets a wildcard.\nCentral Bucks South at Pennridge, 9 p.m. Feb. 16 at Hatfield Ice. The Rams\u2019 second game of the week as they battle North Penn for positioning. All they\u2019ll have to do in their final game is beat the only team undefeated in SHSHL play.\nLogin to post comments\n"}, {"score": 819.23175, "uuid": "627ebc1a-04f8-53d2-acf0-b7b0c1ba95b8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1505wb-29-24567", "target_hostname": "neufutur.com", "target_uri": "http://neufutur.com/?p=4809", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Top 10 Most Depressing <em>Rap</em> Songs - |", "snippet": "All the above <em>is</em> not depressing at all, are you serious?

If you\u2019re like me, your older siblings or parents introduced you to the psychedelic sounds of classic rock like Pink Floyd or the poetic genius of Bob Dylan. But when it comes to rap, no one was schoolin\u2019 me on smooth sounds of De La Soul and I wasn\u2019t watching Grandmaster Flash on Beat Street. I\u2019ve been looking for a book to fill some gaps in my knowledge so I might gain a greater appreciation for a genre of music I spend so much time YouTube\u2019ing. Solution? The new \u201cAnthology of Rap\u201d edited by Adam Bradley and Andrew DuBois.\nAndrew DuBois is none other than a U of T prof based out of the Scarborough campus. Originally from the Southern US and armed with a PhD from Harvard he breaks down thirty years of history into an accessible book that contains nearly 300 lyrics. The book is separated into four sections: The Old School, The Golden Era, Rap Goes Mainstream, and New Millennium Rap. Although a comparable volume of lyrics are found in each section, the authors focus heavily on the early history of rap music and the influence earlier artists had on the development of the genre. In the first section, the stage is set: it\u2019s 1975 and DJ Kool Herc is spinning in the Bronx. The book is evokes strong visual images like this based on a rich historic timeline throughout making it captivating for interested parties.\nOne slight drawback to The New Millennium Rap chapter was that it felt a little lacking in terms of making the reader feel for the story during this time in raps history. This of course could just be a case of the novel stimulus. For most of us born in the 80s, we are all too familiar with current artists and their histories. Movies like Notorious let us peak into rap legends like Biggie giving us deeper understanding of the music as both a culture and art form. Nevertheless, when we have artists like Justin Bieber peddling Proactive acne cream and 50 Cent selling us our hangover remedies in the form of vitamin water, The Golden Age of Slick Rick and Run-DMC might seem more romantic.\nOverall the book is a must for any reader interested in a comprehensive but approachable guide to the evolution of a genre that has had a massive impact of global popular culture in the past thirty years. It does an elegant job of balancing an impressive anthology of lyrics with a highly engaging history of an art form. Check out the interview below with Prof. Dubois for his thoughts on new rappers, his love of poetry and oh yeah, his book.\nQ: Why did you choose to incorporate so many lyrics into the anthology rather than focusing more heavily on section introductions?\nA: We really wanted to include excerpts from cultural history, certain tools for reading the lyrics as well as excerpts from other people\u2019s critical writing and interviews that artists have done. But the main goal was to create a lyric anthology that would cover the more or less 30 plus year recorded history of the music. So it was a balancing act in terms of including too little or too much. Our original manuscript, intention, or wish list included many many more songs than we put in. At the same time we could have imagined a smaller book but we didn\u2019t feel like it would be comprehensive enough.\nQ: What do you think the history of rap in terms of its rise as an art form?\nA: The history of rap music is absolutely fascinating from the perspective of the cultural history and the rise of an art form. I\u2019m American, as you can probably tell from my accent.\nRap music is such an important American contribution. People all over the world have taken to this music that was born in a very specific time and place. Rap as an art form has grown very quickly and is important to modern American social and cultural history.\nAs a poetry critic and teacher, I\u2019m interested in poetry in all of its manifestations. But in recent years I\u2019m becoming more and more interested in popular poetry. So to find a form of poetry that speaks across all demographics and yet still maintains so much density, variety, and artistic integrity I think is pretty amazing. I would say it\u2019s the most important form of popular poetry in my lifetime.\nQ: How do you feel about the evolution of the genre in terms of its birthplace in Bronx and the political and social atmosphere at that time and how the ideals and messages that artists are rapping about has changed dramatically?\nA: I would say in the earliest stage, there was a range of messages being expressed. Yes Afrika Bombattaa had a range of political messages, but even in his music there are songs that are just good times party music. I remember the first time I heard \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d and \u201cLooking for a Perfect Beat\u201d when I was a little kid at the skating rink. For us that was something you could move around the rink to.\nThere are all kind of evolutionary movements that have been going on in the development of rap music but I wouldn\u2019t say that these are movements away from the political and towards solely commercialization. In the early days, people were recording their shows, selling them on tapes and as soon as records were being sold in 1979, there were artists selling tracks from mainly independent labels but even major labels were in the mix early on. There is a commercial aspect to that. People are listening to what\u2019s hot, trying to replicate it and put there own spin on it.\nThat aspect of commercially pushing music has a very important cultural aspect to it, that is a certain kind of cultural self-efficiency. For instance currently there is a lot of rapid commercialization in hip hop. But it seems to me that there has always been strong counter balance to that.\nQ: What do you think would be an example of a rap artist today that transcends this need to endorse products [I\u2019m looking at you vitamin water and 50cent] and the commercialization of an art form?\nA: A certain version of trying to push your product does come often times with making art. It can be done in a way that diminished the art and can be done in a way that doesn\u2019t but instead makes the art accessible so it\u2019s out there for people to hear. I think there are lots of artists that maintain artistic integrity while their music is being pushed commercially. You know somebody like Jay Electronica is someone who is operating in a way that is totally independent and yet he is going to blow up. And because of the way in the distribution process is like on the Internet lots of people have heard of him. Let\u2019s say somebody for a certain demographic is considered the hottest thing going and is not for another demographic. Take Drake for example, or even better Lil Wayne. No one could be more commercially pushed than Lil Wayne, but I love Lil Wayne. He\u2019s got a lot of artistic integrity. He\u2019s an example of someone who can operate both in a quasi-underground and mainstream artist. He\u2019s flying below the radar putting out mixtapes that only insiders would know about and at the same time putting out tracks for the mainstream. Take something like the Carter II, I mean that is an unbelievable album, not just at the level of the individual song but the total sequencing of it. So that kind of commercial impact is not always detrimental to the aesthetics. I mean sometimes it is. Sometimes one song comes out that brings an original flavor and then next you know twenty different artists starting popping up trying to do the same thing. I mean I think the kind ubiquity of auto tune is an example of that.\nQ: You\u2019ve broken down the book into four sections. In the \u201cNew Millennium Rap\u201d chapter you talk about how suddenly rap goes mainstream and its popularity became fueled by young Caucasian males and people like Eminem coming out of the woodwork. In the first section of the book \u201cThe Old School\u201d, the history is deeply attached to African American culture. Is the music now perpetuated based on different ideals by people who maybe don\u2019t understand the foundation of where it comes from?\nA: I think in terms of percentages of people that strike the listening audiences as viable artists that there may be more Caucasian rappers now than in the past. But I mean Eminem is a kind of special case really. The thing about hiphop is that to a large degree it has an internal critical mechanism whereby the culture determines what\u2019s listenable. It determines which artists have put enough work in to be part of that lineage. So a guy like Eminem couldn\u2019t be used as an example of someone who doesn\u2019t understand the history of the culture for that matter. I mean there are a lot of aspects to the culture. If the determining factor in the historical foundation of the culture is that it was made by African American people in New York. You could say that anyone who isn\u2019t African American or even not from New York can\u2019t access that culture. I mean it\u2019s not a big debate now, but earlier there was a real regional vibe. But you could also say that a guy like Eminem, with his background, could very much identify with the themes, which would be things like marginalization because of poverty or growing up in a single parent home. There are a lot of different ways to think about how an artist like Eminem could contribute to a genre that as you say comes from a very specific time and place and was made by people that are not on the surface like Eminem. But there have been rappers that have not fit into what traditionally constitutes a rapper, such as the Beastie Boys, who made some headway. The same case is often made against women rappers irrespective of their background or color. But the culture isn\u2019t static and as it changes the people who contribute to it also changes.\nQ: I was mostly interested in the early chapters because I knew less about the birth of rap and more about the last twenty years. The book focuses very heavily on the early years and the foundation of rap, why the choice to focus less on \u201cNew Millennium Rap\u201d and more on the guys who really laid the foundation of the genre.\nA: That\u2019s a good question. The disparity isn\u2019t based on actual page allocation, each of the four sections have more or less the same pages and number of lyrics. I don\u2019t think anyone else has noticed this so I\u2019m glad you mentioned it. This was very deliberate. We wanted to try to draw out more history from earlier artists that a lot of our readers might not have heard about. If we had just put the raw lyrics on the page people might start to zone out, at least I think so. So we tried to draw out some of the stories of some of the early artists and I think that explanatory material gets less verbose in chronologically because of methods of dissemination. The fact that rappers and hiphop artists are constantly in the news, magazines and are especially accessible with the internet leading to substantial exposure. So I don\u2019t sense that people now, like you, need or want to hear about the story of Jay-Z because you probably know it. Buy you may not know about Funky Four + 1 even if they\u2019re on your radar. This is also a labor of love so for me personally it was really fun. I first started listening to the music in the early 80\u2019s so it was like going back to my childhood.\nQ: What are your thoughts on new rap? Kanye West? Nicki Minaj?\nA: I love Kanye West first of all. I love anything Kayne does. I think the guy is very impressive, what can I say? I go by albums. I like the way he sequences his albums. I like the way they are coherent projects. I mean I was listening to his new album. Man I don\u2019t even remember what it\u2019s called but that one track. Track number 9.\nQ: Runaway?\nA: Yeah! I just tossed the booklet to the side, played the track over and over, until apparently I was told I that I was singing it in my sleep! Nicki Minaj from what I\u2019m hearing is doing something really interesting. She brings a very interesting kind of monstrosity to some of her manipulations of voice, which I think is both meant as an aggressive tactic but also an ironic response to some of the more aggressive posturing that might go on. So I\u2019m very interested so far. But I\u2019m listening to a lot of things these days.\nQ: Last question. You\u2019re from the south, what do you think of Yelawolf?\nA: I was reading about Yelawolf on hiphopcanada.com before I even picked up that album. I mean I thought it was pretty tight. It\u2019s interesting that the white southern rapper is in a certain sense going to operation out of strokes of let\u2019s say kind of a little rough neck from the rougher side of the track. I think that\u2019s part and parcel with certain tendencies that you see in even southern literature. I mean I think he\u2019s got something going on but I\u2019ll tell ya there are some guys from Huntsville Alabama called the Paper Route Gangstaz that are pretty good. They\u2019ve got an EP called \u201cFear and Loathing in Hunts Vegas\u201d with a song that uses a real nice sample from Slick Ricks \u201cLa Di Da Di.\u201d\nAdditional Info\n"}, {"score": 812.6968, "uuid": "ec76011a-1c57-53d2-8e59-29990c236ef5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000tw-25-08949", "target_hostname": "news.sciencemag.org", "target_uri": "http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/01/rap-music-powers-health-device.html", "page_rank": 1.1861294e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Rap</em> Music Powers Health Device - ScienceNOW", "snippet": "&quot;One [would need] to hermetically seal the device in these cases,&quot; he says, &quot;<em>which</em> <em>is</em> easily doable by sealing the glass capsule with a laser.&quot;", "explanation": null, "document": "Previous Article Next Article\nRappers could one day be part of a health-monitoring regimen\u2014or at least their music could be. A prototype device that can track blood pressure in damaged blood vessels or monitor the bladders of incontinent patients draws its power from the low-frequency vibrations in rap music rather than from batteries.\nFeel the beat. Researchers hold their test balloon up to speakers playing different types of music while monitoring the signal given off by the sensor inside.\nCredit: Albert Kim and Seung Hyun Song\nMore Science News Videos\nIn a paper presented 30 January at the 25th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems in Paris, researchers described the guts of their 2-centimeter-long device. A small lever, which converts vibrations into electricity, powers a sensor that takes readings and transmits data. The lever, made of a thin layer of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) coating a glass core, responds to vibrations at 435 hertz.\nThis lever is connected to a capacitor, which stores the electricity until the vibrations stop. Once they stop, the released energy triggers a pressure sensor to take a reading and then transmit its data via a radio signal to a receiver. Patients with this implant could conceivably monitor their blood pressure by playing a couple of minutes of J. Cole's latest to charge the sensor, and then have it send the data to a receiver. And having a self-contained device to control conditions such as incontinence would be more convenient than having to insert a catheter or rush to the restroom all the time.\n\"Nothing happens when you stop playing music,\" says electrical engineer Babak Ziaie of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The implant works only when exposed to specific frequencies. And because of design constraints that dictate the length of the vibrating lever, those frequencies are most often found in rap music.\nNot a fan of hip hop? No problem, Ziaie says. It wouldn't be hard to change the lever's length or thickness to respond to different musical preferences. \"I like listening to classical music,\" he says, but his graduate student Albert Kim, who worked on the device, prefers rap. Changing the lever's dimensions changes the frequency it responds to, so Tchaikovsky buffs aren't stuck listening to Jay-Z.\nThe researchers tested their device in a water balloon to approximate human soft tissue. When they pressed the balloon to a metal plate attached to speakers (to ensure even sound distribution) playing rap music, their receiver picked up signals from the sensor 10 to 15 centimeters inside. That means that you can power a sensor deep in the body, Ziaie says.\nThe thumping bass in Rihanna's or Flo Rida's latest hits reaches these frequencies more often than other musical styles tested, including blues, jazz, and rock, according to Ziaie.\nCurrent medical devices run on batteries that need to be changed periodically or rely on precise alignment of the sensor and the receiver to work properly, Ziaie says. The new device addresses those issues because music can power the sensor via the vibrating lever, and a receiver does not have to be perfectly positioned relative to the new sensor to achieve an accurate reading. As long as it can pick up a radio frequency, the receiver can get the data.\nThe music part sounds cool, writes Robert Langer, a biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, who was not involved with this research. But he cautions that some of the materials used in this device, such as PZT, merit careful packaging to ensure they don't leach out of their container.\n\"If you have lead in a biological system, it's a big concern,\" says Zhong Lin Wang, a nanotechnology and materials science engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, who also was not involved with this research. Wang thinks another material, such as zinc oxide, would be much better to use as a lever. Zinc oxide is biocompatible and much cheaper to fabricate than PZT, he says.\nZiaie writes that they used PZT in their prototype because it was commercially available and it works well. And he agrees that the lead can be an issue for long-term implants. \"One [would need] to hermetically seal the device in these cases,\" he says, \"which is easily doable by sealing the glass capsule with a laser.\"\nAfter some modifications to make the device smaller and safe for use in the body, Ziaie says his team plans on testing it by monitoring bladders in pigs.\nFollow ScienceNOW on Facebook and Twitter\nPosted in\n"}, {"score": 812.6719, "uuid": "77f2cf66-d5e5-501d-9364-b8a8a357ca8c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1118wb-59-11359", "target_hostname": "www.westernbassclub.com", "target_uri": "http://www.westernbassclub.com/Risto.html", "page_rank": 1.2038343e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "The Western Bass Club - Risto <em>Rap</em>", "snippet": "By adding a ultra sharp, <em>better</em> holding hook to your crank, you are now prepared to go out there and take advantage of the fish attracting qualities of the Risto <em>Rap</em>.

May he rest in peace.\nAccording to the Chinese Calendar, 1997 was the \"Year of the Ox.\" But according to my fishing diary, last year will be remembered as the \"Year of the Crank\". Most of us who spend a lot of time on the water are not strangers to crankbaits, and yet the typical bass angler attributes the majority of their \"year-round\" success to plastics and spinnerbaits. Last spring I discovered a new crankbait that should change that balance dramatically: Normark's new Risto Rap.\nAny bass angler who has ever used a Rapala Minnow, Rattlin' Rap, Shad Rap, or Husky Jerk, knows that Normark designs baits to catch more then just the eye of the fisherman; they produce fish! So when asked last spring to \"field test\" these newest medium and deep-diving crankbaits, I chose Lake Washington, WA as the place to put the Risto Raps to the test.\nLake Washington tends to have it's fair share of wind and one of the frustrating traits of many crankbaits is that they are often too light to cast in breezy conditions. The weight and aerodynamics of the Risto Rap allows casting control, reduced back lashing, and more distance which allows the lure to get down and stay in the strike zone longer. (And it catches fish!)\nAn hour or two of throwing a medium or deep diving crankbait with a large bill, often has anglers entertaining the idea of wrist transplants. But I was delighted to discover how little water resistance there is due to the body and lip design. Couple this with the fact that every Rapala is hand tuned and tank tested, and you have a crankbait that gets down quickly and is comfortable to fish all day long. (And it catches fish!)\nReplacing the monofilament line with \"Fireline\", a thin-diameter fiber line, gives the crankbait extra depth. This is important because the more you make it bounce on the bottom, the more reaction strikes you will encounter. Time and time again, smallmouths lethargically watched my plastic baits slither by, but only moments later they nailed the Risto Rap as it careened off rocks and bottom debris. (Believe me, it catches fish!)\nGetting reaction bites is great, but only if you can keep the fish on. You will have an added advantage if you replace the factory hooks with the New EWG Extra Wide Gap treble hooks by GAMAKATSU. By adding a ultra sharp, better holding hook to your crank, you are now prepared to go out there and take advantage of the fish attracting qualities of the Risto Rap. (Which, by the way, really catches fish!)\nFrom early spring to late fall, the Risto Rap has consistently produced quality fish on Lake Washington. It has become such a confidence lure, that my crankbait rod is increasingly becoming the first one I reach for in the morning. Field testing in 1997 allowed me a jump on most anglers, but put some of these new Risto Raps in your tackle box, and this year may be your \"Year of the Crank\".\n"}], [{"score": 809.9115, "uuid": "4cb51342-1c01-5219-847d-12ca23e24854", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0612wb-05-07585", "target_hostname": "www.reverbnation.com", "target_uri": "http://www.reverbnation.com/goonzlivesavage", "page_rank": 1.224523e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Young Diesel | Little <em>Rock</em>, AR | Hip Hop &#x2F; <em>Rap</em> | Music, Lyrics, Songs,", "snippet": "Young Diesel, PaNuke and Yung Foreign make up the multitalented <em>rap</em> group Goonz Live $avage.

The competition isn\u2019t even close in terms of sales. Bun B\u2019s TrillOG debuted in the Number 4 spot and Rick Ross\u2019 Teflon Don has slipped to sixth after failing to unseat Eminem.\nOther Hot Rappers Are Still Charting\nWhile it\u2019s clear that fans are ready for \u2018Recovery,\u2019 rap music has enjoyed a number of other album debuts this summer, with albums from other stars including Rick Ross, Drake, Usher, The Black Eyed Peas, B.o.B, Big Boi and Alicia Keys, just to name a few. L\u2019il Wayne also put out an album as did Nicki Minaj. Curren$y\u2019s Def Jam debut, entitled Pilot Talk, (which was produced mostly by Ski Beatz) received high marks from the critics for its mellow, melodious sounds and hardcore, traditional Southern rap leanings.\nThose who\u2019ve said that rap is dead surely didn\u2019t foresee a summer like 2010. The rap music genre has undergone its share of growing pains and is now branching out to co-mingle with other music genres, like pop, rock, hard rock, bluegrass, reggae, and gospel. Some rap music artists are returning to their \u201cclassic\u201d roots, while others are breaking new ground, and inching rap music forward as a force that will impact music for generations to come.\nThis summer is also proof that new artists are moving onto the center stage of the rap music genre. New artists are flocking to rap music, and the ability to self-produce tracks, mixtapes and even full-length albums is providing exposure to artists who might otherwise never have been seen.\nThe tools to self-produce music are available, easy-to-use and designed to help new music producers avoid the pitfalls of copyright and music royalty issues. Music sampling has always been a big part of the rap music scene and new producers (and even some experienced ones) can get themselves into trouble by illegally sampling the work of others.\nWith products like Sonic Producer, a rap music artist has access to a library of thousands of free samples that are all royalty-free. With this software, users can mix their own music, export to MP3 or other musical format and begin distribution right away.

The Brother\u2019s Gotta Rap!\nCharles Hughes writes:\nIt\u2019s been a damn good year for OutKast\u2019s Andre 3000, and \u2013 frankly \u2013 he needed it.\u00a0 This appears counterintuitive at first, given that 2006 saw Andre (real name Andre Benjamin) and his partner Big Boi (nee Antwan Patton) release Idlewild, perhaps the most inventive and daring album of a very inventive and daring career, and the accompanying film that starred the duo as a pair of funky-fresh musicians whose 1930s juke joint helped Andre and Big Boi draw connections between past and present eras of African-American culture even more clearly.\u00a0 It seemed a fine way to capitalize on the monumental popularity of their previous record, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, whose dual smashes \u2013 Andre\u2019s \u201cHey Ya\u201d and Big Boi\u2019s \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d \u2013 propelled them to a level of success that, even for hardcore \u2018Kast-heads like myself, was unforeseeable.\nUnfortunately, that level of success proved unrepeatable.\u00a0 The album fizzled commercially, although I still argue for its merits as a work of creative experimentation that contains much more compelling music than the negative reaction would have you believe.\u00a0 The Idlewild movie proved even more undistinguished, disappearing from theatres in just a few weeks.\u00a0 Even considering the complicated content, it was a strangely precipitous drop for both releases, and \u2013 regardless of whether or not Idlewild deserved such ignominy \u2013 it definitely signaled that some sort of regrouping (both literally and figuratively) was in order for pop music\u2019s most exciting creative force.\nAs OutKast hit these unforeseen icebergs, the widening creative gulf between the two halves of OutKast became more and more obvious.\u00a0 Now, the difference between the two men\u2019s creative approaches has been overstated, and the \u201cAquemini\u201d magic of the partnership still burns brightly, but there\u2019s no denying that Andre Benjamin and Antwan Patton are walking down different paths, a separation only symbolized by their divided double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, the success of which couldn\u2019t mask the fact that Big Boi\u2019s Speakerboxxx and Andre\u2019s Love Below exist almost entirely independent of each other.\u00a0 On that effort, and on Idlewild, Big Boi has only cemented his reputation as one of hip-hop\u2019s most talented performers and producers, a hip-hop Ellington who packs his tracks with multiple layers of musical complexity and texture.\nMeanwhile, Andre has traveled a more esoteric path, parlaying his flower-funk image and increasing interest in rock and R&B vocal styles into a series of recordings that \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 seem intent on destroying genre categorization, or at least exposing its limits.\u00a0 Whether the pop rush of \u201cHey Ya\u201d or the juke stomp of \u201cIdlewild Blue,\u201d Andre Benjamin has aimed his bop gun on a constellation of pop and soul styles that, for a moment, helped him conquer the world.\u00a0 But this came with costs: He temporarily wore the dreaded crown of \u201cWhite People\u2019s Favorite Rapper,\u201d and \u2013 like most who actively seek to bust boundaries \u2013 he\u2019s made the occasional misstep (you may remember the Indians-from-space motif he chose for his Grammy Awards performance of \u201cHey Ya,\u201d which tainted a moment that should\u2019ve been a triumphant coming-out party).\nMost importantly, Andre 3000\u2019s almost entirely stopped rhyming.\u00a0 Where Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Patton once bounced off each other\u2019s feverish flow into flights of lyrical fancy that seemed in a state of continual ascension, Andre now left almost all of the rap duties to his superbly talented partner, choosing to sing on practically all of his offerings to The Love Below and Idlewild.\u00a0 Now, this worked about as well as could be hoped: It served to even further emphasize Big Boi\u2019s remarkable talent, it made the rare Andre verses even more precious than they had been before, and \u2013 as we all learned so beautifully with \u201cHey Ya\u201d \u2013 Andre proved to be a perfectly suitable rock-n-soul star.\u00a0 It was nice, but it started to make less and less sense to those of us who remember the time when Southerplayalisticcadillacmuzik first announced the arrival of the two young princes (and maybe young Princes) into the hip-hop world, or the way that Andre\u2019s deep, playful flow bounced across \u201cElevators,\u201d \u201cRosa Parks\u201d or \u201cMs. Jackson,\u201d perfectly complementing the hooks\u2019 infectious melodies.\nMaybe Andre Benjamin himself felt, or at least understood, some of this. This year, Andre 3000 has returned to the rhyme with an astonishing slew of 16-bar lyrical symphonies, flawless performances that should be more than enough to remind any skeptic or hater that he\u2019s still one of the very best in the game.\u00a0 However, these verses haven\u2019t been on a new OutKast record, or the long-rumored Andre solo project. Instead, they\u2019ve been sprinkled across cuts by a variety of hip-hop\u2019s top artists, often as part of \u201cremix\u201d versions that allow the hip-hop nation to conference, converse and cut heads.\nThese verses, collected on the wondrous mixtape Whole Foods, include appearances on remixes of hits by UNK (\u201cWalk It Out\u201d), Rich Boy (\u201cThrow Some Ds\u201d) and Lloyd (\u201cYou), plus his contribution to the original version of tunes by Devin The Dude (\u201cWhat A Job\u201d), and the Mount Rushmore that is the stylish OutKast/UGK collaboration \u201cInternational Players Anthem.\u201d They all reveal one thing: As wildly imaginative, and occasionally frustrating, as Andre 3000\u2019s creative journey has been, one thing that is absolutely unimpeachable is his mic skills, which remain as gritty, fresh and exciting as ever.\nAlthough all of these tracks deservedly have their partisans, I\u2019m a particular fan of Andre\u2019s verse on \u201cWhat A Job,\u201d which accomplishes a multitude of miracles: He seamlessly employs at least three different flows over the course of the verse, for example, and he constructs a coherent, essay-like 16 bars that manage to come off as profound rather than pretentious, significant but not self-important.\u00a0 Most miraculous of all, he offers a criticism of \u201cillegal\u201d downloading that\u2019s lucid, affecting and fair-minded.\u00a0 Like all of the aforementioned appearances, it\u2019s a veritable concerto.\nBut wait a minute: Remember when I said that these skill-shredding spits do not appear on an Andre 3000 solo record?\u00a0 I lied\u2026sort of.\u00a0 Yes, none of the verses that have remade his reputation among hip-hop heads have shown up on an official Andre 3000 release.\u00a0 Still, history will show that Andre Benjamin did \u2013 in fact \u2013 put out a solo effort in 2007: the soundtrack to his idiosyncratic cartoon show Class Of 3000, which has received shockingly little attention, even in hip-hop circles.\u00a0 (In fact, each of his remix appearances has received more press.)\u00a0 Despite this lack of publicity, and the fact that no one will mistake this sunny collection of often kid-centric material to be Andre\u2019s latest masterpiece, there is more than enough interesting music on Class Of 3000 to justify its consideration by those who enjoy any facets of Andre Benjamin\u2019s wide-ranging talents.\nAlthough some of the tracks certainly qualify as side-project trifles, a few of them are something like remarkable.\u00a0 \u201cThrowdown\u201d is a pulsating celebration of musical expression, complete with chorus of kids rpping their respective instruments. (It turns out that Mama don\u2019t allow no turntablism \u2018round here\u2026but we\u2019ve never cared what Mama don\u2019t allow, have we?) Then there\u2019s \u201cWe Want Your Soul,\u201d a shockingly dark deconstruction that wouldn\u2019t have sounded out of place amid the experimentation of The Love Below.\u00a0 It\u2019s an unsettling moment on a mostly joyous collection, but even \u201cWe Want Your Soul\u201d includes Andre\u2019s breathless shout-outs of \u201cGet em, shorty\u201d in the bridge and two main verses that could easily be elements of Andre\u2019s next show-stopping guest spot.\nLike any great artist, it remains to be seen where Andre 3000 will go next.\u00a0 It\u2019s by no means for certain that OutKast will remain together, and \u2013 whether or not they do \u2013 I find it doubtful that Andre will continue to keep pace with the innovative mastery of Big Boi, whose streak keeps getting hotter.\u00a0 But all that\u2019s in the future, and \u2013 as OutKast themselves taught us, on \u201cAquemini\u201d \u2013 nothin\u2019 is for sure, nothin\u2019 is for certain, nothin\u2019 lasts forever.\u00a0 For right now, it\u2019s enough for me to conclude that Andre 3000 seems to be in a very good place, balancing his boundless imagination with a firm grounding in the skillz that brought him such fame and glory.\u00a0 Trust me, my friends: If he\u2019s in a good place, then it is our right, our obligation and our infinite pleasure to follow him.\nAndre Benjamin \u201cThrowdown\u201d and \u201cWe Want Your Soul\u201d from Class of 3000: Music Volume 1 (La Face, 2007)\nThis entry was posted on Monday, August 13th, 2007 at 3:18 pm and is filed under Uncategorized .

Which will have an effect on what you like on a bigger or smaller boat, which many over look. You ask why does this matter. Well a 22' will troll at a smother rate than say a 16' boat. Which all has an effect on how that same lure will run.\nRe: What Are better Single Or Treble Hooks ?\nReply #1 - Nov 22nd, 2009 at 11:06am\nI run single siwash hooks when ever possible. Rapalas not so much due to balance problems. Siwash hooks are generally easier for a boat side release. They are much easier for a net release even with a rubber or hookless net. Since I plan on releasing every fish that isn't a Kokanee in fresh water, the release is my main concern. For Kokanee, single Gami hooks in tandem rock!\nAfter catching hundreds or more fish a year on single hooks, I don't feel mortality is an issue unless you are using spoons for Steelies and Salmon.

Sometimes they hit hard on the front hook of a lure, and will be gone just as quick if they don't get hooked. In this case trebles are a must. Other times they'll tail nip the lure, and a single, or a couple singles can be good. Generally, I stay with trebles unless I'm having a hard time releasing fish.\nHere's a fish that very artfully hung himself in the line without being hooked at all!\nIf you think this post is off topic, just start a new thread to continue your topic!\nIP Logged\nRe: What Are better Single Or Treble Hooks ?\nReply #4 - Nov 22nd, 2009 at 10:10pm\nI have a question, a bit off topic but, I fish pretty much with 6lb line all the time with a BB snapswivwl for quick changes. Why should I run a 6lb leader to my Needlefish or other spoons? I don't when I fish the Rapalas, or Dodgers and others. I was just wanting others thoughts on this. I don't know why all of a sudden I thought of this I have been using 6lb. leaders for years just because. Are leaders really needed when you use the same size main line?

I just changed all my trout reels over to 6# Florocarbon no need for leaders.\u00a0 Most lures run fine with a swivel.\nAs for the hook question I run single hooks when I can mostly because it is so much easier to deal with a hooked fish when you have single hooks. I have had plenty of treble hooks in my fingers over the years.\nWoody\nFishing is my way of life!\nPosts: 273\nRe: What Are better Single Or Treble Hooks ?\nReply #6 - Nov 23rd, 2009 at 12:04am\nI fish out of a 12'er, 18.5'er and a 22'er a lot! The 12' 50% 18.5 30% and the 22' 20% of the time and boat size and how my lures work have never been a problem for me. Not saying it's not a factor just most people will never be able to tell something like that.\nI use both types of hook all the time. It all depends on what im fishing for and how im fishing it. ie. a single hook will not work alone on a Rogue spinner or most stick baits. Or fly fishing with trebles for trout.

In shapeless T-shirts, baggy pants and baseball caps turned backward, Gazza , Nehon , Zaion.e and Dr. Snot would have passed unnoticed at any American hip-hop gathering. Except this wasn't New York (or Los Angeles) but a small market town 30 miles south of Florence, better known for its 18th-century churches (one with a reliquary said to contain the sacred milk of the Virgin Mary) and its temples to consumerism (a Prada outlet) than for its breakbeats.\nThey had come to take part in a three-day conference on hip-hop from the Italian diaspora, organized by Joseph Sciorra of the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute at Queens College. Italian rappers and those of Italian origin from around the world met to discuss and debate the finer points of their art, their concerns and aspirations.\nThough the hip-hop community of Montevarchi and nearby Terranuova Bracciolini is tiny -- Dr. Snot (Beniamino Brogi), a 17-year-old local M.C., says it numbers about nine people -- the town was in many ways an ideal site for the conference. For Montevarchi is home to Libero Vietti , one of the few remaining poets of ottava rima, a 13th-century form in which stanzas have 8 lines of 11 syllables in a rhyme scheme of abababcc. Ottava rima is the standard form for epic and narrative verse in Italy (Boccaccio, Ludovico, Ariosto and Torquato Tasso) and has also been used in competitions. In its competitive form, in which two poets improvise verses selected by the public, some argue it is a sort of precursor of rap.\n\"This is the land of the ottava rima, and this is something you should think about,\" Lorenzo Brusci , an organizer of the conference, told an audience of about 50 on the first day. \"It's a form that depends on rhythm and texts where you can go for hours improvising rhymes. Try to see how the technique works.\"\nOttava rima is a highly polished and structured form that, in its present version, sounds more like a modulated singsong than a rap. But the idea that a tradition with roots in medieval Tuscany relates to a genre rooted in modern New York throws into relief an essential element of Italian rap: as a re-examination of local oral traditions, it has revived the use of dialects in music. Indeed, Italy's vibrant hip-hop scene is less a confirmation of the supremacy of American exports than proof of the popularity of homegrown offerings.\nSince their earliest days in the 1970's, hip-hop culture and rap music have built up a global following. Today it is possible to turn on the radio just about anywhere in the world -- TransRap , the \"home of global hip-hop,\" provides information on the music in 167 countries on its Web site -- to hear Hindi rap, Japanese rap or Cherokee rap. There's even a hip-hop band, Nuuk Posse, which raps in Inuit.\nThe earliest Italian rap, which developed throughout the 1980's, was for the most part a direct emulation of what was happening in the Bronx. \"Most of us, when we started, imitated Americans and we all rapped in English,\" acknowledged Ice One (Sebastiano Ruocco), one of the most respected Italian rappers and the producer of many hip-hop groups. \"Then came a sort of Italianese, an imitation of English, that modified the words. But then we became aware of our own language. And we began to understand Italian sounds.\"\nThe repudiation of English as rap's lingua franca began about 10 years ago as the mostly underground Italian hip-hop scene developed in distinct and isolated communities. In this context, it was natural for dialects, which had not been used in popular music for years, to be embraced in many areas, especially in the South. Nearly 50 percent of all Italians still speak in dialect, at least within the family, and the musicality of most dialects adapted well to the rhyme and cadence of rap.\n\"We want to speak to young people, and rap is the most direct way of getting to them,\" said Polo (Alberto Cretara), the 28-year-old M.C. of La Famiglia , a Neapolitan hip-hop group. \"Neapolitan is what I speak every day, and I rap about everyday things. Our songs present our reality; we aren't trying to be American.\"\nAt first, Italian rappers mostly addressed contemporary social issues like the Mafia, government corruption (the rise of hip-hop coincided with the fall of the ruling party that had governed Italy for nearly 50 years), immigration, heroin addiction, homelessness and the high unemployment rates in the South. The militancy of the songs varied, finding hard-core spokesmen in the so-called \"centri sociali,\" political aggregations of squatters occupying derelict buildings throughout Italy. Hip-hop groups with battle-cry names like Assalti Frontali (Frontal Attack) and AK 47 dominated that scene, which competed with an even more underground movement that chose to follow a less political, more stylistic, path.\nPhotographer: James Hill\nSha-One (Paolo Romano) and Polo (Alberto Cretara) of the Italian rap group La Famiglia performing in the Tuscan town of Terranuova, Italy, in June.\nBut with few exceptions, the political activism has been short lived. Goffredo Plastino, who teaches ethno-musicology at the University of Bari, argues that the novelty of Italian hip-hop is that it has no ties to Italian musicality and the tradition of the canzone italiana (Italian song), whose mellifluous lyricism easily lends itself to love songs. He contends, however, that as Italian rap broadened its appeal to become increasingly profitable, social protest was progressively abandoned in favor of more conventional subjects, like love. It was an indication that even hip-hop cannot resist the intrusion of Italian melody.\n\"The reality is that the Italian music industry pushes everyone in one direction until you get the same formula as the Italian song,\" Mr. Plastino said. \"As it becomes more Italian, rap will be finished.\"\nSuch a fate is unlikely as long as rappers continue to investigate their deeply rooted musical traditions. \"Italian rock, which dominated the 1970's and 80's, was an ugly copy of American rock,\" said Pierfrancesco Pacoda, a hip-hop producer and the author of two books on Italian rap. \"While in hip-hop, Italy rediscovered its own originality.\"\nIn the 1993 song \"Fight da Faida\" (\"Fight the Feud\"), Frankie Hi Nrg MC (Francesco di Gesu), one of the country's best-selling hip-hop artists, decried the Mafia's stranglehold over southern Italy. \"It's the eve of a revolution against the voice of the Godfather,\" he raps. \"But today Don Vito Corleone is much closer. He is seated in Parliament.\" The song ends with an 18th-century Sicilian filastrocca (nonsense rhyme) sung by Frankie's cousin, Vabbina La Bruna, whose quick-fire staccato delivery of the filastrocca easily fits with Frankie's rap.\n\"I used to sing it with my friends when we were children,\" he said. \"Just listen to the meter, to the rhythm of the filastrocca; it sounds just like a rap. I learned it from my grandmother. It was the first rap I ever heard; I was 5.\"\nSud Sound System , a group from the Salentine peninsula in Apulia, plays a reggae-inflected rap hybrid known as \"tarantamuffin.\" It is a music that draws on an old local tradition in which musicians once performed songs to heal those who had been bitten by tranatulas. The rhythm of this healing music, also known as pizzica, passes like an undercurrent through the songs of the Sud Sound System.\nSha-One (Paolo Romano), another of La Famiglia M.C.'s, says his group has absorbed many elements of Neapolitan culture, in particular the songs of the musicians, known as posteggiatori, who traveled from town to town spreading different words and idioms. In the song \"Odyssey\" he mentions the siren Parthenope, whose name is linked to the mythological origins of Naples. \"I sing you this sonnet that is taken from the portrait of a goddess,\" he raps. \"You have to believe me Parthenope is more beautiful than Venus.\"\nHe also points to the animated gestures of the Neapolitan comic Tot\u00f2 (Antonio de Curtis), who died in 1967 but is still celebrated as the archetype of southern Italian comedy. \"Just watch an American rapper and how he moves onstage,\" he said, \"and tell me if he doesn't look Neapolitan.\"\nThe hip-hop scene in Montevarchi, as well as that of most of Tuscany, is perhaps less lively than that of Naples or the rest of Italy. Still, Tuscany is a natural cradle for rap, as competitions in ottava rim depend on the same skills of improvisation and verbal dexterity that mark a good rapper. Ottava rima competitions have taken place since the 18th century, and until the late 1970's there were few Tuscan town festivities that did not include them. The Italian actor Roberto Benigni mastered the technique as a teenager. Yet today the practice has almost disappeared and is being kept alive by a handful of poets like Mr. Vietti.\nIn his red T-shirt and blue Nike baseball cap, Mr. Vietti, 74, could pass for a rapper (at least from the back), though he concedes that he knows little about the genre. He is more concerned with the disappearance of the ottava rima competitions, which he says is a result of rural flight and an increased dependence on television. Nonetheless, he says he would be more than willing to teach a youngster the tricks of his trade.\n\"I can't believe that in the year 2000, there isn't someone from around here with the brains and the gift of nature needed to improvise,\" he said, shaking his head. \"They can rap, but I guess if a young person doesn't hear the ottava rima canto, they'll never learn to improvise it.\"\nGazza (Daniel Zaganelli), 17, an M.C. from Montevarchi, acknowledges that he has never seen an ottava rima competition. \"Sure, we shouldn't ignore our tradition,\" he said. \"It was a good thing that already existed here, but we're too young to know about it and, besides, it's different from what we do.\"\nElisabetta Povoledo is a researcher in the Rome bureau of The New York Times who writes about Italian culture.\n"}, {"score": 801.6359, "uuid": "666702cd-6ee6-588f-9187-0253573c2572", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0512wb-45-11947", "target_hostname": "www.parisdailyphoto.com", "target_uri": "http://www.parisdailyphoto.com/2008/04/rap-at-opera.html", "page_rank": 1.2031803e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "ParisDailyPhoto: <em>Rap</em> at the Opera!", "snippet": "This <em>Rap</em> singer, DIAM, <em>is</em> popular in Paris right now -- I think she <em>is</em> adorable.

But right after watching several movies of both Jimi and Mick in concert, here's why I would do it:\nThe word genius is highly overused and it is generally applied to people who are extremely talented.\nI don't agree with the dictionary when it equates genius with \"exceptional intelligence\", and what I believe the word genius is supposed to refer to is an individual who creates something that is new, and not only new, but significantly new, important, and relatively a milestone in human development.\nI call Albert Einstein the premier genius of the human race because the Theory of Relativity was a giant jump in the understanding of the way our universe operates and to this day, few men and women actually comprehend anything other than the bomb part.\nJimi Hendrix was the genius of rock and roll since he was the only one who invented something new. It's virtually impossible to do anything that's really new in the field of music because there are actually only eight notes within the Western scale so in a sense, all music is derivative.\nBut Jimi invented guitar feedback and no one before Jimi even thought about it. And Jimi took his invention one step farther. Until Jimi came along, all music since the time of Mozart and Beethoven has been built on chord structure and rock and roll music uses very simple chord structure.\nJimi truly used feedback alone to construct song structure in some, but not all of his songs (Third Stone From the Sun). To this day, nobody has been able to do what Jimi did. In fact, Jeff Beck bought Jimi's strat at an auction and even the super talented Jeff admitted that he cannot get the identical sounds out of the very same guitar as Jimi.\nWith all due respect to Mick, he's a brilliant performer and one of the all time great rock and roll songwriters, but he's not actually a brilliant musician because he only plays rhythm guitar.\nI believe Mick would agree with me about Jimi being a genius guitar player for the reason that Mick was one of the first ones to uncover Jimi when The Experience made their debut in the clubs of London.\nAlong with John Lennon, Mick spread the word to other British musicians about the new nova in the rock and roll sky.\nListen to this well-known rock music artist as well as the latest hard rock artists influenced by the great Jimi Hendrix.

Give it a quick read. I\u2019m quoted in it.\nFor those of you who are not familiar with them, they are small stones that you can purchase, keep\u00a0in your freezer, and put in your whisky instead of ice. The idea here is that you can cool your whisky without watering it down.\nI was interviewed by the author twice before the piece was published, and think she did a good job in the article conveying\u00a0my general opinion of them: I see very little use for them in my whisky-drinking life. I own some because I was sent samples to review. For the most part, they just take up space in my freezer next to whatever that is in the Ziploc bag with freezer burns all over it that my wife put in there last year.\nMost people I know who are \u201centhusiasts\u201d drink their whisky neat or with a splash of water at room temperature. And, as I note in the article, my friends who are not serious whisky drinkers (like my fishing buddies who drink bourbon and ginger ale on the rocks) have never complained to me about the ice watering down their drink. (It\u2019s probably because\u00a0their drinks don\u2019t last long enough for melting ice to become a concern\u2026)\nPlus, there\u2019s the whole logistical and sanitary issue with whiskey stones. You have to have them handy, in a freezer nearby, to use them. (Try asking for them\u00a0with your drink order the next time you go out to a bar or restaurant and see what response you get from your server.)\nThe few times I have tried them, they became a nuisance at some point. They weigh down my drink, and I am stuck with them when I\u2019m done with it. Then I have to wash them, dry them (heaven forbid any\u00a0ice forms on them, right?), and put them back in the cute little bag they came in before throwing them back in my freezer.\nTo be fair, I really do see one situation where they would be useful. I mentioned this during the interview, but it was not included due to space constraints. I keep most of my whiskies in a bar in my house here in Pennsylvania. In the summer, the house is air-conditioned, so my bottles never get warmer than the temperature at which I prefer to drink my whisky. But, I have a vacation home at the New Jersey shore and we often keep the windows open and forgo the A/C to welcome in the lovely sea breezes. But, my bottles of whisky sometimes get a few degrees warmer than I would like and I find myself wanting to cool my whisky down a bit. I suspect many of you have similar situations, depending on where you live and if you have A/C or not.\nEven so, I have several options available to me that are very convenient and do not require the expense and hassle of whisky stones. What I normally do is just add a little cold water or a small ice cube to bring my whisky down a few degrees. I often drink cask-strength whisky and would be adding some water anyway. Even in the times when I don\u2019t want any water or ice in my whisky, in a pinch I can simply keep some glasses in the fridge or stick my glass in the freezer for a minute or two, which will cool my whisky down shortly after I pour it in the glass.\nI guess the point I am trying to make is: who are the tens (hundreds?) of thousands of people buying these? If you\u2019re using them on a regular basis, please chime in here. I\u2019m keeping an open mind. I am all for progress and buying new things that will make my life better. (Our house has iPhones and iPads with lots of cool apps, for example).\u00a0If I can help whisky stone producers sell more product,\u00a0make more money, and at the same time making whisky-drinkers (and therefore whisky producers) happier, then I am all for it.\nP.S. Just after I published this post, I was coincidentally sent an email promo for something called the \u201cInstant Wine Chiller\u201d which you can find here . They say it also works for vodka, tequila, etc. You put it on the end of the bottle and it cools the beverage as it flows out of the bottle before going into the glass. I don\u2019t know anything more about it or how well it work, but it looks like another alternative to putting stones in your whisky.\n"}], [{"score": 787.37115, "uuid": "580ff27e-8d12-5364-be31-5590d823109e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-26-19803", "target_hostname": "www.reverbnation.com", "target_uri": "http://www.reverbnation.com/brokenlanguage", "page_rank": 1.2652059e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Broken Language | Bailey, CO | <em>Rap</em> &#x2F; Cannibal <em>Rap</em> &#x2F; unheard | Music, Lyrics", "snippet": "Global Chart Toppers Local Chart Toppers Trending Artists Alt&#x2F;<em>Rock</em>&#x2F;Indies Electro&#x2F;Pop&#x2F;Dance HipHop&#x2F;<em>Rap</em>&#x2F;R&amp;B Featured Artists My Favorites Custom Channel See how far the rabbit hole goes, you never know where you&#x27;ll end up <em>or</em> what new music you&#x27;ll discover.", "explanation": null, "document": "What's This?

That comes as no big surprise, given the rap beats the rapper laid down on Relapse, Recovery and his latest work with Bad Meets Evil. The only contenders to the throne were rappers who had released at least one solo album between 2009 and mid-2011.\nNumbers Game\nBetween his 7.5 million album sales, his number one rank on Twitter in terms of followers, more than 40 million fans on Facebook and more than 1 billion hits on YouTube, it should come as no surprise that Eminem is on top of the rap heap. No other rapper comes close to those numbers, but the love of one\u2019s fans doesn\u2019t always translate into financial success.\nNot to say that Eminem isn\u2019t very well off \u2013 he is. But there are other rappers who don\u2019t rap quite as much who end up making more money than him, according to Forbes Magazine. In fact, the King Of Hip Hop found himself in a 3-way for 14th place, along with 50 Cent and Young Jeezy. How does that happen? While other rappers make music, more of their earnings come from sponsorships, product endorsements and production deals than from rap music. For Slim Shady, the money comes from the music and the fans love him for it.\nEminem\u2019s income may get a bump from the $1M+ Chrysler commercial he shot for the Super Bowl, and the deal with Lipton Brisk iced tea, but don\u2019t expect a lot of merchandizing deals from Slim just yet. At 38, he still believes he\u2019s got a lot of rap beats to lay down before he assumes other roles in the music business.\nEven though Eminem has a significant lead on other rappers in terms of sales and fans, there\u2019s still plenty of room for new rappers in today\u2019s rap and hip hop music scene. The art form has spent nearly 30 years building a diverse fan base, and rap has been used successfully as a way to reach out to a broad audience.\nThe genre is far more open to new talent than other musical styles and still represents one of the best, most efficient routes into the music business today. It still takes an investment of time to make the music people want to hear, but new rappers can get into the business by self-producing their own tracks, using something like Sonic Producer.

(Or Not!)\nHave you ever taken a look at the sites that sell rap beats ? These sites offer royalty-free music for up-and-coming rap and hip hop artists to use in their songs and mixtapes. Once you buy the rap beat, you can use it as you see fit. The problem with that approach (for the rapper, anyway) is that these beats can cost $20, $25, or even $50. That\u2019s a lot for someone who\u2019s just starting out and is on a budget.\nWhat Are The Alternatives?\nIf you want to make music and need rap beats to do that, the alternatives go something like this: you can make your own. You can buy someone else\u2019s. You can use someone else\u2019s without asking (but there are serious risks to that approach), or you can find a source of royalty-free rap beats that is inexpensive, yet provides you with enough of a sound catalog to do what you want to do.\nTo make your own rap beats, you\u2019ll need a synthesizer, a mixing board and other equipment. You may also need actual instruments and still more recording equipment. You\u2019ll also need editing software that you can use for post-production work. If you think that route sounds expensive, it is.\nWe\u2019ve already covered buying someone else\u2019s catalog of sounds. That gets serious really fast. At $25-$50 a beat, you can easily spend thousands of dollars assembling the catalog you want to work with.\nYou can \u201csample\u201d someone else\u2019s tunes to get the beats you\u2019re looking for. Up front, that\u2019s the easiest thing to do. The problem comes in later\u2026 sometimes much later. If you hit and people start listening to your music, someone eventually will find your self-serve sample. And you\u2019ll get sued. The law isn\u2019t on your side. In fact, some of the biggest names in the rap industry have been sued for copyright infringement. If the original artist can prove that you took their work without asking (which is a nice way of saying \u201cwithout paying for it\u201d), you\u2019ll lose and you can lose big. The courts can require your song to be removed from the store shelves. You can also be forced to turn over all the profits from the song that uses the work. If the song happens to be your big hit, that can be a big hit to your wallet!\nThere is one more option. You can work with a software package called Sonic Producer. Sonic Producer has a built-in catalog of thousands of royalty-free samples that you\u2019re free to use. Once you\u2019ve made your music, the music is yours. You don\u2019t owe anyone anything, and you own the rights to the work. Sonic Producer\u2019s catalog alone is worth the price you\u2019ll pay for the software, which is available for both Mac and PC. No extra equipment to buy, no license fees to pay, and everything you make is yours.

The group, which changed its name to Run D.M.C., went on to become the first rap superstars\u2014hailed as stars both in the streets and the suburbs\u2014and their Profile Records\u2019 single \u201cRock Box\u201d made history as the first rap video to be shown on MTV.\nThis anthology is a great acquisition for anyone who wants to make headway in the sometimes foggy and always disputed world of hip hop history. Reading the liner notes in combination with listening to the album provides a crash course\u2014one can trace mainstream successes while also making connections with the ways in which hip hop\u00a0 emerged as the music of marginalized youth from different backgrounds who developed their own sub-genres. \u00a0For example, Asher D & Daddy Freddy\u2019s reggae inspired \u201cRagamuffin Hip-Hop,\u201d with its patois-influenced spitting style, became a rap standard imitated by many artists from Snow to Busta Rhymes, while The Showboys created a proto-bounce style in \u201cDrag Rap.\u201d\nIf you want an accessible entre to the study of hip hop, pick up Giant Single: The Profile Records Rap Anthology and travel back to the glory days.\nReviewed by Dorothy Berry\n"}, {"score": 775.8887, "uuid": "4bb5979d-5fd2-56d4-b521-722cd3afda69", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1803wb-10-11830", "target_hostname": "www.theemceemind.com", "target_uri": "http://www.theemceemind.com/2011_08_01_archive.html", "page_rank": 2.233329e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Mastery of Freestyle <em>Rap</em> | eMCeemind.com: August 2011", "snippet": "You can use how the word sounds, its spelled, correctly, <em>or</em> incorrectly.

While I think rap is not very creative, it does allow individuals to.. well.. express their individuality. An example would be rock music being a powerful force in destroying Soviet Russia.\nNow, if you're asking if there were less rap about crime, that's a different question but I think the answer is still no. If there were fewer violent video games, would there be less violence? I doubt it.\nPersonally, I enjoy causing mayhem in Grand Theft Auto, but I don't do so in real life.\n[COLOR=\"Red\"]Liberty is not simply an idea- it is life.\nLevel\n1\nI'm mixed on this subject. Art depicts life. So if the things rap talked about didn't exist prior to rap, it would have never been in a rap song. This is a fact. Gangs, robberies, drugs, have been realities of minority culture in America long before rap ever came onto the scene.\nHowever, one who grew up in the 80's and 90's can't say with a straight face that gangster rap, which must be stressed as there IS different types, severely effected young whites in a negative way. Most came out of those decades never being more than a \"wanna-be\", but one must be a wanna-be in anything before they become the real deal, and a large chunk of white America crossed the line and will pay for it for life.\nBlack and white Americans all knew it was a joke because whites, for the most part, had options the minorities didn't have and were choosing to live that lifestyle. That in itself proves minorities have a rougher time at things in this nation.\nBut on the other side of the coin, whites for the 1st time in America were starting to live under the same conditions as minorities(single moms, worthless fathers, America growing more nepotistic and less true capitalist for all), so one could also conclude that gangster rap can't be blamed because under the right circumstance one isn't susceptible to the lyrics, regardless of race. America for a long time, for lack of better words was whitatistic, where as long as you were white you had a chance. Equal rights became more about everyone living in crap than everyone becoming middle class, and of course young whites not related to the right people took to rap like gasoline to fire.\nAll of this leaves out the subject of women. Whether it is politically correct to say it or not, men of all races learn at an early age that women love bad boys. The good guy gets played while the jerk to the girl gets laid. Gangster rap was the only type of music to stress this fact, and it gave it more substance, or made it more \"real\" to the young man listening.\nIn summation, I grew up right in this time frame. I know if any form of media is to blame for the gangsters that sprouted up everywhere in America during the late 80's and early 90's, it would be the movie \"colors\". After \"colors\" came out, crip and blood sets sprouted in every suburb and rural community clear across America. No one knew they existed before that unless you lived in L.A. Gangster rap was merely the hymns of the gangster church, \"colors\" was the baptism.\nLast edited by Til the Last Drop; 08-02-2011 at 10:59 PM.\nThe key was all the rhetoric by status quo republicans in the debate as to \"our debt is a national security issue\".

Rock music, n\u00e9 rock 'n' roll, after struggling manfully (young manfully, of course) through a flood of exposure, must now prepare for a deluge of documentation. The books listed above represent the first wave, and their arrival all at once--there will be half a dozen more by autumn--signals the end of a phenomenon, its formalization, so to speak.\nNo doubt about it--the excitement has waned. But this does not mean that the music itself has degenerated, nor that it is in any real danger of abandonment by its core audience. On the contrary, its spoor is everywhere. Rock has effected a startling transformation in America's adult popular music, so that what Jack Jones does today can be traced directly to what Fats Domino was doing ten years ago. (A recent album by old farina-voice contains three songs by Randy Newman, a brilliant young Los Angeles composer who counts Fats as a major influence.) Some soft-rock groups--the Association, the 5th Dimension, Simon & Garfunkel--have invaded the middle-of-the-road market themselves. And rock is the heart of at least three overlapping kinds of youth music--the teeny-bopper and soul fare of AM radio, the heavily amplified white blues which currently dominates the concert circuit, and the more pop-oriented rock of older groups like the Byrds, the Who, and (most prominently) the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, of course, are everywhere.\nThere is no better gauge of the unflagging importance of rock for the young--nor of the variety of a music which seems so undifferentiated from the outside--than the volume of specialized journalistic coverage it still receives, coverage which should continue as long as the younger generation remains bohemian. It is a rare underground medium--a category which includes not only the dozens of community journals (almost all of which are supported by record advertising) but the college anti-papers and even the mimeographed or Xeroxed high-school and Army-base handouts--that does not give space to two or more rock commentators. The Village Voice has ten or so. Most teen and fan magazines feature serious or pseudo-serious discussions of rock and one of them, Hit Parader, has become a respected organ. Eye, a Hearst-backed hip-youth magazine centered around rock, survived a predictably pallid year, then folded like its much hipper competitor Cheetah, and Crawdaddy!, formerly \"the magazine of rock,\" has recently transformed itself into \"the magazine of roll,\" whatever that means. Rolling Stone, however, guided by an ambitious young critic-entrepreneur from San Francisco named Jann Wenner, seems likely to end up as solid (though not as boring or limited) as its jazz counterpart, Down Beat, which is admitting rock into the canon itself these days, as is Jazz & Pop, formerly just Jazz.\nWhat this means is that young writers have more outlets for rock criticism today than for fiction. The rock critique has become a major form, although a lot of this writing is more interesting as cultural sample than as criticism, representing as it does a kind of generational exploration in an art preserve the writers correctly regard as their own. The style is term-paper rap, and the tone especially in the underground, falls somewhere between cultural demagogy and hebephrenia, a sort of post-adolescent fan frenzy. Anyone who recalls the film writing of Jonas Mekas in his palmier days at The Village Voice will make the connection with the Voice's Annie Fisher. This is not to put down enthusiasm. Like Mekas, these writers are valuable propagandists, and since their judgments are hit-or-miss, they do often hit, sometimes with salutory effect. In New York, Annie Fisher has been the making of an underrated San Francisco group called Mother Earth; Bob Rudnick and Dennis Frawley of the East Village Other have inveighed valiantly against the \"super session\" fad; and Vince Aletti of Rat has put in a good word for the great soul duo, Sam & Dave, who have yet to achieve the success they deserve among whites. Nevertheless, the general imprecision is maddening. Most rock musicians now take long solos to varying critical applause, but only rarely is there even an attempt to define what makes a good solo, of the difference (if any) between a good jazz solo and a good rock solo, or of why solos belong in rock at all.\nTo an extent, this is inevitable. Because popular art is aimed at a broad audience, it must succeed in a lot of ways if it is to succeed at all, and because it is not designed to last there is reason to wonder whether the standard artistic test, that of time, applies. In rock, which (for a while, at least) was the music of the entire left side of the generation gap, and which depends for much of its power on effects which can only be called kinetic, subjectivity comes naturally. No wonder there is such confusion. The only valid question a rock \"critic\" really can ask himself is \"Did it get me off?\"\nNevertheless, some critics describe how they get off better than others. In general, these writers--Richard Goldstein, Paul Williams, Jann Wenner, Jon Landau, and others--were into rock before it became fashionable, not just in the mid-Fifties, when everyone listened, but in the pre-Beatle Sixties, and certainly before late 1965, when the Beatles began to go arty with Rubber Soul. Although they represent varying attitudes and approaches, they do share certain values. Rock was homogeneous when it attracted them, implying an aesthetic which emphasized tight, brief songs, unpretentious lyrics, and a driving beat--the tightness in contradistinction to jazz, the kineticism in contradistinction to folk. (Rock's artistic development has been an elaboration of these motifs, sometimes of one of them at the expense of another--for instance, the overwhelmingly loud rock solo, which is anything but concise, intensifies the power of the beat.) Wenner and Landau excepted, none of these critics knew from harmony and chord structure, and they still don't. Those things just don't matter.\nPartly because of his instinct for self-promotion, Richard Goldstein is the best-known rock critic, and the best-hated. Goldstein's uneven, assertively personal style invites resentment, but he is one of the best--sure he overwrites, but so does Dylan. Goldstein is more a columnist than a critic, occasionally extraordinary when he gets down an ambience or makes an offhand remark, occasionally awful when he deals in abstractions. The Poetry of Rock, a compendium of lyrics which does not contain much of his own writing, shows what there is of it at its best. The introduction touches all the bases--rock is sound first and words second; it has its traditional themes and diction; it may not be art and who cares?--and most of the brief descriptions that precede the lyrics are just right: \"`Yakety Yak,' or: How Leiber and Stoller reduce the generation gap to an unbroken, unheeded chain of commands.\" Despite inevitable quirks of taste, and disregarding some difficulties with song publishers (which is why the book contains no Stones compositions), the selection is excellent, and the dubious enterprise of isolating lyrics from music works, at least for someone who knows the originals.\nIt is only in the final section, \"Allegory and Beyond,\" that the collection breaks down. Very few writers in rock can handle Big Themes unless they do so in a Small Way. Phil Ochs' \"Crucifixion\" and Paul Simon's \"Sounds of Silence\" and Janis Ian's dreadful \"New Christ Cardiac Hero\" (\"Your virgin red crown of thorns had turned to ivory horns\") all suffer from elephantiasis of the ambitions. Of course, so does Goldstein's writing; only someone who could speak of a \"curvaceous sermon\" or of work that is \"tapped profusely\" could single out Jim Morrison's \"mute nostril agony\" for special commendation. Goldstein's worst writing, like the worst post-Dylan songwriting, seems to reflect hand-me-down dicta from some college poetry course: concretion is better than abstraction, evocation is better than description, metaphor is better than simile, and simile is better than nothing. But his good sense and affection for the music always pull him through.\nLike Goldstein, most of the young critics show an instinct for the music that overbalances any na\u00efvet\u00e9. Older writers, intelligent and with the best intentions, are usually so overwhelmed by the discovery that rock is worth thinking about that they (a) idealize it or (b) miss its spirit entirely and then praise it for irrelevant virtues. Arnold Shaw, a journalist-musicologist who was working in the music business when rock began, has written a historical book called The Rock Revolution which theoretically should avoid these pitfalls, since it is about what rock is. Unfortunately, Shaw seems neither intelligent nor well-intentioned, and it is tempting to blame this on his age: rock just isn't his thing, and he can't pretend otherwise. Anyone who can confuse the Shirelles (black and soft) with the Shangri-Las (white and tough) as Shaw does, can't possibly care much about rock and roll. The Rock Revolution is obviously thrown together from press releases and secondary sources, and contains few interesting or original organizing ideas. Shaw falls victim, for instance, to the common fallacy that the burst of energy personified by Elvis Presley in 1956 soon petered out, only to be reincarnated by the Beatles. Actually, American rock and roll, led by Motown and the Beach Boys (not to mention producer Phil Spector, whose \"wall of sound\" is dutifully listed--inventor and all--in Shaw's rather pathetic glossary, but who is never mentioned elsewhere in the book), was making a comeback before the Beatles; only someone who doesn't realize that fact could write a history of rock that grants one paragraph to Chuck Berry and six to Janis Ian.\nWhat a comparison Shaw's book provides to Nik Cohn's Rock From the Beginning. Cohn is a twenty-two-year-old Englishman who had never visited the States when he wrote this book, yet his rendering of Shaw's subject is accurate, funny, well-written, and filled with love. Where Shaw plods arbitrarily through long lists of almost indistinguishable performers, Cohn manages to find the quote or detail that turns what might be an indifferent account into a full vignette, showing as especially poignant sense of the evanescence of pop stardom. Where Shaw justifies rock by comparing it to other and implicitly better things, Cohn presents a consistent vision of what rock actually is. This vision is a special trick of the English--it is, in fact, the essence of the early Beatles. The English tend to see rock as both very raw (rawer than it ever was) and hilariously commercial: a never-ending gangster movie. Cohn revels in the meretriciousness and sexuality of rock and roll, deploring all but some very peculiar convolutions of sentimentality and almost anything that smacks of Art. Even in terms of this limited view, Cohn makes mistakes--his (correct) notion that the South engendererd most good rock and roll affects his ability to judge East Coast rhythm-and-blues, he doesn't understand the twist, and he is unfair to Memphis soul--but it is unlikely that a better account of the music to the time of folk-rock will ever be written.\nCohn is also excellent on the Rolling Stones and the Who, both of whom have applied coherent style to an idea of rock very similar to his own. But despite a good chapter on Dylan, whom he despises, he seems temperamentally unable to deal with the recent romantic florescence of rock in America. In Outlaw Blues, Paul Williams does that half of the job perfectly. Coming to rock out of the Cambridge (Mass.) folk scene, Williams founded Crawdaddy! as a seventeen-year-old Swarthmore freshman, and Crawdaddy!, in turn, spawned Jon Landau, Sandy Pearlman, Robert Somma, and Richard Meltzer, the strange genius who was thrown out of the Yale graduate philosophy program when he insisted on entitling all his papers \"Rock and . . .\" Now Williams has collected some of his own Crawdaddy! pieces plus the third installment of a long rap about Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Williams is a lovely writer, but not because of his felicity with words. It is rather the total ingenuousness of his approach--casual, cheerful, pragmatic, serious, and very young. (He was twenty-one this year.) He is perceptive about the music but that is not the point. As he writes in his preface, \"Rock to me is not a phenomenon at all--if it is, that fact is not significant--rather I see rock as a means of expression, and opportunity for beauty, an art. So what I have written is expression, not explanation; an attempt to convey what I feel from the music, an exploration of what rock does to me.\" The book is just like that, full of silly art talk. Yet finally in a subtle, even adult, way, Williams achieves his goal.\nBoth Outlaw Blues and Rock From the Beginning succeeded the way rock itself succeeds, by a kind of synthesis: their weaknesses provide the best context for their strengths, like Billie Holiday against those awful strings, remember? The analogy can be extended: Cohn's idea of rock is rigid, formal, and so he conveys his own truth within the strict form of musical history, while Williams, more flexible aesthetically, simply gathers some old essays, adds a gratuitous title, and comes up with a book that reveals what it is like to mature in a world in which rock music and the rest of experience coexist more or less equally.\nA collection called The Age of Rock, edited by Jonathan Eisen, contains five good pieces from Cheetah (plus one of mine on rock lyrics) as well as five equally good ones from Crawdaddy!, including Richard Meltzer's \"Aesthetics of Rock\"; the latter would justify any collection. Beyond that, there are also the classic come-gather-round-all-ye-over-thirties essays on the Beatles by Richard Poirier and Ned Rorem, both cogent and convincing and badly off the mark in tone and detail, and some other stuff that is even more stodgy. It is in fact the perfect rock textbook, and anybody who wants one of those should go right out and buy it. As for the rest of us, there remain the Cohn and the Williams and the Goldstein, and, even better, a few records, five or so: Chuck Berry's Greatest Hits (Chess); A Package of Sixteen Original Hits (Motown); The Beatles' Second Album (Capitol); Happy Jack, The Who (Decca); Crown of Creation, Jefferson Airplane (RCA Victor).\nHarper's Magazine, Sept. 1969\n"}, {"score": 771.1098, "uuid": "52d917af-5399-52f3-811d-af9aa195ed4d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1312wb-14-06139", "target_hostname": "www.musicals.net", "target_uri": "http://www.musicals.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=76189&p=1260368", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Musicals.Net - View topic - Why the bad <em>rap</em>?", "snippet": "There <em>is</em> one thing about <em>which</em> DrummerDude <em>is</em> entirely correct: If Jesus was just another man, what would make him any different than other great minds, such as Socrates <em>or</em> Plato?", "explanation": null, "document": "Joined: Thu Apr 23, 2009 7:12 am\nPosts: 293\nLocation: US\nWhy the bad rap?\nSo some people have disdain for Godspell.

This is a shame because people get caught up in the religious aspects of the show and forget what it's really about, the formation of a close nit community comprised of individuals. It's not a literal retelling of the life of Christ and it never tries to be, despite the fact it takes a good deal of its book and lyrics from the gospels and hymns (and probably has a better understanding of what Christianity should be like, but moving on...)\nAlso people can be put off by the abstract nature of the show, if done improperly the first act can seem meaningless, little more than a bunch of skits based on parables with songs here and there, and it seems a surprise when an actual story appears in act 2.

The author of the show, apparently, was attending a service on Easter morning, and he felt that the whole thing was very oppressive. He wanted to shed the gospels in a different light. When Stephen Schwartz and John-Michael Tebelak directed it, it was re-scored with all new music. Originally, the first author of Godspell, who was a student at Carnagie Mellon University, wrote the musical as a school project. It was intended to be a re-telling of the gospel according to Matthew (Godspell is derived from the word gospel). When Schwartz and Tebelak took the project over, they had a different idea as to what the play was all about. Rather than a light-hearted retelling of the gospels, it was now a story all about the forming of a community. They also didn't address the divinity of Jesus at all in the play. To them it wasn't important that he was God's Son or that he rose from the dead; he was a really great teacher who could bring people together. As a Christian, this (to me) takes away the entire point of the gospels; my faith is based on the belief that God sent His only Son, representative of Himself, to die in our place. If Jesus was just another man, what would make him any different than other great minds, such as Socrates or Plato?\nWed Feb 15, 2012 5:18 pm\nBrother Marvin Hinten, S.\nJoined: Thu Apr 18, 2002 2:48 pm\nPosts: 1387\n"}, {"score": 770.3299, "uuid": "a7b0205e-ac8d-541f-bf62-17901c1fcd20", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1311wb-94-06811", "target_hostname": "www.musicals.net", "target_uri": "http://www.musicals.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=76189", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Musicals.Net - View topic - Why the bad <em>rap</em>?", "snippet": "There <em>is</em> one thing about <em>which</em> DrummerDude <em>is</em> entirely correct: If Jesus was just another man, what would make him any different than other great minds, such as Socrates <em>or</em> Plato?", "explanation": null, "document": "Joined: Thu Apr 23, 2009 7:12 am\nPosts: 293\nLocation: US\nWhy the bad rap?\nSo some people have disdain for Godspell.

This is a shame because people get caught up in the religious aspects of the show and forget what it's really about, the formation of a close nit community comprised of individuals. It's not a literal retelling of the life of Christ and it never tries to be, despite the fact it takes a good deal of its book and lyrics from the gospels and hymns (and probably has a better understanding of what Christianity should be like, but moving on...)\nAlso people can be put off by the abstract nature of the show, if done improperly the first act can seem meaningless, little more than a bunch of skits based on parables with songs here and there, and it seems a surprise when an actual story appears in act 2. When done right the first act shows how the community is brought together with the second act a continuation of the story.\nThu Feb 10, 2011 6:07 pm\nDrummerDude\nJoined: Wed Feb 15, 2012 4:57 pm\nPosts: 5\nRe: Why the bad rap?\nI think that one thing people should know is the how and why Godspell became the show it is today. The author of the show, apparently, was attending a service on Easter morning, and he felt that the whole thing was very oppressive. He wanted to shed the gospels in a different light. When Stephen Schwartz and John-Michael Tebelak directed it, it was re-scored with all new music. Originally, the first author of Godspell, who was a student at Carnagie Mellon University, wrote the musical as a school project. It was intended to be a re-telling of the gospel according to Matthew (Godspell is derived from the word gospel). When Schwartz and Tebelak took the project over, they had a different idea as to what the play was all about. Rather than a light-hearted retelling of the gospels, it was now a story all about the forming of a community. They also didn't address the divinity of Jesus at all in the play. To them it wasn't important that he was God's Son or that he rose from the dead; he was a really great teacher who could bring people together. As a Christian, this (to me) takes away the entire point of the gospels; my faith is based on the belief that God sent His only Son, representative of Himself, to die in our place. If Jesus was just another man, what would make him any different than other great minds, such as Socrates or Plato?\nWed Feb 15, 2012 5:18 pm\nBrother Marvin Hinten, S.\nJoined: Thu Apr 18, 2002 2:48 pm\nPosts: 1387\n"}, {"score": 770.8224, "uuid": "eb9afffc-c84e-5444-8f83-ec1579dd7275", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0905wb-26-21726", "target_hostname": "www.robertchristgau.com", "target_uri": "http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bkrev/rockcrit-69.php", "page_rank": 1.1851642e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Robert Christgau: <em>Rock</em> Critics", "snippet": "mature in a world in <em>which</em> <em>rock</em> music and the rest of experience coexist more <em>or</em> less equally.", "explanation": null, "document": "Edited by Jonathan Eisen\nRandom House\nNothing fails like success. Rock music, n\u00e9 rock 'n' roll, after struggling manfully (young manfully, of course) through a flood of exposure, must now prepare for a deluge of documentation. The books listed above represent the first wave, and their arrival all at once--there will be half a dozen more by autumn--signals the end of a phenomenon, its formalization, so to speak.\nNo doubt about it--the excitement has waned. But this does not mean that the music itself has degenerated, nor that it is in any real danger of abandonment by its core audience. On the contrary, its spoor is everywhere. Rock has effected a startling transformation in America's adult popular music, so that what Jack Jones does today can be traced directly to what Fats Domino was doing ten years ago. (A recent album by old farina-voice contains three songs by Randy Newman, a brilliant young Los Angeles composer who counts Fats as a major influence.) Some soft-rock groups--the Association, the 5th Dimension, Simon & Garfunkel--have invaded the middle-of-the-road market themselves. And rock is the heart of at least three overlapping kinds of youth music--the teeny-bopper and soul fare of AM radio, the heavily amplified white blues which currently dominates the concert circuit, and the more pop-oriented rock of older groups like the Byrds, the Who, and (most prominently) the Rolling Stones. The Beatles, of course, are everywhere.\nThere is no better gauge of the unflagging importance of rock for the young--nor of the variety of a music which seems so undifferentiated from the outside--than the volume of specialized journalistic coverage it still receives, coverage which should continue as long as the younger generation remains bohemian. It is a rare underground medium--a category which includes not only the dozens of community journals (almost all of which are supported by record advertising) but the college anti-papers and even the mimeographed or Xeroxed high-school and Army-base handouts--that does not give space to two or more rock commentators. The Village Voice has ten or so. Most teen and fan magazines feature serious or pseudo-serious discussions of rock and one of them, Hit Parader, has become a respected organ. Eye, a Hearst-backed hip-youth magazine centered around rock, survived a predictably pallid year, then folded like its much hipper competitor Cheetah, and Crawdaddy!, formerly \"the magazine of rock,\" has recently transformed itself into \"the magazine of roll,\" whatever that means. Rolling Stone, however, guided by an ambitious young critic-entrepreneur from San Francisco named Jann Wenner, seems likely to end up as solid (though not as boring or limited) as its jazz counterpart, Down Beat, which is admitting rock into the canon itself these days, as is Jazz & Pop, formerly just Jazz.\nWhat this means is that young writers have more outlets for rock criticism today than for fiction. The rock critique has become a major form, although a lot of this writing is more interesting as cultural sample than as criticism, representing as it does a kind of generational exploration in an art preserve the writers correctly regard as their own. The style is term-paper rap, and the tone especially in the underground, falls somewhere between cultural demagogy and hebephrenia, a sort of post-adolescent fan frenzy. Anyone who recalls the film writing of Jonas Mekas in his palmier days at The Village Voice will make the connection with the Voice's Annie Fisher. This is not to put down enthusiasm. Like Mekas, these writers are valuable propagandists, and since their judgments are hit-or-miss, they do often hit, sometimes with salutory effect. In New York, Annie Fisher has been the making of an underrated San Francisco group called Mother Earth; Bob Rudnick and Dennis Frawley of the East Village Other have inveighed valiantly against the \"super session\" fad; and Vince Aletti of Rat has put in a good word for the great soul duo, Sam & Dave, who have yet to achieve the success they deserve among whites. Nevertheless, the general imprecision is maddening. Most rock musicians now take long solos to varying critical applause, but only rarely is there even an attempt to define what makes a good solo, of the difference (if any) between a good jazz solo and a good rock solo, or of why solos belong in rock at all.\nTo an extent, this is inevitable. Because popular art is aimed at a broad audience, it must succeed in a lot of ways if it is to succeed at all, and because it is not designed to last there is reason to wonder whether the standard artistic test, that of time, applies. In rock, which (for a while, at least) was the music of the entire left side of the generation gap, and which depends for much of its power on effects which can only be called kinetic, subjectivity comes naturally. No wonder there is such confusion. The only valid question a rock \"critic\" really can ask himself is \"Did it get me off?\"\nNevertheless, some critics describe how they get off better than others. In general, these writers--Richard Goldstein, Paul Williams, Jann Wenner, Jon Landau, and others--were into rock before it became fashionable, not just in the mid-Fifties, when everyone listened, but in the pre-Beatle Sixties, and certainly before late 1965, when the Beatles began to go arty with Rubber Soul. Although they represent varying attitudes and approaches, they do share certain values. Rock was homogeneous when it attracted them, implying an aesthetic which emphasized tight, brief songs, unpretentious lyrics, and a driving beat--the tightness in contradistinction to jazz, the kineticism in contradistinction to folk. (Rock's artistic development has been an elaboration of these motifs, sometimes of one of them at the expense of another--for instance, the overwhelmingly loud rock solo, which is anything but concise, intensifies the power of the beat.) Wenner and Landau excepted, none of these critics knew from harmony and chord structure, and they still don't. Those things just don't matter.\nPartly because of his instinct for self-promotion, Richard Goldstein is the best-known rock critic, and the best-hated. Goldstein's uneven, assertively personal style invites resentment, but he is one of the best--sure he overwrites, but so does Dylan. Goldstein is more a columnist than a critic, occasionally extraordinary when he gets down an ambience or makes an offhand remark, occasionally awful when he deals in abstractions. The Poetry of Rock, a compendium of lyrics which does not contain much of his own writing, shows what there is of it at its best. The introduction touches all the bases--rock is sound first and words second; it has its traditional themes and diction; it may not be art and who cares?--and most of the brief descriptions that precede the lyrics are just right: \"`Yakety Yak,' or: How Leiber and Stoller reduce the generation gap to an unbroken, unheeded chain of commands.\" Despite inevitable quirks of taste, and disregarding some difficulties with song publishers (which is why the book contains no Stones compositions), the selection is excellent, and the dubious enterprise of isolating lyrics from music works, at least for someone who knows the originals.\nIt is only in the final section, \"Allegory and Beyond,\" that the collection breaks down. Very few writers in rock can handle Big Themes unless they do so in a Small Way. Phil Ochs' \"Crucifixion\" and Paul Simon's \"Sounds of Silence\" and Janis Ian's dreadful \"New Christ Cardiac Hero\" (\"Your virgin red crown of thorns had turned to ivory horns\") all suffer from elephantiasis of the ambitions. Of course, so does Goldstein's writing; only someone who could speak of a \"curvaceous sermon\" or of work that is \"tapped profusely\" could single out Jim Morrison's \"mute nostril agony\" for special commendation. Goldstein's worst writing, like the worst post-Dylan songwriting, seems to reflect hand-me-down dicta from some college poetry course: concretion is better than abstraction, evocation is better than description, metaphor is better than simile, and simile is better than nothing. But his good sense and affection for the music always pull him through.\nLike Goldstein, most of the young critics show an instinct for the music that overbalances any na\u00efvet\u00e9. Older writers, intelligent and with the best intentions, are usually so overwhelmed by the discovery that rock is worth thinking about that they (a) idealize it or (b) miss its spirit entirely and then praise it for irrelevant virtues. Arnold Shaw, a journalist-musicologist who was working in the music business when rock began, has written a historical book called The Rock Revolution which theoretically should avoid these pitfalls, since it is about what rock is. Unfortunately, Shaw seems neither intelligent nor well-intentioned, and it is tempting to blame this on his age: rock just isn't his thing, and he can't pretend otherwise. Anyone who can confuse the Shirelles (black and soft) with the Shangri-Las (white and tough) as Shaw does, can't possibly care much about rock and roll. The Rock Revolution is obviously thrown together from press releases and secondary sources, and contains few interesting or original organizing ideas. Shaw falls victim, for instance, to the common fallacy that the burst of energy personified by Elvis Presley in 1956 soon petered out, only to be reincarnated by the Beatles. Actually, American rock and roll, led by Motown and the Beach Boys (not to mention producer Phil Spector, whose \"wall of sound\" is dutifully listed--inventor and all--in Shaw's rather pathetic glossary, but who is never mentioned elsewhere in the book), was making a comeback before the Beatles; only someone who doesn't realize that fact could write a history of rock that grants one paragraph to Chuck Berry and six to Janis Ian.\nWhat a comparison Shaw's book provides to Nik Cohn's Rock From the Beginning. Cohn is a twenty-two-year-old Englishman who had never visited the States when he wrote this book, yet his rendering of Shaw's subject is accurate, funny, well-written, and filled with love. Where Shaw plods arbitrarily through long lists of almost indistinguishable performers, Cohn manages to find the quote or detail that turns what might be an indifferent account into a full vignette, showing as especially poignant sense of the evanescence of pop stardom. Where Shaw justifies rock by comparing it to other and implicitly better things, Cohn presents a consistent vision of what rock actually is. This vision is a special trick of the English--it is, in fact, the essence of the early Beatles. The English tend to see rock as both very raw (rawer than it ever was) and hilariously commercial: a never-ending gangster movie. Cohn revels in the meretriciousness and sexuality of rock and roll, deploring all but some very peculiar convolutions of sentimentality and almost anything that smacks of Art. Even in terms of this limited view, Cohn makes mistakes--his (correct) notion that the South engendererd most good rock and roll affects his ability to judge East Coast rhythm-and-blues, he doesn't understand the twist, and he is unfair to Memphis soul--but it is unlikely that a better account of the music to the time of folk-rock will ever be written.\nCohn is also excellent on the Rolling Stones and the Who, both of whom have applied coherent style to an idea of rock very similar to his own. But despite a good chapter on Dylan, whom he despises, he seems temperamentally unable to deal with the recent romantic florescence of rock in America. In Outlaw Blues, Paul Williams does that half of the job perfectly. Coming to rock out of the Cambridge (Mass.) folk scene, Williams founded Crawdaddy! as a seventeen-year-old Swarthmore freshman, and Crawdaddy!, in turn, spawned Jon Landau, Sandy Pearlman, Robert Somma, and Richard Meltzer, the strange genius who was thrown out of the Yale graduate philosophy program when he insisted on entitling all his papers \"Rock and . . .\" Now Williams has collected some of his own Crawdaddy! pieces plus the third installment of a long rap about Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Williams is a lovely writer, but not because of his felicity with words. It is rather the total ingenuousness of his approach--casual, cheerful, pragmatic, serious, and very young. (He was twenty-one this year.) He is perceptive about the music but that is not the point. As he writes in his preface, \"Rock to me is not a phenomenon at all--if it is, that fact is not significant--rather I see rock as a means of expression, and opportunity for beauty, an art. So what I have written is expression, not explanation; an attempt to convey what I feel from the music, an exploration of what rock does to me.\" The book is just like that, full of silly art talk. Yet finally in a subtle, even adult, way, Williams achieves his goal.\nBoth Outlaw Blues and Rock From the Beginning succeeded the way rock itself succeeds, by a kind of synthesis: their weaknesses provide the best context for their strengths, like Billie Holiday against those awful strings, remember? The analogy can be extended: Cohn's idea of rock is rigid, formal, and so he conveys his own truth within the strict form of musical history, while Williams, more flexible aesthetically, simply gathers some old essays, adds a gratuitous title, and comes up with a book that reveals what it is like to mature in a world in which rock music and the rest of experience coexist more or less equally.\nA collection called The Age of Rock, edited by Jonathan Eisen, contains five good pieces from Cheetah (plus one of mine on rock lyrics) as well as five equally good ones from Crawdaddy!, including Richard Meltzer's \"Aesthetics of Rock\"; the latter would justify any collection. Beyond that, there are also the classic come-gather-round-all-ye-over-thirties essays on the Beatles by Richard Poirier and Ned Rorem, both cogent and convincing and badly off the mark in tone and detail, and some other stuff that is even more stodgy. It is in fact the perfect rock textbook, and anybody who wants one of those should go right out and buy it. As for the rest of us, there remain the Cohn and the Williams and the Goldstein, and, even better, a few records, five or so: Chuck Berry's Greatest Hits (Chess); A Package of Sixteen Original Hits (Motown); The Beatles' Second Album (Capitol); Happy Jack, The Who (Decca); Crown of Creation, Jefferson Airplane (RCA Victor).\nHarper's Magazine, Sept. 1969\n"}]]}
