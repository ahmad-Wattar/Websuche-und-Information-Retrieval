These institutions are known as colleges or institutes depending on the state or territory they belong. These colleges are owned and operated by state or territory governments in Australia.\nWithin the Australian Qualifications Framework, TAFE Colleges award qualifications up to the level of advanced diploma, which is below that of a Bachelor degree. Since 2002, TAFE Colleges have been awarding degree-level awards and post graduate diplomas to fill niche areas in the industries of Australia. However, these awards do not go beyond the level of Bachelor degree. In fact, many Australians refer to all degrees that are below the level of a Bachelor degree as TAFE courses regardless of the institutions that offers it.\nAll courses offered in TAFE Colleges have to be assessed and approved by the Higher Education Accreditation Committee and students are required to pay full fees since they are not entitled to student fee loans supported by the Commonwealth Government.\nOther institutions such as some universities offer TAFE courses funded by the state and territory governments. There are also some high schools that offer courses accredited by TAFE institutions. Other private institutions also offer TAFE courses other than the common vocational education and training courses the offer to people.\nThe Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations is the government agency that leads the country's education and workplace training as well as transition to work. It collaborates with the different government agencies with the states and territories to provide easy access to educational services and support programs to the Australian people. It also aims to increase workforce participation and promote fair work practices in Australia.\nTips for choosing the best TAFE College\nLimit your search to the location where you prefer to study. There are many reputable colleges in Australia and deciding whether you want to go to one in your State or in another might help you limit your search to a handful.\nGet as much information as you can from at least a handful of TAFE Colleges that you have in mind. Check their admission requirements, their course offerings, policies, campus and other pertinent information.\nYou may want to consider less selective schools with minimum requirements since competition is very tough for a spot in a well-known institution.\nConsider the costs of studying in a college you like. Think about the tuition and other fees, housing, food and transportation.\nSubmit as many applications as you can to different TAFE Colleges and take the entrance tests. The more colleges you try out, the better the chances of getting into one.\nWhen applying, always bring your documents and identification.\nTake a tour of the campus in person. The online campus tour may not always be as informative as going there yourself.\nYour college of choice should always be based on your goals, needs, interests and budget.\nToday's Fresh Tafe Colleges\n"}, {"score": 1568.0222, "uuid": "16154e07-4054-53ba-b426-211d8b49fd32", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0704wb-81-09267", "target_hostname": "www.startlocal.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.startlocal.com.au/industrial/fibreglassfabri/", "page_rank": 1.1973902e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Most</em> <em>Popular</em> Fibreglass Fabricators <em>Australia</em>-wide - StartLocal\u00ae", "snippet": "You are here: Home &gt; Manufacturing and Industrial &gt; Fibreglass Fabricators Are you looking for <em>the</em> <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> fibreglass fabricators <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em>?

There seems here to be a fair amount of interest in it, but based on the running around that I've done, the price-point that craft brewers pitch their product at is around the $70-$80 per case mark plus $12-$15 per case postage. Given these sorts of prices I'm not surprised that the Aussie Beer Club, if it has in fact ceased operation, would have struggled to make any money.\nOff the back of these prices, along with the effort involved in securing the appropriate licence (and costs involved there), along with logistical and admin costs, including website etc, I would think that the cases would need to be priced at around the hundred dollar mark just to cover costs.\nWould this still be feasible at these prices?\nI am passionate about beer and love the idea of setting something like this up, but it's a mammoth challenge and could be a thankless task, but if the interest is there, then I'd definitely pursue it. It's not the sort of thing that makes a man rich, but it could certainly result in a great deal of pleasure to all involved, especially subscribers.\nSo, as a gentle gauge, would $100 per case (give or take) prove exhorbitant? keeping in mind, it costs about $50-$60 bucks for a half decent case at your local bottlo already.\nAnother change that might be interesting is to introduce international beers as well.\nThese are all just thoughts at this stage, but hey, that's where things start right?\nI'm not sure how many people read this but could you give me a little feedback...it'd be greatly appreciated.\n"}, {"score": 1190.015, "uuid": "149e4c3c-f888-5815-9d7e-a79c16242afc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-82-16845", "target_hostname": "www.beerguide.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.beerguide.com.au/forums/topic/1785-new-layout/", "page_rank": 1.1873058e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "New Layout - Australian <em>Beer</em> Forums | <em>Beer</em> Guide to <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "Basically this <em>is</em> just a cloud which lists <em>the</em> <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> search keywords people are entering.

By now, friends in Britain were phoning me to say that the \"story\" had \"broken\" in Fleet Street. I tuned into CNN, hoping for an update on this new threat to world peace.\nWhen international issues loom, the place to be is the capital.

So before we start drinking the heck out of this style, here is a little bit about it\u2019s early roots\u2026\nThe humble origin of the Stout harkens back to January, when we investigated the history of the Porter . As you may recall, the Stout emerged as the younger and, well, stout-ier brother: the style \u201cStout Porter\u201d referred to a stronger version of the Porter (at 7-8% instead of the typical Porter 6%).\u00a0 So, the term \u201cStout\u201d was more an adjective than a style. Eventually, the original Porter fell by the wayside\u2013but are you surprised? The Stout Porter was stronger and richer than the original\u2013and who doesn\u2019t love a strong and rich man\u2013er, beer?\u00a0 Well, the Stout was loved so much, that doctors actually prescribed Stouts, so to speak, to athletes and nursing mothers to help them regain strength\u2013or, in other words, regain their Stoutness. Stouts, Porters, and Stout Porters lost their popularity in England when a restriction was placed on making roasted malts during World War I, at which time the mild Ale won over the hearts of the Brits. However, it took the Irish population by a malty storm!\nStout Propaganda: \"Guinness is Good For You\"\nArthur Guinness opened his Dublin brewery in 1759, producing (along with an Ale) what can be considered the first Stout Porter.\u00a0 (In 1799, Arthur made a wise decision to focus solely on Porter production\u2013that\u2019s why we see no Guinness Ales today.)\u00a0 In the mid-1800s, the \u2018Porter\u2019 nomenclature was dropped, and thanks to keen advertising and calculated exporting, Guinness (with the help of other Irish breweries Murphy\u2019s and Beamish & Crawford) made the Stout one of the most ubiquitous beers in the Western World.\u00a0 Of course, it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for this smooth brew: in the 1800s, Stouts became less popular, as it was expensive to produce based on the types of grains needed; and as mentioned earlier, the WWI restriction on roasting malts halted production in England, leaving the job to the mighty Irish. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s, when beer writers such as Michael Jackson (the beer god, not the music god) took an interest in the style, that the Stout was resurrected.\nThroughout its development, a number of stout variations emerged, in England, Ireland, and beyond. The following will be included in this month\u2019s beernalysis!\nThe Stout Styles\nEnglish Stout: The first to appear on the scene, the English Stout is notable for its black color and use of charred barley, which gives the beer a roasted, coffee taste. Chocolate Stouts are characterized under English Stouts; the malts in a Chocolate Stout are left in the kiln until they develop a chocolate taste and color.\u00a0 (In some cases, actual chocolate is also added to the brew.)\u00a0 Similarly, the malts of a Coffee Stout are roasted until they are as bitter as freshly ground coffee beans (and also, some brewers add coffee grounds to highlight the flavor).\nForeign/Export Stout: The Export Stout took the English Stout and made it a helluva lot more alcoholic to survive a journey across the sea where it was being exported. In fact, this style is still found in many tropical areas to where Stouts were first exported, such as Jamaica and Malta.\nIrish Dry Stout:\u00a0 The most popular of the Stouts, popularized by the aforementioned Guinness, Murphy\u2019s, and Beamish. The Irish Dry Stout is the lighter of the Stout styles\u2013it has lower carbonation and a uniquely creamy body, with a roasted and crisp taste.\nIrish Stout\nMilk/Cream/Sweet Stout: This is not for the lactose intolerant!\u00a0 The Sweet Stout has a high content of dextrins and unfermented sugar that makes this Stout sometimes oddly sweet.\u00a0 Milk/Cream Stouts are very similar to Sweet Stouts, but brewers add lactose to the brew kettle to add body and some sweetness. This was one of the beers that doctors would recommend mothers drink, because of the dairy content. In fact, one of the original Milk Stouts, Mackeson\u2019s, claims to have 10 ounces of \u201cpure dairy milk\u201d in it.\nOatmeal Stout: As you can gather, Oatmeal Stouts are made with oatmeal, which is added to the mash. The major characteristic of this type of Stout is its smoothness. Oats have been used in beer production since the medieval times in Europe. It remained popular in Northern Europe, but Tudor sailors hated the bitter flavor that it caused in the beer so much that it died out in other parts of Europe. There was a brief revival at the end of the 19th century, when people thought that including oats would be healthy.\u00a0 (But, of course, that\u2019s like eating a bar of dark chocolate, washing it down with a bottle of red wine, and saying you did it for heart health.)\u00a0 Subsequent Oatmeal Stouts used a very little bit of oats. When Michael Jackson wrote about the Oatmeal Stout in the 1970s, a European distributor commissioned the Samuel Smith Brewery to recreate the style; thus, their Oatmeal Stout has become one to imitate. The Oatmeal Stout can now be found in new incarnations all throughout the world, from Denmark to Australia. Fair warning, though: don\u2019t expect it to taste like downing a big bowl of oatmeal; the uniqueness of this beer is in its smooth body.\u00a0 (Oatmeal is used as a major component of moisturizers, too\u2026)\nRussian Imperial Stout (sometimes just Imperial Stout): This was a whole big marketing campaign on the part of Thrale\u2019s brewery in the 17th century to impress Catherine II of Russia, as one story goes. Another is that Peter the Great, while visiting London, loved the Porter so much, that he requested Barclay Brewery send it over to Russia. However, the beer would spoil on the trip over; thus, a stronger brew was created to survive the journey. Barclay did so by brewing a beer with a higher alcohol and hop content. Rumor has it that Catherine the Great enjoyed this new recipe so much that she ordered kegs upon kegs of it to stock her court. And if it\u2019s good enough for the courts, it\u2019s good enough for us.\nCatherine II with an Imperial Stout. Photoshop Credit: http://ladiesocb.com\nOyster Stout: Oysters, you say? Oysters! Back in olde time England, Stouts were enjoyed with a full plate of oysters in the taverns. But the two were not formally combined until the 1920s in New Zealand. Later, this recipe popped up back in London, and even later, after WWII, oysters were added to Stouts as another way of trying to infuse health benefits into beer, such as the Milk Stout campaign. Today, some breweries add oysters, while others only use the name, implying that the beer should be consumed with oysters. Vegetarians, be wary!\n\"Guinness Guide to Oysters\" / Credit: Appellation Beer\nWhile the British Isles hold the proverbially patent on the Stout, other countries have certainly had their fun adapting the style with local ingredients and recipes. Most notably, us crafty Americans!\nAmerican Stout: American Stouts range in their tenacity and ingenuity. There really is no way to generalize the American Stout, other than that they have a tendency of materializing as some crazy renditions of the English and Irish classics (from an Imperial Milk Stout to a Chicory Coffee Stout). However, one major difference is that American Stouts will often have a stronger hop presence than their British counterparts.\nAnd with that\u2026we venture into this month looking for the roastiest, maltiest, sweetest stouts this world has to offer.

They call it Cyclo-Cross, and it\u2019s huge! Cowbells clang boldly as if there is a mass stampede taking place. Air horns blast out in unison, while regional and national flags rage above the frantic crowds, all cheering insanely for their favourites. No it\u2019s not a Premier League soccer match, it\u2019s a typical Belgian cyclo-cross race.\nIf you could imagine all the roar and atmosphere of a finale of a Tour de France stage on the great Alpe d\u2019Huez and then bring it all into the centre of a small town for everyone to join in, you\u2019ll get a feel of what it\u2019s like at a major cyclo-cross race on a cold winter\u2019s day in Belgium. Or anywhere else within driving distance of the tiny beer and fritte producing nation, which is without a doubt the homeland of all things bike racing.\nMud, Sweat and BeersTo most Australians cyclo-cross is some kind of strange sport that involves riding and running around in the cold and the mud, and could well seem kind of pointless. After all, that\u2019s what mountain bikes are for, aren\u2019t they? But say that to any Belgian cross fan and you\u2019ll probably be hung by his braces and battered by his cowbells. Sure enough Belgium has more than its fair share of great classic bike races to go to. The place virtually drowns in cycling culture and history. But when it comes to cyclo-cross, they are that extra little bit fanatical.\nThe misty cabbage fields of Flanders are a bleak and unforgiving place in winter. The wind roars, the rain cuts sideways, and in-between the rains the ice freezes in the ploughed furrows. It\u2019s these sorts of conditions that have moulded the Flandrians over the years, and is partly why they have such tough bike racers. So the thought of getting out and racing around these fields in such conditions is not exactly alien to the wind hardened northerners, and coming out to watch them do it is considered great entertainment on a cold and dreary winter day.\nOn any given weekend between September and late February there will be local cyclo-cross races all over Belgium and Northern Europe. These races have all of the usual categories, are held on circuits of about a mile in distance and for the senior riders are usually raced for one hour plus one lap. They\u2019re basically like a big muddy crit. Conditions vary, but a typical race circuit will contain a number of obstacles, lots of twisty grass riding, short road sections and a few technical bits with a short run or two. Most aficionados don\u2019t consider a race to be a true cyclo-cross unless the circuit is also capped in ankle deep mud, and they often are. The sport began around a century ago as a way for road riders of the day to keep fit during the harsh winter offseason.\nIt ain&#039;t cyclo-cross if it ain&#039;t got mud! Bart Wellens and Lars Boom make it look so easy!But these days with longer and more demanding road race schedules to cope with, and the easy availability of cheap sunshine in southern Europe, not as many of the really top line road riders compete seriously in cross. There are of course some exceptions. Riders such as Lance Armstrong, John Gadret and Roger Hammond are fans of playing dirty.\nCyclo-cross has grown in stature and standard dramatically since its official \u2018incarnation\u2019 in 1950. Belgium leads the major players by a long muddy stick, while Holland, Czech Republic, Switzerland and France follow with smaller cross powers like the USA, UK, Italy and Germany a little behind. That said, from a participation numbers stand point the US pretty much rules, with some American events attracting over 1,000 riders. There are a number of potential reasons for the sport\u2019s popularity. From an average rider\u2019s point of view it\u2019s great fun and really works well as a way of maintaining and boosting fitness by forcing them to ride more and cross train during the winter. It\u2019s great for bike handling work, and it\u2019s all over within an intensive hour which might otherwise have been spent in front of a TV on a wet day. In the US it often attracts many older riders. Not only because it\u2019s seen as cool, it\u2019s a great way to be able to race at weekends for riders who simply do not have the time available to put in the long training hours that are required to even stay in the bunch of an average road race.\nAt the top end it\u2019s a different story. Many European riders first cut their knees in muddy cyclo-cross fields, so it is pretty much in their blood. Plus for those on a higher level, it\u2019s an incredibly lucrative sport, and they are virtual super stars in their home countries \u2013 especially in Belgium. Besides the usual team sponsorship and prize money, most elite riders will receive handsome start money for races, particularly the bigger events. A rider of the prominence of Sven Nys for example, could earn up to A$12,000 in start money for a major race and then race another 40 times during a season.\nMajor race organisers are full time commercial set ups, so the standards are always high. The upper echelon of cyclo-cross is comparatively rich compared to other branches of the sport. Why? Imagine Frazer vs. Ali, the Aussie Rules Final or the Ashes taking place every weekend somewhere close to your home town, and once a year within walking distance \u2013 and for free!\nJust as they do with other major sports, the average fans in Belgium know all of the riders. Bart Wellens even has a weekly TV docu-soap show following his every move, so when these guys come to town everyone turns out to watch. Add in the fact that the circuit distance and layout means they can see the riders every few minutes, and it\u2019s great free entertainment. Bike racing is a tough sport, and in Belgium it has always been associated with the tough working classes. So when these working class cycling heroes come out to race the atmosphere is nothing short of electric. But, of course you have to add in the other great Belgian element \u2013 beer! Yes beer. The Belgians make more of it, and better beer than anybody, and they love to drink the stuff too. What better accessory for a Cyclocross bubba watching a race? And then by late afternoon it\u2019s all over, and they can make it home in time to watch the race again on TV, as all of the major races are televised. This accounts for the sponsorship, popularity, and the high awareness factor of the sport in Northern Europe. From the TV network\u2019s point of view filming a cyclo-cross is a piece of cake, and very cheap, compared to following a road race.\nOther Countries\nSven Nys is grateful for his wide tyres as he ploughs through the mud.Outside of Northern Europe there\u2019s the Czech Republic, which hosts the World Championships in 2010. Although the former eastern block nation has no great cycling culture, its system has always produced great cyclo-cross riders. Back in the communist days they boasted several World Champions, drawn into the sport by the great potential bonus offers. Even now they rank second only to Belgium on a performance scale. In the USA the sport first kicked off in the late 70s, but now it\u2019s huge, and American riders are making regular top positions in big Euro races. Elsewhere cyclo-cross gets harder to find. In Japan there are a few races and the Kansai Series is very popular, sometimes attracting visiting Europeans.\nIn China there is a very small series in Beijing, and Mongolia is sending a small team of riders to try their hands at the sport in Europe with the support of Johan Musseuw\u2019s bike manufacturing company. I guess the question is \u2013 will it ever happen here in Australia? Well, Cyclocross bikes are slowly finding their way into shops here and some of the bigger mountain bike races are allowing cross bikes to compete too. There was also a cross event held on the cross-country MTB course in Canberra before the recent World Championships, and there is a fledgling series, and unofficial National Championship in Victoria. Check out www.cyclocrossaustralia.com .\n\"There is no reason it shouldn\u2019t take off here; it\u2019s a great sport, and cyclo-cross bikes are the ultimate all-rounder.\"\nA Brief History of Cyclo-cross\nYou need a clean pair of heels and good clipping technique. Many cyclo-cross courses have obstacles that require running.The sport of cyclo-cross came about towards the end of the 19th Century. There are many theories as to how, but it is largely attributed to a cycling French solider named Daniel Gouseau. During the cold northern winter months he used to ride his bike around the local forest and farm trails, hopping over obstacles along the way, all in the name of keeping fit. It is said that the French army witnessed this and took to training their soldiers the same way.\nMany other road riders of the day used to race each other from village to village for winter training, cutting across fields and through woodland to try and make the shortest route. The running element was added it is said, to get the blood circulating in frozen feet. The first official French National Championship was organised by Gouseau in 1902, and over the next decade many other nations added their own championships. In those early days the leading road riders all competed in Cyclocross, hoping to maintain their fitness and improve bike-handling skills, much as many top riders have done ever since.\nMany of the early Tour de France winners were also great cyclo-cross champions. In 1924 the first ever \u2018Criterium International\u2019 was held. This was then recognised as the ultimate cyclo-cross race and considered to be the World Championship of the sport. In 1949 Roger Rondeaux (one of the early greats of the sport), won the last Critirium International. The following year the event became the World Professional Cyclo-Cross Championship and the first winner was 1947 Tour de France champion Jean Robic. Cyclo-cross has grown considerably since then, with 24 nations lining up for last year\u2019s World Championship. Many ask, what about adding the sport to the Winter Olympics? The chances of this happening are very slim. Firstly it\u2019s still a fairly Eurocentric sport, and secondly it does not require snow or ice to happen. However, they are trying to introduce cross-country running to the Games \u2013 so never say never!\n"}, {"score": 1129.3324, "uuid": "20b7e18b-6216-5df4-8779-ce791423f06f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1900tw-05-16378", "target_hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "target_uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_in_Germany", "page_rank": 1.4064698e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Beer</em> <em>in</em> Germany - Wikipedia, <em>the</em> free encyclopedia", "snippet": "By far <em>the</em> <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> style, with around two thirds of <em>the</em> market. * Export \u2014 a pale lager brewed around Dortmund that <em>is</em> fuller, maltier and less hoppy than Pilsner.", "explanation": null, "document": "Main article: Reinheitsgebot\nThe Reinheitsgebot (\"purity decree\"), sometimes called the \"German Beer Purity Law\" or the \"Bavarian Purity Law\" in English, is a regulation concerning the production of beer in Germany.

Around 10 breweries in the Duesseldorf region brew Alt. 5-6.5% ABV.\nSchwarzbier \u2014 a bottom-fermented, dark lager beer with a full, roasty, chocolatey flavor. 11-12\u00b0 Plato, 4.5-5% ABV.\nDunkles \u2014 dark lager which comes in two main varieties: the sweetish, malty Munich style and the drier, hoppy Franconian style\nDunkler Bock \u2014 a strong, full-bodied lager darkened by high-coloured malts. 16-17\u00b0 Plato, 6.5-7% ABV.\nRauchbier \u2014 usually dark in color and smoky in taste from the use of smoked malt. A speciality of the Bamberg region. 12-13\u00b0 Plato, 5-5.5% ABV\nDoppelbock \u2014 a very strong, very full-bodied lager darkened by high-coloured malts. 18-28\u00b0 Plato, 8-12% ABV.\n[ edit ] Unfiltered beer\nA glass stein of unfiltered Eichbaum Kellerbier.\nKellerbiers are unfiltered lagers which are conditioned in a similar manner to cask ales . Strength and colour will vary, [10] though in the Franconia region where these cask conditioned lagers are still popular, the strength will tend to be 5% abv or slightly higher, and the colour will tend to be a deep amber, but the defining characteristic is the cask conditioning. Kellerbier is German for \"cellar beer\". [11]\nZwickelbier was originally a sample amount of beer taken by a brewery boss from the barrel with a help of a special pipe called a \"Zwickelhahn\". Zwickelbiers are unfiltered lagers like Kellerbier, though with a slightly different conditioning process which gives the lager more carbonation. Zwickelbiers tend to be younger, lower in alcohol and less hoppy than Kellerbiers. [12]\nA very similar beer is Zoiglbier , which in Franconian brewing practice is advertised with a \"Zoigl\" (i.e., sign) \u2014 a six-pointed blue-and-white symbol made from wooden slats, similar to a Star of David . [13] [14]\n[ edit ] Brands and breweries\nWhile the beer market is weaker but more centralized in northern Germany, the south has lots of smaller local breweries. Almost half of all German breweries are in Bavaria. [15] In total, there are approximately 1300 breweries in Germany producing over 5000 brands of beer. The highest density of breweries in the world is found near the city of Bamberg , in the Franconia region of Bavaria. The Benedictine abbey Weihenstephan brewery (established in 725) is reputedly the oldest existing brewery in the world (brewing since 1040). In 2004 Oettinger replaced Krombacher as the best selling brand in Germany. [16]\nTop ten of Germany's best selling beer brands.

With some of the best beaches, world-class art museums, cultural attractions and friendly people, it\u2019s easy to see why Australia appeals to\nyoung, energetic travelers. Where else can you watch people race in boats made of beer cans (in the Darwin Beer Can Regatta), race a camel in the Alice Springs Camel Cup, enjoy fine wines at dozens of wineries and experience the formal pageantry of horse and yacht races all in one incredible vacation?\nTry some of these ideas during your visit to Australia for a unique and unforgettable trip:\nAustralian Adventures\nWhile you could spend your Australian vacation lounging on the beach or shopping in the cities, to truly experience Australia, get out there and have an adventure. Whether you want to explore the sea, the mountains or the desert, Australia has an adventure for you.\nBush Adventures\nWant to get your Crocodile Dundee on? Spend some time exploring the Australian bush in the Megalong Valley in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. Hop on a horse for a short tour, or immerse yourself in the bush experience by attending Jackaroo School, a one-week camp where you\u2019ll learn to rustle cattle, shear sheep and crack a whip. If you\u2019re into more exotic animals, sign up for the Aboriginal Bush Tucker Tour in Kakadu National Park. You\u2019ll experience Aboriginal culture and see stunning landscapes and thousands of species of insects, birds and animals.\nAir Adventures\nAdmit it: you\u2019ve always wanted to feel what it\u2019s like to be a bird. Why not give flying a try with a hang gliding adventure in Canungra, along the Gold Coast Hinterland in Queensland? Several companies offer tandem hang gliding and paragliding adventures over the beaches, rainforest, mountains and city skyscrapers.\u00a0 For a slightly more enclosed experience, take a dawn hot air balloon ride over Canberra, and see the city\u2019s buildings and parklands from the air. If you visit in March, you can attend the Canberra Balloon Festival and see dozens of balloons take flight.\nCamel and Driving Adventures\nHave you ever wondered what is was like to be Lawrence of Arabia? You can find out if you take a camel tour through the Simpson Desert in central Australia. Most visitors take the one-week tour, in which they ride and walk with camels to explore the desert and camp under the stars. More adventurous trekkers can sign up for the six-week experience.\nIf you want to explore Australia via a more reliable \u2013and less smelly\u2014mode of transport, try out one of the driving adventures. Drive along the Explorer\u2019s Highway between Adelaide and Darwin to see everything from wine country to the outback post of Alice Springs, as well as several national parks and heritage sites. Or explore the varied landscapes of the Flinders Ranges in an open-air 4WD vehicle.\nHiking Adventures\nAustralia offers thousands of miles of hiking trails, from the oceanside trails of the Great Ocean Walk to the rugged paths of the Alpine Track in New South Wales. Plan a trip of several days to explore a section of the longer trails; completing the entire Alpine Track, for example, requires nearly two months and is for the most experienced hikers only. Day treks are possible, though, and they give you the chance to see some of Australia\u2019s beauty and diversity.\nMusic Festivals\nAustralia is a mecca for all types of music festivals. Whether you have a taste for rock, jazz, blues, classical, dance or just about any style of music, chances are there is a music festival in Australia for you. Many festivals take place during the summer months (the winter months in the northern hemisphere), particularly around the beginning of the year. On January 26th of each year, the entire nation celebrates Australia Day, which is marked by festivals, concerts and other events all over the country throughout the week. Most of the events are free and feature live acts from all over Australia, both traditional and contemporary.\nVolunteer Opportunities\nWant to explore Australia while learning and helping the community at the same time? Sign up for one of the many volunteer opportunities that will give you a chance to get up close and personal with the country and its people. Try rescuing endangered wildlife, or learn about organic farming through the Willing Workers on Organic Farms program. The best part of these volunteer projects is that your room and board are often covered, allowing you to experience Australia on a budget.\nFrom exhilarating, once in a lifetime adventures to more laidback \u2013 and sometimes humorous \u2013 excursions, Australia has something for everyone. So get out of your hotel or dorm, and explore all that the diverse continent has to offer. You might find that you never want to leave!\nThis guest post article was written and provided by Erica Gustafson who is an avid Australia traveler, freelance writer and digital media consultant for Expedia .\u00a0 She helps people book cheap hotel reservations at many locations around the world.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 1119.5645, "uuid": "f70945d3-277d-563d-8172-e3241d1c837f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0705wb-26-27854", "target_hostname": "www.startlocal.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.startlocal.com.au/recreation/", "page_rank": 2.6037734e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Most</em> <em>Popular</em> Australian Recreation and Entertainment - StartLocal\u00ae", "snippet": "Tourism marketing <em>is</em> <em>the</em> responsibility of Tourism <em>Australia</em> within <em>the</em> country as well as internationally.

Recreation is an activity of leisure that is enjoyed by individuals to refresh the body. It is always considered as fun and free from prior commitments. The list of recreational activities and entertainment in Australia is endless, one only needs the time.\nAustralia is known for its popular tourist destinations and the number of visitors has increased greatly. Backpackers are mostly young tourists from Europe or the USA who spend considerably more time in the country for exploration. Tourism marketing is the responsibility of Tourism Australia within the country as well as internationally.\nSport in Australia is very popular. The vast bulk of people above the age of 15 are engaged in some sort of organized sport, most especially in water sports and team sports. Sports can be played with friends or relatives in open areas such as parks, fields, gymnasiums, beaches, and other locations. The Australian Sports Commission is responsible for providing and distributing funds for sports as well as providing guidelines and guidance for any sporting activity within the country. Each state and territory also has its own institutes and institutions of sport.\nFilms are one of many recreational activities in Australia. Many Australian films are being produced and the Australian Government has expressed its continued support for the film industry through funding initiatives. There are cinemas in a majority of Australian cities while there are some open-air-cinemas that provide entertainment outside the walls of a traditional theatre. While there are a lot Australian stars that have gained prominence in international films, there are still some well-known actors and actresses that continue their work in the country for the publics entertainment.\nParks are open spaces that are great areas for picnics and sporting activities. Australian cities have an abundance of great and beautiful parks where everyone can enjoy free time. Parks are maintained by state governments or local governments where they are located.\nTheme Parks are also another form of recreation and entertainment. These are a group of rides or attractions that are put together for the main purpose of having fun. Sea World, Movie World, Wet n Wild Water World, and Dreamworld are all located in Queensland. Luna Park is a fun park with rides and stage performances in Sydney. Sovereign Hill is a topnotch historical park in Victoria while Adventure World is located in Western Australia.\nGeneral\n"}, {"score": 1118.1252, "uuid": "4a14f0be-d9c9-5534-8f45-caad2db9646a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1414wb-92-27117", "target_hostname": "epicbeer.com", "target_uri": "http://epicbeer.com/blog/2010/4/17/best-beer-in-australia-new-zealand.html", "page_rank": 1.2123876e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Beer</em> <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "Modern Spa <em>is</em> a specialist <em>in</em> <em>the</em> SPA industry, which has been making steam showers, wholesale steam shower, shower enclosures and traditional saunas since 1993. this post <em>is</em> good for <em>beer</em> lover.you share good information.i agree with you <em>in</em> these country <em>beer</em> <em>is</em> amazing..", "explanation": null, "document": "Best Beer in Australia & New\u00a0Zealand\nSaturday, April 17, 2010 at 8:21AM\nEarlier this year RateBeer.com announced the best beers of each region of the world.

What\u2019s more, with visionary pub owners like those at the Weldborough Hotel who have beers from every Tassie micro in stock and try to encourage visitors to go and visit them all, it has an industry that seems proud and supportive of its own members. Add in the efforts of the new(ish) team running Lauceston\u2019s Crown Cellars to get quality craft beer into punters' hands and the arrival of more and more new breweries, with Morrison being the latest cab off the ranks, and it\u2019s a very healthy situation.\nSo, without further ado, over to a couple of those responsible for pushing the craft beer revolution in Tasmania.\nWill Tatchell, founder of Van Dieman Brewing\nHow was 2011 for you?\nBusier than 2010. It saw us grow at a sustainable level initially but end up reaching a point where we were struggling with packaging and storage capacity. We ended up purchasing a new bottling line to assist with these problems in 2012. I was generally impressed with the continued level of uptake of craft beer thoughtout not only Tasmania, but also Australia, something that bodes well for the fututre.\nWhat was the highlight of the year?\nThe continued success of our limited release beers. As \u00e2\u0080\u0098exerimental\u2019 batches that obviously aim to be a commercial success, all three this year have hit the mark perfectly and been terribly popular with the consuming public. It makes then more fun to produce when you know that the support for such beers is out there, giving you confidence to push the boundaries even further. Even though we don\u2019t brew for awards, it was great recognition for our Little Hell ESB to be awarded a silver medal at the AIBA earlier in the year.\nAnything that surprised you?\nThe best beer you tasted all year.\nKooinda Black IPA. What a fkn cracker.\nWhat would you most like to see in 2012?\nContinued craft beer uptake by educated consumers not fooled into the marketing bandwagon of the big brewers. A single national Craft Beer body, representing all corners of the industry, pushing forward in support of craft beer.\nAl, manager of the New Sydney Hotel , Hobart\n2011?\n2011 was a fantastic year in Hobart, customers continue to enjoy different beers and the demand for craft beer seems to grow every week, local brewers continue to experiment and evolve, often leading the rest of the country in developing different beers for the market.\nHighlight?\nThe highlight of 2011 was the \u201cPlatinum HOPS\u201d tasting with James from BrewDog. The beers on show were amazing, James was in fine form talking about all thing beer and BrewDog, and making ice cream out of Tokyo stout with liquid nitrogen was quite a sight.\nSurprises?\nPossibly the most surprising thing was the continual rise of cider \u2013 there appears to be no sign of a slowing down for this market. We are very fortunate in Tasmania as apples are plentiful and craft producers like Capt'n Blighs understand what it means to produce quality products from local produce, not just swill for the masses.\nFavourite beer?\nThis is a hard one, do we go with Seven Sheds \u201cSmoking Bagpipes\u201d, a beer made with grain smoked with Tasmanian peat, perhaps it was Van Dieman\u2019s Autumn Hedgerow Ale infused with berries from Will\u2019s farm, can\u2019t leave out Iron House\u2019s big double IPA aptly called \u201cThe Hoff\u201d, and finally we really enjoyed Moo Brew seasonal stout through our very own \u201cHopinator\u201d with a luxurious Tasmanian black truffle dropped in for good measure.\nHopes for 2012?\nFor 2012 we would just like to see the craft beer world continue to evolve and grow. It would be nice if some more venues in this part of the world embraced smaller producers instead of towing the large corporation line, from a Tasmanian point of view we think the local producers will continue to be right up there with the mainland boys in quality and variety. We would love to see more people visit to look at the amazing array of products on offer down here; it\u2019s a great place to sample amazing things made locally.\nPhoto at top shows the hop bines at Two Metre Tall. Look out for more listings for Tasmanian craft beer venues and breweries on The Crafty Pint in 2012.

Beer was the leading wicket-taker in Victorian Premier Cricket last season before joining the Warriors ahead of the 2010-11 season.\nWhat enticed you over to Western Australia?\nThe opportunity of a contract was definitely a major factor. I had been hoping and trying to get that opportunity and it came from somewhere outside Victoria but I didn\u2019t think it was going to come at all.\nDid the reputation of the WACA pitch as a paceman\u2019s wicket make you think twice?\nNot at all. In all forms of the game these days there\u2019s a role for a spinner in all conditions so it didn\u2019t enter my mind.\nFast-forward to next March, what would make you satisfied with your season?\nI just want to get the most out of myself. I have a lot to improve in my game to get me where I want to be. And if I get an opportunity I have to take it.\nWhat\u2019s the best thing about Perth compared to Melbourne?\n(Without hesitation) The weather. No doubt about it.\nWhat makes spin bowling a tougher craft than fast bowling?\n(Laughs) Each to their own! Even though I\u2019m a spinner, I\u2019ve got a bit of a fast bowler\u2019s mentality. At first-class level the conditions make it harder for bowlers in general, so that\u2019s a difficulty we\u2019ve all got in common.\nWhere does the love for cricket come from?\nI was lucky to have a father who played cricket at an older age at a sub-district level in Melbourne and he was the same as me \u2013 a pace bowler until he got to his mid-20s who then turned to spin. When I started bowling spin it just seemed natural having watched someone else do it, and do it well.\nDid St Kilda Cricket Club\u2019s finest spin product \u2013 Shane Warne \u2013 come down to the club much while you were there?\nI played four games with him throughout my journey at St Kilda and each time I learnt so much. He always gave brilliant advice. We had a situation once where we were playing a game and almost forgot to do a warm-up because we were all inside just listening to him talk.\nWho\u2019s your pick: Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey?\nAdam Sandler. It\u2019s got to be Happy Gilmore, surely.\nYou walk into a caf\u00e9 and there\u2019s a vanilla slice and piece of pavlova \u2013 which one do you choose?\nSix-of-one or half-a-dozen of the other I reckon with this one. At the moment I probably shouldn\u2019t have either, but I\u2019d go the vanilla slice. Nothing beats them.\nAnd, finally, the obvious questions\u2026your beer of choice?\nHahn Super Dry comes first, and then probably XXXX Gold.\nThis article is courtesy of Inside Cricket magazine .

If you're low on money, visit the Pylon Lookout for a spectacular view of Sydney Harbour, or, if money's not such an issue, then book a BridgeClimb which takes you to the top of the arches using safety equipment.\nGo for a surf, swim, sunbathe or spectate at Bondi or Manly Beach,. You can also take the two-hour coastal walk from Bondi Golf Course to Coogee Beach, and see Aboriginal rock engravings.\nTake a cruise on Sydney Harbour or a scenic ferry ride to Watsons Bay and head to the beer garden of Doyles Hotel. Picnic in the Royal Botanic Gardens and get interactive at the Powerhouse Museum\nExplore Australia's rich and diverse aquatic life and habitats at the magnificent Sydney Aquarium, where you can \"walk on the ocean floor\" through 145 metres of transparent underwater tunnels.\nStroll around The Rocks, Sydney \u0092s oldest area, which has been tastefully restored. A combination of historic buildings and modern amenities makes this a great area to explore.\nGo shopping! The hub of city shopping is Pitt St Mall, where there are many designer shops. Visit Paddy's Markets in Chinatown for souvenirs and cheap clothing, or shop for fashion in popular innercity areas such as Oxford St, Paddington. For furnishings and antiques try Queen St, Woollahra; and for music CDs try Crown St, Surry Hills.\nThere are so many things to do in Sydney that you will be spoilt for choice.\n"}, {"score": 1064.7731, "uuid": "41515daf-7102-51c0-89fe-d1c0a5386a68", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1020wb-64-18303", "target_hostname": "www.whichfranchise.net.au", "target_uri": "http://www.whichfranchise.net.au/index.cfm?event=getArticle&articleID=307", "page_rank": 1.892213e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> a franchise? <em>What</em> <em>is</em> franchising?", "snippet": "Read more on <em>the</em> benefits of franchising <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em> As well as benefits, franchising can also have some perceived disadvantages.

The weather was perfect and the sun was hot which meant there was a need for a few days in the shade to refresh and rehydrate.\nOur first beer stop was to the Monkey Wizard Brewery located in Riwaka. The brewery has been running for less than two years and appears to have created a significant following with the locals, brewing beers with highly distinctive flavours and aromas. The brewery is run on a very small scale, brewing 600 litre batches, with the beers only available from the brewery in riggers/flagons (1-2L bottles), or via one pub, The Freehouse in Nelson. Their range of beers includes interesting names such as Kiwifruit Wheat, Able Ale and Fat Kelpie Brown Ale \u2013 all of which are excellent tasting.\nFollowing on from Monkey Wizard we headed to the Moutere Inn , which is believed to\nbe New Zealand\u2019s oldest pub having first been established in the 1850s. The pub was very popular in the 1970\u2019s with the large local population of agricultural workers, looking for a drop after a hard days work, however it fell into decline in the 90\u2019s. In 2008 a group of real beer enthusiasts purchased the pub and sought to turn it into a venue providing a range of great tasting beers from breweries throughout the Nelson area and wider New Zealand.\nIf you\u2019re keen on mainstream beers you will still be well looked after, however if you\u2019re after something slightly different, the wide selection\u00a0 of brews will leave your thirst quenched with around\n12 beers on tap, including a couple of hand pumped cask ales. While the beers on offer vary throughout the year, the beer coasters allow drinkers to rate their beers, with higher scoring beers put on tap more regularly. The pub is not only great for the beers on tap but also the locals it attracts, including a bloke by the name of Archie, who while we were there sold us some freshly dug spuds, garlic and capsicum to whip up our dinner \u2013 fresher, more tasty vegies I have not had.\nAfter a stop at Neudorf Winery to pick up a couple of wines for something different we made our way to the Golden Bear Brewery located on the wharf at golden Mapua \u2013 a fantastic spot on a sunn\ny day overlooking rich blue water. Golden Bear had 9 brews on offer, appearing to specialise it beers with real hop flavour. The brewery has been operating for just over 2 years, however with its smart looking setup you can see they have established themselves so they can go places. While tasting paddles are available I recommend the Toad Hop as a one off beer, or the Bear Trappe Belgian, which is a hand bottled, limited release golden Belgian ale brewed with black-boy peaches.\nAfter a couple of days had passed and the flagons we had bought were empty it was time to visit a few other spots to refill the fridge. Heading to Stoke near Nelson we went to the McCashin\u2019s brewery. The brewery is owned by the McCashins who were famous for the Mac\u2019s range of beers that ex-All Black Terry McCashin established in the 80s. Mac\u2019s developed a national fan base before then being sold to Lion Nathan. The new \u2018Stoke\u2019 range has been created by Terry\u2019s son Dean who obviously has a love for\nthe family profession. Three Stoke beers are on offer including Gold, Dark and the great tasting Amber. As well as the beers, the brewery also makes a wide range of great tasting ciders which are highly recommended.\nHeading not far down the road and just around the corner we hit the Sprig and Fern brewery , where we caught up with owner David Barrett. The brewery has been running for 14 years, formally as Tasman brewery and appears to be growing fairly rapidly brewing beer for its Sprig and Fern branded pubs located throughout the Nelson/Tasman region.\u00a0 David owns Sprig and Fern with his business partner Tracy Banner who has significant brewing experience, previously as head brewer for Mac\u2019s during its\nhigh growth days and also with Lion Nathan at the Speights plant in Dunedin.\nWorking with David they have produced a range of 14+ beers (including seasonals) that can be found in any of the Sprig and Fern pubs. The business seems to be onto a winner with it appearing strongly endorsed by locals and tourists alike with a something for everyone approach producing an easy drinking lager and pilsner to the more testing IPA and beaut Scotch Ale and Porter. While we were at the brewery David also took us for a bit of a tour to see the \u2018business end\u2019 of the brewery \u2013 with over 5,000 litres of Pilsner at various stages of the brewing cycle every week you can see demand and patronage at the various Sprig and Fern hotels must be high.\nAlthough we didn\u2019t quite manage to fit in a visit to a Sprig and Fern pub, speaking to David they sound like they are well worth the visit. With a focus on providing the traditional pub experience (no TV\u2019s!) to gather, have a beer and enjoy a bite, it will definitely be on the list for a visit next time I get back to NZ.\nWith time running out this was the end of our tour \u2013 the sad thing was that there were 7 other breweries within 2 hours of each other that I didn\u2019t get to visit\u2026at least it is a great excuse for another visit!If you do make a trip to NZ for a spot of beer tasting I highly recommend a visit to the beertourist.co.nz website \u2013 an excellent resource on the burgeoning craft brewing segment in New Zealand!\n"}, {"score": 1062.4202, "uuid": "b1b994e4-900d-5518-8222-1cd05bb4de5a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-68-14301", "target_hostname": "midgie.list.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://midgie.list.co.uk/articles/midgie-bites/sort:views/show:100/", "page_rank": 1.2047735e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Midgie Bites | Articles (<em>most</em> <em>popular</em>, 100 per page) | <em>The</em> Midgie", "snippet": "Their songs rattle with smoky vocals\u2026 This sweet orange fizz <em>is</em> Scotland&#x27;s second drink, after whisky, and <em>is</em> so <em>popular</em> that this <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> only countries <em>in</em> <em>the</em> world where Coca Cola <em>is</em> not <em>the</em> biggest selling soft beverage.

For example try Bee Sting, or Beez Neez - the Honey is barely detectable, if at all.\nUnfortunately the beer was under carbonated and there was practically no head, consequently it wasn't that inviting - despite the great pale straw colour it had.\nThe taste is a little on the sweet side and not overly complex, that said it was very enjoyable and you could easily enjoy a number of these in a row now that the warmer weather has kicked in (ie:\u00a0Sping).\nHoney Wheat is great for a Honey Beer although not a show stopper as a Wheat beer.

Next best option is to grab a light beer \u2026 right? Not so fast\u2014 before cracking open that ice cold Natty Light, consider this lighter option may not really be a healthier choice.\nThe New King of Beers \u2014 Why It Matters\nPhoto by Marissa Angell\nWhen Coors Light knocked Budweiser off the podium as the most popular beer in America, for the first time, light beer dominated the best-beer ring. Created out of people\u2019s concern that beer makes them fat , light beer boomed onto the scene in the 1970s when Miller Brewing Co. developed a low-calorie brewing method . Now, light beer makes up almost half the total market share. Re-named Miller Lite and marketed alongside the slogan \u201cgreat taste, less filling,\u201d light beer was promoted as the answer for avoiding that beer belly.\nBut the medical community isn\u2019t ready to raise a glass to that just yet. Instead, they\u2019re concerned people may be confusing low-carb with low- alcohol beers, or they believe light and low-carb beers have fewer health risks (thus drinking more). Others may drink even drink light and low-carb beer when they shouldn\u2019t be consuming any alcoholic beverages [ 1 ].\nNo Beer Is Created Equal \u2014 The Answer/Debate\nBefore ordering a light draft over regular, it\u2019s important to note the differences between light, low-carb, and low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beers. Light beer has been brewed to be lower in alcohol , lower in calories, or lower in both (depending on the brand), while low-carb beer has only been brewed to remove carbohydrates (but could have the same alcohol content). And since higher levels of alcohol means more calories, there is little difference in calorie content between low-carb and regular beers [ 2 ]. Similarly, if a light beer is lower in alcohol, people may knock a few more back than if they\u2019d stuck with the original\u2014 in the end, consuming more calories and possibly more alcohol.\nIn addition, light beer\u2014 albeit lower in calories\u2014 is only lower in comparison to a brewery\u2019s leading brand of regular beer. Even when comparing Bud Light to Coors Light , Bud Light has 110 calories and 6.6 grams of carbohydrates per 12 oz. versus. Coors Light with 102 calories and 5.0 grams of carbohydrates. So the meaning of \u201clight\u201d varies between brands.\nSimilar to wine, a moderate consumption of beer may have some health benefits , but those pluses might not all extend to light versions. Studies have linked the highest antioxidant activity to lagers and dark ales, as opposed to light or non-alcoholic beers, so looks like we\u2019re out of healthy luck [ 3 ]. Likewise, dark beers also contain more iron than light colored or low-alcoholic beers [ 4 ].\nSo while research has yet to show specific health benefits in choosing a low-carb beer, the jury is also out on light beer [ 5 ]. But at the end of the night, a moderate consumption of regular beer is probably (okay, definitely) still a safer bet than a 12 pack of the \u201clight\u201d stuff.\nThe Takeaway\nWell, not necessarily. While light beer can be lower in calories, carbs, and alcohol, that slightly smaller buzz may cause drinkers to consume even more (and thus more calories) than if drinking heavier beer!\nFurther Resources\n"}, {"score": 1036.008, "uuid": "2c35a3f1-dcba-51e7-8f22-b08b17680f2f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200wb-32-16745", "target_hostname": "www.findingtheuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.findingtheuniverse.com/2010/06/australian-beer.html", "page_rank": 1.2306858e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Australian <em>beer</em>", "snippet": "Low carb <em>beer</em> <em>is</em> increasingly <em>popular</em> <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em>, with all <em>the</em> major <em>beers</em> available <em>in</em> a low carb option.

Naturally, this depends on <em>the</em> state you are <em>in</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Australian beer\nEven though I\u2019ve now been in Germany for nearly a month, I do not believe that sufficient research has been undertaken yet to warrant an entry on the fine beer based beverages of this country. I know that kolsch is the local beer from Cologne, and that beer is exceptionally cheap, but perhaps the fact of the latter has restricted serious scientific research into the substance itself. So instead I will witter at you about something I did learn about on my trip around Australia, that being Australian beer.\nIn the UK, if you talk about Australian beer, probably only two beers will come to mind. First, Fosters, and second, Castlemaine XXXX.\nThe four X is a well known beer over in Oz, particularly in Queensland, although it is mostly drunk in the XXXX Gold variety, which is a mid strength lower carb beer. Fosters, on the other hand, as it is sold in the UK, is nigh on impossible to find. The company, Fosters, are responsible for brewing a large number of Australian beers, but the actual Fosters Lager as enjoyed (well, drunk at least) worldwide isn\u2019t a common drink in it\u2019s native land.\nSome Australian beer trivia for you before the actual beer itself. Beer, when sold by the 24 pack of cans, or small glass bottles known as stubbies, is referred to as a slab. When enjoying your beverage, most people would employ a stubby holder, a sort of neoprene wetsuit for your beer that stops your hand from warming your beer unnecessarily, and your beer from cooling your hand in a vexing manner. Low carb beer is increasingly popular in Australia, with all the major beers available in a low carb option.\nEnough with the beer trivia already. What beer does one actually drink in Australia? Naturally, this depends on the state you are in. The most popular (and depending on where you are, looked down upon) beer is Victoria Bitter. This is brewed by Fosters, and there are some definite similarities in the logo. It is estimated that a slab a second of this product is sold in Australia. Some people swear by it, to others it is the equivalent of Carling (an upstanding British lager to some\u2026 to others.. you get the point).\nThe various states therefore have their own foibles. In Western Australia a brand of beer known as Emu is popular. We couldn\u2019t find Emu anywhere else in Australia, and to be fair, most Western Australian inhabitants looked at us a bit strangely when we cracked open the tins of Emu Export. Still, it was drinkable. If it\u2019s not Emu then it is Swan. Both are brewed at the same brewery.\nQueenslanders are big fans of the aforementioned XXXX Gold, which is usually just referred to as Gold. New South Wales is the home of Tooheys, who make the antlered beer known as Tooheys New (first brewed in 1930, but renamed to New in the eighties.) Victoria is obviously the home of that fine beverage, Victoria Bitter, one of the only beers to achieve wide spread Australian penetration. Victorians also enjoy a tipple or two of Carlton Draught.\nSouth Australia is the home of my favourite Australian brewery, Coopers, maker of a variety of fine bottle matured beers, and the only family owned brewery left in Australia, the rest now being owned by either Fosters or Lion Nathan. The most intriguing, and almost guaranteed to give you a hangover, of the Coopers bottled beer, is the Coopers\nSparkling Ale, which has to be one of my all time favourite beers. Coming with a spangly red top and red label, and an exciting sediment due to the bottle maturing process, this fine beer weighs in at a brain melting 5.8%. Not to be taken lightly.\nThe Northern Territory doesn\u2019t appear to have too much of a preference for one beer over another, often VB is the beer of choice. Instead they are famous for the Northern Territory stubby, a beer bottle that hold two litres of beer. After all, who cares about the beer in the bottle when the bottle has two litres of beer in it. Right? I thought so.\nFinally, in terms of beer drunk where, perhaps the most interesting beer divide occurs on the island of Tasmania. In the North of the state one drinks Boags, brewed in the town of Launceston at the North of the island. In the South, you drink Cascade, brewed in Hobart, at the South end of the island. Cascade Brewery is the oldest brewery in Australia, although the company is now owned by, you guessed it, Fosters. There is a line at which point one stops drinking the beer from the other end of the island. Across this line you shall not tread.\nThat was a brief tour of what beer you could expect to find where in Australia. But the story doesn\u2019t end there. Now you need to be able to order the beer, and it\u2019s not as simple as just meandering into a pub and asking for a pint (well, ok, it is. But there is more to it.)\nMost beer in Australia is not drunk by the pint. When you\u2019re in the outback at a roadhouse (think service station filled with cowboys) you\u2019re more likely than not to be presented with either a stubby or a can. You would be wise to take along your own stubby holder. In pubs, and depending on where you are, beer comes in either half pint, two third pint, or pint glasses. Naturally, these are not referred to as halves and two thirds, that would be much too easy. In the majority of Australia, a half pint is called either a middy or a pot. Except in South Australia, where it\u2019s called a schooner. And two thirds of a pint is referred to mostly everywhere as a schooner, except in South Australia, where confusingly it\u2019s called a pint. Luckily, a pint is pretty much a pint everywhere, although you could try and confuse South Australian bar tenders by ordering an imperial pint. At your own risk, I hasten to add.\nThe schooner is actually a pretty clever idea for a beer glass. You don\u2019t end up with that annoying last few mouthfuls of warm beer from the pint sitting around (unless you drink quickly that is). And you can drink more of them, making larger rounds a more feasible idea. Cheers all round.\nSo, Australian beer, a brief study, a years worth of adventure wrapped up in a nice cold refreshing blog entry. Oh, one last thing. Nearly every bottled beer in Australia comes with a twist cap. No more fiddling around trying to find a bottle opener or trying to work out how to open a beer with a lighter. Excellent work my Antipodean friends, any innovation that gets me to my beer faster is a winner..\n"}, {"score": 1028.7513, "uuid": "75b20704-c3a3-5c3d-9d27-b4ee5bb55bbe", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-70-13970", "target_hostname": "www.gourmetgiftbaskets.com", "target_uri": "http://www.gourmetgiftbaskets.com/Twelve-Beer-Bucket-Gift-Basket.asp", "page_rank": 1.363326e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Around <em>The</em> World <em>Beer</em> Bucket - 12 <em>Beers</em>: Imported <em>Beer</em> Gift Baskets, Foreign", "snippet": ". - One of <em>the</em> best pepperoni&#x27;s <em>the</em> world has to offer, this pepperoni <em>is</em> made with love <em>in</em> Vermont.", "explanation": null, "document": "Loading ...\nDescription\nThis beer gift basket has no rival!

The modern beer infrastructure is very hard on the planet with conventional brewing techniques leaving behind huge carbon footprints. Fortunately, environmental - as well as economic - concerns have many breweries turning to greener brewing methods.\nTwo examples caught my attention this week. The first is the Anheuser-Busch Inbev Houston brewery in Texas. In May the brewery was hooked up to a trash heap . It\u2019s better than it sounds. A six mile pipe-line transports biogas from a landfill to the brewery where it uses steam energy to help run the brewery. I don\u2019t pretend to completely understand how the technology works but smarter people than me say that this will greatly reduce A-B\u2019s fossil fuel usage.

bottle shops around the country.\nWhen Burleigh Brewing launched its Duke beer in August 2007, the German-style lager could only be found within a four-hour-drive radius of the Gold Coast brewery.\nFour years and a swag of world championship medals later, the brewery's six labels can be bought in capital cities throughout the country, with export interest coming from around the world.\nThe brewery's success is just reward for the hard work of Peta and Brennan Fielding, the Coast couple who have longed dreamed of a craft beer business to call their own.\nAdvertisement: Story continues below\nTheir 10-man operation now produces five times as much beer per year as they did in their first 12 months of operation.\nAnd their beers are stocked at large chain stores such as Dan Murphy's and 1st Choice.\nThey have also infiltrated the big brewer-dominated taps of many CBD hotels and restaurants, even producing house beers for Aria and the Pig 'n' Whistle.\nIt has been a long road for the couple to walk.\nThe pair met in Hawaii 20 years ago and, after marrying, Brisbane-born Peta brought her brewmaster husband to Australia in the hope of starting their business.\n\"Brennan's from Hawaii so I wasn't going to be taking him anywhere that was too far from good surf,\" she said.\n\"I do remember coming back to Australia on a holiday one time and Brennan and I were standing on Burleigh Beach and looking out at the ocean and we took a big breath and said 'I could live here'.\n\"From that moment we knew where it was going to be.\"\nAfter years of planning and development, the couple opened the brewery on August 1, 2007.\nBrennan, who has been working as a brewmaster for 17 years and worked at the Oxford 152 brewery when he first moved to the country, said he believed beer drinkers had been crying out for a local choice in the Queensland market.\n\"We felt that the industry had gone through some cycles and consumers were going to really start demanding choices of beer and not just national brands any more,\" he said.\n\"If you travel to England, or Germany or America, every single town has a brewery supplying local beer to their people.\n\"There was always going to be the big suppliers as well but the craft influence was the only growing part of the beer industry.\"\nBrennan said the restrictions on the craft brewing industry made it difficult for craft beers to prosper in the state.\nAn issue that has been raised before by beer expert Matt Kirkegaard.\nhttp://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/restaurants-and-bars/beer-sales-slump-why-are-queenslanders-losing-their-taste-for-the-amber-fluid-20110217-1axf2.html\nGetting into pubs and bottle shops has proved very difficult, while the cost and labour required to start a brewery was \"mind-blowingly intensive\".\nOn top of that, state legislation that does not allow craft breweries to sell their beer at markets, like wineries can, prevented another form of connection between brewer and consumer.\n\"I find that to be a little bit crazy,\" he said.\n\"The government hasn't done anything in Queensland to make it any easier for craft brewers.\n\"[If they wanted to help craft brewers] they could probably take the exact model that they did with the wine industry 30 years ago, where they lowered taxes and they went into industry development mode, as opposed to risk management.\"\nSlowly but surely, the brand has made it into pubs and bottle shops along the east coast, with Brennan attributing venue operators as leading the way into getting people to taste new beers.\nRather than growing through a national ad campaign, Peta said the company had spread by word of mouth.\n\"We're about reaching one mouth at a time, and one taste bud at a time, and people discovering our products and telling other people about it because they really like it,\" she said.\nThe limited initial reach of the brewery's two Duke beers was by design.\nThe couple made the beer as a nod to the true traditions of German lager brewing where the beer is meant to be consumed as fresh as possible and as close to the source as possible.\nThis confined the sale of the beer to the southeast Queensland region, in a move to develop a local beer for local people to call their own.\n\"We made the very specific decision that the duke brands would only be available from within what we started to call 'Dukeland', which is an area four hours around the brewery because the Germans would say beer shouldn't be available more than a horse and cart ride from the brewery,\" she said.\n\"We were getting so many enquiries outside of Dukeland's borders that we developed other brands that we could let go further afield.\"\nWhat has followed is a string of world championship medal-winning beers such as the American-style 28 Pale Ale, Australia's first \"no-carb\" Bighead and the English session beer Brennan named after Peta, My Wife's Bitter.\nThe brewery's Heffe German wheat beer won the best beer in Queensland at last year's Ekka.\nMy Wife's Bitter started as one of the brewery's 500 carton limited edition beers but proved so popular it began distribution as a permanent product this week.\nPeta said she was not offended by the title of Brennan's beer.\n\"When Brendan and I were partners in the Hawaiian brewery our two children had a beer named after each of them when they were born,\" she said.\n\"I used to have a bit of a whinge about that and say 'I married you and I had those kids, where's my beer?' So I got 'My Wife's Bitter'!\"\nThe names of two of the brewery's popular flavours, 28 Pale Ale and Bighead, also have inspirations that hit close to home.\nThe pale ale is named after a famous period of 28 straight days of perfect swell at Burleigh Beach during the 1970s.\nWhile the the no-carb flavour is named after the region's \"big headland\".\nThe interest in Burleigh beers overseas has increased over the past years but the pair have no plans to start exporting.\nThey are more focused on producing the best possible product for locals.\n\"I know all the news is that, in general, beer is in decline, but for the four years we've been going we've been experiencing wonderfully healthy double digit growth rates every year,\" she said.\n\"Obviously there is some action going on in some part of the market, it's just not in those more-generic, mass-produced products.\"\nFollow Brisbane Times on Twitter @brisbanetimes\n"}, {"score": 1005.1358, "uuid": "6d346b48-de5b-516b-b7f7-bb40634191b0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1212wb-13-08184", "target_hostname": "connect.krishna.com", "target_uri": "http://connect.krishna.com/node/3721", "page_rank": 1.1815134e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Non-alcoholic <em>beer</em>... <em>is</em> it offerable? | Krishna.com", "snippet": "<em>The</em> way you describe it I think that this stuff you mention <em>is</em> not <em>beer</em>, <em>beer</em> means fermented.

I know that such a beverage should not be encouraged, but no matter how much one drink this particular alternative libation, one can not get drunk. Some people who came to Krishna consciousness liked the taste of beer, despite the alcoholic content.\nJaya Radhe!\nMy take on it is that it\nMy take on it is that it seems to me that this beverage would only remind one of alcohol. And despite alcohol content, the beverage seems to still be steeped in the mode of ignorance. For example, a child, who generally has a taste for food in the mode of goodness, I would say would most likely not like the taste of this product. Most devotees previously have drunken alcohol in the past, and for some they were alcoholics, and it seems that the better method to substitute alcohol with Krishna Consciousness, instead of non alcoholic beer.\nAs practitioners of Krishna Consciousness it is best to somehow or other surround ourselves with sensory items that are in the mode of goodness and thus offer those items to Krishna.\nMon, 09/15/2008 - 14:21 \u2014 madanbhakta\nWell, it is a little\nWell, it is a little difficult for me to fathom, because for example, cheese would be considered terrible for people ayurvedically (because it is aged). Despite this understanding, Western devotees still use cheese in their diet. Or soy sauce (which is fermented, as well as vinegar) and soy products are seen with a very suspicious light by many devotees, or chocolate... Should one remove carob from one's diet as well because it reminds them of chocolate (minding that Srila Prabhupada never liked carob and called it 'hippy food')? Chocolate tastes good, but it is not in the mode of goodness whatsoever. Same with soy products.\nAnd traditionally, all plants in the nightshade family, such as eggplants and tomatoes, were seen as asattvic. Honey should not be cooked because it becomes toxic ayurvedically, but devotees do it.\nMany devotees drink soda, chips, hard candies and popcorn. Beck's non alcoholic beer (which I have tried long before) is in my opinion, healthier than soda (it only contains water, barley malt and hops) and has no yeast so there is no fermentation process, and thus no alcohol is really produced (unlike other non alcoholic beers where it is produced, and then the alcohol is vacuumed). I drink Krakus because I like the taste, although it is called \"Instant Coffee Substitute.\" It is made with roasted chicory root, barley, rye, and beet roots. Just because I consume something that tastes like coffee, does not necessarily mean that I wish to or want to drink the caffeinated substitute, nor do I hanker for caffeine.. my attachment is merely of taste alone, and I offer that to Krishna.\nAnd then there are devotees who cook too much fried foods, salty foods, too many sweets, etc. Normally, these would be considered rajasic; however, because they were offered, they are still okay to eat for devotees.\nAccording to Ayurveda, devotees should not mix fruit with dairy or grains, but so many devotees make fruit salad (which I have heard Srila Prabhupada did not like) or make pastries with fruit...\nBut I do not say that it is something for the majority of peoples to drink, especially those who have alcoholically inclined past or present. But with all our material attachments and offenses, I do not see anything particularly wrong with beer (beer is just a fermented, malt beverage - alcoholic or otherwise) if there is no alcohol and someone who has never drunk alcohol likes the taste, since bitter foods are necessary to stimulate and continue digestion.\nBut these dietary laws do get nitpicky sometimes for me even... I was told by a devotee for example, that I should not cook with pasta unless I made it by myself, as well as that I should never use something frozen or canned (I use canned coconut milk quite a bit in my cooking). I guess I am just confused. To me, the idea of offering everything to the Lord is the whole meaning of sattvic foods, or even foods due to saltiness or spiciness are rajasic; offering in love and devotion is the whole point, and what is offerable and what is not is more secondary.\nI just am not convinced...\nHaribol!\nI am little confused why you asked this question, seems that you already have you answer.\nBut as the Mahabharata states, \"arguments fail to reveal truth.\n- mahajano yena gatah sa panthah better to just follow the path that the great devotees have given.\" In my personal life with Krishna Consciousness I have not found any experienced devotee advocating this path.\nMon, 09/15/2008 - 23:03 \u2014 abrennan\nNitpicky is an understatement ; )\nMy experience has been that for every person I ask I get a slightly different answer, based on their bias. (The three modes of material nature). If you ask me I'll tell you my opinion with my own bias of course. : )\nWhat you have observed is true. There is some confusion. There is no list with definitions and glossary to satisfy us. That's why we end up asking others. I am not so sure that asking a lot of people is a good way to work out the answers to these things. We should seek the advice of our seniors and Guru.\nIt seems there are possibly two types of things under discussion here.\nOne is what you would like to drink and eat, compared to what Krishna would like to eat or drink.\nThe other is the difference between what will or won't be allowed to offered at a temple compared to you at home.\nThe things that are offered should fall into the catagory of what Krishna likes to eat or drink.\nTemples are very strict about offering, you might not be so strict at home.\nI bet there would be no temple that would offer beer or non-alcohol beer. I don't think they would offer 'soda' either. (Carbonated drinks are particularly unhealthy form of beverages.)\nThe way you describe it I think that this stuff you mention is not beer, beer means fermented. It sounds like soda flavoured with something. Now here is Australia Ginger Beer is very popular, we all made it at home when we were kids. What you describe is something like that I think. Or Root Beer which is again seems to be no beer at all.\nOffering is about developing love and surrender. What is offered should reflect that it is not secondary it is equal.\nI say that to find out what Krishna likes is the best way. Now what I like or what you like.\nIf you knew me, and you invited me for lunch you would not offer me something that looks like beer and tastes like beer because I don't like beer. You would probably ask what I liked and if you really liked me you would offer me that.\nI think (bias alert) that Krishna doesn't like beer or anything like it. So I wouldn't offer him beer or beer tasting things.\nOfferings at home is are not usually as strict and opulant as the Temple. The job of the temple is to set the standard. At the temple they like to make things from fresh as possible food.\nSo if it's not beer and it is it's soda, I would still say it is not to be offered. Soda is far from fresh.\nI would suggest seeking advice from a Guru if you are not satisfied.\nFunniliy enough, we should accept the answer that is true, not that one that satisfies us. That's how we got here in the first place.\nI feel like I am just rambling in now so I'll stop. I hope I am helping some.\nHare Krishna\nI've heard that Balaram\nI've heard that Balaram likes beer though (Varuni's honey)... XD\nIn any case, yes, I do understand. But I do say, does Krishna like chips, homemade vegetarian sushi and tofu? I really doubt Krishna would like the bland taste of tofu... And sushi, when it is reminiscent of fish.\nWith soda, although perhaps Krishna at the temple does not like it, He does seem to accept the soda offered by congregational devotees, especially at home programs and celebratory occasions, and there are many devotees who are much higher in sadhana than I am who seem to enjoy soda and chips every now and then. And then there's cheese... Cheese is aged and not very good for you, unless it is curd...\nBut if we offered only what Krishna liked, then we would be eating kheer and ghee-soaked foodstuffs every day! And that can not be healthy for us; God can eat as much ghee and kheer as He wishes, and He still looks attractive while doing it. And although I know that Krishna does love dairy products, I must limit my dairy intake, else I gain weight very easily.\nIt's still all confusing, and I just like to think that that Krishna enjoys consuming the devotion of the person who wishes to enjoy His remnants, rather than the foodstuff itself. Besides, I know that devotees can also get attached to whether a foodstuff tastes better than another's, although both cooks may have been cooking with bhakti towards Krishna.\nThere are many things that we offer that are not fresh, like cheese, pasta, spring rolls (if I make them from spring roll wrappers bought from the supermarket), tofu and soy sauce, and canned coconut milk (a semi-staple in my food diet). I want to learn to vegetarianise some Asian dishes (as a birthed Asian myself), but I can not replicate tastes unless I use soy sauce, which is aged to a degree in itself.\nIf some substance is offered with love and devotion to Krishna, even if it is a soy product or chocolate (many devotees that I know are very biased against soy and chocolate; I do not eat chocolate myself, but I do believe that Krishna will still see the sincerity of people when they offer Him chocolate), would Krishna not accept it?\nIn any case, I think asking a spiritual master would be best. Although beer is just an example, to cut out things that are aged and what Krishna may not like may include cheese (exception of curd), soy sauce, soy cheese and my beloved soy milk... XD (There's my attachments again!)\nOn a separate but related note, I have heard that I can not offer pasta or any dish I have made from using cans (like chickpeas or coconut milk) towards Krishna directly, and thus can instead offer it to Srila Prabhupada. Is this true?\nFri, 09/19/2008 - 13:24 \u2014 Nity\u0101nandaChandra\nHaribol, I was hoping that\nHaribol, I was hoping that your reply to my comment but that is ok, \"But as the Mahabharata states, \"arguments fail to reveal truth.\n- mahajano yena gatah sa panthah better to just follow the path that the great devotees have given.\" In my personal life with Krishna Consciousness I have not found any experienced devotee advocating this path.\"\nSo our process is to follow the footsteps of previous acharyas, whatever path they set we follow and then examine its benefits from that perspective. Simply stated, we do not manufacture our own standards by logic or any other reasoning including scripture. Regarding your question, no actually nothing do we offered to Krishna directly it is always done via medium of the guru, spiritual master. Yes there are some items that are not ok to offer to the Deity form of the Lord as a standard of Deity worship but there are items that we can offer just to Guru asking him to offer the item to Krishna. There are even items that we offer to Krishna that we cannot partake of, such as Betel nut, we do not take Betel nut as per acharya's instruction due to the intoxicating affect of Betel nut. There is also a plant seed that is offered to Krishna in His shila form. We do not eat the plant seed, although it is prasadam, because it is extremely poisonous and can cause immediate death.\nHare Krishna\n"}, {"score": 999.5736, "uuid": "b3af8d94-c1f8-505c-9070-524c168fa43b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0809wb-28-09330", "target_hostname": "foodreference.about.com", "target_uri": "http://foodreference.about.com/od/bar_beverage/a/What-Is-Guinness.htm", "page_rank": 1.2115715e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Guinness - <em>What</em> <em>is</em> Guinness?", "snippet": "Today, Guinness <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> <em>most</em> successful <em>beer</em> brands and <em>is</em> sold <em>in</em> over 100 countries world wide.

The deep color and caramelized flavor that are characteristic of Guinness come from barley that has been roasted but not malted . The thick, creamy head that Guinness is well known for is achieved by mixing the beer with nitrogen, which creates smaller bubbles and thus a thicker head.\nAlthough the company is now based in London, Guinness was first produced in Dublin at the brewery of Arthur Guinness in the late 18th century. Today, Guinness is one of the most successful beer brands and is sold in over 100 countries world wide.\nA Meal in a Cup\nGuinness long ago earned the nickname \"meal in a cup\" because of it's thick, filling nature. Surprisingly, at 198 calories per pint, Guinness contains fewer calories than most juices or even milk. In the 1920's, Guinness used the slogan \"Guinness is good for you,\" after consumers reported an enhanced feeling of wellbeing after drinking a pint. Due to restrictions on medical claims, this slogan has long since been abandoned. Regardless of whether the company advertises it, Guinness contains a surprising amount of healthful antioxidants similar to those found in fruits and vegetables. These antioxidants have even shown to help slow the deposit of bad cholesterol on artery walls.\nGuinness Varieties\nGuinness is sold world wide and brewed in over 50 countries. The available varieties and alcoholic content vary from country to country. These are a few of the most popular varieties of Guinness available on the market today.\nGuinness Draught - Guinness Draught is sold in kegs, bottles, and widget cans (with a special nitrogen \"widget\" for an extra creamy head) and contains an alcoholic content between 4.1 and 4.3 percent alcohol by volume (ABV).\nGuinness Original / Extra Stout - One of the most widely sold versions, Guinness Original/Extra Stout contains about 4.3 percent ABV in Europe and slightly more in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan.\nGuinness Foreign Extra Stout - This variety has a higher alcohol percent by volume than most other varieties of Guinness, reaching up to 7.5% ABV in Europe and the United States and up to 8% ABV in Singapore. To make this variety of Guinness, an unfermented hop mixture is shipped from Dublin to foreign countries where it is then fermented locally. The variance in fermentation processes and techniques account for the varying alcohol levels.\nIn addition to these three main varieties, Guinness has created a large array of other brews throughout its history, including a number of limited-edition stouts.\nGuinness as an Ingredient\nGuinness has come to represent Irish culture and cuisine and is therefore used to infuse an Irish feel into many culinary creations. In addition to being used as a cultural prop ingredient, Guinness lends a unique, rich, caramelized flavor when added to food. One of the most popular dishes to use Guinness is Irish stew . Adding Guinness to the stew creates a fuller, more complex gravy. Guinness has also been used as a leavening agent in soda breads and scones, and even as a novelty ingredient in cupcakes. In recent years, Guinness floats (Guinness poured over vanilla ice cream) have become a popular treat around St. Patricks Day.\nRecipes with Guinness\n"}, {"score": 998.00134, "uuid": "91a57f50-59d2-5f13-b77d-a6b45dae5fb1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0905wb-28-08167", "target_hostname": "www.boozemonkey.com", "target_uri": "http://www.boozemonkey.com/profile/kinlochwines", "page_rank": 1.1901248e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Kinloch Wines | BoozeMonkey :: Wine &amp; <em>Beer</em> | <em>Australia</em> &amp; NZ", "snippet": "Our chardonnay <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> wine sold from our cellar door - well balanced with fruit and oak.", "explanation": null, "document": "Kinloch Degustration Wine Dinner\nDEGUSTATION WINE DINNER\u000bThe marriage of fine wines with fine food\u000b Kinloch Wines and Rennies at Acheron invite you to a dining experience to remember!\u000b\u000bChefs love showing off their talents, and one way in which they can best do this is by offering a degu...\nOctober 3, 2011\nKinloch Wines has added a new profile photo.\nOctober 3, 2011\nKinloch Wines Thanks for your comment TDG, I will be emailing you our product list for the freelisting on Thomsons Drink Guide.

The Old Harkers Arms (No. 36)\nWhat Brunning & Price tried to do with a derelict old canalside warehouse a number of years ago was to create a \u2018city of London\u2019 pub in the heart of Chester. What they\u2019ve actually created is better than that \u2013 primarily because it\u2019s not full of bankers ! Unless of course you count crumply-suited provincial mortgage consultants and pensions advisors, who along with estate agents, solicitors and various other \u2018professional\u2019 types seem to have made this place their second home. This is Chester\u2019s busiest pub for a reason though. It\u2019s very well run, the wide range of real ales is always in excellent condition and the atmosphere is usually lively. It can even be full on a Monday or Tuesday night. Downsides are the \u2018aloof\u2019 disposition of some of the staff, the draconian policy on closing (you\u2019re often forced out of the door by 11:30 !) and the high prices. Still a fantastic boozer though.\n3. The Carlton Tavern (No. 5)\nQuite simply, this is Chester\u2019s best community pub \u2013 a street corner boozer that\u2019s been brought into the 21st century by a dynamic, hard working landlord who\u2019s been given the freedom to develop the business by a brewery (Hyde\u2019s of Manchester) which is perhaps a little more forward thinking than most. It\u2019s a pub that\u2019s popular with the locals but good enough to draw customers from a much wider area as well. This is particularly the case when one their famous twice-yearly beer festivals is being held. Excellent real ales from Hyde\u2019s (naturally) and other Manchester brewers such as Marble and Allgate\u2019s are usually available, as are beers from \u2018Chester Ales\u2019 \u2013 a Saltney based micro-brewer in which the Carlton has an interest. Across the river and up the hill \u2013 it\u2019s well worth the short walk from the town centre, people.\n2. The Cellar (No. 45)\nWe\u2019re now in the realms of pub perfection and we had a very difficult job separating these last two. I was trying to find a word that best describes the Cellar \u2013 and I think the word is modern. This place represents evolution \u2013 maybe it\u2019s even the forerunner of the next generation of Chester pubs. Whether or not the craft beer revolution will ever completely eclipse the traditional brewers is open for debate, but the Cellar certainly has more in common with a Brewdog bar for instance than the \u2018Olde Dog & Duck\u2019,* for here you will find beer heaven. On one side of the bar, there are three constantly changing cask ales, usually from local micro-brewers, which are always in perfect condition. These are complimented by an array of keg fonts across the rest of the bar carrying a wide range of imported German and Belgian beers, from black lagers and wheat beers to strawberry lambics** and unusual ciders. In addition, the fridges are well stocked with more Belgian beers and some quite frankly \u2018wacky\u2019 offerings from the rest of the world and beyond. Add to the equation, some high quality live music and late opening at the weekends and what you get is the perfect city centre pub. This is the future. Others will follow their lead.\n* this place doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 it\u2019s a cipher \u2013 a stereotypical \u2018traditional English pub\u2019 reference point. Don\u2019t look for it in the list. It\u2019s not there !\n** I\u2019m making this up.\n1. The Pied Bull (No. 86) & (Beer Festival)\nAnd finally ! If Harkers (No. 36) is a \u2018City of London\u2019 pub in the heart of Chester, then the Pied Bull is a \u2018City of Chester\u2019 pub in the heart of Chester ! If that makes any sense. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it epitomises Chester \u2013 ancient architecture within the famous city walls, staffed by friendly local people and it epitomises a modern English pub \u2013 focus very much on the traditional pint rather than, ahem \u2018poncey\u2019 beers, but with the net cast wider than the traditional brewers. The place was wrestled from the grip of the appalling PubCo, Punch Taverns a few years ago and the business has steadily been developed since then by focusing on providing quality real ales. This philosophy even extends to brewing beer on the premises. A small micro-brewery is in operation in the cellar, producing a range of \u2018Pied Bull\u2019 brews, one or more of which is usually available at the bar \u2013 and they\u2019re not afraid to experiment either. For example, I think their \u2018Raging Bull\u2019 is the hoppiest ale I\u2019ve ever drunk ! Apart from the micro-brewery, the other thing the Pied Bull is famous for is organising it\u2019s own twice yearly beer festival at which there is usually a \u2018meet the brewer\u2019 event. These are not to be missed for any Chester based real ale fan \u2013 and for anyone who isn\u2019t, attending one of these events is likely to convert you. The Pied Bull is still a work in progress \u2013 it could do with a refurbishment for instance, but we sort of like the rough edges to be honest. The fact that they brew their own beer is what swung the decision in the great Cellar vs. Pied Bull debate. Best of luck to them anyhow. Long may they continue to serve fantastic ale and long may they continue to brew.\nRight then, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. I hope we\u2019ve provided a few laughs \u2013 that\u2019s been the main objective of chronicling this odyssey to be honest. I hope nobody feels offended in any way at the comments made \u2013 that certainly wasn\u2019t our intention, although neither was it our intention to offer a flaccid uninteresting story. Maybe we\u2019ve been a bit controversial at times, but we just walk into pubs on a Thursday night and \u2018say it how it is\u2019 ! I hope we\u2019ve managed to stimulate some interest in the pubs of the great city of Chesterville anyhow \u2013 viewing figures for this site would indicate that we\u2019ve been successful in that respect and hopefully that\u2019s to the benefit of the Chester pub and beer drinking community in general.\nWe\u2019ve been the Chester Beer Project and my name\u2019s Tarquel.

April 2012 in Beer , Books , Circus Apartments , Events by Paul\nOn Wednesday 2nd May the Circus Apartments are playing host to Dialogue Books and one of the many wonderful English-language literary events. Fittingly the reading is of a book called \u201cThe Apartment\u201d by Berlin-resident Greg Baxter.\nHere\u2019s some more about the book from the organisers:\n\u201cOne snowy morning in an old European capital, a man wakes in a hotel room. A young local woman he has befriended calls to the hotel, and the two of them head out into the snow to find the man an apartment to rent.\nGreg Baxter\u2019s astonishing first novel tells the story of these two people on this day \u2013 and the old stories that brought them to where they are. Its magically subtle and intense narrative takes them across the frozen city and into the past that the man is hoping to escape, and leaves them at the doorstep of an uncertain future.\nThe Apartment is a book about war, the relationship between America and the rest of the world, and the brittle foundations of Western culture; but above all it is a book about the mysteries and alchemies of friendship \u2013 truthful, moving and brilliant.\u201d\nIf you are not a guest of the Circus but you are interested in the event, follow this link to find out how to register. We have a very limited number of tickets available to Circus guests, for which you can register at the reception. The event begins at 7.30pm.\n25.

But more than that we have an awfully good evening planned, so if you are up for any of the following then come on down and join the fun. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are Aussie, Kiwi, Pom, German, Italian, French or anything else, we\u2019re all ready to party. Here\u2019s the poster:\n21.

The Women\u2019s Football World Cup got serious as we reached the knock-out stages. Germany, as always, were great hosts of the tournament, but they fell foul on the pitch to a surprise defeat at the hands of the eventual winners Japan. Here at The Circus we made a film , brought Dandy of the Grotesque into Fabisch, and began our tours to Kreuzberg with Jim Hudson whilst Jule and the other Jim took people to explore Marzahn .\nInto August and Rani delivered the first designs for the new cafe and lounge at the apartments, whilst Sasa and the gang began the long process of deciding what special things would be served there. Berlin commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the building of the Berlin Wall with a series of different events and exhibitions around the city, whilst we met a 70 year-old on his birthday who had been born in the very building that now houses The Circus Hotel. Meanwhile Andrew was having a weekly struggle with the weather , Toga was off to watch his team at the Olympic Stadium, and Sandra was getting \u201c in the mood \u201d with her plans for new apartments. It all seems so long ago\u2026\nIn September we met Carl Oskar for the first time when he popped by the hotel for a visit, but otherwise it was work , work , work , work , on the Circus Apartments. Meanwhile, we were checking out the international literature festival , and many of our guests were gaining our complete admiration as they took on the Berlin Marathon course. As we moved into autumn a friend of ours published a book on a subject close to the hearts of the English-speaking staff members of The Circus \u2013 beer \u2013 whilst Preston ran a special photography tour for the festival of lights and Digel waved to passing members of the St Pauli football team on Torstra\u00dfe.\nInto November and we hosted the inaugural meeting of the Berlin St Georges Supporters Club down in Goldman\u2019s Bar, began our new fundraising campaign with our friends at Multitude, celebrated Thanksgiving in the Circus Cafe and drank our first glasses of gl\u00fchwein at the Berlin Christmas Markets .\nAnd so we reach December and the end of 2011. Sometimes December can be a calm and quiet month at The Circus, but not this year. We had a film crew come by the hostel to make a special clip for our website (coming soon!) but mostly we were getting the apartments ready for launch , which we did last week.\nSo as Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve approaches, we reach the end of our special review of 2011 (part two), and we would just like to take this opportunity to thank everyone \u2013 guests, staff, partners and friends \u2013 who have been with us during 2011 and the next year of the Circus story. In 2012 the Circus will be FIFTEEN years old\u2026 who could imagine what would have happened when the doors opened on that first 40-bed building close to Friedrichstra\u00dfe.\nAh, enough of the nostalgia. See you soon.\n20.

Now quite a lot of things have happened to us over the past twelve months, so we have decided to split this into two and begin with the first six months of the year.\nIn January we launched our cooperation with the ZeitzeugenB\u00f6rse for our series of eyewitness history talks, which are still continuing each month in Fabisch, and we have a very special treat and surprise on this topic coming up in January\u2026so keep your eyes open! We also recieved the happy news that The Circus Hotel had once again been selected for the Tripadvisor Traveller\u2019s Choice Awards , voted for by people who have stayed with us at the hotel and a wonderful achievement for the second year in a row. Later in month Judith and Lisanne took some guests on a special Long Night of the Museums Tour , whilst Jared started on his mission to eat around Berlin .\nFebruary might be the shortest month but there was lots going on, especially as the Berlinale was in town. We also prepared a very special welcome for a very special friend of ours.\u00a0 March was completely packed, with a renovation of the Circus Cafe just in time for all the different events of our Slow Travel Day, including tours, film screenings, a pop-up bookshop and much more, whilst our small Kunstbox at the hostel became host for the Pictosplasma festival. Over at the hotel Marie Jacobi brought Rapunzel to the tower, where she still sits\u2026\nInto spring and we welcomed the Berg Gallery to our Kunstbox, celebrated Hertha\u2019s return to the Bundesliga , and continued our obession with you know who . As the weather continued to get warmer the fun and games carried on, with a visit of Gino the Clown to the hostel, we sadly waved goodbye to Konny as he left the Circus (we still miss you), and made the first announcement of the new Circus Apartments.\nAs the summer arrived we headed up onto the roof of the Circus Hotel for yoga sessions , and worked with our neighbours on the Rosentage neighbourhood and cultural festival. We reached the halfway point of the year with Lisa hosting \u201c Europe\u2019s Most Awesome Barbecue \u201d in Mauerpark.\nPhew\u2026and we are only halfway there. Part Two of the 2011 review will be on the blog in the next couple of days\u2026\n1. November 2011 in Beer , Circus Hostel , Circus News , Goldman's Bar by Jim\nHistory was made last week in Goldman\u2019s Bar as it held the first meeting as the official HQ of the Berlin St. George Supporters Club. The foundation of this club is important, as it fills an aching gap in the Berlin social calendar \u2013 namely; where else can like-minded boys and girls get together to talk about Australia and the World\u2019s greatest Rugby League Team.\nAll four founder members were of course present and correct \u2013 see photo above \u2013 our great leader Andy (President), Jim (Vice President), Lisa (Assistant to the Vice President) and Felix (Berlin Flames Co-ordinator). There were try outs for keenly sort-after places in the Berlin Flames Cheerleader team and lots of new members attracted.\nMost importantly of course there was free beer \u2013 and I seem to remember somewhere towards the end J\u00e4germeister \u2013 but by that point things were getting a little foggy. Let us just say that a good time was had by all and we are looking forward to the start of the new season and the next meeting on the club sometime in the New Year.

Graham Reeks looks at the beer lovers who started it all...\nIf with water you fill up your glasses,\nYou'll never write anything wise,\nFor ale is the horse of Parnassus\nWhich hurries a bard to the skies.\n(Thomas Moore)\nOnce upon a time all beer was local. As a perishable product with a short shelf life, historically beer didn't travel too far from its brewery. In the UK beer was traditionally ale, conditioned in the cask from which it was served.\nIn 1933 however, a brewing company called Watney introduced a new method of storing and dispensing beer to the UK market. By filtering, pasteurising, adding carbon dioxide and chilling the beer before sealing it in kegs the beer lasted longer and was easier to dispense. It was great for brewers and pub landlords, but many felt that the character of English ales suffered for the convenience. Still, over thirty years this style grew to dominate. Traditional cask beer, neither filtered, pasteurised nor chilled, continued to be brewed in the meantime with breweries often producing both types of beer.\nEasily portable kegs lent themselves perfectly to being sold nationally and large national breweries began to flourish, absorbing many of the small regional breweries in the process. The number of breweries halved between 1940 and 1960 and by the mid-1960s six conglomerates produced most of the beer and owned the majority of the pubs in Britain. Known as the \u2018nationals' these huge companies had the economic clout and logistical ability to market keg beer throughout Britain.\nBy the 1970s much British beer was about as appealing as Adelaide water; the strength was declining, and with it the concept of regional variety and distinctive tastes. But the 1970s were also the decade of mass movements and consumer protest. Enter a bunch of savvy young whippersnappers to kick up a hell of a fuss about the state of their beer!\nIn 1971 four young men from the north-west of England formed the Campaign for Real Ales - or CAMRA - to protect and preserve their favourite drink.\nOne of the founders, Michael Hardman, says they were just four men of 25 and under, who knew very little about traditional British beer except that some tasted wonderful and some tasted awful.\n\"We established the campaign rather jokingly with a wish that every pub should have at least one traditional draught beer available, and blow what else it sold, that's none of our business,\" he said.\n\"Out of the woodwork came hundreds of people who had been thinking along our lines for years and knew the answers to a lot of our questions.\"\nThe organisation stuttered at first but then grew rapidly. CAMRA was active in recruiting members and campaigning via a central headquarters and regional branches. By its second AGM, in 1973, CAMRA boasted a membership of over 1,000 people. They adopted the term \u2018real ale' to describe \"traditionally brewed and properly served draught beer.\"\nCAMRA aimed to fend off the standardisation of beer and the monopolisation of the market by large centralised brewing companies. They did this by celebrating, promoting and encouraging decentralisation, specialisation and regional diversity in the brewing industry. Their methods were ingenious, and sometimes downright cheeky.\nIn the spirit of the era there were lots of marches, such as the protest against the closure of Joules brewery (founded in the 12th century, but owned then by Bass Charrington, one of the big six conglomerates). Over 600 members turned out to drink, protest and attend a meeting held in the local cinema. The event was well covered by radio and the BBC's prime-time Nationwide television program. It was a popular way for members from around the country to meet (and drink) whilst simultaneously spreading the real ale message to a wider audience, and frustrating the big six brewing companies.\nOther approaches got right into the big breweries' nerve centres. The monthly newsletter What's Brewing organised CAMRA members to team up to buy shares in large brewing companies so they could vote against the closures of small breweries at shareholders' meetings, and ask tricky questions.\nChris Holmes was President of CAMRA in 1975 and has since gone on to run a chain of pubs in the East Midlands. Chris said that one of his favourite campaigns involved Mansfield brewery, an independent brewery but one that didn't produce any real ale.\n\"We organised a survey in the streets of Mansfield. We asked Mansfield Bitter drinkers whether they thought the beer was better, worse or the same as it was two years ago when Mansfield Bitter was real ale,\" Chris said. \"The vast majority said it was worse.\"\n\"We gave these results to the press and we got loads of coverage. Mansfield Brewery were livid. Livid!\"\nChris later asked questions related to this exercise at the breweries AGM. Success was not immediate, but within two years Mansfield had begun to brew \u2018real ale' again.\nLiterature was another important driver of the real ale movement. What's Brewing arrived on the scene in June 1972 and CAMRA's indispensable annual Good Beer Guide came out in 1974 with a county by county, pub by pub breakdown of where to find the best beer.\nBut other beer writers were also on the case independently of CAMRA.\nTo write 1973's The Beer Drinker's Companion author Frank Baillie must have had a wonderful time. He visited every brewery in the country to find out what the difference really was between keg beer and cask beer.\nHis book provided a detailed explanation of brewing processes, methods of dispensing beer, appropriate temperatures for serving, the flavours and strength, and changes and trends in the brewing industry. He also later presented a gazetteer of all the breweries in Britain, differentiating between \"The Regional (Independent) Brewers\" and \"The National Brewers\".\nThe Companion was written and presented in an unpretentious style; with little of the wine-snob prose we endure today. The entry for George Bateman & Sons Ltd shows how Baillie used simple language for his depictions. \"Bitter. Malty-flavoured with above-average hopping rate.\" Still, he held back from being too critical of the breweries and beers he\ndidn't like for fear of legal action.\nOn the other hand Chris Hutt's The Death of the English Pub, also published in 1973, reads more like a call to arms for the beer-drinking Briton. Hutt pushed, pulled and pleaded with beer drinkers using his skills of rhetoric to persuade them by interspersing the facts with his own opinionated narrative. His book was artfully presented with a symbolic front cover and moody black and white photography.\nThe Death openly sought to expose how the \"objectives of the big brewers are to banish quality\", and the individual is overlooked in deference to company profits. The targets of his polemical arrows were clear and names were not withheld.\nHutt provided economic justification for his judgement that the alcoholic content of many beers had declined in recent years. He explained how some beers were weak enough to have been sold in the United States prohibition era. The gradual decline in strength was associated with the increasing profits of brewers. Hutt estimated the saving made in duty and raw materials between 1964 and 1970 at \u00a311M. A price \"paid by the beer drinker, because the brewers do not tell us when they weaken their products, and they do not lower their prices accordingly.\"\nA journalist by the name of Richard Boston cottoned on to the groundswell of discontented drinkers and wrote a regular column - Boston on Beer - that ran in the Saturday Guardian from 1973 to 1975. He says that it arose because he'd been abroad for some time.\n\"I came back and I was horrified by what they were doing to the pubs and friends said, \u2018they've fucked up the beer as well, not just the architecture'.\"\nIn 1976 Boston published a compilation of his column entitled Beer & Skittles. The book blended the characteristics of both Baillie and Hutt's work, but came further from the left and developed its own quite different arguments. It overflows with references far and wide, including Hardy, Hogarth, Dickens, Sassoon, Orwell and Graham Greene and economists such as J K Galbraith and E F Schumacher.\nBoston injected an added element of wit that had been lacking, intermingling fact and opinion with amusing anecdotes. He recounted the story of a German civil servant who shot 13 of his barbeque guests when they complained that the beer he had served was warm. On home brewing he said, \"This will fill your house with a delicious aroma. If your spouse dislikes it, change your spouse.\"\nBut, according to Michael Hardman, the most significant single contribution to the publicity of CAMRA was an article by a prestigious architectural writer. Ian Nairn's journalism was noted for its criticism of public agencies' design, planning and works and its effects on the urban environment of England, but he also commented on the architecture and interior design of English pubs.\nIn a 1974 article in the Weekly Review of the Sunday Times Nairn confessed his membership to CAMRA and summed up their concerns. He did not refer to design or architecture, but rather to breweries and beer, using wine as a frame of reference to help explain his argument.\n\"True draught bitter in Britain is in its way as good as the best of claret or hock - without the snobbery or the expense. And unlike good wine, it doesn't exist anywhere else,\" he wrote.\nNairn combined the arguments from The Companion and The Death, which he believed \"dovetailed beautifully\", and he reinforced this with a discussion of his favourite brewers, their beers, and the pubs he knew that served the beers he recommended. He saw two points as standing out. \"One is keg versus draught beer; the second is the arbitrary extinction of local flavours in favour of a \u2018national brew'.\"\nBaillie wrote his book unaware of CAMRA. After it was published he read about the organisation in his local paper and joined up. In contrast, by the time The Death was published Hutt had become its second chairman.\nRichard Boston maintained a surprising distance from the organisation. Before his death he told me that when he was writing his column he found CAMRA a \"bit boring\", although his writing led some people to believe that he had founded CAMRA. Although his book made many points sympathetic to the organisation's stance, he also criticised them for their inflexibility.\n\"It has been said that some of their members would drink castor oil if it came from a hand pump, and would reject nectar if it had no more than looked at carbon dioxide,\" he wrote.\nRegardless of any allegiance with the campaign, all of these writers did a great service to the British beer drinker and to the industry. Together CAMRA and the beer writers fuelled a remarkable consumer-led resistance to standardised beer. Ordinary small breweries with low status and restricted local markets have been reincarnated (sometimes literally) as specialist artisan breweries. This provided a superb example to beer drinkers the world over. People began to take beer - and beer drinkers - seriously and craft brewing and microbreweries followed on.\nDespite their success, the brewing industry is a constant battle between the craft of the brewer and the realities imposed by business. CAMRA is a monument to how consumers banding together can ensure that the celebration of the craft is good business.\n"}, {"score": 974.9213, "uuid": "f42d36bd-c104-53fd-b81d-4898134aea43", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-02-03396", "target_hostname": "www.ytravelblog.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ytravelblog.com/what-to-do-in-melbourne-australia/", "page_rank": 1.2378094e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>What</em> to Do <em>in</em> Melbourne - Highlights of Melbourne, <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "Steve shares with us his insider knowledge on <em>what</em> to do <em>in</em> Melbourne for those looking for <em>the</em> best places to eat, shop, explore, and enjoy a cold <em>beer</em> on a Sunday afternoon.", "explanation": null, "document": "What to Do in Melbourne, Australia\nFebruary 6, 2012 By: Caz\nComments\nAre you looking for travel tips on what to do in Melbourne, Australia?\nAs part of our \u201cTravel Tips Tuesday\u201d series, we interviewed\u00a0Steve Davidson from @Melburnian who has lived in Melbourne for almost 12 years.\nSteve shares with us his insider knowledge on what to do in Melbourne for those looking for the best places to eat, shop, explore, and enjoy a cold beer on a Sunday afternoon.\nTake it away Steve\u2026\nWhy Visit Melbourne?\nThere really is something for everyone here, no matter what your budget or tastes are.\nThe streets are very easy to navigate, and the city\u2019s laneways offer a shopping and dining experience like no other city in Australia. The inner suburbs also offer an array of shopping and dining experiences, especially along shopping strips like Chapel and Fitzroy Streets and Sydney and Bridge Roads.\nAlso, it is a well known fact among Australians that we have the best coffee in the country.\nBest Things to See and Do?\nA personal favourite is St Kilda Pier at dusk, when the fairy penguins come in and bring smiles to everyone who sees them. Why go to Phillip Island for the penguin parade when there is a free one right in the city?\nPenguin at St Kilda Pier\nFor shopping, I love the city laneways, especially between Flinders, Elizabeth, Bourke and Swanston Streets. Little Collins Street is also very good for relieving you of some of your cash.\nEureka Tower is a must see for anyone in the city. It offers stunning views from the highest observation deck in the southern hemisphere, at 297 metres/88 floors.\nView of Melbourne from Eureka Tower\nIf you\u2019re here during the AFL (Australian Football League) season, you must check out a game. The atmosphere in the massive MCG is unlike anything else in this country.\nAFL game at the MCG\nBest Suburbs to Explore?\nThe city centre is actually pretty good. I also like St Kilda for the outdoor dining and bars, many with bay views. Brunswick is great if you want to experience a bit of the Middle East, with small markets, affordable restaurants with delicious food.\nSt Kilda Beach\nI like Fitzroy for the cafes and restaurants, not to mention all of the boutique shops, many catering for a hip crowd. Richmond and Prahran are also alright, but a little more expensive than the others. They are quite popular with the locals though.\nWhere to Eat?\nFor budget, I would recommend any beer garden on a Sunday afternoon offering a free BBQ \u2013 these are quite widespread over the summer months.\nLucky Coq (Chapel Street, Prahran) and Bimbo Deluxe (Fitzroy) offer very cheap pizzas, and I am a huge fan.\nDon Dons on Swanston Street, near Melbourne Central, offers very affordable and tasty Japanese fare \u2013 and lightning fast service.\nFor stylish, I\u2019d recommend Eureka 89 and Vue De Monde \u2013 mainly because I love a good view from high above the city.\nFor stylish yet casual, I\u2019d recommend anywhere on Little Collins Street from Swanston Street, up to Spring Street. Terra Rosa is a personal favourite of mine along this strip.\nAny Cool Bars and Pubs?\nFor pubs, my personal favourites are along Sydney Road \u2013 The Penny Black , The Retreat and the Cornish Arms Hotel .\nThere are also many along the river in Southbank \u2013 walk along and pick one \u2013 they are all great, though if you like cocktails, Left Bank (next to Freshwater Place) has the best espresso martinis I\u2019ve ever had\u2026\nBest Place to Have a Drink with the Locals and a Sunday Session?\nDefinitely any of the suburban bars and pubs mentioned above. I personally love The Penny Black because they also offer a Sunday roast for those wishing to enjoy a nice, traditional Sunday meal.\nI\u2019ve never been disappointed with the food, drink, or atmosphere there on a Sunday. And, it\u2019s good all year round, with outdoor heating and protection from the elements in winter.\nI also like checking out the bars along Chapel Street \u2013 many offer discounted meals with each drinks purchase. The people are relaxed and happy on a Sunday. I\u2019ve only good things to say about my Sunday sessions.\nSunday beers at Ponyfish Island\nBest Area for a Night on the Town?\nThis very much depends on your preferences. There is so much diversity.\nBimbo Deluxe has always been a place where I\u2019ve had great nights \u2013 with an outdoor beer garden on the rooftop, dancefloor, dining area and lots of comfy couches. This one is for the younger people who like to dance to stuff other than what\u2019s on the radio.\nIf you like hip-hop, Bond Lounge in the city is the place to be. There are also many great options in St Kilda, the city, Fitzroy and along Chapel Street. There truly is something for everyone.\nGetting Around?\nThe city is laid out on a very easy to navigate grid. The public transport system will get you to anywhere you may need to go, despite the odd cancellation.\nFederation Square\nIf you\u2019re heading to St Kilda, get the 96 tram \u2013 it runs express along an old train line, and will save you quite a bit of time.\nMelbourne at Night\nAny Markets or Shopping Areas worth a Visit?\nThe Queen Victoria Markets , despite it\u2019s reputation, does not really offer anything for the average tourist, in my opinion (other than to say you\u2019ve been there). I do my meat and fruit shopping there though, so it may be handy if you\u2019re staying in a serviced apartment and wanting to save a lot of money on the essentials.\nRose Street Markets , in Fitzroy, are known as The Artist\u2019s Market. It is small compared to other markets, but I really like the range of clothing, accessories and art available there. They also sell some pretty nice coffee!\nAs above, there are many shopping areas to choose from \u2013 this really is the shopping capital of Australia, with something for everyone.\nThere are also other markets at St Kilda on a Sunday, as well as the ones at the Arts Centre. Chadstone in the suburbs is worth a visit if you like massive shopping centres. It may be a little tricky to get to via public transport though.\nMajor Events and Festivals throughout the Year?\nThere are heaps. The Comedy Festival, through April, is fantastic for seeing world famous (and up and coming) comedians live.\nThe Moomba Festival (on the Labour Day long weekend in March) offers a carnival experience right in the city, with a highlight for me being the annual parade down Swanston Street, and the Birdman Rally. The latter just has to be seen to be believed.\nMoomba carnival\nSpring Horse Racing Carnival in early November is what I consider to be the unofficial start of summer, with a whole week of horse racing at Flemington, the highlight being the Melbourne Cup . I highly recommend everyone to go and experience this once in their lives.\nWe also have the Grand Prix and the Australian Tennis Open \u2026there is something big on pretty much all year round.\nFavorite Side Trip?\nDaylesford to the north is a beautiful country town, just over an hours drive away. There is great food and the Sunday markets are also worth the trip, along with the nearby Chocolate Mill.\nThis is an excellent place to visit any time of the year, though it is generally a little colder than Melbourne most of the time.\nDaylesford Lake in Autumn\nWhat is the Best Time of Year to Visit?\nAutumn to early winter. The weather is at it\u2019s sunniest at this time of year, and there is generally a lack of weather extremes that occasionally hit in summer and winter.\nHaving said that, the weather is no where near as bad as other Australians would have you believe. I love this city all year round.\nHow Do You Get into the City from the Airport?\nThere really are only a couple of options for those without a car.\nThe Sky-Bus offers a regular shuttle service 24/7 direct to Southern Cross Station in the city. They also offer a hotel drop off and pick up service \u2013 ask for details at the counter.\nA taxi to the city costs around $50-$60, depending on what time of day you\u2019re travelling. I am generally very happy to stick with the Sky-Bus, unless I have returned from a long day at work interstate.\nBest \u201cinsiders\u201d Tip for Travellers?\nHmm\u2026this is a tricky one. Definitely check out the city\u2019s laneways for some shopping bargains, along with Smith Street, Collingwood for some decent factory outlets.\nAvoid the DFO outlets and Docklands\u2019 Harbour Town. In my observation, the items on \u201csale\u201d there are more expensive than the major city department stores, although the rare occasional bargain may be found.\nYou can\u2019t visit Melbourne without __________?\nA map. There are several \u201cCity Ambassadors\u201d \u2013 wearing their distinctive red outfits, on many of the main intersections in the city.\nThe locals are also only too happy to recommend things to see and do, and give you directions on how to get there. This city is very easy to navigate.\nBIO: Steve Davidson moved down to Melbourne from tropical Queensland almost 12 years ago. He first visited Melbourne in the winter time (deliberately) to see if it was as miserable as everyone says it is. He ended up falling in love with the city. You can follow Steve on twitter and connect with him on facebook.\nTags\n"}, {"score": 974.4298, "uuid": "c1c0b28b-eaf3-52cf-b1f6-e21582f2b5a4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0709wb-47-03110", "target_hostname": "www.ytravelblog.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ytravelblog.com/my-travels-in-australia-with-hannah-demilta/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "My Travels <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em> - Backpacking <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "Caz and Craig have been traveling and living around <em>the</em> world since 1997.

Backpacking Australia is popular for people on a working holiday Australia visa.\nToday we talk with Hannah DeMilta \u2026\nPlease introduce yourself and tell us a little about your traveling experience?\nI\u2019m originally from Cleveland, Ohio and now live in Sydney. I work as a social media specialist for Switched on Media , a digital marketing agency. I have a wide range of brands I work with, including several travel and tourism clients. I\u2019ve been lucky to travel around the states some already, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. There are still so many places I want to visit.\nHow long have you been in Australia and what places have you seen so far?\nI studied abroad in Australia on the Gold Coast in 2008 and moved back here in August 2010. I\u2019ve been to Melbourne (Great Ocean Road) and Cairns a couple times and places around Sydney and NSW. A friend from home was visiting and we just got back from a fun trip sailing Whitsundays, Magnetic Island and Cairns.\nWhat is your style of travel in Oz? Independent travel, group tours etc?\nI prefer traveling with a friend or small group but wouldn\u2019t mind taking a solo trip one day.\nWhat type of accommodation do you mostly stay in? Is there a Hostel/Hotel/Campsite you love?\u2026\nI usually stay in hostels. I\u2019m a big fan of Greenhouse Backpackers both in Melbourne and Cairns.\nFavorite city and why?\nI love Sydney. That\u2019s why I moved halfway across the world to live here. It\u2019s a fantastic city!\nNorth of Cairns, Queensland\nFavorite other region?\nI went camping at Jervis Bay (a couple hours south of Sydney) one weekend and really loved that area. It was beautiful and I didn\u2019t think I would have so much fun camping since I\u2019m a wimp about the outdoors sometimes. There were kangaroos hoping all over the park right next to us.\nHow do you like the food? Favorite local meal?\nThe food is good although there are certain things from home that I miss. I feel spoiled getting to have yummy Thai and other Asian influence cuisine that I wouldn\u2019t normally get at home. I also don\u2019t mind a fish and chips\u00a0takeaway\u00a0to eat on the beach.\nIt\u2019s no secret Australia is an expensive place to travel. What tips could you give on ways to keep expenses low?\nBook flights early and watch for specials. I always make the mistake of eating too many meals out instead of packing a\u00a0sandwich\u00a0or snack to go. I\u2019m the one who should be\u00a0receiving\u00a0tips instead of giving them, I\u2019m sure\nWhat inspired you to visit Australia? Have you always wanted to go there?\nI was trying to pick a place to study abroad in college and a friend\u00a0recommended\u00a0Australia to me. I read In A Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson and fell in love with the idea of coming here. After studying abroad I didn\u2019t want to leave. I knew I wanted to come back here to live and work.\nAt what moment of your visit did it hit you that\u2026\u201dshit, I\u2019m really in Australia?\u201d\nI have those moments all the time. I hope the feeling never goes away.\nI\u2019m still laughing about___________\nMy fist time here we went abseiling (rappelling) with our study abroad group in the Blue Mountains. I got to the top and the abseil staff member asked me \u201cHow are you going?\u201d meaning \u201cHow are you?\u201d but I answered \u201cright-handed.\u201d That was my \u201cwelcome to Australia\u201d moment that I still laugh about.\nBlue Mountains\nFinish this sentence: The people in Australia are_____________\n\u201cCruisey.\u201d\nAustralia has plenty of deadly inhabitants (snakes/spiders/Sharks/Crocs}. Did you have any animal encounters that freaked you out?\nI\u2019ve seen a few spiders, jellyfish and a wobbegong shark but nothing too serious (that wanted to eat me alive) to really freak me yet. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have more stories to tell soon enough.\nWe are big sports fans down under. Did you get a chance to experience any of the local action live, or possibly watch a game in a pub with other Aussies?\nDefinitely, I don\u2019t mind a little rugby. I went to see the Rabbitohs play in Sydney when I moved here and I\u2019ve been to other random rugby and basketball games when I was on the Gold Coast. A memorable game was in Melbourne seeing Ireland and Australia play their International Rules Series match in 2008 on Halloween. We bought tickets not knowing what it was, a hybrid football game played between the two countries.\nAustralia is a big place. If someone only had 2-3 weeks to visit, what advice would you give them as far as regions to see and ways to get around?\nI would remind them to book more flights than they think they need because the distances on the map are a lot\u00a0further\u00a0apart than they appear. I would encourage them to see The Great Barrier Reef and the Great Ocean Road, two things that I made sure my friend saw when she was here. Of course I\u2019m partial to Sydney as a place to see.\nGreat Ocean Road\nWhat do you feel are the MUST experiences people should have visiting Australia?\nSpending time on the beach and outdoors in general is pretty much required. The experience of hanging out and having a few drinks with Australians is strongly encouraged. If you can get yourself invited to a local BBQ in the park and have a\u00a0sausage sizzle and beer, then you\u2019re doing really well.\nHow do you research your travels in Oz? What resources do you use to figure out places to see, accommodation, flights etc?\nI\u2019m lucky that I work with Australians and\u00a0non-Aussies\u00a0that love to travel. I get advice from them. I\u2019ll use social media to\u00a0crowd-source\u00a0recommendations, read travel blogs and research online in general. If I\u2019m already out traveling I love asking at hostels. They have deals better suited to the young budget traveler.\nMy friends at Sydney Travel Tribe are great too. For my last trip I used Adioso to find my flights and VroomVroomVroom for our car rental. I met both of those guys at a Travel Tribe meetup.\nTags\n"}, {"score": 970.2426, "uuid": "cf64570c-d901-57a1-b79d-03b46a85c849", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-72-19969", "target_hostname": "www.cocktailmixingmaster.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cocktailmixingmaster.com/cocktail_recipes.html", "page_rank": 2.2049678e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Cocktail Recipes Guide \u0096 Your guide to <em>the</em> world&#x27;s <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> cocktail", "snippet": "Whisky <em>is</em> rich <em>in</em> flavour and taste. <em>The</em> classic Manhattan uses whisky as its base ingredient. <em>Beer</em> <em>is</em> perhaps not <em>the</em> first base-ingredient that comes to mind when you think of cocktail mixing.

Inverarity is presently en route to the West Indies, leaving the selector Rod Marsh to speak about Forrest and the team on his behalf.\n\"He [Forrest] looks to all of us more of a Test match player than he does a one-day player and yet he was very successful in the one-day game,\" Marsh said in Adelaide. \"We're very very happy with what he has done this year and we just hope he progresses.\"\nShane Watson has returned to Test calculations for the first time since the South Africa tour in November 2011, and Inverarity indicated that he was likely to fill Marsh's vacated No. 3 batting spot.\n\"If Michael [Clarke] wants him to bat at number three, he'll be batting at number three,\" Marsh said. \"We're happy for Michael to set the batting order.

An undergraduate degree in marine biology on the Great Barrier Reef? Or maybe just a straight and geekish MBA?\nWith 39 universities, a plethora of private and government institutions for vocational training, a booming English Language industry and worldwide recognition of qualifications, there are far worse places to study than Australia.\nAnd you can do your homework at the beach, just like in Home And Away. But the real benefits of studying here are the comparatively cheap fees and cost of living, plus the great year-round climate which enables that famous outdoor Aussie lifestyle.\nAttending study and social groups, cheap beer at the uni bar and nights of raucous partying against a backdrop of sun and surf is an alluring blend. So alluring to British-born student Naomi Cook, that she chose to complete her Masters in nursing at Sydney University.\n\u201dAfter completing my undergraduate degree in philosophy in England I went to travel and live in Egypt where I met my partner. We both wanted to study further and when we did a comparison with other countries, Australia was the cheapest, while the quality of education was still very good,\u201d says Naomi, who is confident that qualifications from Sydney University are as well respected as any university in the US or the UK.\nNaomi\u2019s study programme is a two-year course and her annual fees are around $AU20,000. By comparison, Australian students enrolled in the same course, pay an annual fee of around $4,000 -- it hurts, but it\u2019s cheaper than many other countries, she says.\nSwedish student Anna Bakke had already travelled around Australia and her ambition was not necessarily to study, but to have the opportunity to live and work in Sydney. \u201cI wanted to do that without using up my Working Holiday Visa,\u201d says Anna.\n\u201cOriginally I enrolled for just one semester\u2019s study to give me time to experience Sydney, but I ended up extending that to three semesters, enabling me to complete a masters course in journalism,\u201d says Anna, who is studying at the University of Technology in Sydney.\nNaomi and Anna both hold student visas -- which are valid for the duration of their study. Other conditions typical of the student visa allow candidates to exit and enter Australia as often as they like (NZ and the Pacific islands are temptingly close by), and the ability to work to support themselves while here (student visa holders can work a maximum of 20 hours per week during term time, more during holiday periods).\nRESEARCH\nAustralia has reputable institutions offering quality courses which are monitored by a range of government and industry organisations. But before you commit, do your research to ensure you are happy with the course content and reputation of the institution. Generally speaking though, the quality of Australian courses is comparable to some of the best in the world.\nBEFORE YOU APPLY\nWhen it comes to applying for a visa through the notoriously strict DIMIA (Department of Immigration and Indigenous Affairs) not all nationalities are created equal. Be aware that countries are divided into different assessment levels according to the risk of nationals overstaying their visa (Level One being lowest and Level Five highest). If you are considering applying for a student visa, make sure you check out what category your country is, as it will affect your application. For instance, if your country is a Level One you can apply for a student visa in Australia, whereas countries ranked Level Two or above have to apply from outside Australia (categories may also change depending on what kind of study you\u2019re applying for). Note, you can only start work after you\u2019ve got your student visa.\n\u201dAustralia is a popular choice for international students and that means that at times you need to be patient,\u201d adds Anna. \u201cI received lower marks for group projects where I worked with students who could not speak English very well. Otherwise, the mixed ethnicity in the classroom is just another positive part of education in Australia.\u201d\nWHAT CAN I STUDY?\nCommunity colleges (TAFES) and universities offer a baffling range of subjects including everything from juggling to journalism (geh -- you mean you\u2019re meant to study for this lark?).\nAs well as trades and all the classic disciplines such as arts and humanities, sciences, business and economics, medicine, law, education and engineering there are other streams for which Australia is particularly well known, including Asian studies, environmental sciences, viticulture, marine biology and the ever-popular MBA. In addition, look out for the oddball stuff, like the Diploma in Surf Studies and the Degree in Circus Arts.\nCOURSE COSTS\nAlthough much higher than fees paid by Australian students, international study fees are inexpensive compared to countries like the UK and the US (the cost of living is also lower).\nAccording to a 2002 study*, the average cost of living per year for a student is AU$9,237 compared to the US (AU$13,133) and Britain (AU$13,038). This figure includes accommodation, food, transport, clothing, fuel, power, telephone and entertainment. The average weekly cost of living is AU$178.\nInformation from research by IDP Education Australia and Australian Education International, 2002: Cost of study for international students, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nVISA CHECKLIST\nStudent visas are valid for any course accredited by the government to accept international students (CRICOS courses) so check your course has this accreditation before applying.\nA student visa allows you to work part-time (up to 20 hours per week during term time, and unlimited hours in holiday periods) and is valid for the duration of your studies.\nBefore you apply for your student visa you will need confirmation of your enrolment from an Australian institution. For most applicants, there is also the requirement for a medical examination for those who intend to study for periods of more than three months.\nBefore you apply for a student visa there\u2019s some basic things you\u2019ll need to get organised. You\u2019ll need to prove that you\u2019ve got sufficient funds to support yourself and pay for your studies, and that you\u2019re prepared to comply with the conditions of your visa. If your first language is not English, you\u2019ll also need to show that you\u2019ve got the appropriate level of English to do the course.\nDO I NEED A STUDENT VISA?\nIf you\u2019re only intending on doing a short course, you may not need to apply for a student visa, as you\u2019re permitted to study for a maximum of four months on a Working Holiday Visa.\nHEALTH\nStudent visa holders must purchase an approved OSHC policy (overseas student health cover) from a registered health benefits organisation (health fund). You will need to buy OSHC before you come to Australia, to cover you from when you arrive and must maintain OSHC throughout your stay in Australia (Norweigan and Swedish students may be waived the compulsory OSHC visa requirements). If in doubt, check with immigration.\nOSCH starts from $74 for three months cover ($274 for one year). You will be covered for most medical expenses in public hospitals, clinics and specialists. Dental and optometry costs are not included.\nCONTACTS\nFor more information about studying and living in Australia you should visit www.idp.com .

[3] Originating in Germany the glass is narrow at the bottom and slightly wider at the top; the width both releasing aroma, and providing room for the often thick, fluffy heads produced by wheat beer. [4] It tends to be taller than a pint glass, and generally holds 500 millilitres with room for foam or \" head \". In some countries, such as Belgium, the glass may be 250\u00a0ml or 330\u00a0ml.\nWheat beers tend to foam a lot, especially if poured incorrectly. In pubs, if the bottle is handed to the patron for self pouring, it is customary for the glass to be taken to the patron wet or with a bit of water in the bottom to be swirled around to wet the entire glass to keep the beer from foaming excessively.\nA Beer stein or simply stein (\n/ \u02c8 s t a\u026a n / ) [5] is an English neologism for either traditional beer mugs made out of stoneware , or specifically ornamental beer mugs that are usually sold as souvenirs or collectibles . Such Steins may be made out of stoneware (rarely the inferior earthenware ), pewter , porcelain , or even silver , wood or crystal glass ; they may have open tops or hinged pewter lids with a thumb- lever . Steins usually come in sizes of a half litre or a full litre (or comparable historic sizes). Like decorative tankards , they are often decorated in a nostalgic manner, but with allusions to Germany or Bavaria . It is believed by some that the lid was implemented during the age of the Black Plague , to prevent diseased flies from getting into the beer. [6]\n[ edit ] Ma\u00df\nThe Ma\u00df (pronounced [\u02c8mas] and the Bavarian word of female grammatical gender, thus die Ma\u00df, for a mug containing one litre of liquid, though commonly misinterpreted as the Standard German noun Ma\u00df, pronounced [\u02c8ma\u02d0s] and gramatically neuter, thus das Ma\u00df, and translating to \"measure\") is a term used in German-speaking countries for a unit of volume, now typically used only for measuring beer sold for immediate on-site consumption. In modern times, a Ma\u00df is defined as exactly 1 litre. As a ma\u00df is a unit of measure, various desings are possible: modern ma\u00df krugs are often handled glass tankards, although they may also be in the form of steins.\n[ edit ] Stangen and becher\nThe high, narrow and cylindrical stange ( German : stick or rod) is traditionally used for K\u00f6lsch . A becher, traditionally used for altbier , is similar, though slightly shorter and fatter. The stange usually holds between 100cc and 200cc (though larger ones are now sometimes used to reduce serving work), the becher between 200 and 300cc. Stangen are carried by slotting them into holes in a special tray called a Kranz (\"wreath\")\n[ edit ] Beer Boot\nThis section does not cite any references or sources .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .\n(March 2010)\nBeer boots , or Bierstiefel , have over a century of history and culture behind them. It is commonly believed that a general somewhere promised his troops to drink beer from his boot if they were successful in battle. When the troops prevailed, the general had a glassmaker fashion a boot from glass to fulfill his promise without tasting his own feet and to avoid spoiling the beer in his leather boot. Since then, soldiers have enjoyed toasting to their victories with a beer boot. At gatherings in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, beer boots are often passed among the guests for a festive drinking challenge. Since the movie Beerfest appeared in 2006, beer boots have become increasingly popular in the United States. It is an old joke to hand the boot to a young novice drinker with the tip pointing away from his person, which will result in beer pouring over the drinker's face uncontrollably when air enters the tip; seasoned drinkers always point the tip towards their body until the glass is sufficiently drained.

Whether it's enjoying a 'barbie' (barbecue) and game of backyard cricket, cheering their team at football, soccer, rugby, netball (or just about any other sport you can think of), celebrating at one of the many festivals and events held annually across the country or throwing a tent in the car and heading off camping in the wilderness, there's always something happening and many opportunities for visitors to get involved.\nSporting Australia\nAustralians love their sport\u2014both playing it and watching it. The number-one watched sport in the country is Australian Rules Football. Around Melbourne you can pass through the suburbs of Carlton, Collingwood, Hawthorn, North Melbourne, Footscray, Essendon, Richmond and St Kilda, all of which have a team in the elite Australian Football League (AFL). This league was once exclusive to the state of Victoria but since 1982 has included other states: the Sydney Swans, Perth's Fremantle Dockers and West Coast Eagles, Port Adelaide and the Adelaide Crows, and the Brisbane Lions. Being part of a crowd at an AFL game is an Australian (particularly Melburnian) must, even if you don't like sport that much.\nThen there's the National Rugby League (NRL). The highlight of the season is the annual State of Origin series. Australians who play rugby union dream of playing for the national team the Wallabies, who have always been an internationally dominant force. Apart from the World Cup, Bledisloe Cup games against New Zealand are highly anticipated and form part of a Tri Nations tournament that also includes South Africa.\nSurrounded by sea, it's not surprising Australia is a nation of swimmers . There are plenty of public swimming pools throughout the country, as there are great swimming beaches. Surfing is a hugely popular sport and pastime, as is evidenced by big events such as the Bells Beach Surf Classic. Popular beaches are patrolled by surf life savers during summer and patrolled areas are marked off by flags. Even so, surf beaches can be dangerous places to swim if you aren't used to the conditions. Undertows (or 'rips') are the main problem. A number of people are also paralysed every year by diving into waves in shallow water and hitting a sand bar. Check the depth of the water before you leap.\nThe Australian cricket team are a dominant force in both the test and one-day cricket series. The stars have been Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Mitchell Johnson. To find out more, including how to find a local club if you're interested in playing, have a look at Cricket Australia's website.\nThe Australian Open is one of tennis' four Grand Slams. It attracts more people to Australia than any other sporting event. Lleyton Hewitt is a great Aussie star, having won Wimbledon and US Open titles. Tennis Australia's website has a good search engine for finding local clubs all over Australia.\nFrom a participation and spectator viewpoint, soccer is one of the growth sports in Australia, and much hope is pinned on the new A-League . For years local soccer has suffered as young players choose the better competition and contracts on offer in Europe.\nThere are 1.2 million netballers in the country, which makes netball Australia's most popular participation sport. Women's basketball is also popular, with most Australians believing that Lauren Jackson is the best player in the world, while in men's basketball , McKinnon and Bogut are the stars.\nThe list of sporting opportunities also include hockey, horse racing, sailing, car racing, golf and cycling. All of the sports listed here are available to everyone, either as a participant or a spectator. Australia has more than 120 national sporting organisations and thousands of state and regional bodies, so there's a good chance there'll be one close by that caters to your interest. Universities and local councils (and the websites listed above) are good places to find out about sporting opportunities in your area. When it comes to watching, you can simply buy tickets on the day at the venue for most sports. Big finals' series, like the AFL or the Australian Open, are likely to sell out and you should buy tickets in advance through an agent such as Ticketek or Ticketmaster .\nEntertainment\nIt doesn't take much to convince an Australian to celebrate or be entertained and it makes sense to follow this light-hearted lead during your stay.\nAustralia's arts festivals attract people from all over the country to see drama, dance, music and visual arts. The huge Festival of Sydney, which takes up most of January, includes a number of events from open air concerts, to street theatre and fireworks. The Adelaide Arts Festival takes place at the beginning of March in even-numbered years. Womadelaide, Adelaide's outdoor festival of world music and dance, takes place in the second week of March each year. Melbourne has a Comedy Festival in April, the world's biggest Writers' Festival in September and the fabulous Melbourne International Festival in October. A couple of festivals celebrating Aboriginal arts and culture include the Stompen Ground Festival, which is held in Broome in October, and the Barunga Wugularr Sports & Cultural Festival, held near Katherine in June.\nSporty fun includes Darwin's Beer Can Regatta in August, when a series of races are held for \u201cboats\u201d constructed entirely of beer cans, while Alice Springs holds the Henley-on-Todd, a boat race on a dry river bed! More mainstream events include the Sydney to Hobart yacht race (from Boxing Day), the Australian Grand Prix (Melbourne, March), Australian Rules Football (around the country from March to September\u2014see Sporting Australia above) and the country-stopping Melbourne Cup horse race on the first Tuesday in November.\nGay festivals include Sydney's massive, flamboyant Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras, in February/March, and Melbourne's January/February Midsumma Festival. (See the Events sections of the individual state/territory summaries on this site for more detailed festival listings.)\nAustralians also love their pubs and bars. You'll usually find one or the other wherever you are in the country. Australia has long had a strong pub culture, which extends from the big cities to the bush (that is, anywhere away from the cities). There are classic Aussie pubs in tiny country towns like the Birdsville Hotel in outback Queensland, and more refined versions, such as Sydney's Paddington Inn Hotel in Oxford Street, Paddington. Bar culture is a more recent phenomenon, with the big cities leading the way, especially Melbourne. Many pubs and bars across the continent also regularly feature live bands and DJs.\nThen there's cinema, theatre, dance, clubbing, opera, classical music, jazz. The list of entertainment options is endless. The best way to find out what's on is through local newspapers and free entertainment magazines, newspapers and websites.\nTravel\nBeing such a huge and diverse country, there are countless ways to explore this great continent. Following are two sample itineraries to get you started: one a well-trodden route, the other well off the beaten track.\nEast Coast Run: Sydney to Cairns\nHordes of travellers stay on the beaten track on Australia's sun-loving east coast, following this beach-themed route. From Sydney, meander along the Pacific Highway through central and northern New South Wales towns with idyllic beach locales. Soak up the serenity of Port Stephens, the watersports-mad Myall Lakes National Park and the stunning, plateau-top rainforests of Dorrigo National Park. Join the wild and famous in Byron Bay, then head over the Queensland border into the state capital, Brisbane, via the party town of Surfers Paradise.\nThe Bruce Highway then winds along the coast into the far north. Nature lovers should visit the whale-watching haven of Hervey Bay and, further north, the blissful Whitsunday Islands, the coral charms of the Great Barrier Reef and the scuba-diving heaven of Cairns.\nAcross the Continent: Cairns to Perth\nThe following is a long, difficult route from the tropics to the Indian Ocean\u2014few roads are less travelled than this 4,560 kilometre trail. There are many potential hazards in heading off the beaten track into the Australian outback, so wherever you go, make sure you're well informed and fully prepared. Start in Cairns and head west to Normanton, the biggest town in the Gulf of Carpentaria region, then south down the Matilda Highway to the rough mining town of Mt Isa. To the southwest is the frontier outback town of Urandangi, after which you run into the Plenty Highway, a long\u2014or to some, gloriously desolate\u2014road with plenty of bone-jolting challenges (4WD recommended). Over 500 kilometres later you'll hit the Stuart Highway and then the dead-centre city of Alice Springs.\nThe Lasseter Highway turn-off takes you to amazing Uluru (Ayers Rock) and the captivating Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) rock formations, beyond which is the beginning of the Great Central Road. This lonely trail, suitable for well-prepared 2WDs and lined with saltbush, spinifex and desert oak trees, stretches 750 kilometres to the tiny gold-mining town of Laverton, from where it's another 400 kilometres to a much bigger gold-mining town, Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Finally, the ocean beckons from behind the beaches of Scarborough and Cottesloe in Perth.\nSidebar\n"}, {"score": 951.6669, "uuid": "fed97cc0-7713-5e65-9f53-8c4aa5117fd9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0701wb-88-17378", "target_hostname": "www.studyinaustralia.gov.au", "target_uri": "https://www.studyinaustralia.gov.au/en/Living-in-Australia/Leisure/What-to-do-in-your-spare-time", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Leisure - Study <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "There are 1.2 million netballers <em>in</em> <em>the</em> country, which makes netball Australia&#x27;s <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> participation sport.

Popular beaches are patrolled by surf life savers during summer and patrolled areas are marked off by flags. Even so, surf beaches can be dangerous places to swim if you aren't used to the conditions. Undertows (or 'rips') are the main problem. A number of people are also paralysed every year by diving into waves in shallow water and hitting a sand bar. Check the depth of the water before you leap.\nThe Australian cricket team are a dominant force in both the test and one-day cricket series. The stars have been Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke and Mitchell Johnson. To find out more, including how to find a local club if you're interested in playing, have a look at Cricket Australia's website.\nThe Australian Open is one of tennis' four Grand Slams. It attracts more people to Australia than any other sporting event. Lleyton Hewitt is a great Aussie star, having won Wimbledon and US Open titles. Tennis Australia's website has a good search engine for finding local clubs all over Australia.\nFrom a participation and spectator viewpoint, soccer is one of the growth sports in Australia, and much hope is pinned on the new A-League . For years local soccer has suffered as young players choose the better competition and contracts on offer in Europe.\nThere are 1.2 million netballers in the country, which makes netball Australia's most popular participation sport. Women's basketball is also popular, with most Australians believing that Lauren Jackson is the best player in the world, while in men's basketball , McKinnon and Bogut are the stars.\nThe list of sporting opportunities also include hockey, horse racing, sailing, car racing, golf and cycling. All of the sports listed here are available to everyone, either as a participant or a spectator. Australia has more than 120 national sporting organisations and thousands of state and regional bodies, so there's a good chance there'll be one close by that caters to your interest. Universities and local councils (and the websites listed above) are good places to find out about sporting opportunities in your area. When it comes to watching, you can simply buy tickets on the day at the venue for most sports. Big finals' series, like the AFL or the Australian Open, are likely to sell out and you should buy tickets in advance through an agent such as Ticketek or Ticketmaster .\nEntertainment\nIt doesn't take much to convince an Australian to celebrate or be entertained and it makes sense to follow this light-hearted lead during your stay.\nAustralia's arts festivals attract people from all over the country to see drama, dance, music and visual arts. The huge Festival of Sydney, which takes up most of January, includes a number of events from open air concerts, to street theatre and fireworks. The Adelaide Arts Festival takes place at the beginning of March in even-numbered years. Womadelaide, Adelaide's outdoor festival of world music and dance, takes place in the second week of March each year. Melbourne has a Comedy Festival in April, the world's biggest Writers' Festival in September and the fabulous Melbourne International Festival in October. A couple of festivals celebrating Aboriginal arts and culture include the Stompen Ground Festival, which is held in Broome in October, and the Barunga Wugularr Sports & Cultural Festival, held near Katherine in June.\nSporty fun includes Darwin's Beer Can Regatta in August, when a series of races are held for \u201cboats\u201d constructed entirely of beer cans, while Alice Springs holds the Henley-on-Todd, a boat race on a dry river bed! More mainstream events include the Sydney to Hobart yacht race (from Boxing Day), the Australian Grand Prix (Melbourne, March), Australian Rules Football (around the country from March to September\u2014see Sporting Australia above) and the country-stopping Melbourne Cup horse race on the first Tuesday in November.\nGay festivals include Sydney's massive, flamboyant Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras, in February/March, and Melbourne's January/February Midsumma Festival. (See the Events sections of the individual state/territory summaries on this site for more detailed festival listings.)\nAustralians also love their pubs and bars. You'll usually find one or the other wherever you are in the country. Australia has long had a strong pub culture, which extends from the big cities to the bush (that is, anywhere away from the cities). There are classic Aussie pubs in tiny country towns like the Birdsville Hotel in outback Queensland, and more refined versions, such as Sydney's Paddington Inn Hotel in Oxford Street, Paddington. Bar culture is a more recent phenomenon, with the big cities leading the way, especially Melbourne. Many pubs and bars across the continent also regularly feature live bands and DJs.\nThen there's cinema, theatre, dance, clubbing, opera, classical music, jazz. The list of entertainment options is endless. The best way to find out what's on is through local newspapers and free entertainment magazines, newspapers and websites.\nTravel\nBeing such a huge and diverse country, there are countless ways to explore this great continent. Following are two sample itineraries to get you started: one a well-trodden route, the other well off the beaten track.\nEast Coast Run: Sydney to Cairns\nHordes of travellers stay on the beaten track on Australia's sun-loving east coast, following this beach-themed route. From Sydney, meander along the Pacific Highway through central and northern New South Wales towns with idyllic beach locales. Soak up the serenity of Port Stephens, the watersports-mad Myall Lakes National Park and the stunning, plateau-top rainforests of Dorrigo National Park. Join the wild and famous in Byron Bay, then head over the Queensland border into the state capital, Brisbane, via the party town of Surfers Paradise.\nThe Bruce Highway then winds along the coast into the far north. Nature lovers should visit the whale-watching haven of Hervey Bay and, further north, the blissful Whitsunday Islands, the coral charms of the Great Barrier Reef and the scuba-diving heaven of Cairns.\nAcross the Continent: Cairns to Perth\nThe following is a long, difficult route from the tropics to the Indian Ocean\u2014few roads are less travelled than this 4,560 kilometre trail. There are many potential hazards in heading off the beaten track into the Australian outback, so wherever you go, make sure you're well informed and fully prepared. Start in Cairns and head west to Normanton, the biggest town in the Gulf of Carpentaria region, then south down the Matilda Highway to the rough mining town of Mt Isa. To the southwest is the frontier outback town of Urandangi, after which you run into the Plenty Highway, a long\u2014or to some, gloriously desolate\u2014road with plenty of bone-jolting challenges (4WD recommended). Over 500 kilometres later you'll hit the Stuart Highway and then the dead-centre city of Alice Springs.\nThe Lasseter Highway turn-off takes you to amazing Uluru (Ayers Rock) and the captivating Kata Tjuta (the Olgas) rock formations, beyond which is the beginning of the Great Central Road. This lonely trail, suitable for well-prepared 2WDs and lined with saltbush, spinifex and desert oak trees, stretches 750 kilometres to the tiny gold-mining town of Laverton, from where it's another 400 kilometres to a much bigger gold-mining town, Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Finally, the ocean beckons from behind the beaches of Scarborough and Cottesloe in Perth.\nSidebar\n"}, {"score": 951.8601, "uuid": "a7dea795-4b96-5320-962c-ddc8241cb476", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-61-19505", "target_hostname": "www.findingtheuniverse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.findingtheuniverse.com/2010/12/year-in-australia-costs.html", "page_rank": 1.2110738e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "A year <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em> \u2013 <em>the</em> costs", "snippet": "A <em>popular</em> option <em>is</em> to get a station wagon, which you can sleep <em>in</em> <em>the</em> back of. Prices range from about \u00a31000 upwards, and naturally, you can spend as much as you can afford.", "explanation": null, "document": "A year in Australia \u2013 the costs\nI have waxed somewhat extensively on this blog about the 60,000km year long road trip I took around Australia last year. But what I have failed to mention, thus far at least, is what this sort of trip is likely to cost you, should you decide, as I did, to down tools and head out into the wide blue yonder.\nSo now I will rectify that. The bottom line, is that a year in Australia, with all of that travel, with food, with insurance, with flight tickets, with a vehicle, with all those kilometres, cost me just about \u00a312,000, or \u00a332 a day.\nAnd here, in case you were wondering, or thinking about doing something similar, is how that broke down, and where money can be saved. Note that this is written largely from the perspective of coming over from the UK under the working holiday visa scheme, but there is certainly plenty that would apply to most travellers here!\nInsurance\nIf you\u2019re travelling for any period of time, travel insurance is an absolute must, in large part for the medical cover that it provides you should something unfortunate happen to you on your trip. If you\u2019re coming from the UK, you will be covered under a reciprocal agreement under the Medicare scheme, but this won\u2019t cover you for things like repatriation.\nInsurance from a reputable company is therefore a must. Luckily Australia isn\u2019t considered too high of a risk, so insurance for a full year is reasonably priced. Many insurers will do \u201cbackpacker\u201d or \u201cgap year\u201d insurance policies which are usually fairly cheap and will cover most of the basics. Clearly, the more cover you want, the more it will cost. Expect to pay in the region of \u00a3150 - \u00a3300 for a year of cover, more if you have big ticket items to insure like laptops or digital cameras. Remember to always read the policy wording carefully to see what you are signing up for and what the terms and conditions are.\nInsurance -\u00a0 \u00a3150 - \u00a3300\nFlights\nLets face it, Australia isn\u2019t exactly close to a lot of the world, so flights here aren\u2019t ever going to be particularly cheap. A return flight from the UK / Europe is likely to cost you at least \u00a31000. Check out all the usual deal sites and flight search engines, but don\u2019t expect to get to the other side of the world for a song.\nFlights - \u00a31000+\nTransport\nThis, for me at least, was the biggest cost. I wanted to see all of Australia in a year, and it is a somewhat large place. Plus I wanted to get to a lot of places that are inaccessible to normal vehicles, which meant either getting my own transport, or signing on to a lot of tours. As I wanted to go at my own pace, my own transport seemed like the way forward. And for a year, the most cost effective way of doing that was to purchase my own vehicle.\nThe second hand vehicle market for travellers is pretty active in Australia, with key buying spots being Cairns, Perth and Sydney. Prices fluctuate based on demand and availability, with prices being lower in the quieter seasons (think Winter in Sydney) and higher in the busier seasons. Of course, if you are travelling for a year, this largely cancels itself out, as any saving you make on purchase will be lost when you come to sell.\nWe bought, therefore, a second (or possibly fourth) hand Toyota Landcruiser, 1991\u00a0 model, for \u00a34000. Of course, if you aren\u2019t into four wheel driving, or you want something more like a camper van, then there are a myriad options. A popular option is to get a station wagon, which you can sleep in the back of. Prices range from about \u00a31000 upwards, and naturally, you can spend as much as you can afford. Once you have chosen your vehicle, don\u2019t forget to budget for additional equipment you may need, like camping gear, tents, etc.. some travellers vans will come fully equipped, other won\u2019t.\nVehicle cost - \u00a31000 and upwards, in our case \u00a34000, plus around \u00a31000 in gear\nOnce you have your vehicle, you then need to factor in the cost of ongoing maintenance, repairs and of course, fuel. It will also need to be taxed and insured. Expect to pay in the region of \u00a3300 for the latter, and then however much the gods choose to charge you for mechanical damage as you go. In our case we had to get a new radiator, multiple new tyres, new rear differential, new battery and snorkel as well as oil and filter changes every 10,000km or so.\nVehicle maintenance \u2013 approximately \u00a33500\nFuel is of course the other main cost - in fact on a trip like this, fuel accounts for a serious majority of what you are likely to be paying. We averaged around 15 litres of fuel per 100km, although that is higher than most cars as we had a big heavy vehicle. Over 60,000 kilometres, we consumed in the region of 9,000 litres of diesel. The price of this diesel varied enormously, from around a dollar twenty in the densely populated areas, right up to two dollars twenty in the deep outback.\nTaking an average of a dollar seventy per litre, our total fuel costs for the trip were in the region of \u00a38000. When travelling, keep an eye out for fuel deals, often a purchase of groceries over a certain amount will entitle you to a discount at the pump, and these discounts will add up over time to significant amounts.\nFuel \u2013 approximately \u00a38000\nFood / Drink\nFood and drink are obviously something you can\u2019t do without, but are an area where you can save serious cash if you shop carefully. Buy in bulk where you can, stocking up on items that are on offer. If you stick to the value ranges, and aren\u2019t extravagant with your purchases, then you can get by on a fairly tight budget.\nOf course, if you go the other way and spend all your time in restaurants and takeaways, then you may find yourself over budget fairly quickly. In terms of drink, well, one can\u2019t possibly expect to travel without a beer or two of an evening, again, look out for deals and do your best to keep costs down. Buying a case of beer will always be cheaper than hitting the pubs, but don\u2019t forget of course that you are travelling and having fun, so you can\u2019t expect to skimp on everything!\nOverall I would estimate that our food and drink budget per person worked out to around \u00a340 per person per week, and then spiked from time to time when we hit a pub in earnest.\nFood and Drink - \u00a33000\nAccommodation\nThe dream of course, once you have your vehicle, is to head out into the wilderness and camp for free under the stars for the rest of your trip. Unfortunately, the reality is a little bit different. When you start your trip you are likely to spend a fair bit of time in a hostel as you look for your vehicle and get it ready to hit the road, and whilst this is fun, it isn\u2019t necessarily that cheap in a country like Australia. Expect to pay \u00a310 a night for a dorm bed, and \u00a325-40 for a private room (per person). Alternatively, you can rent a timeshare in Australia that will provide you with more space and privacy than a hostel, and can sometimes be found for cheaper on the secondary market.\nWhen you actually hit the road, things will become a better. Australia is a very large country, and there are a lot of places where you are legally allowed to camp for free. Often these camps will be very basic rest stops just off the highway, sometimes with a pit toilet, sometimes not. Don\u2019t expect water to be available. But still, for free, what can you expect.\nIf rest stops aren\u2019t your thing, some national parks are also free, although many operate an honesty system of payment. Another option of course are the commercial camp grounds and holiday parks, and here you can pay anything from three or four pounds per person per night right up to ten or twenty depending on location and amenities. On our trip I would say that we managed to camp for free for just over half of the nights, and ended up in paid sites for the rest of the time.\nAn absolutely invaluable asset if you are planning this kind of trip is the Camps Australia Wide series of books. Issued on a fairly regularly basis, and up to edition five when we did the trip, these list every free and budget minded camp site around Australia, handily located on a full road map of the whole country. This book, whilst a little pricey to purchase, is absolutely a no brainer on a trip like this. It will save you its cost multiple times over.\nTotal Accommodation cost, including hostel at start and end: \u00a31500\nExtras and incidentals\nExtras, of course, are where the price of the trip can sky rocket. There are many many choices of things to do in Australia that are both amazing and often seriously expensive. From sky diving, to bungee jumping, to learning to surf, to heading out to the great barrier reef, to countless tours and adventures, it can all really add up. My advice would be to absolutely do the things you want to do as often these can be once in a lifetime experiences, and money can always be earnt again, but keep an eye on the budget, and if something is likely to wipe six months off your trip due to cost, just weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.\nOn my trip one of the major costs was a trip to Tasmania, which involved taking our large four wheel drive on the ferry. This was not a cheap option, totalling nearly \u00a31000 for the return trip for three of us and a vehicle, but the month we had in Tasmania more than made up for that. Other things we did that cost us more than we would usually spend included a boat ride over to Fraser Island , which was another amazing adventure.\nIn our case our extras probably added up to around \u00a32500 all in, which was a result of being fairly conservative and doing our best to do things ourselves where we could. This includes things you can\u2019t avoid doing, like laundry, and things like festival tickets and what not as we went.\nExtras - \u00a32500\nHow to save?\nBy now you have probably started to tot up the various numbers I have been floating around, and realised that my maths is probably fairly dire, as I am way over the \u00a312,000 mark that I put forward initially.\nThe reason for this, and the number one way that you can save money on a trip like this, is by not doing it alone. As soon as you have a travelling companion, your main costs, which will be largely transport based, will be cut in half. Instead of spending \u00a34000 on a vehicle and \u00a311,000 on fuel and maintenance, I was spending a third of that, as for most of the trip we travelled as a trio. Food costs also come down when you are cooking as a group, and sometimes accommodation works out more effectively too. Even if you don\u2019t know anyone who shares your dream of this sort of trip, you will find plenty of people on the way who will be willing to share costs, at least for a part of your adventure. Seriously consider this, as it is the number one way that you will be able to bring your costs down.\nThe other way you can recoup your costs is by successfully selling your vehicle at the end of the trip for as close to what you paid for it as possible. Due to the vagaries of the exchange rate, which had conspired against us throughout the trip at every possible opportunity, we ended up losing only around \u00a3400 on our vehicle. So one landcruiser, for a whole year and 60,000km, only cost us \u00a3400 in actual vehicle cost. Plus a few thousand in fuel and maintenance, certainly, but that was to be expected. So set aside some time at the end of your trip for the sale of your vehicle, and try your best to get a fair price for it.\nThat was a summary of how I got around Australia for \u00a332 a day. I hope you find it useful. If you are considering a trip to Australia and have any questions, feel free to pop them into the comments or head over to the site\u2019s Facebook page and see what the community has to say. Also, you may want to check out the excellent community over at the Working Holiday Tips Australia Facebook page , where you can find out all sorts of things about this most marvellous of schemes.\nNote \u2013 all the prices in this article were converted to pounds at the exchange rate of 1 pound to two dollars. As this in reality fluctuated throughout the trip, prices changed as we went. It\u2019s not something you have any control over, but it can seriously impact how much your trip costs you.

Now we are left with the best; the number 1 tourist attraction in the great City of London. There is only one maritime museum with the most items and richest history.\nThe National Maritime Museum\nThe museum, created by the National Maritime Act of 1934, is the best maritime museum and the largest of its kind in the world. Aside from the main museum building, it also incorporates the Royal Observatory of Greenwich (ROG) and the 17th-century Queen\u2019s House.\nMost of its collections came from the enormous donations of James Caird.\nSir James Caird of Glenfarquhar\nJames Caird was born in 1864 in Glasgow, Scotland. When he was in his mid twenties, young James went to London to work for the firm that managed the Scottish Shire Line, Turnbull, Martin & Co. Due to his innate intelligence and enormous passion for the industry, he soon became the owner of the Scottish Shire Line \u2013 after just four years of service in the company.\nHis company made great contributions to the maritime industry. They were the ones responsible for the United Kingdom\u2019s open trade with Australia and New Zealand. In 1916, during World War I, Caird built a shipyard in a faraway city in Wales called Chepstow, which is found 124 miles west of London. The area was located away from enemy attack, which enabled them to quickly build ships that could replace the losses from the war. This great contribution to the cause of the Royal Navy led to a government buy-out the following year.\nJames Caird predicted that the industry\u2019s profitability will dip tremendously after the war so he sold many of his shipping interests. To maintain profit, he remained chairman of the Smithfield and Argentine Meat Company and continued to hold significant number of founders\u2019 shares. But he could not leave the shipping industry totally. This is where his heart remained and he continued to be the director for 25 companies that had something to do with shipping, shipbuilding, and maritime trade.\nHaving accumulated a significant fortune, he became interested in preserving the country\u2019s naval and shipping memorials. As a member of the Society for Nautical Research, an organization formed to promote maritime history as an academic field in the United Kingdom, he provided for the cost of restoring HMS Victory in the 1920s. Thanks to him and his \u00a365,000, it is now the oldest naval ship still in commission.\nIn 1927, there was great interest in establishing a national museum for preserving and displaying Britain\u2019s rich maritime history. Of course, Sir James Caird was one of the first people who was more than excited to work towards that goal. With the help of the Society for Nautical Research, a board of trustees was established and Caird was one of the first people on board. When the Royal Hospital School moved from Greenwich to Suffolk, the school\u2019s old buildings were abandoned. Sir James Caird shelled out \u00a380,000 to renovate these buildings into a museum. At the same time, he began purchasing historical artifacts, rare books, globes, nautical instruments, artwork, and shipmodels to help start the collection. According to research, all these items amounted to \u00a3300,000.\nParliament passed the National Maritime Museum Act and three years later King George VI formally opened the museum. Sir James Caird continued to donate items to the collection.\nThe Collections\nAstronomical & navigational instruments\nThe National Maritime Museum (NMM) is home to a large collection of astronomical and navigational instruments \u2013 including about 400 globes and armillary spheres, 40 sundials, 360 telescopes, 70 astrolabes and 40 quadrants.\nMost of the items are from the last 300 years. While some, like the oldest astrolabes are up to 800 years old. Many of astronomical and navigational instruments are housed in the ROG, which was founded by King Charles II himself in 1675. Maritime travels have always depended on effective navigation and many of the objects in this collection are proof of man\u2019s attempts to use the stars to determine his position in the vast open waters of the world.\nCharts & maps\nThe NMM holds more than 100,000 sea charts and maps dating from the medieval period to the present day. These charts and maps document many of man\u2019s expeditions of exploration and discovery throughout history. The vast differences in the items reveal how navigation and surveying techniques have developed through time. Although the collection focuses on charting the seas and coastlines, land maps are also included. Together, these maps illustrate the work of the leading hydrographers and cartographers throughout the entire history of charting and mapmaking.\nCoins & medals\nA fisherman\u2019s charm from Switzerland\nThere are around 5,000 coins and medals in the NMM collection. The entire collection came from a group of private medal collectors that had an interest in naval history. George Montagu, 9th Earl of Sandwich (1874-1962) presented his private collection to the Museum during the 1930s. It included foreign commemorative medals, Roman coins and a collection of French counters or jetons. He also produced a published catalogue that forms the basis of our online collection.\nMost of the Museum\u2019s trade tokens came from the collection of H. H. Brindley. Other items were presented by Sir James Caird and Queen Mary. After the Second World War, the Museum concentrated on collecting war medals, gallantry medals and other awards.\nMost of the coins and medals date from the 15th to the 20th century. It includes Orders from all over the world. An Order is a decoration, awarded by a government, a dynastic house, or a religious body to an individual for distinguished service to their cause. Aside from these, British war and gallantry medals and art medals from Europe and North and South America are also on display.\nSome of the prized pieces include: a medal showing the track of Sir Francis Drake\u2019s circumnavigation (he was a navigator from the Elizabethan era, knighted by Queen Elizabeth I); World War I German medals; and a Victoria Cross awarded to Captain Sir William Peel (the Victoria Cross is the most prestigious award for courage can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces).\nDecorative art\nThe NMM decorative art collection includes silver, ceramics, furniture, glass, jewelry, textiles and craftwork. The total number of items in the collection is almost 6,000 \u2013 dating from the 18th century onwards.\nThe value of the pieces range from priceless to inexpensive to disposable souvenirs considered as fashionable at their time. Commemorative materials peaked production towards the end of the 18th century and continued to the early 19th century. Most of the decorative pieces came from that time period. Of the 6,000 objects, 2,000 are British ceramics.\nPerhaps the most important pieces of this collection are those from Admiral Horatio Nelson (of the Napoleonic Wars, most notably of the Battle of Trafalgar) and his family. Many items, such as engraved silver associated with the Admiral, form what is known as the Greenwich Hospital Collection.\nIn 1948, priceless decorative art that were kept by the 5th Earl Nelson at Trafalgar House were purchased by the government and was added to the NMM. John Walter of Norwich also lent his large private collection of commemorative items, including several Nelson souvenirs. These were later purchased by the NMM. Same goes for commemorative items borrowed from Sir Henry Sutcliffe Smith in 1946, they were also purchased in 1974.\nFigureheads\nThe figureheads and ornamental carving collection traces the development of the art from the late 17th to the early 20th century. A figurehead is a carved full-length figure built into the bow of a ship. An example is this figurehead from HMS Ajax:\nThe NMM holds what is probably the only important figurehead and ornamental carving collection in the world. It includes a wide variety of materials \u2013 from simple scrollwork and ship badges to very large items figureheads and stern galleries. Although naval figureheads form the bulk of the collection, the NMM also holds other forms of decoration from numerous water vessels.\nThe origins of the figurehead and its other counterparts began in prehistoric times. The decoration of ships and other vessels was common among seafaring civilizations of the ancient world \u2013 evidenced by the Egyptian pieces of the collection which date to as old as 3,000 BC. Although the exact reason for placing these figures on the bow of a ship is unknown, it could be inferred that these representations had significance to those of that time; perhaps symbolizing the need for a ship to be guided safely in its journeys across the open seas. In Europe, figureheads were almost always used by the Greeks and Romans, and so did the Viking longboats. The French and English used dragons and other mythical beasts as figureheads in their vessels.\nThe lion was the most commonly used figurehead across much of Europe from the 17th until the mid-18th century (only then did individual designs became more prevalent). It was an obvious choice for Royal Navy warships: not only was it a fierce predator, but it was also a national symbol and formed part of the monarch\u2019s coat of arms. There are a number of lion figureheads in the NMM collection, and most of them could not be identified with a specific vessel since the figure was widely used during its time.\nFilm archive\nThe NMM has a collection of over 1,500 sea documentaries that date back to as early as 1910. more modern films offer a unique view of coastal resorts and ports both in the United Kingdom and abroad.\nFine art\nThe most famous piece of art in the collection is the Battle of Trafalgar by Joseph Mallord William Turner (1805)\nThe NMM fine art collection includes over 4,500 oil paintings and over 60,000 prints, drawings and watercolors; as well as contemporary art, miniatures, photography and sculpture.\nThe oil paintings date back from the year 1530 up until 2000 \u2013 with the earliest being a painting of Portuguese ships by a Flemish artist.\nMarine painting was firmly established in England in the mid-18th century. It is represented in the collection with works by Peter Monamy, Samuel Scott, Charles Brooking, Dominic Serres and many others. The paintings were not only of ships and the sea, but also of sea battles (like the Seven Years War of 1756).\nThen there are important portraits, the earliest of which date from the Tudor and Stuart period \u2013 which includes major portraits of the Royal Family by Peter Lely. Also of importance are the flagmen of Lowestoft series commissioned by James Duke of York after the battle in 1665. There are portraits of naval officers of the 18th century, made by Hogarth, Reynolds and Gainsborough. Some of the more notable pieces are those of William Hodges \u2013 which he made during and after Captain Cook\u2019s second voyage to the South Seas in 1772.\nAfter that time, in the late 18th century and through to the 19th century, so-called \u201cship portraits\u201d became popular. These pieces eventually came to great value when they were used for the study of merchant shipping and trade.\nJ. M. W. Turner\u2019s painting of the Battle of Trafalgar (pictured above) was made for George IV in 1823. This was the largest painting ever made by Turner.\nAs for the late 19th century and early 20th century \u2013 the pieces are mostly the work of William Lionel Wyllie, Charles Dixon and John Everett. The collection also includes works by Richard Eurich, Henry Lamb and John Worsley. And for the late 20th century, the art collection comprises of works by L.S. Lowry, Alfred Wallis, Edward Wadsworth and others, as well as by recently commissioned pictures by John Wonnacott and Humphrey Ocean.\nFlags\nThe National Maritime Museum has over 1,000 flags \u2013 including two large collections of house flags which were used in the past to identify the owners of vessels and the company that a ship belongs to. They were introduced in the late 18th century to enable the owner to recognize and prepare as their vessels approached ports. During the early part of the 19th century, during the expansion of world trade shipping, commercial house flags were seen in ports throughout the world.\nThe house flag of the owner, together with a pennant with the name of the vessel were always on display on merchant ships (usually on the mainmast) during the 19th century. There are also a few name pennants in the collections.\nAside from the merchant ensign, signal flags were also used. These signal flags were one of the most important forms of communication in the sea \u2013 it was used famously by Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar; communicating the message: \u201cEngland expects that every man will do his duty.\u201d The NMM also has many signal flag code books.\nSome of the prized flags include: Captain Scott\u2019s sledge flag and those of other polar expeditions, the ensign of the Spanish vessel San Ildefonso captured at Trafalgar, the unusual White Ensign of HMS Brunswick and the Union flag used by Lord Howe on the Queen Charlotte at the Battle of the First of June in 1794.\nHistoric photographs\nThe NMM holds the United Kingdom\u2019s finest collection of historic maritime photographs. Their prints and negatives date back to the 1840s \u2013 during the humble beginnings of photography.\nThe collection covers every maritime subject \u2013 from British and foreign war and merchant ships to seaports, river and coastal views, and shipyards. The collection includes work by photographers such as W.H. Fox Talbot (he has the oldest photograph: Brunel\u2019s iron screw steamship Great Britain taken in April 1844), Alan Villiers and Bedford Lemere. It includes portraits of the world\u2019s most famous ships, from Aquitania to Zweena.\nThere are approximately 270,000 negatives (glass, nitrate and safety film) and 1,000,000 prints in 1,463 albums. Every sphere of maritime life is recorded in the collections, from the very beginnings of photography with Fox Talbots studio\u2019s hazy to the present day.\nLibrary & manuscripts\nThe Library (named after NMM\u2019s principal founder and benefactor Sir James Caird) contains over 140,000 books and periodicals. It has the world\u2019s largest and most important collection of manuscripts dedicated to archive maritime history. aside from the books, there are also 20,000 pamphlets, 20,000 bound periodicals (which includes 200 current titles) and 8,000 rare books dating from 1474 to 1850.\nThe Library is staffed by a team of professional librarians and subjects specialists who are available to help and advise readers at all times. The Caird Library\u2019s contents range over every aspect of maritime history: emigration, navigation, piracy, astronomy, shipping companies, shipwrecks, biographies, the two world wars, horology, merchant and Royal Navy. There are special collections for researching family history, merchant shipping and warships.\nFranklin Relics\nHere is one of the medals found by Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka in 1878\nThe NMM has over 270 relics from Sir John Franklin\u2019s last expedition. The Franklin Expedition is the worst disaster in the history of British polar exploration. It occurred with the total loss of two naval vessels: Erebus and Terror, together with all their crews.\nThe objective of the voyage was to sail through the North West Passage and carry out magnetic observations. It was led by Sir John Franklin. His second in command, Captain Rawdon Moira Crozier manned the HMS Terror, while Commander James Fitzjames manned the HMS Erebus. The expedition sailed from the Thames on May 19, 1845 and it was last sighted off the coast of Greenland two months later.\nFollowing the disappearance of the two ships, a series of search expeditions were sent out. In 1854, Dr. John Rae brought back stories that the expedition had perished somewhere to the west of the Back River. Then, a privately-funded expedition under Captain F.L. McClintock verified the expedition\u2019s route and the claim that it had traversed a previously unexplored sea route. Most of the expedition\u2019s documents remained missing and encouraged some later searches such as that led by Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka of the United States Army in 1878.\nThe majority of Dr. John Rae\u2019s finds were handed over to the Admiralty by the Hudson Bay Company. They were then given to Greenwich Hospital for display in the Painted Hall in 1854. The McClintock material, initially displayed at the Royal United Services Museum, was later moved to the Royal Naval Museum in Greenwich, and then material from the Schwatka expeditions was added. All these relics were then transferred to the NMM when during its opening.\nShip models\nThe NMM has probably the best ship model collection in the world \u2013 with almost 3,200 models. It has all types: ethnographic, Navy Board, half-block, builder\u2019s, design, waterline and full hull models. And a huge variety of vessels dating from the 16th century to the present day: schooners, steam yachts, paddle yachts, lifeboats, curraghs, cutters, fishing vessels, luggers, and trawlers. There are also topographical models of dockyards and ports.\nThe models date back to the early 19th century when Sir Robert Seppings, a naval architect, founded a national collection of ship models at Somerset House. The collection was relocated to Kensington in the 1860s, to the Royal Naval College in the 1870s, and finally to the NMM on its opening. There it was joined by models from the Greenwich Hospital Collection and the Mercury Collection. Of course, there were also acquisitions by Sir James Caird.\nSince its foundation, the Museum has acquired models from many sources, most notably the R. C. Anderson Collection, the Royal Navy, the Royal United Services Institution and the Science Museum.\nShip plans\nThe NMM looks after the largest single collection of original ship plans in the world \u2013 a total of one million plans from the early 18th century to the present day.\nTimekeeping\nJohn Harrison\u2019s marine timekeeper H4\nTimekeeping is one of the specialties of the NMM. The collection of 1,000 objects is the finest in the world.\nIt includes accurate portable and marine chronometers: time-measuring instruments used in navigation that keep precise time at all temperatures. The collection also contains many clocks with complex astronomical indications and astronomical regulators \u2013 used with a transit telescopes to make accurate astronomical observations. They also have clocks and watches associated with famous naval figures and events.\nThe highlight of the collection is the famous series of marine timekeepers by John Harrison, including the prize-winning H4 which he began working on in 1755. Then there are the timekeepers by London watchmaker John Arnold \u2013 who was first to employ the term chronometer in the modern sense and successfully found a way to simplify Harrison\u2019s timekeeper design.\nUniforms\nAdmiral Nelson\u2019s undress coat \u2013 the one he was wearing when he died by musket at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805\nThe extensive NMM uniform collection holds over 7,000 items of regulation dress, ratings\u2019 clothing, ceremonial wear and accessories. These include uniforms worn by Admiral Nelson, Edward VII, 1st Earl Beatty and Admiral John Arbuthnot Fisher.\nThe majority of the merchant uniforms date from the 20th century \u2013 including the standard uniform used in 1918 and those relating to particular shipping lines. The merchant uniforms include a small number of those of the Honourable East India Company.\nWeapons\nThe weapons collection of the NMM includes firearms, ordnance and edged weapons (swords and daggers). It also has examples of cannons, cannon balls, shot, mortars and howitzers ranging from the 18th century to the more advanced 19th and 20th century inventions. The firearms include 18th century sea service pistols and guns of 20th century, including those used in the World Wars. The edged weapons comprises of over 600 swords including regulation and presentation types. There are a number of ethnographic weapons such as spears and bows and arrows brought back from earlier expeditions.\nThe Peter Harrison Planetarium\nThe NMM is home to London\u2019s one and only planetarium, which features Europe\u2019s first digital planetarium projector. The new state-of-the-art planetarium is found in the Astronomy Centre of the ROG. Entry fee is \u00a36 for adults and \u00a34 for children.

It comes in granulated and powdered forms.\nErythritol has been used in Japan since 1990 in candies, chocolate, yogurt, fillings, jellies, jams, beverages, and as a sugar substitute.\nErythritol is classified as a sugar alcohol. Sugar alcohols, also called polyols, are sugar substitutes that are either extracted from plants or manufactured from starches. Some of the more common sugar alcohol sweeteners are sorbitol and xylitol.\nSugar alcohols also occur naturally in plants. Erythritol is found naturally in small amounts in grapes, melons, mushrooms, and fermented foods such as wine, beer, cheese, and soy sauce.\nHow Sweet is Erythritol?\nErythritol is approximately 70 percent as sweet as table sugar (sucrose). Some manufacturers, however, claim that their erythritol products are as sweet as sugar.\nHow is Erythritol Made?\nErythritol is usually made from plant sugars. Sugar is mixed with water and then fermented with a natural culture into erythritol. It is then filtered, allowed to crystallize, and then dried. The finished product is white granules or powder that resembles sugar.\nWhy Do People Use Erythritol?\nErythritol has almost no calories. In the United States, erythritol is labeled as having 0.2 calories per gram, which is 95 percent fewer calories than sugar. In Japan, erythritol is labeled as having zero calories.\nErythritol has not been found to affect blood sugar or insulin levels and has a zero glycemic index.\nErthyritol has a clean, sweet taste. I've found that it\u2019s more similar in taste to sugar than other natural sweeteners such as stevia (which can be bitter).\nIn reasonable amounts, erythritol doesn\u2019t cause digestive upset and diarrhea that other sugar alcohols like sorbitol and xylitol are known to cause. This is because erythritol is a smaller molecule and 90 percent of erythritol is absorbed in the small intestine and for the most part excreted unchanged in urine. This quality makes erythritol unique among the sugar alcohols.\nErythritol isn\u2019t metabolized by oral bacteria, which means that it doesn\u2019t contribute to tooth decay.  Erythritol was approved for use as a sugar substitute in Japan in 1990. In the United States, it is classified as being Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) since 1997. It was approved in Australia and New Zealand in 1999.\nWhat are the Side Effects?\nExcessive consumption of erythritol (over 80 grams per day) may result in digestive upset, diarrhea, and bloating.\nWhat are the Downsides of Erythritol?\nErythritol has a cooling effect on the mouth, unlike sugar.\nErythritol isn\u2019t as sweet as sugar. It is approximately 70 percent as sweet.\nErythritol doesn\u2019t dissolve as easily as sugar.\nErythritol still isn\u2019t easy to find. Currently it is available online and in some health food stores and groceries.\nSources:\nCargill. \"Erythritol.\" 2006.

They either seem to have everything that they could possibly want or I have no idea what to get them. If you have someone like that on your list that loves beer here are ten gifts that they will certainly enjoy.\n1. Buy Them a Beer Online\nThis works especially well with distant friends. Here's how it works: You go to a website that offers this service. You buy your friend a beer or pretty much any kind of drink. They are contacted by the site with the news that they now have a credit to go out and have a drink on you. Want to give it a try? Check out YouGotBeer.com or Beer2Buds.com . These sites work quite differently from each other so check them both out.\n2. Magazines\nThere are some really good beer magazines out there.\nAll About Beer , US - Every issue is packed with industry news, articles that study beer in depth, and a ratings section that rates hundreds of beers.\nBeer & Brewer , Australia and New Zealand - A quarterly that features industry news, beer & food matching, home brewing tips and beer tasting notes.\nDraft , US - This magazine focuses beer drinking culture. Glossier and with a little less depth than the others, it is good for idle thumbing.\nBeer Advocate , US - This is the ultimate craft beer lover's publication from the owners of BeerAdvocate.com.\n3. Beer Books\nEvery year there are new books about beer on the shelves. Here are some recent titles of interest:\nRed, White, and Brew by Brian Yaeger - This is an entertaining book about one man's beer odyssey as he explores the American craft beer scene, one brewery at a time.\nChristmas Beer - This wonderful little book features reviews of author Don Russell's fifty favorite Christmas beers as well as some entertaining histories and anecdotes about Christmas beer.\nThe Brewmaster's Table - Perfect for the gourmand beer lover, this book explores the pleasures in the relationship between real beer and real food.\n4. Breweriana\nCollecting beer memorabilia is something that all beer lovers do at one level or another. Whether it be a labeled pint glass or two from favorite breweries or a rare 19th century bottle from a long gone brewer these items represent brand loyalty, devotion to the brew, and the owner's particular love of beer. You can find signage, glasses, bottle openers, key-chains, and all sort of other things from you beer lover's favorite brewery. If the brewery itself doesn't have a website with items for sale - and most do these days - then you can usually find collectibles from many breweries on EBay.\n5. Clothing\nBeer themed clothing will also go over well with most beer lovers. Make sure, though, that if you are buying brand specific beer clothing that it is from a brand your beer lover actually likes! Most breweries sell tee shirts and caps. Some also offer pants, jackets, gloves, and pretty much any other article of clothing that you could think of with their logos emblazoned on them.\n6. Beer!\nI suppose that this is a rather obvious choice but one worth mentioning. Nothing would make me happier that a six-pack of good beer on any holiday or for my birthday and I'm sure most beer lovers agree. Whether you go all out and pick out a beer gift basket or just go down to the liquor store and pick up a pack of your beer lover's favorite, nothing can top the perfect simplicity of this gift.\n"}, {"score": 930.47687, "uuid": "f83ad1ea-7bb5-5a0c-921a-5c584c85d6ed", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300wb-22-22478", "target_hostname": "www.seniors.gov.au", "target_uri": "http://www.seniors.gov.au/internet/seniors/publishing.nsf/Content/Contribution+-+BarrieA", "page_rank": 1.1899578e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "seniors.gov.au - <em>What</em> was it like - living <em>in</em> <em>the</em> <em>Australia</em> of <em>the</em> war", "snippet": "Part A <em>What</em> was it like - living <em>in</em> <em>the</em> <em>Australia</em> of <em>the</em> war years?

Part A\nMuch of what follows comes from my own memories as a young boy. I hope that my memories will encourage you - if you are old enough - to travel back over the years to your own younger days and to remember what happened.\nMy experience of the war came between the ages of seven and thirteen, and my memories range over:\nMaking camouflage nets (or helping the Country Women's Association (CWA) ladies do it) - the CWA made hundreds of thousands of nets across Australia\nHelping to pack Comforts Fund parcels\nTrying to dig an air-raid shelter under the clothes-line at home (it ended up about big enough to house a small dog)\nHaving zigzag trenches dug in the playground of our little country school at Bexhill, near Lismore on the north coast of New South Wales\nSitting on the school horse-paddock fence watching long convoys of Australian and American servicemen heading north\nLater, at high school in Lismore, hearing the air-raid sirens being tested each week\nMeeting and helping entertain servicemen when they bivouacked on our farm and others\nSinging and playing instruments with my family at the soldiers\u2019 send-offs and welcome-homes - singing songs like...\n'There\u2019ll Always be an England while there\u2019s a country lane\nThe Army, the Navy and the Air Force have made old England\u2019s name\nWe\u2019re Swingin\u2019 Along the Road to Victory and\nWe\u2019re Gonna Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line if the Siegfried Line\u2019s still there'\nAnd we formed a kids\u2019 version of the VDC (the Volunteer Defence Corps) - the Home Guard or Dad\u2019s Army as the British version was called.\nObviously one of the biggest effects of the war on those at home occurred when a loved one went off to fight and wasn\u2019t seen perhaps for years. Much worse was the impact - the tragic impact - when news was received of a loved one who had been killed or wounded, or captured, or was missing. And after it became known that prisoners were being subjected to barbarous treatment, the anxiety of their families became much greater.\nThe Second World War touched many thousands of Australian families in these ways, although not to the same extent as the Great War, in which 60,000 Australians had died. About 39,000 died in World War Two.\nOne of the difficult questions that arose was how the news of servicemen\u2019s deaths should be broken to their families. This was a real problem - whether the local clergyman (who in those days was much more a part of the community than, sadly, is the case today) should deliver the news, or whether it should come via the telegram boy. The churches felt that their ministers were best equipped, by training and experience, to perform this task.\nEventually there was a compromise under which local committees of clergy and postmasters decided how the telegrams were to be delivered in their areas. Even this led to confusion, and in the end Arthur Fadden, as Acting Prime Minister, announced that all telegrams would be delivered by telegram boys. That is what happened until the war ended and all such terrible messages had been delivered.\nIn 1941 the Jehova\u2019s Witnesses were proclaimed a banned organisation. People of German and Italian descent, some of them long-time citizens of this country, were interned in considerable numbers. At the peak of this process, in September 1944, nearly 7,000 people were behind barbed wire in 18 camps spread across the country.\nI suppose the most evident inconvenience of the war for those at home was rationing - mainly of petrol, food and clothing but also things like tobacco and newsprint. This led to displays of greed and selfishness by some in the community. It also produced two other wartime phenomena - hoarding and the black market. One man was found to have hoarded 200 44gal drums of petrol.\nPetrol rationing began on 1 October 1940. The day before, motorists in Melbourne (and no doubt other places) indulged in an orgy of petrol-buying, carrying away full tanks and drums, cans and even bottles. A lot of petrol was spilled in the buying frenzy.\nWhen it was announced that rationing of clothing was to be introduced, shoppers in some places rushed the stores and carried away armloads of clothing in what was described as a \u2018frenzied, unedifying stampede\u2019. I remember the shopkeepers cutting the coupons out of the ration books with a pair of scissors as purchases were made. Then they would put the money and the docket in a cylindrical container, attach it to a pulley on an overhead wire, pull the cord, and send it flying up to the cashier\u2019s office, high above the floor. The cashier would send the change back in the same way.\nTea, sugar, meat and butter were rationed. In 1942, each person over nine years of age was entitled to one ounce of tea per week (I think it was increased to two ounces later), and you had to register with a shop to get your ration. Some people soon tumbled to the fact that they could register with several shops, but I think something was done to stop that from happening.\nBecause of the petrol shortage, many cars were simply put up on blocks. A family friend, got her old sulky out of the shed, harnessed up the pony, and started using this, to me, very novel and exciting form of transport. I was delighted one afternoon when she gave me a ride - my first - in the sulky from my grandmother\u2019s place back to our house.\nThe rationing of petrol led to the appearance on top of buses in Lismore of large canvas bags filled with \u2018town gas\u2019 and to the fitting of gas-producers to many vehicles. Our baker had a gas producer on his van, there was one on the school bus, and the butcher delivered the meat in a horse-drawn cart, with a saddle horse alongside to take the meat to houses that weren\u2019t close to the road.\nMy brother, only 16 years old, constructed a gas-producer in the cow-bails on our dairy farm, out of four-gallon drums, 3/4in galvanised pipe and other bits and pieces. He only did it to see if he could, and actually got it to work - which I thought was a pretty good effort. He made his own charcoal by burning old wooden fence posts in a hole in the ground, covered with earth.\nThe only problem with my brother\u2019s gas-producer was that, when the charcoal was loaded into the burner and the contraption was fired up, the heat inside the burner melted the air intake pipe.\nPetrol rationing didn\u2019t end until almost 10 years after it began. In the 1949 federal election campaign, the coalition ran the slogan \"Empty out the socialists and fill up the bowsers\" and, after being elected, ended petrol rationing on 8 February 1950.\nOn all those nights driving to and from concerts and dances in our 1935 Hillman Minx, we could travel only very slowly because the headlights were fitted with things like top hats, with slits in the top of the \u2018hat\u2019 that allowed only a weak gleam of light to fall on the road. The car had wide white stripes painted along the edges of its mudguards and running boards in the hope that it would be more easily seen in the dark by other drivers.\nThe austerity campaign which began in 1942 was designed to conserve scarce resources and make it possible for Australia to feed and clothe Britain, as well as free-up workers for war-related work. Meals in hotels, restaurants and cafes were limited to three courses, and the maximum prices that could be charged were four shillings for lunch, five shillings for dinner, and three shillings for all other meals. This is just one example of the mass of regulations and restrictions that affected almost every aspect of daily life.\nOn beef-less days it was an offence to buy, sell or eat beef. The 'Australian Women\u2019s Weekly' ran a competition for the best meatless recipe. The winning recipe was for mock sausages:\n'Boil one cup rolled oats in three-quarters cup salted water for 15 mins, then add finely chopped onion to flavour. Mix well, empty into basin. When cool add one beaten egg, pepper and herbs to taste, one cup breadcrumbs. Shape into sausages, roll in flour and fry in deep boiling fat until golden brown.'\nThe Minister for War Organisation of Industry, John Dedman, introduced the Victory Suit for men - no buttons that weren\u2019t functional, no trouser cuffs, slimmer legs and fewer pockets. There was also the short-tailed shirt. For women there was no evening wear, no excessive fullness in garments and little decoration. We were told: watch out for the \u2018Squander Bug\u2019.\nAttempts were made to reduce consumption of alcohol but these attempts largely failed. So did efforts to curb gambling. These things consumed much of the money that Prime Minister John Curtin wanted invested in war bonds and loans.\nYou could get a new tyre or tube only if you were an essential user, and produced the worn-out article. To get tobacco, cigarettes, meat or boot polish, you had to be a good customer of the shopkeeper. Building materials, nails, screws, tools, tinned foods, chocolates, bacon, biscuits and washing blue either disappeared or were hard to find. For many people the beer shortage was both a national and a personal catastrophe.\nYou needed a permit to travel any distance. By applying a zoning system to bread deliveries in Sydney and Melbourne, the manpower authorities freed up 1,214 men for other work, 361 motor vehicles and 770 horse-drawn vehicles.\nThere were limits or prohibitions placed on the production of furniture, jewellery (except wedding rings, for which there was a big demand), lawnmowers, fur coats and many cosmetics. Icing could only be used on wedding and birthday cakes, and it had to be white. You could employ only one domestic servant, unless the manpower authorities said you could have more than one.\nThe austerity campaign had another purpose. Curtin was very concerned that while soldiers were dying in the green hell of the New Guinea jungle, people at home were, as he put it, \u2018fiddling their leisure away\u2019. He wanted greater equality of sacrifice and stronger commitment to the war effort. Austerity, he said, would improve the quality of the nation.\nThis story is continued in Part B.....\nBarrie, Jerrabomberra, NSW\n"}, {"score": 929.88245, "uuid": "79808f9e-0769-52c3-92c8-a68d275c59b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400wb-63-19947", "target_hostname": "www.powderlife.com", "target_uri": "http://www.powderlife.com/magazine/issue/12/features/brews-japan-beer-review", "page_rank": 1.1766413e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Brews of Japan: <em>the</em> <em>beer</em> <em>in</em> review | Powderlife Niseko", "snippet": "<em>Beer</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> world\u2019s oldest and <em>most</em> widely consumed alcoholic beverage, and <em>the</em> third <em>most</em> <em>popular</em> drink overall, after water and tea.

With a slightly syrupy mouthfeel, it sports a pale, amber hue.\nRating: 2.5\nCanadian Ale\n(5% Alcohol)\nThe local crack at an amber ale, this one is much richer in flavour and very nice on the palate. A subtle sweetness, perhaps honey, is detected by those with keen tastebuds.\nRating: 4\nDark Ale\n(5% Alcohol)\nWith a lighter mouthfeel, compared to some other dark ales, Niseko\u2019s black beer is sweeter than the Yebisu dark, and goes down quite smoothly indeed.\nRating: 4\nPilsner\n(4.9% Alcohol)\nWith a golden colour and the fresh aroma of hops, this lightly flavoured beer is as refreshing as any good pilsner. Otaru Beer has mirrored similar brewing traditions as once used in Pilsen in the Czech Republic, home of the first pilsner at the Urquell brewery.\nRating 4.5\nDunkel\n(5.2% Alcohol)\nSmooth and creamy, this roasted brown beer boasts a rich, creamy taste of malt and caramel. True to old-school tradition, which Otaru brewers take pride in, German brewing methods were closely followed here, and also noted by the palate is a slightly higher alcohol content.\nRating 4.5\nWeiss\n(5.4% Alcohol)\nPopularly known as Otaru\u2019s \u2018Banana Beer\u2019, the full-flavoured Weiss (Bavarian slang for wheat) is brewed in true German Bavarian style, and uses 50 per cent wheat malt, combined with special yeast, to produce the exquisite banana aroma and a cloudy appearance in the glass. A sweet and bitey brew.\nRating 4.5\nKera Piruka \u2018Penguin Beer\u2019\n(5% Alcohol)\nAlthough quite cloudy and stormy, a nice amber colour prevails. A hint of honey means this one is quite sweet, balanced by a decent hopping. A longer fermentation results in a slightly dry mouthfeel.\nRating 4\nFurano Omugi (Happoshu) \u2018Seal Beer\u2019\n(4.8% Alcohol)\nThis one\u2019s okay for those who don\u2019t like much kick to their beers by way of flavour. Only lightly hopped, and with slightly less of an alcohol content, it\u2019s more in the style of a cold-filtered crystal malt lager.\nRating 2.5\nDaisetsu Pilsner \u2018Polar Bear Beer\u2019\n(5% Alcohol)\nClear in colour as the ice this polar bear would lay about on, it starts with a smooth and fruity first taste, into a dry, hoppy bite to finish. Best served colder.\nRating 3\nHamanasu Draft\n(5% Alcohol)\nQuite fruity upon first tasting, an under-hopping and few bubbles mean easy drinking and not much as far as body goes. With Hawaiian-style flower artwork and showing off a peachy pink colour, this could be one for the women.\nRating 1.5\nBlue Beer\n(5% Alcohol)\nApparently the Hokkaido brewer Abashiri likes to get its pastels out when it comes to beer \u2013 this one\u2019s blue, and perhaps best suited to Smurfs. Without much body, it must be said that thanks to its colour, this beer does have some novelty value.\nRating 2.5\nAle\n(5.5% Alcohol)\nHop and wheat ingredients are both balanced particularly well in a beer that manages to be rich in taste at the beginning, then thirst-quenching and refreshing afterwards. No wonder this brewery\u2019s source of water is found in Japan\u2019s list of purest water sites in the country.\nRating 4\nPilsner\n(5% Alcohol)\nA bottle-fermented pilsner, high-quality hops are used here for a balanced combination of bitterness and refreshing characteristics \u2013 Hokkaido\u2019s formidable try at a Czech pilsner. A moreish flavour and pleasant, full-bodied mouthfeel keeps you coming back for more.\nRating 4.5\nStout\n(5% Alcohol)\nDark in colour, as stouts tend to be, this top-fermented beer is fresh and refreshing, with a slight bitterness that lingers after your mouthful. \u2018Pirkawakka\u2019 means \u2018beautiful water\u2019 in the indigenous Japanese dialect, which shows in the purity of this brew.\nRating 4.5\nWeiss\n(5.5% Alcohol)\nHokkaido Beer\u2019s crack at a German-style Bavarian Weiss beer, a yellow-white in colour, this brew uses plenty of wheat and yeast, to reach a final result that is fruity, mild and sophisticated.\nRating 4\nLocal watering holes\nPowderlife popped in to a couple of Niseko pubs that specialise in the world's best beers...\nBELGIAN brewmaster Paul De Coninck boasts a mouth-watering menu of 40 different kinds of beer in his quaint yet charming little hole in the wall, Paul\u2019s Caf\u00e9 & Bar.\nTucked away in Hirafu\u2019s Middle Village on Momiji-Zafa Street, the bar with an adjoining restaurant is the only place in Niseko where genuine Belgian beers \u2013 even Trappist monk brews \u2013 are poured with love, passion and their trademark head every day of the week. In fact, Paul, born in Antwerp (one of the world\u2019s beer capitals), is the only Belgian beer bar owner in Japan, owning a second watering hole in Hokkaido\u2019s capital, Sapporo.\n\u201cI always tell my customers that sake is to the Japanese what beer is to Belgians \u2013 there are just so many different flavours and styles,\u201d Paul says. In fact, of the seven Belgian trappist brews available in the world, Paul says he stocks six. Not bad going. Some of the Belgian beers on offer are the fruity Hoegaarden, an 8 per cent Chimay bitter, Leffe\u2019s darkly sweet drop, the devilish Duvel, fruity novelty beers from Chapeau, and even a hard-to-get Asahi pilsener draft called Kita Mo Shokunin, only made and sold in Hokkaido.\nPaul\u2019s Caf\u00e9 is open daily from 5pm-11pm. He even holds a \u00a5400 Stella Artois happy hour from 5pm-7pm every day, which is just in time for some apr\u00e8s ski refreshment, we reckon.\nPADDY McGinty\u2019s manager Alan Power assures us he would never pour any customer a beer of a quality he wouldn\u2019t drink himself. That\u2019s probably an easy promise to keep, seeing as though he imports his Irish bar\u2019s creamy, genuine Guinness stout direct from James\u2019 Gate brewery in Dublin, the home of the legendary beer and its famous brewery. Alan says the only difference between the Guinness at Paddy\u2019s and that served in Dublin bars is, oddly, in the physical weight of the beverage itself. It tastes spot-on, he reckons.\n\u201cBecause the Guinness needs to be sent greater distances to get to Japan, the brewing process is different, and to improve shelf life they need to process it slightly more for longevity\u2019s sake,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis means the beer is a little lighter because it loses density in this process.\u201d We believe Alan may just know his stuff.\nAlan, also known as \u2018Paddy\u2019, left Dublin when he was 18 years old, and for the past 14 years has called Japan his home. Alan has seen the advent of the Irish bar really take off in Japan. \u201cThe first Irish bar opened in Japan about 75 years ago, and since then have become a staple and pop up everywhere \u2013 just like in many other countries in the world,\u201d he says.\nBut Guinness isn\u2019t the sole attraction at Paddy\u2019s, located on Hirafu-Zaka Street, the main road up to the Hirafu lifts. The bar opened its doors in October this year, and the popular, buzzing pub, with assorted Irish paraphernalia on the walls, is the only place in Niseko where fans of creamy heads can get a pint of Kilkenny fresh from the tap.\n"}, {"score": 929.6839, "uuid": "0d5d3a0e-6cc1-500b-a03a-c5744a3ab9ed", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-19-19511", "target_hostname": "college-in-australia.com", "target_uri": "http://college-in-australia.com/", "page_rank": 2.1708337e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "College <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> <em>most</em> important thing to remember <em>is</em> that there are such diverse opportunities and rewards to working and studying <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em> that each experience will differ according to <em>the</em> interests and aspirations of <em>the</em> individual.", "explanation": null, "document": "College in Australia\nCollege in Australia -\u00a0Gain new qualifications and study in Australia\nAA Education offers detailed information for those interested in studying, moving, travelling or working in Australia.

Maybe you associate Australia vast tracts of desert, or coral reefs, or maybe with Nicole Kidman, or with Cricket. Of course it\u0092s possible that when you scoured the map for possible study destinations, you saw Australia perched there, all the way down south, and drew a complete mental blank. Allow us to remedy the situation.\nAustralia-note, not Austria- began its life as a penal colony. The colonization of \u0091Oz\u0092 began with British convicts being deported, and we can assume they were none too happy about it. Little did the British know then, that they were deporting their ruffians to a veritable island paradise. In Australia today a steady stream of international\u00a0 students to Australia\u0092s cosmopolitan and suburban centres has helped to its culture to evolve beyond a reliance on convictism, beer and footy, towards something more nuanced and fluid. Every student from every culture leaves a mark on Australian culture itself, and whether your mark is outback or inland, in the classroom or in the workplace, we welcome it. You could say that Australian culture\u0092s tendency to embrace difference is what makes it\u0085well\u0085different.\nAustralia is home to in excess of thirty Universities, many of which rank highly by international standards. Depending on your intended subject specialization and Visa conditions, it\u0092s possible you could find a paid internship on completion of your degree, perhaps even employment on a permanent basis owing to the increasing demand for skilled labor in the Australian job market.\nStudy options are not limited to tertiary institutions, as there is also an abundance of Vocational Training (VET) programs which are delivered largely through TAFE learning centres. TAFE is a learning institution, similar to a community college, which provides students with a variety of skills-sets and qualifications ranging from certificates of attendance or \u0091tickets\u0092, and licenses, to advanced diplomas, many of which are nationally recognized. The most important thing to remember is that there are such diverse opportunities and rewards to working and studying in Australia that each experience will differ according to the interests and aspirations of the individual.\nAs the U.S is more than Uncle Sam, France is more than Escargot, and China is more than Tea, so too is Australia more than kangaroos or barbeques.

That in itself is a risk. The market is betting on two big potential areas of blue sky the company is pushing; its re-emergence into the beer market in 2014 and major sales improvement from its Indonesian operations.\nThe Indonesian growth has made CCA one of the better-performing bottlers in The Coca-Cola Company's global family.\nLast year profits from this territory grew 17.5 per cent and over the past six years they have increased fivefold.\nAdvertisement: Story continues below\nCatching the wave of the increasingly prosperous Indonesian market and pushing Coke as an aspirational product is getting results. So is the company's continued investment in manufacturing and logistics.\nThe risk highlighted by some is whether CCA can hold on to this territory in the face of a potential land grab from another of TCCC's favoured bottlers, FEMSA, which is looking at acquiring the Philippines Coke operations.\nThere have certainly been times in Coke's history when there was a bit of a free-for-all around receiving head-office permission to buy in and sell out of international territories.\nCCA has previously owned the South Korean and Philippines areas and had bad experiences with them.\nBut CCA boss Terry Davis takes the view that a successful Indonesian performance is probably his best insurance policy. Territory changes are less random than in the past.\nThis just leaves beer. When Davis arrived at CCA it had a target of 20 per cent of earnings from beer, but he didn't make it. The web of international brewers' ownership makes getting a foothold back in the Australian market an interesting exercise in beer politics.\nThe four biggest imports are now in the hands of Lion Nathan - the largest and the biggest prize being Corona.\nAlready, CCA is busy preparing to wrestle some of these popular imports away from Lion and Foster's - hoping to capitalise on its logistics and network muscle. Lion won the Corona contract just a few months ago and its duration is unclear, although it is speculated to be three years. This is certain to be where CCA will be placing most of its effort.\nWithout these beer and Indonesian growth drivers, CCA should not be able to justify the premium in its share price.\nIts non-alcoholic beverages business in Australia - dominated by Coke - has been doing it tougher than usual, particularly over the past year. But this is not the sort of business that is prone to falling off a cliff. Rather, this makes CCA just the sort of staple stock that cyclical investors feel safe with in times of uncertain economic conditions.\nOne of the bigger factors affecting sales of soft drinks is the weather and, after two wet summers, CCA is desperate for a dry patch.\nIt has also needed to grapple with a push by the two dominant supermarket suppliers to discount most shelf items and claw back margins from suppliers such as Coke.\nDavis does not seem overly concerned by the supermarkets. While admitting it does put his margins under pressure, it is no greater than that being felt by the heavyweights in other markets.\nCoke also has the ability to invest in its manufacturing and distribution processes, to reduce the cost of doing business. Smaller supermarket suppliers don't have the resources or the brand muscle to do this.\nCCA's return on invested capital is now running at 25 per cent, compared with 7.6 per cent when Davis joined the company. In particular, CCA has been putting money into its manufacturing process and reducing its cost of doing business for 11 years.\nMargins are coming under some pressure but CCA says this is no greater than the pressure felt by the likes of Tesco and Walmart.\nDavis had to make a few acquisitions along the way but resisted the pre-GFC acquisition spree that others were seduced into. The company, luckily, refused to take the bait and outbid SABMiller for Foster's.\nDavis, with a couple of small exceptions, has made his mark at CCA as a patient man who is prepared to keep his powder dry, investing in his own businesses rather than taking risks buying others.\n\u25a0Here is a bit of irony. It appears News Corp's Australian operations have become the subject of an attempt by hackers to get into their IT system.\nAccording to an online technology news group, Delimiter, an email was sent out to News Corp's Australian staff telling them about a fraudulent email purporting to be from the company's IT help desk.\nThe real boss of News Corp's IT, John Pittard, immediately alerted his staff to the hacking attempt.\nHe told staff: ''This is a 'phishing' exercise by an external source who seeks to hack into our network.''\nPhishing is IT-speak for a hacking technique designed to get user information including passwords and credit card details.\nJoin the conversation\n"}, {"score": 924.2866, "uuid": "51426928-530b-525e-bd7a-392ffcae5a0f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-90-33080", "target_hostname": "goaustralia.about.com", "target_uri": "http://goaustralia.about.com/od/tassightseeing/a/hobartsights.htm", "page_rank": 1.2708783e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Hobart <em>Australia</em> - <em>What</em> to See and Do <em>in</em> Hobart", "snippet": "Art galleries, arts and crafts shops and souvenir stalls are open <em>most</em> days of <em>the</em> week at Salamanca Place.

Get the information you need at the visitor centre on Davey St.\nWalk down to Battery Point and walk through its maze of narrow streets to view convict-built structures.\nVisit the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery at Macquarie St close to the visitor centre and discover the riches of Tasmanian heritage through fauna and mineral displays, maritime and convict history, early Australian art and stories of Tasmania's Aborigines.\nDiscover the craft markets\nEvery Saturday, Salamanca Place becomes a bustling marketplace with handcrafted products, gemstone jewelry, and assorted, often unique, other products. Art galleries, arts and crafts shops and souvenir stalls are open most days of the week at Salamanca Place.\nCasino\nAustralia's oldest legal casino is found at Sandy Bay south of Hobart city centre. Have a flutter at the gaming tables, enjoy floor shows, dine in its restaurants.\nBeer and chocolates\nThere are tours to Australia's oldest brewery, Cascade Brewery, southwest of the city centre; and to Australia's largest confectionery manufacturing plant, the Cadbury Chocolate Factory, on 15 hectares of land up the Derwent River some 12 kilometres from the Hobart city centre, and yes, you get free chocolates as well.\nGo on a daytrip\nTravel southwest from Hobart to the Huon Valley. Take a jetboat cruise at Huonville. Take the scenic route back to Hobart through Cygnet and along the D'Entrecasteux Channel.\nIf you have time, or on another day, take the ferry from Kettering across the D'Entrecasteux Channel to Bruny Island.\nDrive roughly east, then south, to the Tasman Peninsula and visit the historic site of Port Arthur . Take the ghost tour if you dare.\nDrive northeast to the historic village of Richmond , and see the church and bridge built in colonial times, get lost in a maze, be a Gulliver in a miniature model village.\nOutdoor activities\n"}, {"score": 917.4122, "uuid": "879811a4-3910-5109-ba2f-5ce5bb0cddbf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0407wb-35-10043", "target_hostname": "www.gapyear.com", "target_uri": "http://www.gapyear.com/features/148869/a-guide-to-working-in-australia", "page_rank": 1.176707e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Working <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em> | gapyear.com", "snippet": "Thousands of people go out to <em>Australia</em> to earn good money. <em>The</em> Australian economy <em>is</em> booming at <em>the</em> moment, much stronger than <em>most</em> other countries, and <em>the</em> minimum wage <em>in</em> <em>Australia</em> <em>is</em> one of <em>the</em> best <em>in</em> <em>the</em> world.", "explanation": null, "document": "Working in Australia\nAn Introduction to Working in Australia\nWorking in Australia is a perfect option for many backpackers. As the number one backpacker\u2019s destination in the world, and with millions of tourists making the trip each year, staying in Australia long term is high on a lot of travellers agendas. Prolonged stay makes working in Australia essential so we've broken down everything you need to know.\nThousands of people go out to Australia to earn good money. The Australian economy is booming at the moment, much stronger than most other countries, and the minimum wage in Australia is one of the best in the world. These factors meant that Australia beat the recession and the economy continues to grow annually.\nAustralia is a beautiful place to visit, but the fact that you can earn fantastic money whilst you\u2019re out there makes the attraction a lot stronger.\nDaniel Lucas, the general manager of the TCP Group, a recruitment consultancy, had this to say:\n\u201cWe estimate that there are around 200,000 jobs for travellers available in Australia right now.\n\u201cThe jobs market for working holiday makers is going strong in Australia with plenty of opportunities for 18-30 year olds in most industries.\n\u201cThere is still huge demand for workers in regional parts of the country allowing travellers to earn good money, save most of what they receive and apply for a second year visa afterwards.\n\u201cAny Brits with a sales background, farming background, au-pair or nanny experience, horse-riding skills or nursing, care experience need to buy a ticket and get over here ASAP\u201d\nFigure 1 - Enjoying an ice cold beer after a day\u2019s work fruit picking.\nWorking Holiday Visa (WHA)\nHow much does it cost?\nCan I get more than one visa?\nThe UK and Australia have reciprocal agreements so any British citizen aged 18 to 30 can get a working holiday visa (WHV). They cost AU$270 and allow you to work for 12 months from the date you arrive. \u00a0Anyone over the age of 30 will be denied a working holiday visa.\nYou can extend the visa and obtain a second working holiday visa if you can provide evidence that you undertook 88 days of agricultural work (for example, fruit picking) in Australia during your first year. However, you can\u2019t work for the same employer for more than six months. Australian authorities check every one in four visa applications, so don\u2019t be tempted to claim you\u2019ve worked when you haven\u2019t.\nTo be issued a working holiday visa you need proof that you can support yourself - AU$5,000 is advised. You can apply online for a working holiday visa and it only takes a couple of hours to complete.\nYou can leave and re-enter Australia using this visa as many times as you like during your year. However, if you permanently leave Australia without staying for the full 12 months you cannot go back, say, a year later and use the remaining months of your visa, so you need to be careful and\nOnce your visa has been approved you will be told what you need to do. Basically, your passport will be stamped when you arrive and you'll have a year before you have to leave. Simple really. Everything is tagged electronically so there\u2019s little paper-work to worry about.\nHarvest Work in Australia\nWhat do I need to pick fruit?\nWhat is the work like?\nTo work in Australia you'll need a:\nAustralian Tax File Number (TFN) - apply for once you\u2019re in Australia\nAustralian bank account (e.g - ANZ, Commonwealth, Westpac) - apply for once you\u2019re in Australia\nA working holiday visa - apply online\nA good sense of humour\nFrom grape harvesting in Berri, through mango picking in Darwin, to banana humping in Tully \u2013 there are hundreds of places you can fruit pick in Australia. Each year thousands of travellers become fruit pickers to bring in the fruit and vegetable harvests, and there are jobs all year round.\nNinety per cent of travellers get their second-year working holiday visa by fruit-picking. You need to clock-up 88 days, all signed off by a farmer, to apply for a second-year working visa. It\u2019s hard, physical work, but there can be a great sense of community: you\u2019ll be working with other backpackers and locals. And you\u2019ve all got one thing in common - you need the money.\nThe hours are long and hard, often working in the baking sun. An average week can be anything up to 10 hours a day, seven days a week.\nHarvest factory work. This is another popular choice for backpackers - it\u2019s not hard to find short-term, casual work on a production line or in a packing room. The work itself won\u2019t be very stimulating, but you don\u2019t need any experience or qualifications, and if you\u2019re working with a good bunch of people it can be a laugh. You\u2019ll find work through agencies, local newspapers or backpacker notice boards.\nFigure 2 - The wide open spaces that you\u2019ll call your \u2018office\u2019.\nWorking Hostels in Australia\nIt\u2019s really easy finding accommodation in Australia. A fair few places have working hostels, which are hostels that will find you fruit picking work. For example, there are a number of working hostels in Berri, Bundaberg, Bowen and Tully, just to name a few. Bundaberg has one of the biggest fruit picking communities, great for working in Australia, and everyone stays in working hostels.\nThe hostel will arrange work for you through their contacts with the farmers. They usually arrange transport to and from the farm to, so all you need to do is show up. Oh, and work too\u2026\nOther Ways of Work in Australia\nI don\u2019t want to pick fruit. What else can I do?\nRanch work - This is a little bit niche and not all that easy to sort out for yourself. There is a demand for people working in Australia as \u2018jackeroos and jillaroos\u2019 as they\u2019re known, but it\u2019s skilled work and not for the absolute beginner. Companies such as Changing Worlds do offer supported work placements if you\u2019re not completely confident of finding a position by yourself. Otherwise, lots of cattle stations have diversified and offer backpackers the opportunity to get a taste of the real \u2018Outback\u2019 experience.\nBar work or waiting - From hip bars in Sydney to tiny pubs in the Outback, there\u2019s plenty of jobs available for bar and waiting staff across Australia. Most will require you to have some experience - why not get a job in a UK pub before you go to learn the tricks of the trade? You\u2019ll be much more employable if you know a Castlemaine from a Cosmopolitan.\nYou\u2019ll also need a Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) certificate, which you can only get once you\u2019ve arrived in Oz. This involves taking a one-day course (four hours), which will teach you not to serve alcohol to toddlers or unconscious people, and then sitting a written exam about it. The course will set you back AU$70. You can\u2019t get a job in a bar without the RSA (legally), so man-up, cough-up, and take the test. No one ever fails.\nOffice temping - Your best bet for finding work in larger towns/cities might be to sign-up to a temping agency. Businesses approach these agencies looking for temporary staff to work in call centres or offices for cold calling, data entry positions and administration. Working in Australia through an agency is a good option as they pick the most relevant people from their books and offers them the work. Make sure you ring your agency or pop in regularly \u2013 if you\u2019re fresh in their minds and seem keen then you\u2019re more likely to get work. You\u2019ll know whether work like this suits you or not: the pay isn\u2019t bad, and the hours are generally sociable (Monday to Friday, 9 to 5:30), but you might feel that you didn\u2019t go travelling to sit behind a desk.\nTips on How to Save Money Whilst Working in Australia\nA lot of farm work includes accommodation and meals, which is a fantastic way to save money, and living on a farm means you don\u2019t have much opportunity to spend your hard earned cash.\nAfter a while, and after you\u2019ve seen your bank balance grow significantly, you\u2019ll starting thinking about how you\u2019re going to spend your money. Why not travel around Australia or New Zealand? A lot of backpackers in Australia travel and see the world after they\u2019ve saved up enough mullah.\nA great way to save money is to work for bed and board. If you plan to stay in one place for a bit, a great way to cut down on your costs is to do a few hours work a day in exchange for somewhere to sleep and something to eat. Tasks can involve anything from manning the front desk to making the beds, but it\u2019s always easy work (even if it means cleaning out the toilets) and you can live a pretty easy life.\nYou won\u2019t make yourself rich this way, but it\u2019s a good way of extending your trip without doing anything silly, like working hard or getting stressed and stuff like that.\nWWOOFing - otherwise known as the WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms, is a loose network of national organisations which facilitate the placement of volunteers on organic farms. Basically, this means you find a farm to work on, apply, get accepted, and then work for a certain number of hours a day in exchange for food and lodgings. Easy peasy\u2026\nFigure 3 - Loading sweet potatoes after picking them.\nCan I Really Save Money to Travel?\nThere\u2019s never a firm answer to the question \"How much money will I need?\" but it is possible to work out a rough budget for yourself. Australia represents many and varied opportunities for lightening your wallet, but here\u2019s a rough idea of what to expect. Most travellers budget AU$1,600 - AU$2,300 per month, depending on what type of traveller you are, how often you are drinking (this is where a lot of money magically disappears) and how many activities you do.\nObviously, if you\u2019re working in Australia rather than travelling, then you\u2019re going to save loads of money. Living in Australia isn\u2019t cheap, but it can be\u2026 If you buy value food and cook together, then you can save a lot of money.\nHow Much Tax Will I Pay?\nSo long as you stick to the conditions of your visa, you can do any job you like in Australia. Minimum wage in Australia is an absolute dream. It is AU$15 per hour, but most fruit picking jobs pay AU$17- AU$21.\nYou need a Tax File Number. You can apply for a TFN online or speak to a government official on the phone to have your TFN sent to you. You will need a permanent or semi-permanent address and most hostels are happy to supply theirs for this reason.\nAppropriate taxes are paid on all earnings, usually at 13%. The rate will be determined by your background and the current working arrangements. These are collected by the farmer and submitted to the Australian Taxation Office. If you fail to provide a TFN you will be taxed at the highest rate of 49%. Working hostels will go through the paperwork with you to make sure you don\u2019t get ripped off.\nStill Worried About Going?\nLeaving your mates, family, casual friends, girlfriend/boyfriend, old work colleagues, cat/dog (yup - seriously!) and familiar support structure back home is a really tough thing for most people, but you\u2019re unlikely to find yourself feeling lonely.\nQuite the opposite. The backpacker community is a fun, lively place. Over 100,000 Brits alone head to Australia every year. So statistically the day you land so will another 270 others! Add in another 400,000 backpackers of other nationalities - so no, you won\u2019t be alone, unless you want to be.\nThat\u2019s the best bit about living and working in Australia - lots to do in one of the most amazing places on the planet! Your options are:\nLive and work in one region - head to Western Australia, say, and stay there for the whole period;\nWork for a few months, then move on\u2026 work for a few months, then move. The pros are that you can see the whole country by working in Australia. The cons are that it will cost you money and if you don\u2019t find work where you end up your cash might run out;\nDo six months on the east coast, six months on the west coast and spend weekends and time off travelling around seeing the place.\nOther Ideas\nWith RTW tickets from as little as \u00a3749 (though you have to buy your own flight from Nz to Oz) and you might be tempted to do this as part of a Round the World trip. A lot of people are doing this right now as they don\u2019t have any job to come back to or they\u2019re on no defined time scale (and they\u2019re young enough to make the most of the opportunity as they are commitment free)... which means the money you earn in Australia can keep you on the road for a long time.\nTo give you a rough idea\nOne month in Vietnam could cost you around \u00a3600, which is the equivalent of working for 34 hours behind a bar in Sydney...\nThree months in South East Asia could cost you around \u00a32,000, which is the equivalent of working for five weeks fruit picking\u2026\nSix months travel around India, Nepal and Burma\u00a0 (now Myanmar) could cost you around \u00a32,500, which is the equivalent of saving AU$640 per month doing farm work. That\u2019s only AU$160 per week! You can earn that in a day\u2026\nGapyear.com Members Thoughts on Working in Australia\nLouise Denton, 24, from Birmingham: \u201cI left for Australia on my first backpacking experience in August 2008 on a working holiday visa.

Being in the great Aussie outdoors, living in remote areas with some new found friends was an amazing, different experience to home.\n\u201cAustralia has so much to offer! I\u2019m so glad I went!\"\nCharlotte Riley, 25, from Scotland: \u201cI left in 2008 for an eight month trip to Oz after finishing university. I then left Oz two years later! It was a fantastic experience in a fantastic place.\n\u201cAustralia is such a varied country and each state is very different. I have wonderful memories of the time I spent living in places that were unique and worlds apart from my life at home, whether it was on a farm in rural Queensland or sharing a tiny apartment with eight people on Sydney's Darling harbour!\n\u201cWorking in Australia was the best!

Muskett (?-1909)\n[Return to Top]\nRecommendation for physical exercise circa 1890\nIt is a fortunate thing, then, that most people have to earn their own living, for the exertion thereby entailed is actually necessary for health.\nYet, while this is the case with those who live by their bodily labour, it hardly applies to those who are more dependent upon mental work.\nFor instance, the latter include literary men and journalists, the members of the professions, and those of the vast commercial world--all, indeed, who have brain strain and clerical occupations.\nIn their case the great fault is that they use their heads too much and their limbs too little. For them walking is one of the very best means of obtaining health, and it should be regularly and systematically practised.\nIt has been said that no man under sixty, unless he be kept walking while at his work, should walk less than six or eight miles a day, if he wishes to keep well and have healthy children. In the cooler weather in Australia these are certainly suitable distances, but in the hot months half these amounts will be found sufficient, and they had better be carried out in the cool of the evening. Then again, for those over sixty it has been well observed that a daily walk is still the best means of promoting health. But the walk must always be proportionate to the strength, and should be done at nothing more than a moderate pace, if a man wishes to take care of his blood vessels.\nSource:\u00a0The Art of Living in Australia \u00a01893\u00a0by Philip E. Muskett (?-1909)\n[Return to Top]\nThe indifference to domestic life \u00a0 circa 1890\nEvery one who has the welfare of Australia and of Australians at heart must feel some concern at that growing indifference to domestic life which is so much the characteristic of our girls.\nOnce a girl has left school, she seems to think that the household is no longer any place for her; she consequently ceases to take any interest whatever in the many matters which constitute the management of a home: her one aim is to get into \"business,\" as it is called.\nIt appears to be immaterial whether she is to be a dressmaker, or milliner, or saleswoman, or employee in a large establishment, as long as she gets away from home.\nNow, all this is greatly to be deplored, and has a disastrous influence over the whole of Australian family life, because it must happen that many of these girls eventually marry, and commence their new existence under the most unfavourable conditions.\nIn the first place, they are totally ignorant of everything connected with household management, and what is far worse, they have almost a contempt for it.\nWhat the result is, in too many cases, I have already dwelt upon,-- either the husband and the family suffer from the effects of bad Cookery, and unhappiness and ill-health follow, or else the bread-winner flies to alcohol in order to forget his troubles.\nIt must not be imagined however, that this condition of affairs is altogether beyond remedy, and that our Australian girls are hopeless in this respect.\nNo, on the contrary, those of whom I have just spoken are as attractive and fascinating--as Australian girls always are; but it is a thousand pities that they do not possess a greater appreciation of the importance of home life.\nSource:\u00a0The Art of Living in Australia \u00a01893\u00a0by Philip E.

This was largely a result of the reduction in death from ischaemic heart disease.\nWhat this meant was that there has been in Australia an unanticipated greater degree of survival of our elderly population.\nMoreover, service providers have been dealt a \u0091double whammy\u0092: not only have they been confronted with a situation in which there are an unexpectedly large number of older people surviving, but the survivors may be \u0091sicker\u0092 on average than in the past.\nThe people \u0091rescued from death\u0092 by the new developments in medicine etc., who previously would have died, are generally not rescued in full health.\nAccordingly, the incidence of illness and disability among the elderly population has increased.\nHence the incidence of disability and hardship among the older population has increased in Australia.\nReference:\u00a0 1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2001\nHealthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth (years), 2002\nDefinition: Healthy life expectancy (HALE) is based on life expectancy (LEX), but includes an adjustment for time spent in poor health.\nThis indicator measures the equivalent number of years in full health that a newborn child can expect to live based on the current mortality rates and prevalence distribution of health states in the population.\nHealthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth (years)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for Australia\nMales\u00a0 71 Years \u00a0Females\u00a074 Years\nSource : World Health Organization\nThe disability adjusted life expectancy\nThe disability adjusted life expectancy, is the equivalent number of healthy years a person can expect to live from birth.\nThe total life expectancy for men now is about 75.5 years, the disability adjusted life expectancy is 69 years.\nThe loss of healthy life as a percent of the total life expectancy is about 9%.\nWomen live longer, 81 years, and their disability-adjusted life expectancy is also longer, at about 74 years.\nBut again, the proportion of their total life expectancy is effectively lost due to disability and death is around 9%.\nReference: Mathers C. et al.

This is a common problem in wealthier countries all over the world.\nToday's social and environmental influences, as with those 100 years ago, are far more powerful in child health and disease than are the drugs or medical care facilities we have at our disposal to treat them.\nAre we going to respond to change our social, emotional and economic environments to improve child health as effectively as did our forebears in the years after Federation?\nThere are changes starting to happen generally in society as a reaction to the excesses of this era, such as the desire of the people to protect the environment, to be better parents and value families, to work less for our own income and more for the community.\nWill these start to improve child health the way that decreases in poverty, better food and access to fresh water and sewage disposal affected malnutrition and infectious disease in the 1900s?\nWe must all work to make it happen.

This is the month of leprechauns, the vernal equinox, women\u2019s history month, and\u2026.the STOUT! So before we start drinking the heck out of this style, here is a little bit about it\u2019s early roots\u2026\nThe humble origin of the Stout harkens back to January, when we investigated the history of the Porter . As you may recall, the Stout emerged as the younger and, well, stout-ier brother: the style \u201cStout Porter\u201d referred to a stronger version of the Porter (at 7-8% instead of the typical Porter 6%).\u00a0 So, the term \u201cStout\u201d was more an adjective than a style. Eventually, the original Porter fell by the wayside\u2013but are you surprised? The Stout Porter was stronger and richer than the original\u2013and who doesn\u2019t love a strong and rich man\u2013er, beer?\u00a0 Well, the Stout was loved so much, that doctors actually prescribed Stouts, so to speak, to athletes and nursing mothers to help them regain strength\u2013or, in other words, regain their Stoutness. Stouts, Porters, and Stout Porters lost their popularity in England when a restriction was placed on making roasted malts during World War I, at which time the mild Ale won over the hearts of the Brits. However, it took the Irish population by a malty storm!\nStout Propaganda: \"Guinness is Good For You\"\nArthur Guinness opened his Dublin brewery in 1759, producing (along with an Ale) what can be considered the first Stout Porter.\u00a0 (In 1799, Arthur made a wise decision to focus solely on Porter production\u2013that\u2019s why we see no Guinness Ales today.)\u00a0 In the mid-1800s, the \u2018Porter\u2019 nomenclature was dropped, and thanks to keen advertising and calculated exporting, Guinness (with the help of other Irish breweries Murphy\u2019s and Beamish & Crawford) made the Stout one of the most ubiquitous beers in the Western World.\u00a0 Of course, it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for this smooth brew: in the 1800s, Stouts became less popular, as it was expensive to produce based on the types of grains needed; and as mentioned earlier, the WWI restriction on roasting malts halted production in England, leaving the job to the mighty Irish. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s, when beer writers such as Michael Jackson (the beer god, not the music god) took an interest in the style, that the Stout was resurrected.\nThroughout its development, a number of stout variations emerged, in England, Ireland, and beyond. The following will be included in this month\u2019s beernalysis!\nThe Stout Styles\nEnglish Stout: The first to appear on the scene, the English Stout is notable for its black color and use of charred barley, which gives the beer a roasted, coffee taste. Chocolate Stouts are characterized under English Stouts; the malts in a Chocolate Stout are left in the kiln until they develop a chocolate taste and color.\u00a0 (In some cases, actual chocolate is also added to the brew.)\u00a0 Similarly, the malts of a Coffee Stout are roasted until they are as bitter as freshly ground coffee beans (and also, some brewers add coffee grounds to highlight the flavor).\nForeign/Export Stout: The Export Stout took the English Stout and made it a helluva lot more alcoholic to survive a journey across the sea where it was being exported. In fact, this style is still found in many tropical areas to where Stouts were first exported, such as Jamaica and Malta.\nIrish Dry Stout:\u00a0 The most popular of the Stouts, popularized by the aforementioned Guinness, Murphy\u2019s, and Beamish. The Irish Dry Stout is the lighter of the Stout styles\u2013it has lower carbonation and a uniquely creamy body, with a roasted and crisp taste.\nIrish Stout\nMilk/Cream/Sweet Stout: This is not for the lactose intolerant!\u00a0 The Sweet Stout has a high content of dextrins and unfermented sugar that makes this Stout sometimes oddly sweet.\u00a0 Milk/Cream Stouts are very similar to Sweet Stouts, but brewers add lactose to the brew kettle to add body and some sweetness. This was one of the beers that doctors would recommend mothers drink, because of the dairy content. In fact, one of the original Milk Stouts, Mackeson\u2019s, claims to have 10 ounces of \u201cpure dairy milk\u201d in it.\nOatmeal Stout: As you can gather, Oatmeal Stouts are made with oatmeal, which is added to the mash. The major characteristic of this type of Stout is its smoothness. Oats have been used in beer production since the medieval times in Europe. It remained popular in Northern Europe, but Tudor sailors hated the bitter flavor that it caused in the beer so much that it died out in other parts of Europe. There was a brief revival at the end of the 19th century, when people thought that including oats would be healthy.\u00a0 (But, of course, that\u2019s like eating a bar of dark chocolate, washing it down with a bottle of red wine, and saying you did it for heart health.)\u00a0 Subsequent Oatmeal Stouts used a very little bit of oats. When Michael Jackson wrote about the Oatmeal Stout in the 1970s, a European distributor commissioned the Samuel Smith Brewery to recreate the style; thus, their Oatmeal Stout has become one to imitate. The Oatmeal Stout can now be found in new incarnations all throughout the world, from Denmark to Australia. Fair warning, though: don\u2019t expect it to taste like downing a big bowl of oatmeal; the uniqueness of this beer is in its smooth body.\u00a0 (Oatmeal is used as a major component of moisturizers, too\u2026)\nRussian Imperial Stout (sometimes just Imperial Stout): This was a whole big marketing campaign on the part of Thrale\u2019s brewery in the 17th century to impress Catherine II of Russia, as one story goes. Another is that Peter the Great, while visiting London, loved the Porter so much, that he requested Barclay Brewery send it over to Russia. However, the beer would spoil on the trip over; thus, a stronger brew was created to survive the journey. Barclay did so by brewing a beer with a higher alcohol and hop content. Rumor has it that Catherine the Great enjoyed this new recipe so much that she ordered kegs upon kegs of it to stock her court. And if it\u2019s good enough for the courts, it\u2019s good enough for us.\nCatherine II with an Imperial Stout. Photoshop Credit: http://ladiesocb.com\nOyster Stout: Oysters, you say? Oysters! Back in olde time England, Stouts were enjoyed with a full plate of oysters in the taverns. But the two were not formally combined until the 1920s in New Zealand. Later, this recipe popped up back in London, and even later, after WWII, oysters were added to Stouts as another way of trying to infuse health benefits into beer, such as the Milk Stout campaign. Today, some breweries add oysters, while others only use the name, implying that the beer should be consumed with oysters. Vegetarians, be wary!\n\"Guinness Guide to Oysters\" / Credit: Appellation Beer\nWhile the British Isles hold the proverbially patent on the Stout, other countries have certainly had their fun adapting the style with local ingredients and recipes. Most notably, us crafty Americans!\nAmerican Stout: American Stouts range in their tenacity and ingenuity. There really is no way to generalize the American Stout, other than that they have a tendency of materializing as some crazy renditions of the English and Irish classics (from an Imperial Milk Stout to a Chicory Coffee Stout). However, one major difference is that American Stouts will often have a stronger hop presence than their British counterparts.\nAnd with that\u2026we venture into this month looking for the roastiest, maltiest, sweetest stouts this world has to offer. Stay tuned and drink up!\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 911.25555, "uuid": "af0ca814-a819-57d4-b848-b063c11111e0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0601wb-38-05266", "target_hostname": "www.siamaffiliate.com", "target_uri": "http://www.siamaffiliate.com/shenzhen1.htm", "page_rank": 1.2546063e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>the</em> <em>popular</em> city <em>in</em> china , shenzhen", "snippet": "Window of <em>the</em> World runs many programs during holiday periods too. <em>In</em> <em>the</em> summer holiday, <em>the</em> International <em>Beer</em> Festival <em>is</em> a big tourist attraction.

The simple furniture such as tables, stoves and basins are made of stone as it the stone-paved path. When you come to the Mosuo people's yard, you will find that the prototype of modern flats originated from the Mosuo people's living structures. They piled the solid wooden stocks crossways into a square or rectangular house which was quakeproof. What really interests tourists is that this group is today the world's only matriarchal community in existence. The Dai ethnic group inhabits Yunnan Province where there is an abundance of bamboo. Because of this, all the girders, tiles and roofs in their homes are made entirely of bamboo. Yes, you may call it 'a bamboo garden'. Actually, this kind of building is a two-storied attic in the air. Dozens of wooden stocks support the whole attic and the floor is tiled with flakes of bamboo. Here is the Mongol ethnic group which is generally known as 'a group on horse back' because of their nomadic living habits. Mongols live in the yurts which are not only cool in summer and warm in winter but easy to set up or dismantle. No matter which group you are visiting, young boys and girls will warmly welcome your arrival.\nBrilliant Festivals\nIf you come at right time, you will be able to experience some unique festivals of the minorities. In the Water-Splashing Festival, water is splashed on each other. In addition, the dragon-boat contest each spring, maintains the most important event in Dai people's lunar calendar. They hope to get rid of evil and misfortune from the last year and anticipate blessings in the coming year. Come prepared to get thoroughly soaked. In contrast, The Torch Festival is the most traditional event of the Yi ethnic group and held in the sixth month of the Chinese lunar calendar. Tourists will see the Yi people in bright garments carrying torches as they walk around their houses and farmlands. Usually, chickens or ducks will be sacrificed to pay homage to ancestors. Maybe you will be invited to take part in the performance when the villagers happily sing and dance around their bonfires. The breathtaking and memorable Knife Bar Festival of the Lisu ethnic group is celebrated in the second month of the Chinese lunar calendar. This two part festival starts on the first day by demonstrating the 'jumping into the fire sea'. Several barefooted men jump in and out of a blazing fire. The performance on the second day is as adventurous as that on the first day. It is called 'climbing the mountain studded with knives' because courageous men will climb a ladder formed by two wooden poles with 32 sharp long knives inserted crosswise on their inner surfaces. When barefooted heroes reach the top of ladder, they light the firecrackers to declare their success. This traditional festival commemorates Wang Ji, a hero who valiantly helped the Lisu people to resist foreign invaders during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).\nScenic Spot Area\nThe Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses that are ranked as the eighth wonder of the world are located at Xian City, Shaanxi Province. After the first emperor of China in the Qin Dynasty (A.D.221-206) ascended the throne he ordered more than 700,000 workmen to build him a grand mausoleum. In Splendid China the terracotta figures have been faithfully reproduced and arranged like the originals. The entire assemblage is very grand.\nThe Great Wall, with a total length of 6,700 kilometers (about 4,163.3 miles) is the world's longest protective wall. It was built in the Qin Dynasty ( A.D.221- 206 ) and repaired time to time during the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644). In Splendid China, tourists may see three miniaturized sections of the wall made of scree, white stone and small green bricks respectively. These green bricks were specially made and brought here from Beijing.\nThe Forbidden City, also called The Imperial Palace, is the largest and best-preserved ancient architectural complex in China. In Splendid China, the miniature encompasses the gorgeous spectacle of Emperor Guangxu's (1875 - 1908) marriage. The Forbidden City has been ornately and beautifully replicated and as with the original the dominant color is yellow, the symbol of the royal family.\nThe Old Summer Palace, also called Yuan Ming Yuan, was a cultural treasure house of luxurious jewelry, priceless paintings, calligraphy works and rare antiques in the past. But the real Old Summer Palace was reduced into a ruin by the Allied British and French Armies in 1860 and again by the Eight-Powers Allied Army in 1900. The miniature of The Old Summer Palace shows a recreation of the complete and original royal garden. It has been made according to a full and authoritative plan that was found by accident in the Forbidden City in 1990.\nSplendid China has many more miniatures of places of historical interest to offer you, such as the Ancient Observatory of Beijing, the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, Tibet's Potala Palace and so on.\nMt. Huangshan, lying at the Anhui Province, middle part of China, is proud of its rare pines, bizarre rocks, and the sea of clouds as well as hot springs. Standing on the summit, one will see how small the creatures are beneath the mountain. Characteristics of all famous mountains are reflected clearly on Mt. Huangshan.\nIn the replica of the Li River, you will be surrounded by a pleasant water and mountain garden. This miniature spot gives you a picture of the seemingly relaxed and contented lifestyle along the real Li River, Guilin City, and Guangxi Province. Taking a bamboo skiff on the river, one will see a vast expanse of blue water and peaks.\nMore miniature spots of natural scenes are also included such as the Huangguoshu Waterfall, Stone Forest, and West Lake and so on.\nWindow of the World\nShenzhen Window of the World is a fantastic replica park situated at the Overseas Chinese Town. Here you can see vivid replicas of the world's wonders, historical heritages and famous scenic sites. The entire masterpiece is built at ratios of 1:1, 1:5 or 1:15.\nWithin one day, you can visit many reproductions of famous sites from different countries. For example you can find the Mahamuni Pagoda of Rangoon and the Angkor Wat of Cambodia here. European architectural splendors, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Ancient Athens, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Tower of London will carry you back to the cradle of classical European culture. When you tour the miniature Roman Colosseum, you might notice a cruel and bloody scene. Enjoy the picturesque scenery as you take a gondola along the canals of Venice. Mysterious Africa is always full of life and vigor. Here, the Pyramids and the Sphinx are quietly waiting for your visit. After traveling through typical African hamlets, you come to the Oceania. Sydney Opera House, which boasts a unique style, is a landmark not only of Australia but also the whole Oceania. Looking from a distance, it looks like a luminous pearl on the vast expanse of blue sea water. The rumbles of Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon lead you to the America, a young continent. These two natural wonders are awe-inspiring. Moving on to modern civilization, in the replica of Manhattan you will see rows of towering skyscrapers. No wonder they say the rhythm of life speeds up here.\nVisiting during a festival time is another way to experience this replica park. Annually the park holds the Cherry Festival and the Indian Cultural Week. During the Cherry Festival, wandering in the cherry garden of Japan and taking a cup of tea will refresh you. Window of the World runs many programs during holiday periods too. In the summer holiday, the International Beer Festival is a big tourist attraction. Probably, the Pop Music Festival is the favorite of young people. This is held on China's National Day. In December, Santa Claus welcomes New Year's approach. Following this the World Dance and Singing Gala is held during the Spring Festival. Taking part in the entertainment activities complements your travel plan.\nThere are a number of adventure trips for you to choose from. For example, test your courage by navigating the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. In the Archery Field, tourists may follow the ways of North American Indians and learn to hunt prey in the lush woods. Even more exciting is to traverse the primitive tropical forest in a cable car. Skiing in a subtropical city might sound strange, but the Indoor Alpine Ski Run in Shenzhen Window of the World offers you four thousand square meters (about 6,200,012 square feet) of indoor piste to ski.\nBEIJING\n"}, {"score": 911.10394, "uuid": "2c7e013a-7abd-5d66-a4f6-9d18185e4542", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100wb-75-22602", "target_hostname": "www.beerguide.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.beerguide.com.au/beer/view/1291/-100", "page_rank": 1.2818954e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "# 100 - Nogne O Det Kompromissl\u00c3\u00c2\u00b8se Bryggeri | <em>Beer</em> Guide to <em>Australia</em>", "snippet": "<em>Most</em> enjoyable <em>in</em> a comfortable chair <em>in</em> front of a roaring fire..

Overcome with gratitude (or something like that), he impetuously asked her to produce a piece explaining some of the insanities to the readers of Matrix. This is the result. ---\nSo tell me about alt.fan.pratchett.\nInitially, alt.fan.pratchett appears to be a normal newsgroup. But fairly quickly, one of its idiosyncrasies becomes apparent: many of the thread titles begin with '*R*' or '*I*'. This, though, is a minor foible: it's the subject matter of these threads that may be baffling.\nFirst we should ask 'what' (or possibly 'why') is alt.fan.pratchett? Although nominally the newsgroup dedicated to discussion of the works of Terry Pratchett [2] , one of the first things that the reader discovers about afp (for such is its usual abbreviation) is that its threads mutate away from the subject line faster than you can say 'polymorphic inheritance'. While threads may be started by someone who wants to say something about one of Terry's books, many, nay most, veer off at a tangent.\nThe lurker should perhaps consider afp to be two newsgroups, masquerading under the same name. The first would be better titled rec.arts.books.pratchett, consisting of serious discussions on such subjects as the plotlines of the novels and the mechanics of the Discworld, and this is what many are initially looking for. [3]\nUnfortunately for these innocents, there is a second afp, which is a general free-for-all between people who assume that the other readers have similar interests, and who will start threads with no apparent relevance to the subject at hand. Frequently, these threads will maintain the same title that they had previously, with the result that an article titled 'Dragon digestion' may actually discuss the mating habits of the Boeing 747. (For those that are interested, it appears that the result is not the Learjet, nor even the HS 146, but rather a small submarine larva that eventually creeps ashore near Seattle, pupates in a large hanger, and eventually emerges as a full grown Jumbo.)\nSome of the tangents are well-worn paths, which include discussions about beer, roundabouts, bread, merkins [4] , children's t.v. programs, quantum mechanics and proposals.\nAnother tendency is for some afpers visiting other newsgroups to crosspost apparently relevant articles to afp. These then frequently mutate, thereafter causing much consternation to the original group from which they were crossposted.\nWho are we?\nUnsurprisingly, the majority of the posters are in the UK, although there is a strong representation from Australia, New Zealand and America [5] . There are also regulars in Eire, Germany, South Africa, Scandinavia and The Netherlands. An indication of the international nature of the group can be surmised from the fact that the afp FAQ [6] is maintained by Orin Thomas in Australia, and the APF [7] is maintained by Leo Breebaart in The Netherlands (both of whom, by the way, do a magnificent job). There are also a number of web pages scattered around the globe - for example Colm Buckley at Trinity College, Dublin has scanned in the Clarecraft catalogue of Discworld figures and jewellery [8] .\nOf those in the UK, a fairly high proportion are university students. A certain amount of trepidation pervades the group as September approaches - as in many newsgroups, it sometimes gets called 'newbie season' as the new intake of students arrive at university and many hit the net for the first time, with all that that entails. The flurry of activity that this causes usually dies down by about November. The other main flurry of 'activity' tends to happen in May and June, round about finals time - personally, I put it down to stress :-)\nOn the whole, we are a friendly bunch. Like most groups, we have our up and downs (thankfully with nothing like the level of vitriol or flaming I have seen flying around in other groups). I tend to agree with the description mooted a while back, that it is like nipping down to your local for a pint and a natter with the regulars.\nWhat's this about *R* and *I*?\nBecause of the dual nature of afp, (and because the volume of posting is quite high, especially during university term time) a consensus was reached in the group that people should indicate the nature of the content of the thread in the subject line - not by the title of the thread: as explained above, that can be completely misleading - but by a series of codes. The idea is that it allows people to skip those threads in which they have no interest.\nThe first two to be adopted were *R* and *I*, which was an attempt to indicate the spilt between the two parts of afp. A thread with an *R* in the subject line supposedly indicates that the posting contains something relevant, such as news about Terry (signing tour details, television/radio appearances, performances of the plays based on the Discworld books and serious comment about his writing) or news about Discworld merchandise [9] . *I* (for irrelevant) indicates that the thread has wandered off to discuss things like the sexual dimorphism of hovercraft, or quantum butterflies. Posters are expected to retitle the thread with the relevant code when it crosses the ill defined border between the two, and though this doesn't always happen, one may quite effectively filter afp by only reading the articles with the *R* code in.\nThe Annotated Pratchett\nOne of the joys of reading Terry's works is that, especially in the Discworld novels, the books are peppered with veiled references to things in this world. Although the Discworld may be a flat world resting on the backs of four giant elephants, who in turn are standing on the back of an even bigger turtle which is slowly swimming through space, the characters thereupon are far from your standard 'Another flagon of your best ale, landlord' fantasy characters, and much of Terry's effect is due to his deliberate contrast of the setting with everyday references from our own world.\nAs a result, one of the favourite pastimes of afpers is annotating Terry's books. Many of these references come from popular culture - for instance, the Blues Brothers, Dirty Harry and Meatloaf - but others may be from classical mythology or modern physics. Eventually, these annotations tend to be collected together and published in the Annotated Pratchett File (or APF, which causes a certain amount of confusion in its naming).\nSomewhat inevitably, a new code, *A*, was adopted to signify these annotations. This allows those afpers who haven't yet had the chance to read one of the books, either because it's as yet unavailable in paperback, or because the publishing schedule in other parts of the world is still far from consistent, to avoid 'spoiler' articles.\nOh, no, not the game!\nSome months ago, a Discworld graphic adventure game was released, initially for the PC. After an initial flurry, it was recognised that a large number of posts started 'Help, I'm stuck at.....' etc., so *G* was introduced, and a game FAQ and walkthrough created [10] . The consensus appears to be that the game has wonderfully atmospheric graphics, the dialogue is very nicely done, but that it could really have done with more playtesting, and that some of the puzzles seem to lack all sense, even in retrospect.\n'Colette, will you marry me?'\nOne of the more unusual traditions of afp is the marriage proposal. Originally, the first proposal came from a lad impressed by the sense of humour of one of the female posters, and was regretfully declined by its recipient on the grounds that she was already married, although this was felt by onlookers to be insufficient reason. However, this has since evolved into a tendency to make such proposals to any (apparently) female poster, especially if she is to mention that she hasn't thus far received one. In order that no-one should be deprived, certain regular posters now propose to just about everyone. As the proposals are seen as a form of friendly greeting, no-one expects the proposee to say 'yes'... [11]\nThis in turn has spawned a series of challenges to duels between afpers who have proposed to the same person. One duel has actually taken place - fortunately for the participants, the weapons used only fired foam rods.\n*F*: Fanac\nThis electronic atmosphere has moved into the 'real' world. Not content with sitting in front of our screens, we have got out to meet each other. There have been several 'afp meets', mostly in pubs, and a couple of months ago an afp meet was organised round a formal hall at Trinity College, Cambridge (thanks, Tony). Meets have also taken place in the States and in Australia.\nBy the time this appears in print, Bernard, Isobel and Tom Pearson of Clarecraft will have held their 'Discworld Event' - a weekend of fun and games, complete with barbecue and beer tent, at their factory in Woolpit. (On visiting their factory earlier this year being shown round the place, I came away thinking: 'people get paid to do this? - where did I go wrong?!').\nAnd, as an outgrowth of all this, the first Discworld convention will be taking place next year, on June 28th-30th, in Manchester. [13]\nTerry and afp\n'Does Terry Pratchett really post here?' Yes, he does. One of the myths of afp is the large number of posts asking that question, but, contrary to popular rumour, I can't recall seeing a posting to the group asking that - however, I've only been in the group for just under two years, and it may well have been a problem in earlier days. However, he does get a lot of email asking 'Are you really the Terry Pratchett?' (Apparently, he knows of two others.)\nMuch of the flavour of afp is due to Terry's presence, and there is an assumption that anything that interests him is somehow relevant. He will occasionally (not too frequently, we hope, he has books to write) join in, and many thread traditions derive from his interest in small microcomputers and a regrettable liking for the game DOOM.\nHowever, although he is the raison d'etre of afp, his position is more that of a constitutional monarch rather than a dictator - when asked for his opinions on how something should be done, his response is likely to be along the lines of 'hey guys, this is your group, not mine'. The only matter in which he has expressed a preference is that fan fiction shouldn't be posted to afp itself, as it might interfere with his own ideas. However, if alt.fan.pratchett.creative were to be set up, he is not expected to object.\nAs for his own feelings on afp - well, that is beyond the scope of this article.\nConclusion\nTo return to the 'afp is like a pub' metaphor, when you go to a new pub, it can seem a bit strange the first few times. Then you begin to recognise people and start to feel comfortable about joining in conversations, and before long you're one of the regulars too. So what are you waiting for?\nFootnotes (an afp speciality)\n[1] See footnote 4 .\n[2] Or Pterry, as he is often referred to on afp.

The other main flurry of 'activity' tends to happen in May and June, round about finals time - personally, I put it down to stress :-)\nOn the whole, we are a friendly bunch. Like most groups, we have our up and downs (thankfully with nothing like the level of vitriol or flaming I have seen flying around in other groups). I tend to agree with the description mooted a while back, that it is like nipping down to your local for a pint and a natter with the regulars.\nWhat's this about *R* and *I*?\nBecause of the dual nature of afp, (and because the volume of posting is quite high, especially during university term time) a consensus was reached in the group that people should indicate the nature of the content of the thread in the subject line - not by the title of the thread: as explained above, that can be completely misleading - but by a series of codes. The idea is that it allows people to skip those threads in which they have no interest.\nThe first two to be adopted were *R* and *I*, which was an attempt to indicate the spilt between the two parts of afp. A thread with an *R* in the subject line supposedly indicates that the posting contains something relevant, such as news about Terry (signing tour details, television/radio appearances, performances of the plays based on the Discworld books and serious comment about his writing) or news about Discworld merchandise [9] . *I* (for irrelevant) indicates that the thread has wandered off to discuss things like the sexual dimorphism of hovercraft, or quantum butterflies. Posters are expected to retitle the thread with the relevant code when it crosses the ill defined border between the two, and though this doesn't always happen, one may quite effectively filter afp by only reading the articles with the *R* code in.\nThe Annotated Pratchett\nOne of the joys of reading Terry's works is that, especially in the Discworld novels, the books are peppered with veiled references to things in this world. Although the Discworld may be a flat world resting on the backs of four giant elephants, who in turn are standing on the back of an even bigger turtle which is slowly swimming through space, the characters thereupon are far from your standard 'Another flagon of your best ale, landlord' fantasy characters, and much of Terry's effect is due to his deliberate contrast of the setting with everyday references from our own world.\nAs a result, one of the favourite pastimes of afpers is annotating Terry's books. Many of these references come from popular culture - for instance, the Blues Brothers, Dirty Harry and Meatloaf - but others may be from classical mythology or modern physics. Eventually, these annotations tend to be collected together and published in the Annotated Pratchett File (or APF, which causes a certain amount of confusion in its naming).\nSomewhat inevitably, a new code, *A*, was adopted to signify these annotations. This allows those afpers who haven't yet had the chance to read one of the books, either because it's as yet unavailable in paperback, or because the publishing schedule in other parts of the world is still far from consistent, to avoid 'spoiler' articles.\nOh, no, not the game!\nSome months ago, a Discworld graphic adventure game was released, initially for the PC. After an initial flurry, it was recognised that a large number of posts started 'Help, I'm stuck at.....' etc., so *G* was introduced, and a game FAQ and walkthrough created [10] . The consensus appears to be that the game has wonderfully atmospheric graphics, the dialogue is very nicely done, but that it could really have done with more playtesting, and that some of the puzzles seem to lack all sense, even in retrospect.\n'Colette, will you marry me?'\nOne of the more unusual traditions of afp is the marriage proposal. Originally, the first proposal came from a lad impressed by the sense of humour of one of the female posters, and was regretfully declined by its recipient on the grounds that she was already married, although this was felt by onlookers to be insufficient reason. However, this has since evolved into a tendency to make such proposals to any (apparently) female poster, especially if she is to mention that she hasn't thus far received one. In order that no-one should be deprived, certain regular posters now propose to just about everyone. As the proposals are seen as a form of friendly greeting, no-one expects the proposee to say 'yes'... [11]\nThis in turn has spawned a series of challenges to duels between afpers who have proposed to the same person. One duel has actually taken place - fortunately for the participants, the weapons used only fired foam rods.\n*F*: Fanac\nThis electronic atmosphere has moved into the 'real' world. Not content with sitting in front of our screens, we have got out to meet each other. There have been several 'afp meets', mostly in pubs, and a couple of months ago an afp meet was organised round a formal hall at Trinity College, Cambridge (thanks, Tony). Meets have also taken place in the States and in Australia.\nBy the time this appears in print, Bernard, Isobel and Tom Pearson of Clarecraft will have held their 'Discworld Event' - a weekend of fun and games, complete with barbecue and beer tent, at their factory in Woolpit. (On visiting their factory earlier this year being shown round the place, I came away thinking: 'people get paid to do this? - where did I go wrong?!').\nAnd, as an outgrowth of all this, the first Discworld convention will be taking place next year, on June 28th-30th, in Manchester. [13]\nTerry and afp\n'Does Terry Pratchett really post here?' Yes, he does. One of the myths of afp is the large number of posts asking that question, but, contrary to popular rumour, I can't recall seeing a posting to the group asking that - however, I've only been in the group for just under two years, and it may well have been a problem in earlier days. However, he does get a lot of email asking 'Are you really the Terry Pratchett?' (Apparently, he knows of two others.)\nMuch of the flavour of afp is due to Terry's presence, and there is an assumption that anything that interests him is somehow relevant. He will occasionally (not too frequently, we hope, he has books to write) join in, and many thread traditions derive from his interest in small microcomputers and a regrettable liking for the game DOOM.\nHowever, although he is the raison d'etre of afp, his position is more that of a constitutional monarch rather than a dictator - when asked for his opinions on how something should be done, his response is likely to be along the lines of 'hey guys, this is your group, not mine'. The only matter in which he has expressed a preference is that fan fiction shouldn't be posted to afp itself, as it might interfere with his own ideas. However, if alt.fan.pratchett.creative were to be set up, he is not expected to object.\nAs for his own feelings on afp - well, that is beyond the scope of this article.\nConclusion\nTo return to the 'afp is like a pub' metaphor, when you go to a new pub, it can seem a bit strange the first few times. Then you begin to recognise people and start to feel comfortable about joining in conversations, and before long you're one of the regulars too. So what are you waiting for?\nFootnotes (an afp speciality)\n[1] See footnote 4 .\n[2] Or Pterry, as he is often referred to on afp.

At the infamous MooseCon (or Confabulation, according to its literature), our anonymous editor fell into conversation with one of the strange denizens of alt.fan.pratchett, and received enlightenment. Overcome with gratitude (or something like that), he impetuously asked her to produce a piece explaining some of the insanities to the readers of Matrix. This is the result. ---\nSo tell me about alt.fan.pratchett.\nInitially, alt.fan.pratchett appears to be a normal newsgroup. But fairly quickly, one of its idiosyncrasies becomes apparent: many of the thread titles begin with '*R*' or '*I*'. This, though, is a minor foible: it's the subject matter of these threads that may be baffling.\nFirst we should ask 'what' (or possibly 'why') is alt.fan.pratchett? Although nominally the newsgroup dedicated to discussion of the works of Terry Pratchett [2] , one of the first things that the reader discovers about afp (for such is its usual abbreviation) is that its threads mutate away from the subject line faster than you can say 'polymorphic inheritance'. While threads may be started by someone who wants to say something about one of Terry's books, many, nay most, veer off at a tangent.\nThe lurker should perhaps consider afp to be two newsgroups, masquerading under the same name. The first would be better titled rec.arts.books.pratchett, consisting of serious discussions on such subjects as the plotlines of the novels and the mechanics of the Discworld, and this is what many are initially looking for. [3]\nUnfortunately for these innocents, there is a second afp, which is a general free-for-all between people who assume that the other readers have similar interests, and who will start threads with no apparent relevance to the subject at hand. Frequently, these threads will maintain the same title that they had previously, with the result that an article titled 'Dragon digestion' may actually discuss the mating habits of the Boeing 747. (For those that are interested, it appears that the result is not the Learjet, nor even the HS 146, but rather a small submarine larva that eventually creeps ashore near Seattle, pupates in a large hanger, and eventually emerges as a full grown Jumbo.)\nSome of the tangents are well-worn paths, which include discussions about beer, roundabouts, bread, merkins [4] , children's t.v. programs, quantum mechanics and proposals.\nAnother tendency is for some afpers visiting other newsgroups to crosspost apparently relevant articles to afp. These then frequently mutate, thereafter causing much consternation to the original group from which they were crossposted.\nWho are we?\nUnsurprisingly, the majority of the posters are in the UK, although there is a strong representation from Australia, New Zealand and America [5] . There are also regulars in Eire, Germany, South Africa, Scandinavia and The Netherlands. An indication of the international nature of the group can be surmised from the fact that the afp FAQ [6] is maintained by Orin Thomas in Australia, and the APF [7] is maintained by Leo Breebaart in The Netherlands (both of whom, by the way, do a magnificent job). There are also a number of web pages scattered around the globe - for example Colm Buckley at Trinity College, Dublin has scanned in the Clarecraft catalogue of Discworld figures and jewellery [8] .\nOf those in the UK, a fairly high proportion are university students. A certain amount of trepidation pervades the group as September approaches - as in many newsgroups, it sometimes gets called 'newbie season' as the new intake of students arrive at university and many hit the net for the first time, with all that that entails.

However, this has since evolved into a tendency to make such proposals to any (apparently) female poster, especially if she is to mention that she hasn't thus far received one. In order that no-one should be deprived, certain regular posters now propose to just about everyone. As the proposals are seen as a form of friendly greeting, no-one expects the proposee to say 'yes'... [11]\nThis in turn has spawned a series of challenges to duels between afpers who have proposed to the same person. One duel has actually taken place - fortunately for the participants, the weapons used only fired foam rods.\n*F*: Fanac\nThis electronic atmosphere has moved into the 'real' world. Not content with sitting in front of our screens, we have got out to meet each other. There have been several 'afp meets', mostly in pubs, and a couple of months ago an afp meet was organised round a formal hall at Trinity College, Cambridge (thanks, Tony). Meets have also taken place in the States and in Australia.\nBy the time this appears in print, Bernard, Isobel and Tom Pearson of Clarecraft will have held their 'Discworld Event' - a weekend of fun and games, complete with barbecue and beer tent, at their factory in Woolpit. (On visiting their factory earlier this year being shown round the place, I came away thinking: 'people get paid to do this? - where did I go wrong?!').\nAnd, as an outgrowth of all this, the first Discworld convention will be taking place next year, on June 28th-30th, in Manchester. [13]\nTerry and afp\n'Does Terry Pratchett really post here?' Yes, he does. One of the myths of afp is the large number of posts asking that question, but, contrary to popular rumour, I can't recall seeing a posting to the group asking that - however, I've only been in the group for just under two years, and it may well have been a problem in earlier days. However, he does get a lot of email asking 'Are you really the Terry Pratchett?' (Apparently, he knows of two others.)\nMuch of the flavour of afp is due to Terry's presence, and there is an assumption that anything that interests him is somehow relevant. He will occasionally (not too frequently, we hope, he has books to write) join in, and many thread traditions derive from his interest in small microcomputers and a regrettable liking for the game DOOM.\nHowever, although he is the raison d'etre of afp, his position is more that of a constitutional monarch rather than a dictator - when asked for his opinions on how something should be done, his response is likely to be along the lines of 'hey guys, this is your group, not mine'. The only matter in which he has expressed a preference is that fan fiction shouldn't be posted to afp itself, as it might interfere with his own ideas. However, if alt.fan.pratchett.creative were to be set up, he is not expected to object.\nAs for his own feelings on afp - well, that is beyond the scope of this article.\nConclusion\nTo return to the 'afp is like a pub' metaphor, when you go to a new pub, it can seem a bit strange the first few times. Then you begin to recognise people and start to feel comfortable about joining in conversations, and before long you're one of the regulars too. So what are you waiting for?\nFootnotes (an afp speciality)\n[1] See footnote 4 .\n[2] Or Pterry, as he is often referred to on afp.
