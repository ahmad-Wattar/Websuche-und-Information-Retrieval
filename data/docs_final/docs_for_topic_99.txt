This has given me a rather strange, distanced point of view on how math appears to be presented, or taught.\nThere are two things that seem to be taught: proofs (sometimes, if you're lucky), and steps for solving a problem. There is an emphasis on the latter, and an expectation that the student will learn those steps and use them. \"If you follow 1., 2., 3., you will have the solution.\" This isn't just how things are being presented in the college calculus classes I'm currently taking, but I also recall it rather poignantly from my grade school and high school experiences years ago (most of which were frightful, despite the fact that I love math and understand it easily, b/c I usually need to invent my own solution steps).\nIt is curious to me, especially now that I am older and have a clearer sense for what works for me and what does not, that a key concept recognized in other disciplines is not recognized in mathematics--at least it's not being recognized at the academic level I'm currently at. That key concept is this: if a person has deep, real understanding and ownership of an idea, they can use that idea creatively. Conversely, creative application of an idea leads to deeper understanding. One is expected to make creative use of learned concepts in the arts, right? And even the graduate science course I am taking expects (and grades on) creative problem exploration. Why is the expectation in math that one will simply plug in values to a memorized series of steps that were invented by someone else and be happy with that? That that's enough. Why isn't there an emphasis on using concepts creatively to find an individually optimized series of steps for solving a problem, or using concepts creativity to get at the core of what is wrong or right with methods of solution. If a concept is understood enough to be used creatively, then that implies a much deeper understanding of the concept than rote regurgitation.\nI wonder if it is because we are taught in grade school that there is always \"one right answer\" to a math problem that we get bogged down into thinking that mathematics is purely formulaic. The closer I get to more advanced mathematical concepts, the less I find this paradigm useful (not that I've ever found it particularly useful). What would be different if from the start children were taught mathematical concepts instead of someone else's steps, and were told to find optimal methods of solution? What if from the start children were encouraged to play with their math, to discover for themselves how each jeweled facet of it works?\nEh, maybe things have changed in the way math is taught in primary education in the 20-30 years since I was a kid, but still, I've been thinking about this a good deal. I'm not entirely certain where I'm going with it yet, but I thought the ramble had relevance to this community :-)\n"}, {"score": 1830.25, "uuid": "b5bf089c-c3d2-58be-948e-71275e884ed4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0901tw-05-15274", "target_hostname": "www.saturdayeveningpost.com", "target_uri": "http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2010/03/20/archives/then-and-now/imagination-important-knowledge.html", "page_rank": 1.2251007e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "\u201c<em>Imagination</em> <em>Is</em> More Important <em>Than</em> <em>Knowledge</em>\u201d | Saturday Evening Post", "snippet": "I <em>do</em> not know that I am\u2026 [but] I would have been surprised if I had been wrong \u201cI am enough of the artist to draw freely upon my <em>imagination</em>. <em>Imagination</em> <em>is</em> more important <em>than</em> <em>knowledge</em>. <em>Knowledge</em> <em>is</em> limited. <em>Imagination</em> encircles the world.\u201d", "explanation": null, "document": "Home / Archives / Then & Now / \u201cImagination Is More Important Than Knowledge\u201d\n\u201cImagination Is More Important Than Knowledge\u201d\nBy: Jeff Nilsson\nAlbert Einstein (Wikimedia Commons)\nWhen a Post correspondent interviewed Albert Einstein about his thought process in 1929, Einstein did not speak of careful reasoning and calculations. Instead \u2014\n\u201cI believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am\u2026 [but] I would have been surprised if I had been wrong\n\u201cI am enough of the artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.\u201d\nSomething else that was circling the globe in that year was Einstein\u2019s reputation. At the time of this interview, his fame had spread across Europe and America. Everywhere he was acclaimed a genius for defining the principles of relativity, though very few people understood what they meant.\nImagination may have been essential to his breakthrough thinking, but Einstein\u2019s discovery also rested on his vast knowledge of physical science. Knowledge and imagination let him see the relationship between space, time, and energy. Using mathematics, he developed a model for understanding how objects and light behave in extreme conditions \u2014\u00a0as in the subatomic world, where the old Newtonian principles didn\u2019t appear to work.\nWhenever Einstein explained his work to the popular press, though, reporters got lost in his talk of space-time continuum, absolute speed of light, and E=\u0394mc2. So they used their own imaginations to define relativity. One of their misinterpretations was the idea that relativity meant everything is relative. The old absolutes were gone. Nothing was certain anymore.\nIt was a ridiculous interpretation that could only have made sense if newspaper readers were no bigger than a proton, or could travel near the speed of light.\nThis misperception was so common that the Post writer used it to start his interview.\n\u201cRelativity! What word is more symbolic of the age? We have ceased to be positive of anything. We look upon all things in the light of relativity. Relativity has become the plaything of the parlor philosopher.\u201d\nEinstein, as always, patiently clarified his concept.\n\u201c\u2018The meaning of relativity has been widely misunderstood, Philosophers play with the word, like a child with a doll. Relativity, as I see it, merely denotes that certain physical and mechanical facts, which have been regarded as positive and permanent, are relative with regard to certain other facts in the sphere of physics and mechanics. It does not mean that everything in life is relative and that we have the right to turn the whole world mischievously topsy-turvy.\u2019\u201d\nThe world of the early 20th Century certainly felt like it was being inverted \u2014 with or without relativity. \u00a0Even as Einstein was developing his theory about the space-time continuum and the nature of light, old Europe was dying in record numbers. Just a few weeks before Einstein released his general theory of relativity in 1916, the German Imperial Army began its assault at Verdun. In the ensuing, ten-month battle, France and Germany suffered 800,000 casualties. Four months later, the British launched their catastrophic attack at the Somme and suffered 58,000 casualties in a single day.\nThe survivors of these debacles were disillusioned by the waste of this war, and the peace that followed. The youth of Europe and America were looking for new truths. The old ones seemed empty and especially lethal to young men. They saw how noble sacrifice could be used for political ends. And they had seen how virtue and faith fared against massed machine guns.\nDoctor Einstein accompanying Mrs. Einstein's piano song with his violin.\nThis \u201cRelativity\u201d they read about seemed promising, if it meant that thousands wouldn\u2019t have to die needlessly, of that could live beyond the limiting moral codes of their parents.\nEinstein, himself, didn\u2019t indulge in any of this relativism.\u00a0 He was a man of strong beliefs, not equivocations. For instance, his love of music was absolute.\n\u201c\u2018If\u2026 I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. I cannot tell if I would have done any creative work of importance in music, but I do know that I get most joy in life out of my violin.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s taste in music is severely classical. Even Wagner is to him no unalloyed feast of the ears. He adores Mozart and Bach. He even prefers their work to the architectural music of Beethoven.\u201d\nHe disagreed with the traditional Jewish concept of free will.\n\u201cI am a determinist. As such, I do not believe in free will. The Jews believe in free will. They believe that man shapes his own life. I reject that doctrine philosophically. In that respect I am not a Jew\u2026 Practically, I am nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being.\u201d\nHe never expressed any belief in a personal God, but he believed in the historical Jesus \u2014 not the popularized prophet such as appeared in a best-selling biography by Emil Ludwig.\n\u201cLudwig\u2019s Jesus,\u201d Einstein replied, \u201cis shallow. Jesus is too colossal for the pen of phrasemongers, however artful. No man can dispose of Christianity with a bon mot.\u201d\n\u201cYou accept the historical existence of Jesus?\u201d\n\u201cUnquestionably. No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life. How different, for instance, is the impression which we receive from an account of legendary heroes of antiquity like Theseus. Theseus and other heroes of his type lack the authentic vitality of Jesus.\u201d\nEinstein was no relativist on the subject of nationalism, which he saw grow violent and intolerant from his Berlin home.\n\u201cNationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.\u201d\nIt was different in the United States, he believed.\n\u201cNationalism in the United States does not assume such disagreeable forms as in Europe. This may be due partly to the fact that your country is so immense, that you do not think in terms of narrow borders. It may be due to the fact that you do not suffer from the heritage of hatred or fear which poisons the relations of the nations of Europe.\u201d\nThree years later, Einstein fled Germany to seek asylum in the United States, where he became a citizen in 1940. (Not for the last time, America was enriched by the intolerance of other countries.)\nJudge Phillip Forman hands Albert Einstein his certificate of American citizenship on October 1, 1940. (Wikimedia Commons)\nIt is interesting to see how Einstein viewed America three years before he made it his new home.\n\u201cIn America, more than anywhere else, the individual is lost in the achievements of the many. America is beginning to be the world leader in scientific investigation. American scholarship is both patient and inspiring. The Americans show an unselfish devotion to science, which is the very opposite of the conventional European view of your countrymen.\n\u201cToo many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers. This is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves. It is not true that the dollar is an American fetish. The American student is not interested in dollars, not even in success as such, but in his task, the object of the search. It is his painstaking application to the study of the infinitely little and infinitely large.\u201d\nThe only criticism Einstein could find for America was its emphasis on homogenizing its citizens into a single type.\n\u201cStandardization robs life of its spice. To deprive every ethnic group of its special traditions is to convert the world into a huge Ford plant. I believe in standardizing automobiles. I do not believe in standardizing human beings. Standardization is a great peril which threatens American culture.\u201d\n"}, {"score": 1521.4642, "uuid": "fbc21be5-f237-51c5-a49e-02729244a408", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-05-13528", "target_hostname": "giovanni-esposito.com", "target_uri": "http://giovanni-esposito.com/futurology-ecumenopolis/2012/2/12/abundance-the-future-is-better-than-you-think-free-download.html", "page_rank": 1.4375291e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Abundance: The Future <em>Is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> <em>You</em> <em>Think</em> \u2013 Free Download - futurology", "snippet": "and Life Gets Faster \u00bb Abundance: The Future <em>Is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> <em>You</em> <em>Think</em> \u2013 Free Download A book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.", "explanation": null, "document": "Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think \u2013 Free\u00a0Download\nSunday, February 12, 2012 at 7:41PM\nA book by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.

Conventional wisdom says this gap cannot be closed. But it is closing\u2014fast. In Abundance, space entrepreneur turned innovation pioneer Peter H. Diamandis and award-winning science writer Steven Kotler document how progress in artificial intelligence, robotics, infinite computing, ubiquitous broadband networks, digital manufacturing, nanomaterials, synthetic biology, and many other exponentially growing technologies will enable us to make greater gains in the next two decades than we have in the previous two hundred years. We will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman, and child on the planet. Abundance for all is within our grasp.Breaking down human needs by category\u2014water,\u00a0food,\u00a0energy,\u00a0 healthcare, education, freedom\u2014Diamandis and Kotler introduce us to dozens (and dozens) of innovators and industry captains making tremendous strides in each area: Dean Kamen\u2019s \u201cSlingshot,\u201d a technology which can transform polluted water, salt water or even raw sewage into incredibly high-quality drinking water for less than one cent a liter; the Qualcomm Tricorder X PRIZE which promises a low-cost, handheld medical device that allows anyone to diagnose themselves better than a board certified doctor; Dickson Despommier\u2019s \u201cvertical farms,\u201d which replaces traditional agriculture with a system that uses 80 percent less land, 90 percent less water, 100 percent fewer pesticides and zero transportation costs. As a bonus, the authors provide a detailed reference section filled with ninety graphs, charts and graphics offering much of the source data underpinning their conclusions.\nIn this thrilling antidote to today\u2019s dark pessimism, the authors rely on exhaustive research and extensive interviews with top scientists, innovators, and captains of industry to explore how four emerging forces\u2014exponential technologies, the DIY innovator, the Technophilanthropist, and the Rising Billion\u2014are conspiring to solve our biggest problems. Diamandis and Kotler examine the stunning impact these forces are having on categories of critical importance while establishing hard targets for change, laying out a strategic road map for governments, industry, and entrepreneurs, and giving us plenty of reason for optimism.\nProviding abundance is humanity\u2019s grandest challenge\u2014this is a book about how we rise to meet\u00a0it.

And we are free to determine our course and plot our destiny, limited only by the boundary of our imagination.\nOn the Wikiquote page that talks about Heraclitus, ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Heraclitus ), there are a couple of remarkable image files.\nOne image, of the dispersion of light as it travels through a prism, illustrates the nature of flow, from a single unremarkable thread to a profusion of intricate bands of colour - the kaleidoscope of our changing lives. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif\nThe other is a Hubble image of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) that expresses the dynamic nature of the cosmos.\u00a0 It reminds us that the universe itself is in a state of beautiful and infinite flux. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Whirpool_Galaxy.jpg\nThis investigation of self, of who we are can lead us to a more authentic relationship with ourselves and with others.\u00a0 It can help us to work against stereotypes and enable us to step outside of our limited understanding of personality.

(The first time was in 1975, when we voted on whether to remain in the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called.) Now we have a chance to decide whether to retain our current voting system, misleadingly known as First Past The Post, or whether to switch to the Alternative Vote. Let me come clean straight away. Although in this post I shall try to write dispassionately about these two voting systems, my actual attitude is anything but dispassionate: I have yearned for a better voting system ever since I have had any political awareness at all, and am steeling myself for what is probably going to be a huge disappointment when the country votes for the status quo. And I am writing this post in the genuine hope of making a difference. Since it is extremely hard to change anybody\u2019s mind in politics, I think the best I can hope for is to persuade somebody to vote yes (the question will be phrased in such a way that \u201cyes\u201d means you want AV and \u201cno\u201d means you want FPTP) who might otherwise not have bothered to vote at all. This is a mathematics blog, so I will give this post a mildly mathematical slant, but all I really mean by this is that I know when I write that a typical reader of this post will be mathematically literate, which may make the post different in tone from how it would be if I were writing for a more general readership.\nA little history.\nLet us look at the election results from 1979, when Margaret Thatcher first came to power, to 1997, when Tony Blair first won. These are results of elections held under FPTP, the system where the country is divided into constituencies, each of which gets a seat in parliament, and the seat goes to whichever candidate gets the most votes in the constituency.\nIn 1979 the results of the three main parties were as follows:\nConservatives, 43.9% of the vote, 339 seats\nLabour, 36.9% of the vote, 269 seats\nLiberals, 13.8% of the vote, 11 seats.\nSo the Conservatives got a little over three times as many votes as the Liberals, and just over thirty times as many seats. To put that another way, it took about ten times as many votes (on average) to elect a Liberal MP as it took to elect a Conservative MP.\nThe next election was an interesting one. A couple of years into Thatcher\u2019s premiership, a new political party, the Social Democratic Party, was formed by moderate Labour Party politicians who did not like the lurch to the left that had taken place under Labour\u2019s then leader Michael Foot. Within a short time, they were coming top in opinion polls, but this did not last until the General Election, largely because the Falklands War gave Mrs Thatcher a huge boost to her popularity. It was clear that the Social Democrats had a lot in common with the Liberals (with whom they were later to merge), so they agreed not to stand against each other at the 1983 General Election, instead forming the Alliance. The results of the election were as follows:\nConservatives, 42.4% of the vote, 397 seats\nLabour, 27.6% of the vote, 209 seats\nSDP/Liberal Alliance, 25.4% of the vote, 23 seats.\nLet us note a couple of anomalies in this result. Most strikingly, the Alliance got almost as many votes as the Labour party but Labour got roughly nine times as many seats. Second most strikingly, the Conservative share of the vote went down slightly, but they now had a truly thumping majority, much higher than after the previous election.\nHow was this possible? Well, under FPTP, if you want to maximize the number of seats you will get for a given share of the vote, then there are two things you must avoid. Most importantly, you don\u2019t want to spread your vote about too evenly: if you get 28% of the vote in every single seat, you probably won\u2019t win a single seat. So FPTP penalizes parties that have a uniform appeal throughout the country. This suggests that what you want is for your support to be geographically concentrated, and indeed that is the case up to a point, but you must also avoid having too many seats where you have an overwhelming majority: if you get 90% in a seat, then at least 40% of those votes would have been more useful to you if they had been cast in other constituencies. So FPTP favours parties with support that is geographically concentrated but not too concentrated. The Alliance\u2019s support was dispersed, and the consequences for them at the election were disastrous.\nThe second anomaly \u2014 the hugely increased majority for the Conservatives despite a drop in their share of the vote \u2014 was a consequence of a phenomenon that frequently arises in this country under FPTP, the splitting of the left. At that time, both Labour and the Alliance were clearly on the left (the Alliance was much less so, but they were certainly not in favour of the Thatcherite programme that the country officially voted for) so there was a clear majority in favour of broadly left-wing politics. However, that majority was roughly evenly split between two parties, so there were many constituencies where the Conservatives won the seat with well under half the vote.\nThe next election, in 1987, was similar but less extreme.\nConservatives, 42.2% of the vote, 376 seats\nLabour, 30.8% of the vote, 229 seats\nAlliance, 22.6% of the vote, 22 seats.\nIn 1990 Margaret Thatcher resigned and John Major took over. The next election was in 1992 and the results were as follows. By this time, the SDP and the Liberals had merged to become the Liberal Democrats.\nConservatives, 41.9% of the vote, 336 seats\nLabour, 34.4% of the vote, 271 seats\nLiberal Democrats, 17.8% of the vote, 20 seats.\nSomething odd happened here too: the Conservative vote dropped by 0.3% but their majority went down very substantially (which led to numerous rebellions throughout the parliament, particularly on the thorny subject of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe). The explanation is that the split on the left, which still existed, was less severe.\nNext was 1997, the year that Blair was elected.\nLabour, 43.2% of the vote, 418 seats\nConservatives, 30.7% of the vote, 165 seats\nLiberal Democrats, 16.8% of the vote, 46 seats.\nAgain there are some strange aspects of this result. The Liberal Democrats had their best result for many decades despite their lowest vote percentage in all the elections I have discussed. (However, their share of seats was still significantly lower than it would have been under a proportional system.) Labour got about two and a half times as many seats as the Conservatives for under one and a half times as many votes, and got a massive majority with only 43.2% of the vote.\nDoes FPTP reflect the will of the voters?\nIt is very easy to slip into thinking that the answer to this question is yes by definition: whatever the result of an election, the interpretation given to it by the media will be that \u201cthe voters have said\u201d whatever FPTP deems them to have said. For instance, when I think back to the election that John Major won, my impression of it is that the mood of the country swung against the Tories, but not by enough to unseat them. I had completely forgotten that the Tory vote remained virtually unchanged from the previous election and that it was only the change to how the votes on the left split that caused the Tories to lose seats. So a more correct interpretation of the result is that the Labour party had become more electable again, improving its appeal relative to that of the Liberal Democrats.\nI don\u2019t think it is possible to defend the view that the 1983 election reflected the will of the voters: over a quarter of voters ended up being represented by about 3% of MPs, and the representatives of just over 40% of voters were given free rein to continue with a program that was (I am pretty sure) bitterly opposed by the majority.\nIt is reasonable to say that when Tony Blair was elected, the result reflected the national mood to some extent: the Conservatives had been in power for 17 years and John Major\u2019s government had lost the country\u2019s respect after Black Wednesday , from which it never really recovered. However, it is not reasonable to say that the size of Blair\u2019s majority \u2014 he had almost two thirds of all seats \u2014 reflected the national mood. The large swing was reflected, but in a distorting mirror that greatly expanded it.\nSimilarly, since the Liberals, or Liberal Democrats, always come a distant third in elections, one naturally thinks of them as a minor party, but their share of the vote, often over 20%, is anything but minor.\nAnd I haven\u2019t mentioned elections from further back that were won by parties that did not get the most votes. In 1951, the Conservatives under Winston Churchill won an absolute majority of seats (though a small one) with 48.0% of the vote. In the same election, Labour under Clement Attlee got 48.8% of the vote.\nDo people\u2019s votes reflect the will of the voters?\nThis question looks a bit silly. Is the answer not trivially yes?\nNo it isn\u2019t. Under FPTP, we often receive election literature that looks something like this.\nThat was a bar chart put out by the Liberal Democrats in Cambridge at the last general election. They reasoned that Conservative voters would prefer the Liberal Democrats to Labour, so tried to persuade potential Conservative voters to vote Liberal Democrat on the grounds that voting Conservative might well let in Labour. It is only fair to say that this argument has been employed much more often in the past against the Liberal Democrats. The slogan, \u201cA vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote,\u201d used to be heard frequently at elections.\nBut the general point is that under FPTP it is often rational to vote for a party that is not your first choice. This is a very important point, since it hugely weakens one of the main arguments of those who are campaigning against AV. I will come back to this later.\n(In parentheses, let me remark that the result in Cambridge at the last election was\nLiberal Democrat 19,621 (39.1% of vote)\nConservative 12,829 (25.6% of vote)\nLabour 12,174 (24.3% of vote)\nGreen 3,804\nothers 507\nSo it seems that Conservative voters were not persuaded to vote tactically.)\nGoing back to some of the results under FPTP, one cannot know how many people voted for parties that were not their first choice. However, all the main political parties urge people to vote tactically in individual constituencies (even if the senior politicians do not always admit it), and it is obvious that many people heed the call. I cannot prove it, but I find it pretty obvious that some of the results from the 1980s that were so unfair to the Liberals, the Alliance and the Liberal Democrats were in fact more unfair even than they looked, since many people would have voted for them if they had not been persuaded by the wasted-vote argument.\nIs AV any better?\nSo far all I have done is discuss some of the deficiencies of FPTP. (OK, perhaps \u201cdeficiencies\u201d isn\u2019t a neutral enough word. I have been discussing some of the interesting phenomena that can occur, and often have occurred, under FPTP.) But does AV do any better?\nThe first thing to say is that AV is not proportional representation. Under AV it is still possible for a party to get a share of seats that is very different from its share of the votes. Before I say any more about AV, let me quickly say what it is (though I imagine that most people interested enough to get this far know already). Under AV, you don\u2019t just vote for one candidate. Instead, you number the candidates 1,2,3 until you no longer wish to express a preference. For instance, if you are a UKIP supporter (the United Kingdom Independence Party is a right-wing party that wants Britain to leave the European Union) then you might put UKIP first and the Conservatives second, but not express a preference between Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, etc.\nWhen the votes are counted, the following algorithm is applied.\n1. Count all first-preference votes not yet counted.\n2. If some party has over 50% of first-preference votes, then HALT. (That party then wins.)\n3. Take the party with the smallest number of first-preference votes and change each vote for that party by removing the first-preference votes and turning\nth-preference votes into\n4. Remove that party from the list of preferences of all other voters.\n5. GOTO 1.\nAs an example, suppose that the parties in your constituency are Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, UKIP and the Greens. Suppose that your preferences are Green, Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative, UKIP in that order. Then if no party has over 50% and UKIP comes bottom, nothing happens to your voting paper. If after the next count (when the UKIP second preferences have become first preferences) it is still the case that no party has over 50%, and this time the Greens are eliminated, then your preferences are shunted up by 1, so they now read Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative (UKIP and the Greens having been eliminated). Perhaps by this stage Labour have reached the magic 50% (with a boost from those Greens who put Labour as their second choice). Or perhaps no party has and the Liberal Democrats are now third. In that case, your preferences become Labour over the Conservatives, and one or other of those will now have over 50%.\nOne of the criticisms of proportional representation is that it weakens the constituency link: it is hard to have a fully proportional system where each MP represents his or her constituency. AV does not suffer from this defect, since there is still a constituency system. But the price for that is that there is no obvious reason to expect AV to be proportional. So why is it any better than FPTP (from the point of view of representing the will of the voters)?\nThe reason is that under AV there is far less reason to vote tactically. Under AV, a vote for a minor party is not a wasted vote: you can express your preference for the minor party while still having an opportunity to decide which of the major parties you would prefer. For instance, you could vote Green and not worry that you were letting in the Conservatives, or you could vote UKIP without thinking that you might let in Labour. And if you are an anyone-but-the-Tories person, you can express that sentiment without being forced to guess which party has the best chance of defeating them.\nIs tactical voting eliminated under AV?\nThe scope for tactical voting is greatly reduced under AV, because the wasted-vote argument no longer applies. But it is possible to come up with circumstances under which it would make sense even with AV to vote tactically. I\u2019m not sure these circumstances would be relevant: typically they would require voters to know more about the preferences of other voters than they are ever likely to in practice. But let me give what I think is the simplest situation where tactical voting would in theory be rational under AV. To make it easier to understand, I\u2019ll use actual parties, and will try to make people\u2019s second preferences as plausible as possible given their first preferences.\nSuppose you are voting in a constituency where the Conservatives typically get around 40% of first-preference votes, Labour get around 30%, the Liberal Democrats get around 30%, and the other parties get almost nothing. (This is not entirely realistic, but it could well be the situation after all but three parties have been eliminated.) Suppose you are an ardent supporter of the Conservatives. What should you do? Well, you might judge that Liberal Democrat voters are more likely to put the Conservatives as their second choice than Labour voters are. If that is what you think, then paradoxically it might make sense to vote Labour (the party you like least out of the three) so that when the second-choice votes are counted the Conservatives will get enough to push them over 50%. To see how this could work, imagine that the second-preference votes for Labour split 5:1 in favour of the Liberal Democrats (that is, 25% of voters have Labour first and Lib Dems second, and 5% of voters have Labour first and the Conservatives second), while the second-preference votes for the Lib Dems split 3:2 in favour of Labour (so 18% of voters have Lib Dems first and Labour second, while 12% of voters have Lib Dems first and the Conservatives second).\nLabour and the Lib Dems are neck and neck. If the Lib Dems come second, then Labour will be eliminated and the total percentages of votes will be 45% for the Conservatives and 55% for the Liberal Democrats. If Labour come second, then the Lib Dems will be eliminated and the percentages will be 52% for the Conservatives and 48% for Labour.\nSo in a situation like this, we have the strange phenomenon that it may be in the interests of some Conservative voters to put Labour as their first preference in order to gain a substantial block of Liberal Democrat second-choice votes.\nHowever, there are some pretty serious problems with actually voting tactically in this situation. Obviously if all Conservative voters were to do so it would be a disaster for the Conservatives. And you can\u2019t coordinate your votes. So how do you decide what you, an individual Conservative voter, should do? If you are a mathematician, then you will probably toss a coin a few times and make a probabilistic decision, but something tells me that that practice is unlikely to catch on. And of course, it is ridiculous to suppose that you will know what proportion of Lib Dem voters are likely to put the Conservatives as their second choice.\nTo get an idea of just how much less tactical voting there would be under AV, try to imagine a slogan as punchy as \u201cA vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote.\u201d You won\u2019t get very far with \u201cA vote for the Conservatives might let in the Lib Dems with the help of Labour second preferences, whereas a vote for Labour will help the Conservatives win with the help of Lib Dem second preferences, but could only a few people pay attention to this please?\u201d In practice, hardly anyone will have a good reason to do anything other than put in order of preference the parties that they have a view about.\nIs the First Past The Post system the First Past The Post system?\nThis is another question that seems to have a trivial answer but actually doesn\u2019t. Presumably First Past The Post is a metaphor. Indeed, it is a metaphor \u2014 from horse racing. So let us try to work out how the metaphor works. Presumably there should be a post somewhere. So what is the post? Hmm \u2026 it\u2019s hard to say.\nA natural answer might be that you pass the post when your party reaches 50%. That is, you would have a sort of race, and the first party to get over 50% would be declared the winner. Are there any systems like that? Oh yes, AV. (And not just AV, but that is the one we have the chance to choose.)\nFor the most part I want to stick to rational argument, but sometimes it\u2019s quicker and more effective to use slogans. Here\u2019s one I like:\nFIRST PAST THE POST IS NOT FIRST PAST THE POST!\nAnd to those who think it is, how about\nWHAT IS THE POST?\n(Under some circumstances, the first word might perhaps be replaced by \u201cwtf\u201d, but not on this nice family blog.)\nIf I want to vote selfishly, then how should I vote?\nSuppose that you firmly support one political party and your only interest is to do what will best serve that party, ignoring all questions of fairness, democratic principle, etc. How should you vote in the referendum?\nIf you support the Conservatives, then probably you should vote no. It was the FPTP system that allowed Mrs Thatcher to rule for eleven years with large majorities and well under half the votes. It is possible that the Liberal Democrats are so damaged by the current coalition that we will see a return to straight two-party politics for a while (in which case whether we have FPTP or AV will not make much difference to the outcomes of elections). But unless the political landscape really has permanently changed, FPTP gives the Conservatives the best chance of exploiting the split on the left, whereas AV allows those of a broadly left-wing persuasion to vote in an anything-but-Tory way.\nIf you support the Liberal Democrats then it\u2019s a no-brainer.\nIf you support Labour, then it is less clear what you should do. Perhaps you will look back at the three elections won by Tony Blair, and at the current unpopularity of the coalition, and think that you don\u2019t need the help of AV. But if that is your view, then I suggest you look back further to the dark days of the 1980s. Under AV there is a real chance that Labour would have won the 1983 election, or at least been able to form a grand coalition with the Alliance, and the same goes for the subsequent elections: it is unlikely that John Major would have had his shock victory in 1992, for instance. And AV would not have stopped Blair from winning his resounding victories. Probably in 2005 it would have left Blair a little more punished for the Iraq war, but probably you wouldn\u2019t regard that as a defect of AV. And as for the future, when the Conservatives reduce the number of seats you will have a lot of electoral ground to make up. If the Lib Dem vote collapses then AV won\u2019t harm you, and if it doesn\u2019t collapse then AV will make it much more likely that you will be in a position to defeat the Tories.\nTo put it in slogan form again,\nA LABOUR SUPPORTER VOTING FOR FPTP IS A TURKEY VOTING FOR CHRISTMAS.\nOr to be more visual about it,\nAs I\u2019ve said above, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, but the whole point of slogans is to ignore all those little qualifications.\nSome claims by the NO2AV campaign.\nI would like to assess some of the claims about AV that have been made by those campaigning against it.\n1. Under AV the person who comes second or third can win.\nI find this argument laughable. The truth that the above sentence expresses is that under AV the person who would have come first under FPTP will not always win. Well I\u2019ll be: it turns out that AV and FPTP do not lead to identical results. So that is why we are having a referendum. Duh.\nThis objection to AV is so blatantly question-begging that it is quite extraordinary that anyone can seriously advance it as an argument. The NO2AV campaign has a TV advertisement involving a horse race. At the end of the race, to everyone\u2019s bemusement, the horse that comes in third is deemed to have won. This is supposed to be an argument against AV.\nIf I had the resources, I would make a counter-advertisement. It would go something like this. There is a mile-long horse race. As the horses approach 4/5 of a mile, Tory Boy is in the lead, but Labour Lad is storming up from behind and clearly about to overtake. Meanwhile Demon Libby is flagging badly and may not finish.\nSuddenly the race stewards run on to the track and stop the race. To general bemusement, Tory Boy is declared the winner, despite the fact that the race was not yet over and Labour Lad clearly had more in the tank for the vital closing stages.\nFinal slogan: UNDER FIRST PAST THE POST, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO BE FIRST PAST THE POST!\n2. AV is unfair/undemocratic.\nI don\u2019t actually know what the NO2AV campaigners mean here. But I think they again mean that AV yields results that are different from the results of FPTP. The extreme unfairness of relatively large third parties getting a negligible share of the seats under FPTP does not figure in their calculations.\nThe idea that AV is less democratic than FPTP makes even less sense to me. AV allows people to express their actual political preferences rather than being forced (if they don\u2019t want to waste their vote) to vote tactically.\nI suspect that the NO2AV campaigners would rather not specify what they mean by calling AV unfair and undemocratic, since that way their arguments cannot be properly scrutinized. However, it may be that in the back of their minds is another objection that has been made several times, which is the following.\n3. Under AV, some people get more votes than others.\nThe beauty of this objection (from the point of view of its political effectiveness, by which I mean its ability to persuade people who don\u2019t feel like thinking critically) is that it cleverly confuses a true statement with a false statement. It would be ludicrously unfair if some people were given more ballot papers to fill in than others. But that, it hardly needs pointing out, is not what happens. What does happen is that some people\u2019s second (or lower) preferences are taken into account and other people\u2019s are not.\nThis is presented as an unfair advantage to those whose lower preferences are taken into account. A hypothetical example sometimes given by the NO2AV campaign is of a BNP supporter getting five bites of the cherry whereas decent Conservative and Labour supporters get only one. (The British National Party is our lunatic far-right party. A typical quote from its manifesto: \u201cAt current immigration and birth rates, indigenous British people are set to become a minority well within 50 years. This will result in the extinction of the British people, culture, heritage and identity.\u201d)\nIs there any significant sense in which AV gives more votes to the BNP? There are various ways of thinking about this question, and none of them is of much comfort to BNP supporters.\nConsider first what it means if you get five bites of the cherry. It means that your first-choice party is eliminated, and your second-choice party, and your third-choice party, and your fourth-choice party. Compare that with the poor old voter who gets just one bite of the cherry. Their party is either the party that wins or the party that comes second. In the first case, they obviously do better by far. In the second case, it is not clear: if you vote Labour and Labour come second to the Conservatives, then you might well have preferred the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. But (i) they were behind Labour and (ii) right until the final round your vote was counting for your favourite party rather than for lower and lower choices.\nA quick slogan:\nGETTING MORE BITES OF THE CHERRY IS A DISADVANTAGE STUPID!\nThe idea that it is unfair for some people to have their vote counted more often than others is \u2014 in so far as it means anything at all \u2014 just plain wrong. The NO2AV campaigners are saying that supporters of unpopular parties get more votes. What they actually get is more opportunities to change their vote. Since each change is from a higher preference to a lower preference, changing one\u2019s vote is not something one wants to do. Simple isn\u2019t it?\nHere is another way of thinking about this bizarre objection to AV. Let us contrast it with a different system that is manifestly fair. I\u2019ll call it MR for Multiple Rounds. Under this system, everybody votes for just one candidate. If no candidate gets over 50%, then the least popular candidate is eliminated and there is a new round. Again, if no candidate gets over 50%, then the least popular candidate is eliminated and there is a new round. This process continues until a candidate does get over 50%.\nThis time, everybody gets one vote per round. How does that differ from AV? The answer is that under MR you have more flexibility in how you vote, for two reasons. The first reason is that if you put a party as your first choice in one round, you can put a different party as your first choice in a later round, even if the first party is still in the running. Secondly, you can allow your votes in later rounds to depend on the results of earlier rounds, which increases the opportunities to vote tactically.\nWhy might you want to change your first preference if the party you voted for is still in the running? I can think of a few reasons. One is that you might want to vote tactically because of something like the scenario I outlined earlier that can occur under AV: you want to eliminate a party so that the party you actually like can pick up votes from the supporters of that party. Another is that you like backing a winner, and you sense that a candidate has \u201cmomentum\u201d. The first reason is a legitimate one but an undesirable feature of MR (so it is good that AV lacks it). The second is not, I think, rational in a vote for an MP, though it might be rational if you are voting for a party leader and want a display of unity.\nSo AV is effectively MR under two restrictions: you are not allowed to change your vote from round to round unless the party you are currently supporting is eliminated; and you are not allowed to know anything about the votes cast in previous rounds except which parties have been eliminated. Given those restrictions, you might as well just list your preferences in advance, and if you do then you\u2019ve got AV.\nA quick slogan:\nAV IS MULTIPLE-ROUND VOTING MINUS TACTICAL GAME PLAYING.\nIf you think about AV that way, then you can see easily that no voter has an unfair advantage over any other voter \u2014 and supporters of unpopular parties are the worst off.\n4. AV is unfair because the least popular party gets its second-choice votes counted first.\nOh dear. There was even an article published in the Guardian that made this completely wrong point. If you buy the equivalence of AV and MR with restrictions, then you have an instant proof that the objection is wrong: under MR with restrictions, the least popular party does not get its second-choice votes counted first and yet the result is precisely the same.\nHere is a different argument. Suppose there is a constituency with four candidates, representing Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, and the British National Party. The first preferences are\nLabour, A\n"}, {"score": 1378.684, "uuid": "6751e354-218d-539c-a52c-42a914219ae6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0813wb-51-21138", "target_hostname": "gowers.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "https://gowers.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/is-av-better-than-fptp/", "page_rank": 1.2042867e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Is</em> AV <em>better</em> <em>than</em> FPTP? \u00ab Gowers&#x27;s Weblog", "snippet": "But yes, I <em>do</em> <em>think</em> it <em>is</em> <em>better</em> to vote for the candidate <em>you</em> most sincerely support <em>than</em> vote tactically or simply pass up your right to have <em>you</em> voice heard because <em>you</em> might not \u201cwin\u201d.", "explanation": null, "document": "AV vs FPTP \u2014 a supplementary\u00a0post \u00bb\nIs AV better than\u00a0FPTP?\nOn May 5th the UK will vote in a referendum for only the second time ever. (The first time was in 1975, when we voted on whether to remain in the EU, or the Common Market as it was then called.) Now we have a chance to decide whether to retain our current voting system, misleadingly known as First Past The Post, or whether to switch to the Alternative Vote. Let me come clean straight away. Although in this post I shall try to write dispassionately about these two voting systems, my actual attitude is anything but dispassionate: I have yearned for a better voting system ever since I have had any political awareness at all, and am steeling myself for what is probably going to be a huge disappointment when the country votes for the status quo. And I am writing this post in the genuine hope of making a difference. Since it is extremely hard to change anybody\u2019s mind in politics, I think the best I can hope for is to persuade somebody to vote yes (the question will be phrased in such a way that \u201cyes\u201d means you want AV and \u201cno\u201d means you want FPTP) who might otherwise not have bothered to vote at all. This is a mathematics blog, so I will give this post a mildly mathematical slant, but all I really mean by this is that I know when I write that a typical reader of this post will be mathematically literate, which may make the post different in tone from how it would be if I were writing for a more general readership.\nA little history.\nLet us look at the election results from 1979, when Margaret Thatcher first came to power, to 1997, when Tony Blair first won. These are results of elections held under FPTP, the system where the country is divided into constituencies, each of which gets a seat in parliament, and the seat goes to whichever candidate gets the most votes in the constituency.\nIn 1979 the results of the three main parties were as follows:\nConservatives, 43.9% of the vote, 339 seats\nLabour, 36.9% of the vote, 269 seats\nLiberals, 13.8% of the vote, 11 seats.\nSo the Conservatives got a little over three times as many votes as the Liberals, and just over thirty times as many seats. To put that another way, it took about ten times as many votes (on average) to elect a Liberal MP as it took to elect a Conservative MP.\nThe next election was an interesting one. A couple of years into Thatcher\u2019s premiership, a new political party, the Social Democratic Party, was formed by moderate Labour Party politicians who did not like the lurch to the left that had taken place under Labour\u2019s then leader Michael Foot. Within a short time, they were coming top in opinion polls, but this did not last until the General Election, largely because the Falklands War gave Mrs Thatcher a huge boost to her popularity. It was clear that the Social Democrats had a lot in common with the Liberals (with whom they were later to merge), so they agreed not to stand against each other at the 1983 General Election, instead forming the Alliance. The results of the election were as follows:\nConservatives, 42.4% of the vote, 397 seats\nLabour, 27.6% of the vote, 209 seats\nSDP/Liberal Alliance, 25.4% of the vote, 23 seats.\nLet us note a couple of anomalies in this result. Most strikingly, the Alliance got almost as many votes as the Labour party but Labour got roughly nine times as many seats. Second most strikingly, the Conservative share of the vote went down slightly, but they now had a truly thumping majority, much higher than after the previous election.\nHow was this possible? Well, under FPTP, if you want to maximize the number of seats you will get for a given share of the vote, then there are two things you must avoid. Most importantly, you don\u2019t want to spread your vote about too evenly: if you get 28% of the vote in every single seat, you probably won\u2019t win a single seat. So FPTP penalizes parties that have a uniform appeal throughout the country. This suggests that what you want is for your support to be geographically concentrated, and indeed that is the case up to a point, but you must also avoid having too many seats where you have an overwhelming majority: if you get 90% in a seat, then at least 40% of those votes would have been more useful to you if they had been cast in other constituencies. So FPTP favours parties with support that is geographically concentrated but not too concentrated. The Alliance\u2019s support was dispersed, and the consequences for them at the election were disastrous.\nThe second anomaly \u2014 the hugely increased majority for the Conservatives despite a drop in their share of the vote \u2014 was a consequence of a phenomenon that frequently arises in this country under FPTP, the splitting of the left. At that time, both Labour and the Alliance were clearly on the left (the Alliance was much less so, but they were certainly not in favour of the Thatcherite programme that the country officially voted for) so there was a clear majority in favour of broadly left-wing politics. However, that majority was roughly evenly split between two parties, so there were many constituencies where the Conservatives won the seat with well under half the vote.\nThe next election, in 1987, was similar but less extreme.\nConservatives, 42.2% of the vote, 376 seats\nLabour, 30.8% of the vote, 229 seats\nAlliance, 22.6% of the vote, 22 seats.\nIn 1990 Margaret Thatcher resigned and John Major took over. The next election was in 1992 and the results were as follows. By this time, the SDP and the Liberals had merged to become the Liberal Democrats.\nConservatives, 41.9% of the vote, 336 seats\nLabour, 34.4% of the vote, 271 seats\nLiberal Democrats, 17.8% of the vote, 20 seats.\nSomething odd happened here too: the Conservative vote dropped by 0.3% but their majority went down very substantially (which led to numerous rebellions throughout the parliament, particularly on the thorny subject of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe). The explanation is that the split on the left, which still existed, was less severe.\nNext was 1997, the year that Blair was elected.\nLabour, 43.2% of the vote, 418 seats\nConservatives, 30.7% of the vote, 165 seats\nLiberal Democrats, 16.8% of the vote, 46 seats.\nAgain there are some strange aspects of this result. The Liberal Democrats had their best result for many decades despite their lowest vote percentage in all the elections I have discussed. (However, their share of seats was still significantly lower than it would have been under a proportional system.) Labour got about two and a half times as many seats as the Conservatives for under one and a half times as many votes, and got a massive majority with only 43.2% of the vote.\nDoes FPTP reflect the will of the voters?\nIt is very easy to slip into thinking that the answer to this question is yes by definition: whatever the result of an election, the interpretation given to it by the media will be that \u201cthe voters have said\u201d whatever FPTP deems them to have said. For instance, when I think back to the election that John Major won, my impression of it is that the mood of the country swung against the Tories, but not by enough to unseat them. I had completely forgotten that the Tory vote remained virtually unchanged from the previous election and that it was only the change to how the votes on the left split that caused the Tories to lose seats. So a more correct interpretation of the result is that the Labour party had become more electable again, improving its appeal relative to that of the Liberal Democrats.\nI don\u2019t think it is possible to defend the view that the 1983 election reflected the will of the voters: over a quarter of voters ended up being represented by about 3% of MPs, and the representatives of just over 40% of voters were given free rein to continue with a program that was (I am pretty sure) bitterly opposed by the majority.\nIt is reasonable to say that when Tony Blair was elected, the result reflected the national mood to some extent: the Conservatives had been in power for 17 years and John Major\u2019s government had lost the country\u2019s respect after Black Wednesday , from which it never really recovered. However, it is not reasonable to say that the size of Blair\u2019s majority \u2014 he had almost two thirds of all seats \u2014 reflected the national mood. The large swing was reflected, but in a distorting mirror that greatly expanded it.\nSimilarly, since the Liberals, or Liberal Democrats, always come a distant third in elections, one naturally thinks of them as a minor party, but their share of the vote, often over 20%, is anything but minor.\nAnd I haven\u2019t mentioned elections from further back that were won by parties that did not get the most votes. In 1951, the Conservatives under Winston Churchill won an absolute majority of seats (though a small one) with 48.0% of the vote. In the same election, Labour under Clement Attlee got 48.8% of the vote.\nDo people\u2019s votes reflect the will of the voters?\nThis question looks a bit silly. Is the answer not trivially yes?\nNo it isn\u2019t. Under FPTP, we often receive election literature that looks something like this.\nThat was a bar chart put out by the Liberal Democrats in Cambridge at the last general election. They reasoned that Conservative voters would prefer the Liberal Democrats to Labour, so tried to persuade potential Conservative voters to vote Liberal Democrat on the grounds that voting Conservative might well let in Labour. It is only fair to say that this argument has been employed much more often in the past against the Liberal Democrats. The slogan, \u201cA vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote,\u201d used to be heard frequently at elections.\nBut the general point is that under FPTP it is often rational to vote for a party that is not your first choice. This is a very important point, since it hugely weakens one of the main arguments of those who are campaigning against AV. I will come back to this later.\n(In parentheses, let me remark that the result in Cambridge at the last election was\nLiberal Democrat 19,621 (39.1% of vote)\nConservative 12,829 (25.6% of vote)\nLabour 12,174 (24.3% of vote)\nGreen 3,804\nothers 507\nSo it seems that Conservative voters were not persuaded to vote tactically.)\nGoing back to some of the results under FPTP, one cannot know how many people voted for parties that were not their first choice. However, all the main political parties urge people to vote tactically in individual constituencies (even if the senior politicians do not always admit it), and it is obvious that many people heed the call. I cannot prove it, but I find it pretty obvious that some of the results from the 1980s that were so unfair to the Liberals, the Alliance and the Liberal Democrats were in fact more unfair even than they looked, since many people would have voted for them if they had not been persuaded by the wasted-vote argument.\nIs AV any better?\nSo far all I have done is discuss some of the deficiencies of FPTP. (OK, perhaps \u201cdeficiencies\u201d isn\u2019t a neutral enough word. I have been discussing some of the interesting phenomena that can occur, and often have occurred, under FPTP.) But does AV do any better?\nThe first thing to say is that AV is not proportional representation. Under AV it is still possible for a party to get a share of seats that is very different from its share of the votes. Before I say any more about AV, let me quickly say what it is (though I imagine that most people interested enough to get this far know already). Under AV, you don\u2019t just vote for one candidate. Instead, you number the candidates 1,2,3 until you no longer wish to express a preference. For instance, if you are a UKIP supporter (the United Kingdom Independence Party is a right-wing party that wants Britain to leave the European Union) then you might put UKIP first and the Conservatives second, but not express a preference between Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, etc.\nWhen the votes are counted, the following algorithm is applied.\n1. Count all first-preference votes not yet counted.\n2. If some party has over 50% of first-preference votes, then HALT. (That party then wins.)\n3. Take the party with the smallest number of first-preference votes and change each vote for that party by removing the first-preference votes and turning\nth-preference votes into\n4. Remove that party from the list of preferences of all other voters.\n5. GOTO 1.\nAs an example, suppose that the parties in your constituency are Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, UKIP and the Greens. Suppose that your preferences are Green, Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative, UKIP in that order. Then if no party has over 50% and UKIP comes bottom, nothing happens to your voting paper. If after the next count (when the UKIP second preferences have become first preferences) it is still the case that no party has over 50%, and this time the Greens are eliminated, then your preferences are shunted up by 1, so they now read Lib Dem, Labour, Conservative (UKIP and the Greens having been eliminated). Perhaps by this stage Labour have reached the magic 50% (with a boost from those Greens who put Labour as their second choice). Or perhaps no party has and the Liberal Democrats are now third. In that case, your preferences become Labour over the Conservatives, and one or other of those will now have over 50%.\nOne of the criticisms of proportional representation is that it weakens the constituency link: it is hard to have a fully proportional system where each MP represents his or her constituency. AV does not suffer from this defect, since there is still a constituency system. But the price for that is that there is no obvious reason to expect AV to be proportional. So why is it any better than FPTP (from the point of view of representing the will of the voters)?\nThe reason is that under AV there is far less reason to vote tactically. Under AV, a vote for a minor party is not a wasted vote: you can express your preference for the minor party while still having an opportunity to decide which of the major parties you would prefer. For instance, you could vote Green and not worry that you were letting in the Conservatives, or you could vote UKIP without thinking that you might let in Labour. And if you are an anyone-but-the-Tories person, you can express that sentiment without being forced to guess which party has the best chance of defeating them.\nIs tactical voting eliminated under AV?\nThe scope for tactical voting is greatly reduced under AV, because the wasted-vote argument no longer applies. But it is possible to come up with circumstances under which it would make sense even with AV to vote tactically. I\u2019m not sure these circumstances would be relevant: typically they would require voters to know more about the preferences of other voters than they are ever likely to in practice. But let me give what I think is the simplest situation where tactical voting would in theory be rational under AV. To make it easier to understand, I\u2019ll use actual parties, and will try to make people\u2019s second preferences as plausible as possible given their first preferences.\nSuppose you are voting in a constituency where the Conservatives typically get around 40% of first-preference votes, Labour get around 30%, the Liberal Democrats get around 30%, and the other parties get almost nothing. (This is not entirely realistic, but it could well be the situation after all but three parties have been eliminated.) Suppose you are an ardent supporter of the Conservatives. What should you do? Well, you might judge that Liberal Democrat voters are more likely to put the Conservatives as their second choice than Labour voters are. If that is what you think, then paradoxically it might make sense to vote Labour (the party you like least out of the three) so that when the second-choice votes are counted the Conservatives will get enough to push them over 50%. To see how this could work, imagine that the second-preference votes for Labour split 5:1 in favour of the Liberal Democrats (that is, 25% of voters have Labour first and Lib Dems second, and 5% of voters have Labour first and the Conservatives second), while the second-preference votes for the Lib Dems split 3:2 in favour of Labour (so 18% of voters have Lib Dems first and Labour second, while 12% of voters have Lib Dems first and the Conservatives second).\nLabour and the Lib Dems are neck and neck. If the Lib Dems come second, then Labour will be eliminated and the total percentages of votes will be 45% for the Conservatives and 55% for the Liberal Democrats. If Labour come second, then the Lib Dems will be eliminated and the percentages will be 52% for the Conservatives and 48% for Labour.\nSo in a situation like this, we have the strange phenomenon that it may be in the interests of some Conservative voters to put Labour as their first preference in order to gain a substantial block of Liberal Democrat second-choice votes.\nHowever, there are some pretty serious problems with actually voting tactically in this situation. Obviously if all Conservative voters were to do so it would be a disaster for the Conservatives. And you can\u2019t coordinate your votes. So how do you decide what you, an individual Conservative voter, should do? If you are a mathematician, then you will probably toss a coin a few times and make a probabilistic decision, but something tells me that that practice is unlikely to catch on. And of course, it is ridiculous to suppose that you will know what proportion of Lib Dem voters are likely to put the Conservatives as their second choice.\nTo get an idea of just how much less tactical voting there would be under AV, try to imagine a slogan as punchy as \u201cA vote for the Liberals is a wasted vote.\u201d You won\u2019t get very far with \u201cA vote for the Conservatives might let in the Lib Dems with the help of Labour second preferences, whereas a vote for Labour will help the Conservatives win with the help of Lib Dem second preferences, but could only a few people pay attention to this please?\u201d In practice, hardly anyone will have a good reason to do anything other than put in order of preference the parties that they have a view about.\nIs the First Past The Post system the First Past The Post system?\nThis is another question that seems to have a trivial answer but actually doesn\u2019t. Presumably First Past The Post is a metaphor. Indeed, it is a metaphor \u2014 from horse racing. So let us try to work out how the metaphor works. Presumably there should be a post somewhere. So what is the post? Hmm \u2026 it\u2019s hard to say.\nA natural answer might be that you pass the post when your party reaches 50%. That is, you would have a sort of race, and the first party to get over 50% would be declared the winner. Are there any systems like that? Oh yes, AV. (And not just AV, but that is the one we have the chance to choose.)\nFor the most part I want to stick to rational argument, but sometimes it\u2019s quicker and more effective to use slogans. Here\u2019s one I like:\nFIRST PAST THE POST IS NOT FIRST PAST THE POST!\nAnd to those who think it is, how about\nWHAT IS THE POST?\n(Under some circumstances, the first word might perhaps be replaced by \u201cwtf\u201d, but not on this nice family blog.)\nIf I want to vote selfishly, then how should I vote?\nSuppose that you firmly support one political party and your only interest is to do what will best serve that party, ignoring all questions of fairness, democratic principle, etc. How should you vote in the referendum?\nIf you support the Conservatives, then probably you should vote no. It was the FPTP system that allowed Mrs Thatcher to rule for eleven years with large majorities and well under half the votes. It is possible that the Liberal Democrats are so damaged by the current coalition that we will see a return to straight two-party politics for a while (in which case whether we have FPTP or AV will not make much difference to the outcomes of elections). But unless the political landscape really has permanently changed, FPTP gives the Conservatives the best chance of exploiting the split on the left, whereas AV allows those of a broadly left-wing persuasion to vote in an anything-but-Tory way.\nIf you support the Liberal Democrats then it\u2019s a no-brainer.\nIf you support Labour, then it is less clear what you should do. Perhaps you will look back at the three elections won by Tony Blair, and at the current unpopularity of the coalition, and think that you don\u2019t need the help of AV. But if that is your view, then I suggest you look back further to the dark days of the 1980s. Under AV there is a real chance that Labour would have won the 1983 election, or at least been able to form a grand coalition with the Alliance, and the same goes for the subsequent elections: it is unlikely that John Major would have had his shock victory in 1992, for instance. And AV would not have stopped Blair from winning his resounding victories. Probably in 2005 it would have left Blair a little more punished for the Iraq war, but probably you wouldn\u2019t regard that as a defect of AV. And as for the future, when the Conservatives reduce the number of seats you will have a lot of electoral ground to make up. If the Lib Dem vote collapses then AV won\u2019t harm you, and if it doesn\u2019t collapse then AV will make it much more likely that you will be in a position to defeat the Tories.\nTo put it in slogan form again,\nA LABOUR SUPPORTER VOTING FOR FPTP IS A TURKEY VOTING FOR CHRISTMAS.\nOr to be more visual about it,\nAs I\u2019ve said above, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, but the whole point of slogans is to ignore all those little qualifications.\nSome claims by the NO2AV campaign.\nI would like to assess some of the claims about AV that have been made by those campaigning against it.\n1. Under AV the person who comes second or third can win.\nI find this argument laughable. The truth that the above sentence expresses is that under AV the person who would have come first under FPTP will not always win. Well I\u2019ll be: it turns out that AV and FPTP do not lead to identical results. So that is why we are having a referendum. Duh.\nThis objection to AV is so blatantly question-begging that it is quite extraordinary that anyone can seriously advance it as an argument. The NO2AV campaign has a TV advertisement involving a horse race. At the end of the race, to everyone\u2019s bemusement, the horse that comes in third is deemed to have won. This is supposed to be an argument against AV.\nIf I had the resources, I would make a counter-advertisement. It would go something like this. There is a mile-long horse race. As the horses approach 4/5 of a mile, Tory Boy is in the lead, but Labour Lad is storming up from behind and clearly about to overtake. Meanwhile Demon Libby is flagging badly and may not finish.\nSuddenly the race stewards run on to the track and stop the race. To general bemusement, Tory Boy is declared the winner, despite the fact that the race was not yet over and Labour Lad clearly had more in the tank for the vital closing stages.\nFinal slogan: UNDER FIRST PAST THE POST, YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO BE FIRST PAST THE POST!\n2. AV is unfair/undemocratic.\nI don\u2019t actually know what the NO2AV campaigners mean here. But I think they again mean that AV yields results that are different from the results of FPTP. The extreme unfairness of relatively large third parties getting a negligible share of the seats under FPTP does not figure in their calculations.\nThe idea that AV is less democratic than FPTP makes even less sense to me. AV allows people to express their actual political preferences rather than being forced (if they don\u2019t want to waste their vote) to vote tactically.\nI suspect that the NO2AV campaigners would rather not specify what they mean by calling AV unfair and undemocratic, since that way their arguments cannot be properly scrutinized. However, it may be that in the back of their minds is another objection that has been made several times, which is the following.\n3. Under AV, some people get more votes than others.\nThe beauty of this objection (from the point of view of its political effectiveness, by which I mean its ability to persuade people who don\u2019t feel like thinking critically) is that it cleverly confuses a true statement with a false statement. It would be ludicrously unfair if some people were given more ballot papers to fill in than others. But that, it hardly needs pointing out, is not what happens. What does happen is that some people\u2019s second (or lower) preferences are taken into account and other people\u2019s are not.\nThis is presented as an unfair advantage to those whose lower preferences are taken into account. A hypothetical example sometimes given by the NO2AV campaign is of a BNP supporter getting five bites of the cherry whereas decent Conservative and Labour supporters get only one. (The British National Party is our lunatic far-right party. A typical quote from its manifesto: \u201cAt current immigration and birth rates, indigenous British people are set to become a minority well within 50 years. This will result in the extinction of the British people, culture, heritage and identity.\u201d)\nIs there any significant sense in which AV gives more votes to the BNP? There are various ways of thinking about this question, and none of them is of much comfort to BNP supporters.\nConsider first what it means if you get five bites of the cherry. It means that your first-choice party is eliminated, and your second-choice party, and your third-choice party, and your fourth-choice party. Compare that with the poor old voter who gets just one bite of the cherry. Their party is either the party that wins or the party that comes second. In the first case, they obviously do better by far. In the second case, it is not clear: if you vote Labour and Labour come second to the Conservatives, then you might well have preferred the Liberal Democrats or the Greens. But (i) they were behind Labour and (ii) right until the final round your vote was counting for your favourite party rather than for lower and lower choices.\nA quick slogan:\nGETTING MORE BITES OF THE CHERRY IS A DISADVANTAGE STUPID!\nThe idea that it is unfair for some people to have their vote counted more often than others is \u2014 in so far as it means anything at all \u2014 just plain wrong. The NO2AV campaigners are saying that supporters of unpopular parties get more votes. What they actually get is more opportunities to change their vote. Since each change is from a higher preference to a lower preference, changing one\u2019s vote is not something one wants to do. Simple isn\u2019t it?\nHere is another way of thinking about this bizarre objection to AV. Let us contrast it with a different system that is manifestly fair. I\u2019ll call it MR for Multiple Rounds. Under this system, everybody votes for just one candidate. If no candidate gets over 50%, then the least popular candidate is eliminated and there is a new round. Again, if no candidate gets over 50%, then the least popular candidate is eliminated and there is a new round. This process continues until a candidate does get over 50%.\nThis time, everybody gets one vote per round. How does that differ from AV? The answer is that under MR you have more flexibility in how you vote, for two reasons. The first reason is that if you put a party as your first choice in one round, you can put a different party as your first choice in a later round, even if the first party is still in the running. Secondly, you can allow your votes in later rounds to depend on the results of earlier rounds, which increases the opportunities to vote tactically.\nWhy might you want to change your first preference if the party you voted for is still in the running? I can think of a few reasons. One is that you might want to vote tactically because of something like the scenario I outlined earlier that can occur under AV: you want to eliminate a party so that the party you actually like can pick up votes from the supporters of that party. Another is that you like backing a winner, and you sense that a candidate has \u201cmomentum\u201d. The first reason is a legitimate one but an undesirable feature of MR (so it is good that AV lacks it). The second is not, I think, rational in a vote for an MP, though it might be rational if you are voting for a party leader and want a display of unity.\nSo AV is effectively MR under two restrictions: you are not allowed to change your vote from round to round unless the party you are currently supporting is eliminated; and you are not allowed to know anything about the votes cast in previous rounds except which parties have been eliminated. Given those restrictions, you might as well just list your preferences in advance, and if you do then you\u2019ve got AV.\nA quick slogan:\nAV IS MULTIPLE-ROUND VOTING MINUS TACTICAL GAME PLAYING.\nIf you think about AV that way, then you can see easily that no voter has an unfair advantage over any other voter \u2014 and supporters of unpopular parties are the worst off.\n4. AV is unfair because the least popular party gets its second-choice votes counted first.\nOh dear. There was even an article published in the Guardian that made this completely wrong point. If you buy the equivalence of AV and MR with restrictions, then you have an instant proof that the objection is wrong: under MR with restrictions, the least popular party does not get its second-choice votes counted first and yet the result is precisely the same.\nHere is a different argument. Suppose there is a constituency with four candidates, representing Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, and the British National Party. The first preferences are\nLabour, A\n"}, {"score": 1336.1168, "uuid": "24aa8a2a-ed30-5333-b2f6-0f549bad50ac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-53-18807", "target_hostname": "liberamoris.edublogs.org", "target_uri": "http://liberamoris.edublogs.org/", "page_rank": 1.2805765e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>imagination</em>&gt;<em>knowledge</em> \u2014 thinking <em>is</em> more interesting <em>than</em> knowing, but", "snippet": "I <em>think</em> the ideas represented in this literature review are comprehensive and vast, and provide an ideal jumping off point for the continual expansion of this valuable concept. o Likely the only movie review you\u2019ll ever see here \u00a9 2012 <em>imagination</em>&gt;<em>knowledge</em> \u2014 Sitemap \u2014 Cutline by Chris Pearson", "explanation": null, "document": "March 7th, 2012 by liberamoris \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\nSchool Librarians Association South Australia Brainstorming\n(an article I just wrote for their newsletter.

There have always been, and will always be, inequities when it comes to the things children present to us, with regards to their lives before school. From harmonious homes, filled with books, love, laughter and light, to the other, far more depressing and worrisome extreme, children file in to be \u201cfilled up with learning\u201d\nTraditionally pre-school, and, along with it, long day care, has been viewed as exempt from this expectation of traditional learning outcomes, focusing more on the provision of soft skills, such as the ability to get along with others, to follow a routine, and to develop basic courtesy and manners.\nHowever, as time often causes it to, expectations have changed. There is a growing movement which sees day care no longer being about \u201ccare\u201d and becoming more about \u201clearning\u201d. Many private schools now have \u201cearly learning centres\u201d, which view children as students of the school long before we traditionally have thought of them as such.\nWith this new expectation comes increased pressure, both on the teachers and the students, to produce evidence of that \u201cearly learning\u201d. No longer is it sufficient to play, grow, laugh and explore. More and more, the expectation becomes focused on output and the development of tangible skills, such as reading, writing and a grasp of technology.\nWhile in Sydney recently, a friend was showing me photos of her 4 year old participating in \u201ccomputer class\u201d. Her son\u2019s childcare contract a business to attend \u00a0the childcare once a week for 2 hours, with a laptop or ipad for each pair of children to use and share. The children use the laptop to type, play games and complete puzzle quests. The photos of the process are displayed on Facebook.\nAs a technology loving mother, librarian, teacher and general geek girl, I think this is wonderful. As someone who teaches preschool in a low socio-economic area, with parents with limited English skills and low literacy levels, I can\u2019t help but ponder over the equity of access.\nIn the centre in which I work, there are 2 desktop computers for 60+ children. They \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d. They haven\u2019t worked the entire time I have been there, and, I would suggest, based on the layers of dust, haven\u2019t worked for quite some time. Putting aside laptops and ipads, I am sure, for \u201cmy\u201d children, \u00a0the experience of seeing their name in type on the monitor would thrill them beyond belief.\nI can\u2019t help but wonder just how much of a disadvantage \u201cmy\u201d children are at. Many of them don\u2019t have access to paper and crayons/pencils at home. When they come in, they sit and draw and draw and draw, carried away in a world of colour and imagination.\n(This is not, by the way, a judgement call on the homes they come from. Many of our parents are recent arrivals to Australia, having come through a dehumanising system of being classified as refugees, and having their sights firmly set on survival and establishing a new life for themselves amongst the peace and freedom we so often take for granted. )\nMany of \u201cmy\u201d children come to childcare hungry to learn \u2013 and we do. We play matching games, we do puzzles, we paint, draw, sing and listen to stories. We play rhyming games and guessing games and we talk. When they go home, they listen to a rich variety of languages, and eat some wonderful things. But many of them don\u2019t get on the computer. Many of them are baffled by what to do with one. And I can\u2019t help thinking that puts them \u201cbehind\u201d before they\u2019ve even begun.\nOne would hope that they would have better access at school, but I would counter that it very much depends on the school they attend. At a school where I undertook some voluntary work, \u201ccomputer time\u201d was one hour, once a week, in a library with no teacher librarian. Much of the time was taken up with helping the children to log on, and before you knew it, the hour was up.\u00a0 With more and more schools cutting back on teacher librarians, the future is looking brighter for some than others.\nPublic libraries are also well equipped with computers \u2013 provided they can be accessed. There are issues of funding for the computers themselves, issues of availability (computers are often booked solid for much of the time), and then of course, of biggest concern for children, how can you get to the library if Mum and Dad can\u2019t/won\u2019t take you?\nMy biggest problem when ruminating on concerns such as this is that I don\u2019t have \u201cthe answer\u201d. I don\u2019t know where to get the money from to \u201cfix\u201d this issue of access to technology. I don\u2019t know how to make it ok in my mind that some children start life in such a blessed and \u201clucky\u201d situation, and others struggle right from the start. What I DO know is that it seems awfully unfair. I hope by writing about these things from time to time I can connect up with people who do have ideas about how to help.\nJanuary 11th, 2012 by liberamoris \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\nAn Afternoon In The Stacks by Mary Oliver\nClosing the book, I find I have left my head inside.\nIt is dark in here, but the chapters open their beautiful spaces and give a rustling sound, words adjusting themselves to their meaning.\nLong passages open at successive pages. An echo, continuous from the title onward, hums behind me.\nFrom in here, the world looms, a jungle redeemed by these linked sentences carved out when an author traveled and a reader kept the way open.\nWhen this book ends I will pull it inside-out like a sock and throw it back in the library. But the rumor of it will haunt all that follows in my life. A candleflame in Tibet leans when I move.\nJanuary 6th, 2012 by liberamoris \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\nAs we enter the National Year of Reading, I\u2019ve been reflecting on the stories (both autobiographical and other) that have influenced me as a professional. While I\u2019ve always loved books and helping people, there\u2019s a vast difference between that and becoming a teacher/ librarian (still wearing the ruby slippers on that one) with a passion for community development and social justice. The books I discuss below have made a big difference in how I teach/relate to people, and who I am as a professional;\n1) \u201cLife is so good\u201d \u2013 Co-written with the help of a teacher, George Dawson recounts the story of his life. Sounds fairly typical, if somewhat interesting, when you know that he was the grandson of slaves, and that much of the story recounts the times following the abolition of slavery. However, what made this book so life changing for me was that George learnt to read and write at 98. This is a book that reinforces many of the things I am so passionate about \u2013 giving people power through the written word (in terms of the limits of one\u2019s language being the limits of one\u2019s world) and the passionate and transformational power of testimony.\nThe world needs more \u201cvoices\u201d for all these marvellous and insightful stories \u2013 which is one of the things that is so exciting about NYR\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s never too late\u2026to learn to read\u201d campaign, which encouraged new writers to write stories which will inspire adult learners to want to read. The stories, available in print and audio format, can be found here .\n2) \u201cTwilight\u201d (bear with me here!) \u2013 Stephanie Myer has become a household name, and no doubt a very wealthy woman, due to the popularity of her vampire love story series. One of the things that I like about Twilight (which, by the way, is one of very few. I am very much \u201cteam vampires don\u2019t sparkle\u201d) is that it inspires talk and reflection and debate and sharing about books. So many aspects of these books have been debated in the public arena \u2013 topics ranging from \u201cfluffy\u201d such as \u201cHarry Potter versus Twilight\u201d or \u201cVote! Who\u2019s hotter? Jacob or Edward?\u201d to the more serious \u201cTwilight: The franchise that ate feminism\u201d and \u201cDoes Twilight encourage girls to participate in abusive relationships?\u201d As with Harry Potter, I think that any book which encourages children/teens to read is wonderful. It almost upsets me that they\u2019re now available on film, as I think it ruins some of the magic and imagination of the story, but that\u2019s a hot button issue with me, I recognise.\nThere are a great many wonderful books which are written for (and in some cases, by) teens. When I was in Year 8, I remember being captivated by the idea of S.E Hinton being a) a girl and b) being 16 when she wrote it. The NYR 2012 campaign is running a \u201ccreative reading\u201d prize, which encourages teens to nominate a \u201cmustn\u2019t miss\u201d book which they believe all teens should read. Hopefully, as well as encouraging reading and reflecting on texts, it will inspire some diversity.\n3) \u201c21st Century Boys\u2026\u201d Sue Palmer\u2019s book about how modern life impacts on boys is always something at the back of my mind \u2013 both as a mother of boys and an educator. As information professionals, we\u2019re often called upon to evaluate the use and acquisition of technology, and I think that too often this is broken down to affordability and succumbing to the pressure to be at the cutting edge, rather than a genuine reflection on what is best. As librarians, one of the greatest roles we can play, in terms of equity, is providing access to things which people may not otherwise be able to access, be that books, information, technology etc. We\u2019re indirectly tasked with spanning the digital divide, which does, indeed, open a variety of previously closed doors. I think, as technology advances, however, we need to ensure that this spanning doesn\u2019t come at the cost of eroding social and cultural norms and traditions, especially when the cultures concerned have a rich history of oral storytelling and communication.\nThe NYR suggests, as part of their campaign, a \u201creading hour\u201d, to establish the idea that everyone would benefit from reading an hour a week. Like Sue Palmer, the NYR seems to advocate that time away from screens (for children especially) is a good thing (here here, she says, from behind her laptop)\nFrankly, the fact of only having 60 minutes across 7 days to lose myself in a book makes me break out in hives, but it\u2019s a worthwhile goal to aim for, especially when work/life balance is out of whack. Story time is cherished time in our house, and oh that it was the same the world over.\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEmergency Sex and other desperate measures\u201d This will, no doubt, seem like an odd choice for a story which has inspired me professionally, perhaps even alarming, given that I work primarily in schools. However, as I will hopefully make clear, this isn\u2019t a case of \u201clove amongst the stacks\u201d but more of offering insight into the background and experiences of some of the children and families I work with on a daily basis.\nRecounting the stories and experiences of a lawyer, doctor and social worker contracted by the UN to work in Cambodia (and subsequently elsewhere besides) , the book describes in vivid detail the reality of the people the workers \u00a0come across in the course of performing their duties. Lives lived, loved, and lost in some of the most jarring circumstances imaginable.\nReading this book gave me insight not just to the lives of the authors during their time in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Haiti and Somalia, but into the lives of the people they were sent there to help \u2013 people who go on to find shelter in Australia, and whose children I work with every day. It was one of the first books which I re-read with a new eye as a professional. The messages which I took away from the book have been some of the more formative ones in persuading me that people\u2019s pain and past wasn\u2019t something to fear \u2013 that the people I was dealing with had \u201cnormal\u201d problems too.\nNot everything had to be horrific and laden with pain (though that was of course always a consideration) \u2013 some of the children wanted to talk about the time when Mummy kissed someone else in the camp, and that was just as valid an event as the trauma of leaving Grandma behind. I found this book at my library, in Sydney, and I\u2019m using that as a tenacious link to the NYR, and their connection with Library and Information week (May 21- 27) during which a membership drive will be run, encouraging people to join their local library.\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy Place\u201d by Sally Morgan was one of the first books I read which touched on Aboriginality being something more than \u201cpeople in loin cloths who lived long ago\u201d. From memory, I read this as a privileged (relatively) suburban Caucasian girl. I\u2019m sure I was more familiar than most of my peers that there was racism out there in the world, and that some people had it tougher than others (My Dad was/is an ESL teacher, working with new arrivals, and many of our \u201cbut all the kids at school have XYZ!\u201d arguments were met with \u201cABC at school arrived from Lebanon 2 weeks ago with one suitcase and no parents\u2026.\u201d), but I had no concept of what the reality of modern life was for Indigenous people.\nReading this book, in the late 80\u2019s, meant my frame of reference at that time (I was around 10) was land rights protests at the bicentenary, and the aforementioned loin cloths. \u00a0I distinctly remember reading the part of the novel where Sally hears her Mum calling the dog, saying, \u201ccome here, you little black bastard\u201d and feeling really raw and sad. It switched on a light for me, even at such a young age.\nRe-reading this book as part of an Indigenous Studies unit, as a young adult, I picked up on some layers which I had missed as a child. During the time we read the book as a group, the Mabo judgement was still relatively fresh in people\u2019s memories, and I remember some very spirited debates. Professionally, this book helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the emotionality behind the Stolen Generations, and the inherent (and justified) mistrust of authority that many Indigenous people feel towards those in positions of authority. In the time before K Rudd said sorry, this book brought to mind issues which weren\u2019t getting a lot of notice. Whenever I look back on how \u201cEarly Australia\u201d was taught to me, I shudder, and vow to teach with more compassion and \u201cvoice\u201d.\nThe NYR, through the IAD festival (in Alice Springs)and the festival of Indigenous reading, writing and storytelling (in Darwin) is seeking to expand upon work already being done in remote and urban communities, to ensure that Indigenous storytellers have an equal voice.\nSo there you have it, 5 books which have influenced me as a professional. I\u2019d be delighted to hear what books have influenced you. Through a condensed real life version of this discussion, I\u2019ve discovered Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cFahrenheit 451\u201d, which I never would have picked up based on the cover or blurb, but am excited to read by my friend\u2019s review. Much like my twitter feed, finding out what my peers are reading leads me to some really unexpected and useful material, so I\u2019d welcome your input.\nDecember 29th, 2011 by liberamoris \u00b7 2 Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\n(it\u2019s also about why books are important, and the power of story)\nBack when I was a naive undergrad, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts (which I quickly changed to a B Ed, but that\u2019s a story for another day), my favourite subject was English. My second favourite was sociology (wonderful excuse for people watching, but not meaty enough to sustain a career), and I completed the trifecta with psychology, which I also adored, but the statistical norm and I are never going to be close friends.\nI was drawn to English for the simple reason that I have always loved books, stories, and the written word. As an earnest 8 year old, I wrote a poem waxing lyrical about the wonders of books, how a world could be discovered within the pages, if only one were to look. I read said piece to the school assembly, and it only occurs to me now to look back with gratitude on the day, my supportive classmates and parents, and the school which I attended. In a different school, a different time, such a reading could have ended in a vastly different manner.\nAfter living a bit more life, and reflecting on this love a little more deeply, I realize that it is not, in fact, books that I love. It\u2019s story. Interestingly enough, for someone who loves a good tale, I\u2019ve never been interested in fantasy or science fiction. I prefer my stories set on Earth, with rich characters and plots with twists that you don\u2019t see coming. That said, I also like stories were the characters already feel familiar to me, and the landscapes of the story are allowed to fall over me, thick and soft like a feathery quilt.\nGood stories, great stories, aren\u2019t always comfortable. While I don\u2019t seek out books which I feel are going to make me lose my mind, I am occasionally drawn to books which are outside of my comfort zone. Reading, for example, \u201cWhite Oleander\u201d I was confronted with a world that is, thankfully, quite foreign to me, at least in some respects. But I believe that is what good stories are for \u2013 to bring you just far enough outside of yourself to allow space for some new thought, belief or idea to sink in.\nThis brings me, albeit in a very roundabout fashion, to the point of this piece. Last night I watched, as part of a double feature, \u201cThe Whistleblower\u201d.\u00a0 To ever so briefly summarise, the plot centres on an American policewoman who joins a multinational firm of peacekeepers, who are subcontracted by the UN. The main character, Kathryn Bolkovac , is quickly promoted to the head of gender affairs at the UN, and uncovers a sex trafficking trade and corruption racket which implicates several of the male peacekeepers, and appears to spread all the way through \u201cthe system\u201d.\nAfter watching this powerful and troubling film, I listened to the reactions of people around me. Most were murmuring things about how powerful it was, how it was hard to watch, \u201cdid you see the look on the poor girls face when\u2026\u201d I also watched as they then sank back into their seats and watched \u201cMidnight in Paris\u201d, with \u201c\u2026that charming Owen Wilson..\u201d, and the whimsy of 1920\u2019s Paris. I watched the discomfort cause by the film they had just seen fade away, and I felt disheartened.\nThis is, I believe, the trouble with movies over books. So much of what we see on the big screen is described as \u201cmagic\u201d. We have 3D and special effects, and blue men that walk and talk and live in an imaginary world. Yes, we see young Romanian girls being sold into slavery, but I think it\u2019s all to easy to dismiss it as \u201ca dramatisation\u201d, even if that dismissal is on a subconscious level. What we see is quickly forgotten, as our eyes are bombarded with new images and details in the very next frame. There is no opportunity to turn back a few pages and re-read for meaning, or to listen to a key piece of dialogue again. Once a scene is complete, that\u2019s it, and to heck with any key neuance you may have missed.\nThe power of true story, richly and delicately told, is transformative. Testimony, through story, can change and inspire. Truth, as we all know, is stranger than fiction; but it\u2019s also more beautiful, challenging, awe inspiring and relevant than we give it credit for. Truth in a written form, where it may be revisited time and time again, and preserved in the most accessible of fashions, regardless of technological change, may just be the most powerful form of truth there is.\nTeam Book.\nDecember 4th, 2011 by liberamoris \u00b7 3 Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\nIn August this year, on the verge of graduation, I attended Library Camp Adelaide. Aside from meeting a whole bunch of very wonderful \u201clibrary land\u201d people, I was lucky enough to hear about the concept of a PLN.\nNow that I\u2019m enmeshed in the wonderful world of all things bibliophilic, I hear the term all the time. A PLN (personal learning network) is a network of people, chosen by you, with whom you interact, share resources, articles, job news, ideas, blog posts and the like. By making your PLN occupation specific, you can participate in a vast array of industry discussion, and vicarious professional development opportunities. \u00a0My PLN is a mix of teachers, teacher librarians, academic librarians, library technicians, and a few \u201cnon industry\u201d people who have connected ideas and thoughts on all things library.\nMy PLN is a wonderful thing, and it\u2019s growing all the time. Through my PLN I hear about what\u2019s happening in the industry I want so badly to be a part of. They inspire me to keep plugging away with applications, they read my selection criteria, they invite me to events \u2013 social and otherwise \u2013 which allows me to make myself known to what is a very small and tightly held group of Adelaide individuals.\nThose in my PLN who don\u2019t reside in Adelaide allow me to sharpen my focus beyond what\u2019s happening in my town. Through them, I know what\u2019s happening around the country and around the world. Not just what\u2019s being reported, but what\u2019s actually happening behind the scenes in the industry. My PLN feeds my passion for libraries, books, learning and bringing people together to celebrate all those things. When my passion is wavering and I feel discouraged, my PLN is there to remind me, either covertly or overtly, why I keep hanging in there.\nMy PLN also gives in practical ways. While at NLS5, I developed a killer headache. By simply tweeting \u201cI\u2019ve got a major headache, does anyone have a panadol? #NLS5\u201d I received not less than 7 offers of panadol, including one from @jzgarnett, who was sitting right behind me. I met 7 new people, just by having a headache and being willing to take unmarked pills from strangers! Isn\u2019t it amazing what a PLN can do?\nThe most valuable thing I get from my PLN, and you may have picked this up as a theme, is persistence. They don\u2019t realise it, but just by tweeting about the normal every day comings and goings from their work in libraries, they encourage me that one day I too could be tweeting about weeding a collection, selecting a resource, or conducting a survey designed to establish and cater to the needs of my patrons. Through their tweets, my PLN remind me that there is a life to be had in libraries \u2013 they keep the dream alive. They allow me a window into their world, and inspire me to keep hoping that one day I can call it my world too.\nFor that, but not that alone, they are worth their weight in gold, every single one of them. An amazing year long Christmas gift, *raise your glass here* \u201cto my PLN, the gift that keeps on giving, may your days be merry and bright\u201d\nNovember 14th, 2011 by liberamoris \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\n(In response to @21stPrincipal\u2019s\u00a0 twitter comment \u201cthe term value added is demeaning of education. It implies that learning is the process of adding value to raw materials\u201d)\nEducation professionals love a buzz word. We speak of personal learning environments, those children from CALD and NESB backgrounds, who have ESL. As teachers and learning practitioners, we use constructive alignment to create and explore innovative curriculum, which allows scope for rich tasks and authentic learning. Our aim is to create cognitive apprentices, entice them to build e-portfolios, and allow them to feel as though their learning is part of a community of practice.\nIt should come as no surprise, then, to learn of another buzzword being kicked around with an education hash tag \u2013 the concept of \u201cvalue adding\u201d when it comes to educational outcomes. Only this time, it\u2019s much more than just a word. It\u2019s a worrying trend which seeks to further corporatize the world of teaching and learning.\nFlorida teachers, from next year, will be subjected to evaluations which seek to determine how much value a given teacher adds to a student\u2019s final grade. Using a complicated formula and the results of a student\u2019s score on an examination, each teacher in the school will be assigned a ranking, which will affect their salary and employment situation. Teachers whose subjects are not assessed by the exam in question will be assigned a ranking based on the performance of the school as a whole. Half of their ranking will come from performance based evaluation by the school executive, and half from the student\u2019s results.\nLeaving aside the very real problems of one rat sinking the whole ship, and the cumbrance I take with the idea that the performance of the student rests solely on the teacher\u2019s shoulders, I have very real issues with the mere idea that education as an endeavour can be reduced to something as elemental as, like 21stprincipal put it, raw materials.\nOne of the greatest joys in being involved in education is the value extraction. For every nugget of knowledge I impart, I get to be in the privileged position of spending the day with other people\u2019s children. I get to learn so much about different cultures, different norms, different personalities, stories, parenting styles. I get a front row seat to what goes on in the hearts and minds of the future.\nWorking in pre-schools, I see tomorrow\u2019s architects design and build bridges and castles and homes and cars. I hear the song writers and poets of tomorrow cry with frustration when someone treads on their dreams, either literally or metaphorically. I hear the next Prime Minister argue with passion about some perceived injustice.\nWorking with reading groups, I allow tomorrow\u2019s plumbers, mechanics, nurses, doctors and speech pathologists to overcome stumbling blocks, which will allow them to go on and change the world.\nHanging out with the 2 year old crowd, I look around and know that over 60% of them will grow up to have a career in a field we\u2019ve yet to invent. That I add immense value to them and their lives is no question to me. I know I am shaping the future. I know the lessons and skills I impart make a difference to lives, be it as small as knowing how to use a library catalogue to find out how to make a kite, or as large as believing in yourself and building your castle before building the foundation.\nEducation adds value, no doubt. But we, as educators, also extract it. And that\u2019s worth thinking about too.\nOctober 30th, 2011 by liberamoris \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\nand what\u2019s more, why would you want them to? Obviously, as an education professional, and a librarian to boot, I am an ardent, passionate and involved advocate of all things reading. There is no greater gift to give a child than to flick that switch and help them discover the magical world that waits for them in between the pages of any picture book worth its salt.\nBut notice the key phrase \u201cbook\u201d. Not television. Not ipad. Not computer screen. Book. A book read in the familiar dulcet tones with which the child is so familiar.\nI\u2019ve a great number of issues with the \u201c Your Baby Can Read !\u201d program, not the least of which being that it plays on parental anxiety and targets vulnerable members of the community. However, my biggest issue is with the name. This program doesn\u2019t do what it claims to do. It doesn\u2019t teach a baby to read. It teaches a baby to respond to stimulus, much like one of Pavlov\u2019s dogs. It \u201cteaches\u201d a baby to memorise a series of shapes and cues, and to respond accordingly. It\u2019s no more reading than it is for me to open a packet of fish fingers, put them on an oven tray, and call it cooking.\nReal reading is a complex process. It begins with the understanding that certain shapes (letters) correlate with sounds, and, that by stringing these sounds together, you can assign names to the things around you. Once these names are strung together, you can create whole lines (sentences) of names (words) which can convey meaning about what you see, hear or imagine.\nOnce you\u2019ve got that sorted out, you learn that lines can be joined to other lines, and pictures can be added to support what you\u2019re hearing, and what do you know, you\u2019re reading!\nReading is about comprehension. It\u2019s one thing to know that \u201cc-o-w\u201d says cow, but also about the frames of reference needed to support that. \u00a0\u201cCow\u201d only becomes meaningful with the life experience and exposure to know that the concept \u201ccow\u201d correlates with a large animal that chews cud, moos and produces milk.\nThe transferable skills of phonemic awareness mean that a child who can read can take the sounds \u201cc-a-t\u201d and make \u201ccat\u201d \u201cact\u201d and \u201ctac\u201d. Rote learning that the combination \u201cc-a-t\u201d equates with \u201ccat\u201d will allow the child to read exactly that -\u201ccat\u201d. Nothing more and nothing less. If the norms are moved away, the lesson is lost.\nThe program \u201cworks\u201d for 2 reasons. 1, any parent who is invested enough in their child\u2019s learning to shell out $200 + for a set of DVD\u2019s is attentive enough to talk to them and seek out opportunities for them to expand their world view. These are the same parents who are buying the \u201cBrainy Baby\u201d series of schlock, and supporting any toy which claims to have \u201ceducational benefit\u201d. Any parent who is invested in this way is going to be supplementing the program with talking, reading, singing and play. All the things which are the foundations for reading, without the program in place.\nReason 2 is very simple- correlation bias. You want to see a return on your investment, so you do. You want other people to comment on your child\u2019s party trick of touching their ears when they see a certain card, so you say \u201cHey Jane, watch this, it\u2019s so amazing! I show Jonty this card, and he touches his ears!\u201d Jane, being your well meaning and affable friend, will of course say \u201cWow! That\u2019s wonderful\u201d.\nOne of two things will then happen. Jane, feeling the pressure to keep up with the parenting Joneses, and not wanting Algernon to be at a disadvantage, will purchase the program too. Or Jane will sit down, think about it rationally, and write a blog post about it.\nOctober 6th, 2011 by liberamoris \u00b7 No Comments \u00b7 Uncategorized\nI wanted to share my story about the teacher I will always remember\u00a0 \u2013 we all have one, at least, who we remember for good reasons. Her name was Miss Newman, and I was blessed enough to have her teach me\u00a0 twice.\nShe was everything my other teachers weren\u2019t. She was young, and spunky and full of a genuine passion for what she did. She\u2019d been so many other things before she was a teacher \u2013 she\u2019d sold ice creams in a Mr Whippy van, and gotten fired for making them too big. She\u2019d worked in Kalgoorlie. She\u2019d been an absolutely hopeless waitress, and she told us about all these different lives.\nIn Year 3, I had to start wearing glasses, and she got wind of the teasing that came along with this. Her response was to sit our class down and explain that people who wore glasses were lucky, because they got to see the world in a different way. Then we all had to write a narrative about what we would see if we all had magic glasses on.\nWhen we learnt about compound words, we had to make a sculpture using found objects, to illustrate our newly formed words. I made a shoe tree. She taught us about classic myths and legends, and we got to be mythical beasts for a day. For the art show, she gave us string and took us to the edge of the oval to dig up clay to use as a background. I looped my string around and around and called my piece \u201cvideo tapes rewinding\u201d \u2013 she didn\u2019t think it was stupid. In fact, she said she rather liked it.\nWe made a dragon as a class, for the book week parade. We all learnt how to do running stitch to sew him together; using materials she went and got for us from Reverse Garbage. Miss Newman was wonderful, and I idolised her.\nIn Year 5, she decided to offer relaxation as an alternative to all the traditional PE activities, and sometimes, she\u2019d get us to sit cross legged on the floor, in a darkened room, with softy music playing, and she\u2019d read to us. Selby Speaks and The Witches and The BFG. Heaven for the book loving fat kid.\nWhen learning about community, she sectioned off parts of our classroom, and we all got to work in our cubbies, with friends and decorations of our choosing. We sang all the time, we made a video for BtN,\u00a0 we did tapestry. We all were given a character in a fictional town, and we made paper mache puppets, and wrote biographies for them. We performed a play for the Principal. I got so into what I was doing that my character, Miss Lilly, the florist, said \u201cBloody kids\u201d. Quite the scandal.\nWe did a unit on super heroes, and she was \u201csuper math\u201d, with a belt that had a calculator attached. She told us she was sent to help children be saved from the terrors of complicated mathematical problems. She was wonderful, and I idolised her.\nI happened to run in to Miss Newman (by then Mrs Barr) in a suburban shopping mall one school holidays. I had my infant son with me, and she had a daughter of 7 or so. I was so happy to see her, and to tell her that she\u2019d inspired me to go into teaching. \u201cOh\u201d she said. \u201cIn that case, I apologise\u201d.\nShe\u2019d had all her passion drained from her. All her creativity. All her energy. We spoke for a while, and it wasn\u2019t the kids that did it. It wasn\u2019t the parents either (at least not entirely). It was \u201cthe system\u201d. It was the fact that every 5 years or so, everything was overhauled, and re regulated and there was the \u201cnew\u201d English or the \u201cnew\u201d math.\nShe ended up doing what so many teachers I know have done \u2013 staying where she was physically, but checking out mentally. There has to be a way to make teaching less of a talk fest and more about doing.\nWe don\u2019t need everything overhauled every 5 years. It\u2019s not about pedagogy, or curriculum, or the \u201cnew\u201d anything. It\u2019s about supporting those who have the passion to work with the future, and standing out of the way and letting them get on with it.\nSeptember 27th, 2011 by liberamoris \u00b7 1 Comment \u00b7 Uncategorized\nReading the tweets coming from QPLA2011, people were tweeting thoughts\u00a0 from Sylvia Swalling . Now obviously I wasn\u2019t there, but, from what I gather, her focus was on family literacy building, and the impact that has not only on the family, but on the community as a whole.\nI\u2019ve long been a supporter of programs which encourage the youngest of children to view reading as pleasurable, exciting, fun and escapist. As Mason Cooley said \u201c\u2019Reading gives us somewhere to go when we have to stay where we are\u201d. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to convince readers who no doubt found this blog as educators or librarians of its benefits and joys.\nThe closing statement in my personal teaching philosophy says;\n\u201cFlicking the switch to a love of reading, especially during the formative years, is a vital predictor of long term educational outcomes, and personal and economic well being, as well as higher rates of entry to University and TAFE, higher rates of employment, shorter periods of unemployment, the range of employment options available, and increased earning potential.\u201d\nAnd I stand by that. My feelings are supported and validated by numerous amounts of research, by anecdotal evidence, and by the sheer number of programs which exist to support the growth and development of early reading.\nSo why the blog post? Well, I was interested in what came next. I wanted to learn if any programs existed to target the development and improvement of literacy outcomes beyond school age, or if that was considered the domain of the school in question.\nIntergenerational literacy skill building is something which is of great interest to me \u2013 tying that in to school curriculum\u2019s and community development programs, and building in social networking opportunities \u2013 both \u201clive\u201d and virtual. In this vein, I present to you a review of a review.\nThe paper I read this evening is called \u201c Review of the literature; Family literacy programs \u201d, published in 2009 and prepared by Associate Professor Kaye Lowe, Debbie Martens, Kelly Hannett and Ros Tunks, under the banner of The National Capital Centre for Literacy Research.\nThe key findings are as follows:\n*Programs are currently focused primarily on helping children have a solid foundation in literacy in the years before school, and are \u201cfamily\u201d only in as much as they capitalise on the role of parent as first teacher.\n*Approximately one in two 15- 24 year olds is unable to read to an adequate level to function in society (ABS, July 2008). I think this has very real Implications for young people becoming parents with this skill deficit. Programs which are targeted to children need to take into account the demographics of the parents using the service. This is also true of parents from CALD [1] backgrounds and backgrounds of financial or social disadvantage.\n*More than just mothers \u2013 programs seem to focus and report on the role of mothers as facilitators in the home environment. This fails to take into account the changing modern family structure, non traditional families, and, perhaps most importantly, the role of fathers in the reading interventions, especially with school age boys.\n*The review identified 3 main types of programs. Programs delivered to adults and children \u2013 programs delivered just to parents with benefits to children \u2013 and programs delivered just to children with benefits to parents.\n*There is a need multicultural and multilingual approach, which recognises, incorporates and celebrates CALD traditions and methodologies. This is especially relevant to backgrounds where stories are traditionally conveyed orally.\n*Programs need to be ongoing, personal, non threatening, and hands on. They should build confidence, and may be more effective if there are incentives such as transportation, childcare, vouchers for services etc.\nWith 2012 being the year of reading, I believe there is real scope to capture and expand upon an area which is currently under represented in libraries \u2013 the stage 2, the \u201cwhat happens after they enter school\u201d, the supporting of parents to support their children throughout their schooling, the supporting of families as a whole \u00a0to improve all their literacy outcomes and the idea that families, schools and agencies can (and should) be working in collaboration with each other for improved and sustained community outcomes.\nI think the ideas represented in this literature review are comprehensive and vast, and provide an ideal jumping off point for the continual expansion of this valuable concept.\n[1] Culturally And Linguistically Diverse\n"}, {"score": 1333.8066, "uuid": "174b1a9e-abba-5294-934c-d3a525624d1f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1814wb-80-00065", "target_hostname": "outsideisbetter.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://outsideisbetter.typepad.com/outside_is_better_chad_br/2009/09/worship-eschatology-and-sacramental-imagination-part-3.html", "page_rank": 1.1972496e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Worship, Eschatology and Sacramental <em>Imagination</em>: Part 3 - outside <em>is</em> <em>better</em>", "snippet": "The creatures that have been responsible for naming and protecting the holiness of God are agreeing because as a saved people, we understand the things of God <em>better</em> <em>than</em> they <em>do</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Worship, Eschatology and Sacramental Imagination: Part 3\nThanks for sticking around.\u00a0 This will be the final post in the series.\nRevelation 19:1-4 as applied text\n19:1 After these things I heard a tremendous voice, like of a crowd of many people speaking;\nHallelujah!

The smoke from her city ascends into the eternity of eternity\n19:4 And the twenty four elders and four living creatures fell and worshipped God who sits on the throne sing;\nAmen.\u00a0 Hallelujah (6)\nEntering into the heavenly vision of St. Johns Apocalypse in chapter 19, we come into the story late.\u00a0 The characters have already been long introduced and many of the cryptic elements have already taken place.\u00a0 We see an interaction between the redeemed church and the creatures of heaven that speaks to the eternal placement of those who are found in Christ.\u00a0 This is a great text for us to look at, because it allows us to think of heavenly worship, eschaton and an envisioned sacramental reality of participation in the throne of God.\nA brief description of the heavenly creatures is needed.\u00a0 They are introduced in chapter 4 of Revelation and are woven throughout the narrative. Books have been written identifying these characters, but most agree that the four creatures represent the totality of creation wrapped inside the existence of the Father.\u00a0 Their role that has been played out since the beginning of time is one that identifies and protects the holiness of the Father.\u00a0 The twenty four elders have put themselves is a posture of constant submission towards who God is.\u00a0 They represent those who have passed through the salvific efforts of God into a new reality.\u00a0 These are heavenly creatures, full of the knowledge of the divine, but do not have an earthly home.\nThe interesting part of this reading is found in vs. 4, with the antiphonal response of the heavenly creatures; Amen, Hallelujah.\u00a0 Glossed, this is con temporarily translated as \"we agree, Praise the Lord\".\u00a0 These are two words that are heard in church often, and are part of the Christian\u00a0 vocabulary that many people might take for granted.\u00a0 But there is deep meaning in this response.\u00a0 G.K. Beale notes this response as a \u201cformal expression of ratification\u201d(7) by the creatures.\u00a0 These words are the endorsements of the truth spoken by Christ\u2019s church.\u00a0 The creatures of heaven and operating in agreement with the redeemed church.\u00a0 The creatures, since they are holy beings, understand the function of the incarnation as rescue, and the activity of God recovering His world.\u00a0 It is a \u201creckless indiscrimination\u201d(8), salvation as the action and the very make-up of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nGod is also doing this with us, enlisting us in the saving action, by our entry into the kingdom through the sacraments.(9)\u00a0 We understand our Eucharist as a \u201cTransporting Feast\u201d, as Charles Wesley wrote, bringing us into a timeless reality of action with God.(10)\u00a0 The sacraments are the best vehicle of participation, a vehicle that God provided.\nBut what does this antiphon have to do with us today?\u00a0 Does it hold some sort of secret regarding our salvation?\u00a0 Gleaning contemporary meanings out of Revelation without diverting off into crackpot prophecy is a skill that is not practiced well by many church leaders.\u00a0 I think that our answer lies in the liturgical and textual analysis of v.4.\u00a0 Why are the heavenly creatures agreeing with the words of the redeemed?\u00a0 To think that the church holds more understanding of God than the creatures that have surrounded him in heaven for eons is bold.\u00a0 But to reference Dons Scotus again, the incarnation is a fundamental action that would have happened regardless of the fall.\u00a0 Christ came not because of sin, but because God desired a complete union with humanity that could only be finally realized by grace.\u00a0 This does not discount what Christ did regarding sin, or say that Adam and Eve were not truly perfect, but that the fundamental attribute of God is salvific.\u00a0 The creatures that have been responsible for naming and protecting the holiness of God are agreeing because as a saved people, we understand the things of God better than they do.\u00a0 The heavenly creatures can understand the idea of grace, but they can never understand it as an action because they haven\u2019t received it.\nThis makes salvation not about perfection, but a deep holy love and desire for relationship.\u00a0 Sacrifice for the sake of salvation is in the very being of God.\u00a0 The twenty four elders and living creatures were saying to the redeemed, \u201cThis is now your song to sing, because of grace and that you now know God in a way we cannot.\u00a0 While me may understand the complexities of his holiness, you understand him through the radical, sacramental power of grace.\u201d\u00a0 This provides a very Wesleyan way to look at the eschaton, as fulfillment that is couched in the marriage supper of the lamb.\u00a0 As humans we look towards this privilege with expectation.\nSacramental Vision today\nAt the heart of our sacramental vision is memory, the anamnesis, the constant active memory of the Church.\u00a0 We use our memory to locate ourselves not in the plight of postmodernity, but in the story of God.\u00a0 It orients us towards a narrative that is built out of rescue, renaming, and bringing the lowly to places of Holy prestige. It gives us coherence, meaning and a frame of reference that is built in the creator of the world.\u00a0 Because of this we \u201care not trapped and confined in the present moment but can locate it as the invention of temporal processes and actions, which gives us the wherewithal to transcend the limitations to which the here and now restrict us\u201d.(11)\u00a0 We do know what has happened before us and we know the design of the world.\u00a0 In participation with anamnesis is prolepsis, the active engaging of the future.\u00a0 We know that our world is on a timeline, and that it is originated with the divine.\u00a0 Placing our worship in the language of eschaton allows us to give service to this idea that is able to stay away from the language of revenge and judgement.\u00a0 We know that these things will happen, but that more is written regarding how humanity will be eternally positioned in relation to God.\u00a0 The liturgical Sanctus of the church is a recognition of how creation and end are in relation towards one another, and that end does not mean a final point, but a reconfiguration.\u00a0 Schmemann says \u201cThis is the ultimate purpose of all that exists, the end, the goal and the fulfillment,because this is the beginning, the principle of Creation.\u201d(12)\nWhen we worship, we place ourselves on this timeline.\u00a0 We shift back towards renewal, and again think that our sacramental actions are a reality and sign of our communion with God. The baptismal waters and the Lords table re-members us back into humanities proper place with God.\u00a0 But unlike Adam and Eve, we live knowing the radical sacramental powers of grace.\u00a0 Worship ceases to become a spiritual filling station and returns to the chief story of the Church.\u00a0 An ancient-future practice both grounds us and thrusts us towards the Trinity.\nThe Church\u2019s mission as an eschatological oriented people is one that understands we do have a storyteller.\u00a0 We tell of what happens when we will all know more about the story than ever imagined.\u00a0 Our Eucharist is the time in which we taste an appetizer of the anticipated heavenly reality.\u00a0 We are in between memory and hope, and we look forward to the time in which we will be able to do the things of heaven best; because we have a savior standing like a slain lamb that has brought us a redemption steeped with the grace that God gives his restored people.\n6 Authors own translation\n7 G.K.Beale The Book of Revelation (Eerdmans,1999) pg 929\n8 Eugene Peterson Reversed Thunder (Harper & Row, 1988) pg 153\n9 Ibid 166\n10 Daniel B Stevick The Altar\u2019s Fire (Epworth, 2004) pg 129\n11 Barry Harvey Can These Bones Live?

They have not been a big hit so far, and issues need to be addressed. Look out Greater Boston; you\u2019re next to join the new world of parking meter collections.\nPersonally, I agree with the smart meter gripes, with one exception. The parking meter issues don't warrant going elsewhere. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to a mall unless it\u2019s to watch a demolition crew blow it up. It costs 75 cents an hour and a little hassle to go to Coolidge Corner. You couldn\u2019t pay me ten times that to park at a mall for free.\nLast fall I served a four to six hour sentence at a Mall and left completely rehabilitated. They\u2019ll have to shoot me to get me to go back. Brookline is eclectic, vibrant and alive. Malls are the product of decision by committee, void of any imagination. Miss one on the highway and you might well just go to the one at the next exit. \u00a0They are all the same.\nYou can get food in Brookline made by people. Different kinds of food made from people who live for what they do, with skills learned from all over the world. Shopping malls have food courts. A court is a place you go to see if a crime was committed. Food courts represent crimes against the stomach. The food at malls is not expensive. it just sucks. It's food mass-manufactured by corporations. Food courts are breeding grounds for diabetes, colitis, and all sorts of intestinal conditions. I\u2019ve yet to find the link between pharmaceutical companies and food courts, but there has to be one.\nThe worst kinds of malls are the ones that try to resemble the real world, like Legacy Place. Legacy Place is the alternate reality for people who haven\u2019t taken enough field trips from the suburbs. Did you ever watch the movie, \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d? Truman spent his whole life trying to get out of there. Legacy Place is for people who think Epcot is the world and not just the Disney version of it.\nIf parking in Brookline is a nuisance, there are better ways to get here. Tens of thousands of people live within walking distance of Brookline\u2019s commercial areas. Hundreds of thousands can take public transportation. Brookline has more bike lanes per capita than Beijing.\nIf anyone is to blame for the $1,460,000 expenditure in the new meters, I can\u2019t find that person. To the best of my knowledge, all our elected leaders voted for them and there was no public outcry when they did. The old meters were breaking frequently and they were old. It\u2019s hard to argue that something with the word \u201csmart\u201d in its name isn\u2019t better than something with the word \u201cold\u201d in it. Communities all over the world are turning to them. They cost less to maintain when they are working correctly and they help local government produce more revenue at a time when local government is hurting. Consumers don\u2019t like them. Nobody likes them. Nobody likes to pay to park as it is, dealing with a computer that costs more and does less then your home computer doesn\u2019t make the experience better.\nIn a press release Tuesday, our proactive new Town Administrator took a step in the right direction by announcing the formation of a task force to address the situation. There is nothing about the issue that levelheaded, solution-oriented people can\u2019t address. We don\u2019t have to like the new meters, but they should at least work.\nThe vote is a million to none against the smart meters. But please, please, please, don\u2019t tell me that you would rather go to the mall! Grow your own food and make your own cloths first. Anything but the mall!!!\nR.

Were George Lucas, William Peter Blatty and Bram Stoker following the advice \"write what you know\" when they wrote their stories?\nYup.\nUniversal Experiences\nWhat you know isn't always what you see around you. It's not just the material life you live. You know a lot more than that.\nFor instance, you know what frightens you. You know how you feel when you're afraid. It's this knowledge you draw upon to make your stories believable to others: your fear of dark places, of the unknown, of pain and death -- primal emotions that everyone shares. If it frightens you, it will likely frighten others. Likewise with love, happiness, sadness, anger -- the full range of emotions common to all people. You know both what prompts these feelings, and how you feel when experiencing them -- what you think, how you react and what happens to your body while under the influence of those feelings. This is the knowledge you draw upon to make your stories real for others.\nWhat else do you know? Well, you feel more than emotions. You know how the sun feels on your shoulders, how ice feels in your mouth, how your knees felt when you fell and scraped them as a child. You know what your senses tell you, and other people share those sensations -- tell readers that the paper cut stung, and they will immediately know how it feels, and thus what your character feels. Readers will identify with your character.\nSo far, by simply drawing upon what you and everyone else know, you've created a rapport between the reader and your character; you've identified the stimuli that trigger emotions in you and your readers and used it to make your setting, your characters, your story line come alive. All while sitting in front of a computer in outer suburbia.\nGive it a Twist\nNow that you've got the hang of this \"write what you know\" business, you'll realize that the situations in which you find yourself experiencing these things don't have to be translated literally to the page. Remember Star Wars. Direct transliteration certainly didn't happen there!\nSo, you take what you know and give it a twist. Filter it through your imagination before that knowledge hits the page. Here's one twist I made, to illustrate:\nStanding on the edge of a cenote (a limestone sinkhole filled with water) reputed to have been used for Mayan sacrifices a thousand years past, I felt an inexplicable sense of dread, a feeling that crawled up between my shoulder blades and left me with the urgent need to step back, away from the cenote's edge. This, despite being surrounded by other tourists also looking at an innocuous pool of water on a sunny day.\nThat experience -- the sense of foreboding, that there was something evil lying below the surface of the water, even the sunny day -- became the pivotal scene in a \"ghost story\" I later wrote. Although the setting was on another world, far in the future, the details I used from my experience made the setting, even the situation, seem plausible.\nFolks Are Folks\nDon't neglect the other thing you know -- the people around you. Yes, Harry's an insurance agent and Madeline is a housewife; what could you possibly find to write about these people? Maybe Harry has this nervous habit of tapping a pencil against his teeth while he thinks. And Madeline's whole face changes when she smiles -- suddenly, that average, everyday housewife is beautiful. These details that make the people you know so familiar to you will also make your characters familiar to your readers. Give one of them your Uncle Bob's staccato chuckle, or your best friend's father's unusual penchant for knitting, and your characters will be remembered for much longer than the cliche character who is merely shifty-eyed or the little old lady who knits in her rocker.\nThe people around you don't have to lend their habits or traits only to contemporary stories, of course. Use them to make characters in stories set in the past or the future come alive, too. Writing a story with a historical setting? You've done your research -- another form of \"knowing,\" by the way -- and now you know all about the physical aspects of your chosen time period. You know what was fashionable and their level of technology and so on. You've researched more abstract concepts -- religious and political ideology, perhaps. How people were governed and by what prominent historical figures. But all of this treats the people of your time period en masse, as faceless members of an overall society, and your story contains individuals, characters you want the reader to believe in and care about and empathize with. You need to know how a peasant woman three hundred years ago felt, how she behaved, what she thought. How do you get inside the heads of people who lived a thousand years ago, say, and make them real today?\nAgain, you know how those around you feel and think and behave. People are people, no matter where or when. Even if your characters are aliens living in another galaxy, you are going to have to give them traits that humans -- your readers -- can identify with, so the story will work. No matter when they will live or have lived, all will have experienced love, fear, hate, curiosity, just as you do. So, again, take what you know and filter it through your imagination -- or through the knowledge gleaned in your research. Your historical characters may believe that their ailments are caused by evil spirits or bad humors, but they will feel the same pain and fear that you do. They will love their families just like you love yours.\nNow, next time you hear \"write what you know,\" you'll realize that you know an awful lot about what matters most in a story's success. It's waiting only to be shaped by your imagination.\nCopyright \u00a9 2001 Marg Gilks\nMarg Gilks' short stories, poetry, and articles have been appearing in newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and e-zines since 1977.

The Counter-Revolution of Science (1952) is the best place to explore Hayek\u2019s critique of positivism. In many ways, his history of the rise of positivism is similar to the story told by Habermas. Originally, science arose during the renaissance as moral science and simply examined at the opinions of men. This was natural given that men would want to know reasons for other\u2019s behaviors. This might be analogous to the practical interests discussed by Habermas. The natural sciences actually got many of their concepts from moral science, including law, cause, function, order, organism, and organization. The idea of the natural sciences only came later with the French Enlightenment. Hayek centers his story around the L\u2019\u00c9cole Polytechnique which was a great center of scientific research in areas such as chemistry, engineering, and physics. Again, this might be analogous to the technical interests discussed by Habermas. Hayek, much like Habermas, saw no problem in the application of positivism to the natural sciences.\nPositivism only becomes problematic when certain individuals begin to apply it to the moral or social sciences. Hayek attributes this movement to Saint-Simon and his student, Auguste Comte. According to Comte, \u201cEach branch of knowledge is necessarily obliged to pass through three different theoretical states: the theological or fictitious state; the metaphysical or abstract state; last the scientific or positive state.\u201d In each stage, one kind of science can only come after another and build on it. For example, math comes first, then astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology. This had already occurred within the natural sciences and Comte saw it as his goal to apply it to the social sciences which he simply saw as \u201csocial physics.\u201d\nWhile the goal of Comte was the unification of all the sciences, Hayek believed in a strict methodological dualism between the natural and social sciences. Like Habermas, Hayek objected to the methods of the natural sciences being applied to the social sciences on both analytic and normative grounds.\nAnalytically, the difference lies in the characteristics of the objects of study. In the natural sciences, we study objects which possess no purpose of their own. When we combine a molecule of hydrogen with a molecule of oxygen, we always get a certain chemical reaction which results in water. The facts involved are objective in that the molecules cannot purposely act otherwise. The point of the natural sciences is to figure out how such things happen. Very often, it is beyond our basic senses and we must setup experiments in order to \u201csee\u201d the differences. Hayek gives the example of two white powders which weight and feel the same and lack any smell or taste. By combining them in certain ways and testing their reactions under different circumstances, we can start to explore their differences. Science is the instrument which helps us identify and classify objects. In summary:\n\u201cTo return to our more general conclusion: the world in which Science is interested is not that of our given concepts or even sensations. Its aim it to produce a new organization of all our experiences of the external world, and in doing so it has not only to remodel our concepts but also to get away from the sense qualities and to replace them by a different classification of events. The picture which man has actually formed of the world and which guides him well enough in his daily life, perceptions and concepts, are for Science not an object of study but an imperfect instrument to be improved. Nor is science as much interested in the relation of man to things, in the way in which man\u2019s existing view of the world leads him to act. It is rather such a relation, or better a continuous process of changing these relationships. When the scientist stresses that he studies objective facts he means that he tries to study things independently of what men think or do about them. The views people hold about the external world are to him always a stage to be overcome (38-39).\u201d\nWhile the objects of natural science have objective characteristics, the social sciences are unique in the subjective nature of the \u201cfacts.\u201d The social sciences are concerned with the purposeful actions of individuals. \u201cSo far as human actions are concerned,\u201d according to Hayek, \u201cthe things are what acting people think they are (47).\u201d One cannot explain the reasons for someone\u2019s action if they do not understand how that person perceives their situation. Similar to the idea of Alfred Schutz\u2019s wood chopper, even something as physically objective as a hammer is something specific to each person viewing it according to Hayek. In this way, we must engage in verstehen or hermeneutical approaches. Compared to natural scientists who try to study the world without regard to the opinions of man, the social scientist actually takes the opinions of man as his object of study. The natural scientist who studies social science as done by social scientists feels that \u201che is among the company of people who habitually commit all the mortal sins which he is careful to avoid.\u201d (77) It is here that we see the most similarities between Habermas and Hayek.\nIt is on the normative side that they begin to diverge. Both Habermas and Hayek begin on comparable grounds. Echoing Habermas\u2019 discussion of the technical interests, Hayek asserts: \u201cIt cannot be too much emphasized in any discussion of Comte\u2019s philosophy that he had no use for any knowledge of which he did not see the practical use. And \u2018the purpose of the establishment of social philosophy is to reestablish order in society\u2019 (351).\u201d As mentioned above, Habermas saw the colonization of the social sciences by positivism as a result of the rise of the market and its logic. For Hayek, just the opposite is true. \u201cScientism\u201d leads to social engineering as people come to believe that a science of society means that we can manipulate the units much like we manipulate the units of analysis in the natural sciences. Hayek was quick to point out that both Saint-Simon and Comte were socialists. \u201cCentral economic planning,\u201d Hayek says, \u201cis nothing but an application of engineering principles to the whole of society based on the assumption that such a complete concentration of all relevant knowledge is possible (173).\u201d\nIn the above analysis, I hope to have shown that Hayek\u2019s critique of positivism is not only compatible with Habermas, but that it is more or less the same critique in different language. This is all the more interesting given that Hayek was writing several decades before Habermas. While later generations of Austrian School economists have delved into the idea of taking an \u201cinterpretive turn\u201d in economics, the works of Habermas have been neglected (Vaughn 1994). Additionally, the diverging normative implications each gives to the rise of positivism in social science cast doubt on both assertions. Positivism, despite its epistemological shortcomings, need not drive us toward any one normative implication.\nJosh McCabe\n"}, {"score": 1214.7651, "uuid": "9794251c-4120-5c26-8e15-8db47346d8a6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-72-16764", "target_hostname": "muneebkhan.net", "target_uri": "http://muneebkhan.net/2012/04/04/autism-more-common-than-you-think/", "page_rank": 1.2558005e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Autism: more common <em>than</em> <em>you</em> <em>think</em> \u00ab Educated Insolence", "snippet": "Autism <em>is</em> a hidden disease, it <em>is</em> a lifelong disability yet <em>you</em> cannot be sure if someone has it.

I would like to confess, that the first time I researched autism spectrum disorder (ASD), commonly known as autism, was only two years ago. I had heard of the learning disability but I was not aware of the exact symptoms of this neuro-biological disorder and how many people it affected. The awareness campaigns for the cause in public places; such as supermarkets and shopping malls had caught my attention.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on average every 1 in 88th child suffers from autism worldwide. In some countries the rate is higher; UK (1/60), Canada (1/51), Australia (1/50), China (1.1 mil total) and US (1/110). The symptoms of autism can emerge at anytime from infancy to 2 years old. Living in the United Arab Emirates this figure came as a shock to me. The U.A.E. has a limited population and integrated social demographics, which means that you may not be aware of it but there is a chance you know more than one family or parent with an autistic child.\nWhile research has not been able to identify the exact cause of autism, a mixture of physical and genetic factors have been identified. The symptoms are at times hidden or hard to detect, as autism affects the processing of information by the brain, the severity of which varies from person to person. \u00a0It is not easy to detect by looking at a child whether they suffer from autism, as the condition may not physically make them look disabled. With age, however, that can change.\nAutism can be conditioned and with corrective help and support, symptoms can be reduced but a child born with autism grows up to be an adult with autism. It is a disability that affects development and the three main areas that suffer are known as the triad of impairments; communication, interaction and imagination.\nThe disorder limits the ability to understand verbal and non-verbal communication. In some cases, the meaning of a phrase is taken literally, making it challenging to process expressions, gestures, tone and sarcasm. When communicating, people with autism may prefer to use non-verbal alternatives. While some people suffering from autism find the concept of a two-way conversation hard to grasp, therefore engaging in echolalia (repeating the other person\u2019s words) or talking tirelessly about themselves, leaving no opportunity for interaction.\nEvery day, as we voluntarily engage in non-verbal communication on Facebook, Twitter, Instant Messenger\u2019s and Email\u2019s; we ignore to realise the fact that there are children and adults out there struggling to exercise basic conversational skills with their dearest ones. We need to appreciate God\u2019s gift and have to stop neglecting the ones sitting in the same room as us for the ones sitting miles away over some smart-gadget. Our society has to learn to be more tolerant, as you may not have to go too far to find an example of a disorder such as autism around you. For those who can provide financial help to the cause, I request you all to do so within your means. Those not in a position to help financially, can volunteer at your local Autism Centre, learn more about the disability and extend a helping hand in other ways.\nThe key reason a person with autism finds it taxing to interact is the inability to exhibit their own feeling and emotions and realising those of others. It is harder for them to fit into society, as they may come across as inappropriate or insensitive towards others and may therefore prefer to spend time alone rather than seeking company.\nAs autism increases at an alarming rate, we have to learn to be helpful, sensitive and realise our feelings and emotions, which we can control as we please, come second to those of someone who cannot or does not have the ability to express them. The pain of having feelings and emotions but not being able to voice them is excruciating. Imagine living with it for a lifetime.\nOur imagination sketches our wildest dreams, provides us with the motivation to strive for better and to keep looking forward. Someone suffering from autism however, may not have the luxury of imagining their future or even accepting reality. Due to which, they find it hard to deal with change and struggle in unexplored surroundings. They love routines and may find it easier to repeat conversations or play the same games. A person suffering from autism may also lack the sense to interpret danger and follow rules.\nAny activity that attracts the attention and calms the nerves of a person with autism should be worked on and encouraged. We all find our peace in different activities or sports, something of interest to an autistic child should be cheered and supported as it could be a way to vent their frustration and a chance for them to express themselves in a less interactive and demanding manner.\nAutism is a hidden disease, it is a lifelong disability yet you cannot be sure if someone has it. It is much more common than people think. Over half the children suffering from autism go to schools that cannot provide them proper help and teaching. More than 40% of children with autism are bullied in schools. It is unfortunately increasing throughout the world and we are far from finding a cure for it. It affects children, the future of our world and most suffer from mild symptoms that can be overcome with discovery and help at the right age through corrective behavioral analysis. Please take a moment to think about the families, parents and individual\u2019s that are directly or indirectly suffering due to autism.\nThere are a few ways you can reach out and help spread awareness about autism.\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Help out at your local school or centre for children with autism or special needs\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tell everyone; your family, friends and colleagues and ask them to help you\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Donate to the cause:\n"}, {"score": 1211.3939, "uuid": "0dd7273a-6a31-5953-90ad-b92ea26ce2f3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0112wb-18-01007", "target_hostname": "www.educationworld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.educationworld.com/a_tech/tech/tech011.shtml", "page_rank": 1.546079e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Education World: Creating a WebQuest | It&#x27;s Easier <em>Than</em> <em>You</em> <em>Think</em>", "snippet": "And creating one <em>is</em> easier <em>than</em> <em>you</em> might <em>think</em>!

EducationWorld has all the answers and can make the process easy for you.\nWebQuests are probably the most talked-about and widely used Web-based activities in today's classrooms. What are WebQuests? What accounts for their popularity? And how can you use -- and create -- WebQuests in your own classroom? Education World explores those questions and more.\n\"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember.\nI do and I understand.\"\n-- Confucius\n\"A WebQuest,\" according to Bernie Dodge, the originator of the WebQuest concept, \"is an inquiry-oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by learners is drawn from the Web. WebQuests are designed to use learners' time well, to focus on using information rather than on looking for it, and to support learners' thinking at the levels of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.\"\nEducation World asked two educators who have created their own WebQuests to share with us the benefits they bring to their classroom.\nWHY WEBQUESTS?\nWebQuests, which use the constructivist approach to learning, are a super learning tool, said Kenton Letkeman, creator of a number of excellent WebQuests.\n\"With many research projects,\" Letkeman told Education World, \"students feel that they are sucking up information and regurgitating it onto paper for no other reason than to get a good grade. WebQuests give students a task that allows them to use their imagination and problem-solving skills. The answers are not predefined and therefore must be discovered or created. Students must use their own creative-thinking and problem-solving skills to find solutions to problems.\n\"WebQuests are also a wonderful way of capturing students' imagination and allowing them to explore in a guided, meaningful manner,\" added Letkeman, a resource-based learning consultant for the Tisdale School Division in Saskatchewan, Canada. \"Communication, group work, problem solving, and critical and creative thinking skills are becoming far more important in today's world than having students memorize predetermined content.\"\n\"WebQuests allow students to explore issues and find their own answers,\" he added. \"Particularly with controversial issues -- such as pollution, gambling, and nuclear waste disposal -- students must do more than memorize information. They must process the information in meaningful ways and reach moral and ethical decisions guided by facts.\"\nThe adaptive dimension, the ability to make adjustments in educational programs to accommodate students' diverse learning needs, is also an important characteristic of WebQuests, according to Letkeman. \"With WebQuests, special needs students can be given predetermined roles that are very important and make them feel part of the group,\" he said. \"Advanced students can explore further and do more than is required. The interest this type of project generates makes that a reality, rather than a fantasy!\"\nTHE WELL-PLANNED WEBQUEST\nMim Faro, a gifted and talented enrichment teacher at Mt. Penn Elementary Center in Pennsylvania, recently created her first WebQuest. She agrees that WebQuests are an exciting and valuable teaching tool. \"Of course, some WebQuests are better than others,\" she noted.\n\"A well-planned WebQuest,\" Faro told Education World, \"has guidance for students, a creative end project with room for flexibility, and links that help answer questions and positively add to the project. A strong WebQuest is designed for students to work independently, allowing the teacher to be a facilitator in students' learning rather than the sole dispenser of knowledge.\"\nFaro offered this advice for teachers who are considering using WebQuests in the classroom. \"Always thoroughly check any WebQuest you have not created to make sure the information is relevant and the links work.\"\nOf course, the best WebQuests ensure relevance because they are specifically tailored to your curriculum and your students.\n\"If you are going to create a WebQuest,\" Faro said, \"search through some existing WebQuests first. Make note of what you like and what you don't like. And above all, dare to be creative!\"\nLooking for WebQuests to check out? You might start with the Education World Lesson Planning article Women of the Century: An Education World WebQuest .\nTHE WEBQUEST FORMULA\nWebQuests, say the teachers who use them, promote high-level thinking, develop problem-solving skills, and provide an avenue for seamlessly integrating technology into the curriculum. And creating one is easier than you might think! Many sites are available to walk you through the process.\nOne of the most thorough is Bernie Dodge's WebQuest Page . According to Dodge, the six building blocks of a WebQuest are:\nThe Introduction orients students and captures their interest.\nThe Task describes the activity's end product.\nThe Process explains strategies students should use to complete the task.\nThe Resources are the Web sites students will use to complete the task.\nThe Evaluation measures the results of the activity.\nThe Conclusion sums up the activity and encourages students to reflect on its process and results.\nHELP! WHERE DO I BEGIN?\nBefore designing a WebQuest, you'll want to have an outline handy to guide you through the process. A number of excellent WebQuest outlines, including Tom March's Prewriting Your WebQuest , will help. Templates such as Dodge's WebQuest Templates are also available online.\nTHE DESIGN PROCESS\nOnce you have your outline or template in hand,\u00a0here are some\u00a0main points to\u00a0include:\nThe Topic. You may have already decided on a topic related to current events or to an area of the curriculum that's inadequately covered in available texts. If you're still searching for a topic, however, Tom March, who developed the first WebQuests with Bernie Dodge, suggests starting \"where you're at.\" \"If you have an area that's your specialty, something that thrills you to teach, that you know inside and out, up and down, begin there,\" March says. You can also explore March's Idea Machine , which provides 50 prompts designed to help begin the brainstorming process.\nThe Task. \"The task,\" says Dodge, \"is the single most important part of a WebQuest.\" His WebQuest Taskonomy: A Taxonomy of Tasks provides eleven different types of tasks, including journalistic, mystery, persuasion, and judgement tasks. If you can't find it here, you can't find it anywhere!\nThe Process. In this section, you'll include the roles students will assume and the steps they'll follow to complete the activity. March's Designing for Success provides not only a Designer's Checklist, but also some clickable \"friendly advice\" for the creatively challenged!\nThe Resources. Identify the online resources available on your topic by brainstorming a list of related words and using the list to search for relevant sites. As you search, create a hotlist of current, accurate, and age-appropriate sites that will engage your students' interest.\nThe Evaluation.

Wilson\nDarwin's On the Origin of Species was published 150 years ago, but evolution by natural selection is still under attack from those wedded to a human-centred or theistic world view. Edward O. Wilson, who was raised a creationist, ponders why this should be, and whether science and religion can ever be reconciled\nIT IS surpassingly strange that half of Americans recently polled (2004) not only do not believe in evolution by natural selection but do not believe in evolution at all. Americans are certainly capable of belief, and with rock-like conviction if it originates in religious dogma. In evidence is the 60 per cent that accept the prophecies of the Bible's Book of Revelation as truth, and in yet more evidence is the weight that faith-based positions hold in political life. Most of the religious right opposes the teaching of evolution in public schools, either by an outright ban on the subject or, at the least, by insisting that it be treated as \"only a theory\" rather than a \"fact\".\nYet biologists are unanimous in concluding that evolution is a fact. The evidence they and thousands of others have adduced over 150 years falls together in intricate and interlocking detail. The multitudinous examples range from the small changes in DNA sequences observed as they occur in real time to finely graded sequences within larger evolutionary changes in the fossil record. Further, on the basis of comparably strong evidence, natural selection grows ever stronger as the prevailing explanation of evolution.\nMany who accept the fact of evolution cannot, however, on religious grounds, accept the operation of blind chance and the absence of divine purpose implicit in natural selection. They support the alternative explanation of intelligent design. The reasoning they offer is not based on evidence but on the lack of it. The formulation of intelligent design is a default argument advanced in support of a non sequitur. It is in essence the following: there are some phenomena that have not yet been explained and that (most importantly) the critics personally cannot imagine being explained; therefore there must be a supernatural designer at work. The designer is seldom specified, but in the canon of intelligent design it is most certainly not Satan and his angels, nor any god or gods conspicuously different from those accepted in the believer's faith.\nFlipping the scientific argument upside down, the intelligent designers join the strict creationists (who insist that no evolution ever occurred) by arguing that scientists resist the supernatural theory because it is counter to their own personal secular beliefs. This may have a kernel of truth; everybody suffers from some amount of bias. But in this case bias is easily overcome. The critics forget how the reward system in science works. Any researcher who can prove the existence of intelligent design within the accepted framework of science will make history and achieve eternal fame. They will prove at last that science and religious dogma are compatible. Even a combined Nobel prize and Templeton prize (the latter designed to encourage the search for just such harmony) would fall short as proper recognition. Every scientist would like to accomplish such a epoch-making advance. But no one has even come close, because unfortunately there is no evidence, no theory and no criteria for proof that even marginally might pass for science.\nIn all of the history of science, only one other disparity of comparable magnitude to evolution has occurred between a scientific event and the impact it has had on the public mind. This was the discovery by Copernicus that Earth, and therefore humanity, is not the centre of the universe, and the universe is not a closed spherical bubble. Copernicus delayed publication of his master work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres until the year of his death (1543). For his extension of the idea, Bruno was burned at the stake, and for its documentation Galileo was shown the instruments of torture and remained under house arrest for the remainder of his life.\nToday we live in a less barbaric age, but an otherwise comparable disjunction between science and religion still roils the public mind. Why does such intense and pervasive resistance to evolution continue 150 years after the publication of On The Origin of Species, and in the teeth of the overwhelming accumulated evidence favouring it? The answer is simply that the Darwinian revolution, even more than the Copernican revolution, challenges the prehistoric and still-regnant self-image of humanity. Evolution by natural selection, to be as concise as possible, has changed everything.\nIn the more than slightly schizophrenic circumstances of the present era, global culture is divided into three opposing images of the human condition. The dominant one, exemplified by the creation myths of the Abrahamic monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - sees humanity as a creation of God. He brought us into being and He guides us still as father, judge and friend. We interpret His will from sacred scriptures and the wisdom of ecclesiastical authorities.\nThe second world view is that of political behaviourism. Still beloved by the now rapidly fading Marxist-Leninist states, it says that the brain is largely a blank state devoid of any inborn inscription beyond reflexes and primitive bodily urges. As a consequence, the mind originates almost wholly as a product of learning, and it is the product of a culture that itself evolves by historical contingency. Because there is no biologically based \"human nature\", people can be moulded to the best possible political and economic system, namely communism. In practical politics, this belief has been repeatedly tested and, after economic collapses and tens of millions of deaths in a dozen dysfunctional states, is generally deemed a failure.\nBoth of these world views, God-centred religion and atheistic communism, are opposed by a third and in some ways more radical world view, scientific humanism. Still held by only a tiny minority of the world's population, it considers humanity to be a biological species that evolved over millions of years in a biological world, acquiring unprecedented intelligence yet still guided by complex inherited emotions and biased channels of learning. Human nature exists, and it was self-assembled. Having arisen by evolution during the far simpler conditions in which humanity lived during more than 99 per cent of its existence, it forms the behavioural part of what, in The Descent of Man, Darwin called \"the indelible stamp of [our] lowly origin\".\nSo, will science and religion find common ground, or at least agree to divide the fundamentals into mutually exclusive domains? A great many well-meaning scholars believe that such rapprochement is both possible and desirable. A few disagree, and I am one of them. I think Darwin would have held to the same position. The battle line is, as it has ever been, in biology. The inexorable growth of this science continues to widen, not to close, the tectonic gap between science and faithbased religion.\nRapprochement may be neither possible nor desirable. There is something deep in religious belief that divides people and amplifies societal conflict. The toxic mix of religion and tribalism has become so dangerous as to justify taking seriously the alternative view, that humanism based on science is the effective antidote, the light and the way at last placed before us.\nReligions continue both to render their special services and to exact their heavy costs. Can scientific humanism do as well or better, at a lower cost? Surely that ranks as one of the great unanswered questions of philosophy. It is the noble yet troubling legacy that Charles Darwin left us.\nEdward O. Wilson is a professor of entomology at Harvard University. He has written 20 books and received many awards, including two Pulitzer prizes and the 1976 National Medal of Science. This is an extract of the afterword to From So Simple a Beginning: Darwin's four great books, published next week by W.W. Norton\nhttp://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8254\nAfter more than 2000 years the monotheistic religions have failed to create a better world. At various points in their history each of the monotheisms has been cruel and anti-human. Christianity's barbaric age was when the Popes ruled Europe and Islam is now coming to terms with its own present barbaric age.\nI believe that is is high time that the human race ditches its Bronze Age religious baggage and embraces a greater truth? -Scientific Humanism.\nA truth that is far more gentle and humane!\nihsan\n9th November 2007, 19:50\nThe reasoning they offer is not based on evidence but on the lack of it. The formulation of intelligent design is a default argument advanced in support of a non sequitur. It is in essence the following: there are some phenomena that have not yet been explained and that (most importantly) the critics personally cannot imagine being explained; therefore there must be a supernatural designer at work. The designer is seldom specified, but in the canon of intelligent design it is most certainly not Satan and his angels, nor any god or gods conspicuously different from those accepted in the believer's faith.\nThis is absurd. For some, the fact that certain phenomenon can be explained can be just as much a proof for somebody that God exists, as opposed to God not existing. For some, the very complexity at which an organism operates evokes the idea of design.\nIt is humorous that atheists like the above claim that they aren't dogmatist, or that they are objective. Atheists keep telling people why they believe the way they do, as if they know the person, better than that person knows his own self.\nAny researcher who can prove the existence of intelligent design within the accepted framework of science will make history and achieve eternal fame.\nAnd here we have the absolute stupidity of the challenge. What this basically amounts to is \"We dictate how one approaches reality.\" And yet science does not even touch on the subjective aspect of knowledge.

What this basically amounts to is \"We dictate how one approaches reality.\" And yet science does not even touch on the subjective aspect of knowledge. Pretty comical if you ask me...\nIslam is a body of knowledge.\nSo, Ihsan, are you saying that Islam is a subjective body of knowledge that is open to personal interpretation? It certainly sounds like it.\nTherefore, if Islam is a subjective body of knowledge where do we draw the line? At the Hadith and Sunna perhaps. But why there? There is no reason why we can't apply subjectivity and personal interpretation all the way down to the most basic level of the Koran, and the existence of God himself.\nCan we really know that God exists and is more than a play on the imagination? Answer No.\nThis is in stark contrast to science that offers hard physical evidence to back up its philosophical claims....\n\"Here are the observable facts - and here are the best possible, and most reasonable, explanations to those facts.\"\nWatson\n9th November 2007, 21:49\nAlso ihsan, you have the neglected the most important paragraph of the short essay;\nRapprochement may be neither possible nor desirable. There is something deep in religious belief that divides people and amplifies societal conflict. The toxic mix of religion and tribalism has become so dangerous as to justify taking seriously the alternative view, that humanism based on science is the effective antidote, the light and the way at last placed before us.\nReligions continue both to render their special services and to exact their heavy costs. Can scientific humanism do as well or better, at a lower cost? Surely that ranks as one of the great unanswered questions of philosophy. It is the noble yet troubling legacy that Charles Darwin left us.\nAnd so, when the Religious Right of US politics stops dictating foreign policy, the Israelis stop genociding the Palestinians, and the the threat of an atomic weapon being detonating by right-wing Islamists has gone away - then the scientific fraternity will keep quiet let religion be.\nihsan\n9th November 2007, 22:50\nThis is in stark contrast to science that offers hard physical evidence to back up its philosophical claims....\n\"Here are the observable facts - and here are the best possible, and most reasonable, explanations to those facts.\"\nDespite your tirade on Islam, none of that validates the original objection I raised. What this essentially means is that you tried to divert attention away from the fallacies of an article that you thought laid a nail in the coffin of religion, but which turned out to be nothing but a dogmatist tirade against religion. It is patently obvious that you do not even care to understand what other people say in the context of the various threads you post in. You simply repeat things like a parrot and claim that you won the day with your repeated parroting. Now I will summarize it one more time for you:\nYou see, science does not deal with the subjective aspects of knowledge. This is why the threoy of relativity was so revolutionary. In one single sweep, it shattered the very basis of science as the 'ultimate fact'. What you perceive as an object, is not really that object. It is a perception based upon the mind working in the framework of logical thinking, i.e. thinking affiliated with serial time. Thus, science is working based upon a particular mode of apprehending reality.\nSo when a 'biologist' makes such patently absurd claims that intelligent design needs to be proven in the 'accepted framework of science' he is being a dogmatist through and through. What is ironic is that the very framework of science is what refuted him.\nAlso ihsan, you have the neglected the most important paragraph of the short essay;\nComing from you, any claim regarding the other 'ignoring' is rather laughable... Everybody on this thread, other than you, has pointed this fact out. I didn't ignore anything. I just responded to what I felt relevant at the moment.\nAnd so, when the Religious Right of US politics stops dictating foreign policy, the Israelis stop genociding the Palestinians, and the the threat of an atomic weapon being detonating by right-wing Islamists has gone away - then the scientific fraternity will keep quiet let religion be.\nYou do know that it is a historical fact that more people died in the age of secularism, than all of history combined. But I am not so shallow as to blame such a phenomenon on secularism, like you do with religion. Ironically also, this devastaion also correlates with the greatest technological advances humanity has known. But I am not so shallow as to blame such devastation on science. But I will say this. Science hasn't solved the problem of man, despite all the advances that have enabled man to benefit. You see, the ultimate issue revolves around the 'sustenance' of man, i.e. economics, and man's attitude with respect to it, as the Quran rightly says. You see, when the US gov't wages war, it is because of oil, and oil has little to do with religion. In fact, the benefits of oil were only truly realized with the INDUSTRIAL revolution, well after the great religions that make up the majority of humanity were founded. That oil is used to maintain a certain lifestyle, a lifestyle that is a product of the SCIENTIFIC AGE. And that lifestyle of mass consumption is rooted in certain human urges that men, who lack any sense of self-awareness, cannot control.\nYour a rather shallow-thinking individual. I have yet to meet an atheist that possesses any depth of thought. But that is just a personal observation.\nWatson\nYour a rather shallow-thinking individual\nThat is what I call an ad hominem attack.\nihsan\nThat is what I call an ad hominem attack.\nTo borrow from you:\nAlso Watson, you have the neglected the most important paragraph of the short essay...\nthe WHOLE OF IT...\n"}, {"score": 1197.9844, "uuid": "5a8db72e-ec0f-5bf9-bea8-018f2312140e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1006wb-24-12328", "target_hostname": "jonathanichikawa.net", "target_uri": "http://jonathanichikawa.net/tag/imagination", "page_rank": 1.6916534e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "There <em>is</em> Some Truth in That \u00bb <em>imagination</em>", "snippet": "Stephen Yablo argues that <em>knowledge</em> of things like shapes, insofar as they depend on visual <em>imagination</em>, cannot be a priori.

People really seem to want to make their presence felt, and have a tangible impact at a nonprofit organization. Giving money that disappears into a nonprofit\u2019s bank account doesn\u2019t seem very personal or impactful, regardless of how necessary it may be. People are always being asked for money from countless corporations and charities, and they are tired of being nagged. They would rather give their time than their money, so they try to find ways to help without giving donations.\nWhen I was about 13, I went to a Jimmy Page and Robert Plant concert (with my mom!). In the lobby there was a Greenpeace booth, and I eagerly signed up to become a member, with visions of zodiacs and tree-sits dancing in my head. I was finally going to kick ass and save the world. Unfortuntately, my precious $30 only earned me repeated phone calls and letters asking for more money. I always told the hapless volunteer who was calling me that I was ready and waiting to go to the front lines, but I didn\u2019t want to \u201cjust\u201d give money. Well, Greenpeace never brought me onboard, and I never gave them another dime. I came away feeling bitter and dejected.\nWell, things sure look different from the NGO side of the fence. The NGOs I have encountered seem to have plenty of professionals onboard, they just need money to do their jobs. Volunteers are always valued if their particular skillset is needed, and such help is invaluable. But often, people without strtegically useful knowledge can become somewhat of a burden to many nonprofits by taking staff time (aka staff salary aka money) to manage and guide the volunteers. Nonprofits seem to want people\u2019s money more than their time.\nCertain nonprofits are very well suited to handle volunteers. Groups that run mentoring or literacy programs for youth need many people without a lot of advanced training. Other groups whose missions necessitate some expertise, however, often find themselves trying to politely ask for money from people who don\u2019t want to be viewed as a dollar sign.\nRegardless of what I think, this won\u2019t change. People are still going to want to help with their hands, not with their wallets. Crafting projects that are useful to the nonprofit and gratifying for the volunteer will strengthen the bond between the two. Both come out a winner, and when the volunteer does have a few spare bucks, a volunteer-friendly organization will be well-positioned to receive a needed donation. Non-governmental organizations must be ready to meet the demand for volunteers to succeed in a model where hands-on volunteering is often a sure way to build a lasting relationship, financial and otherwise.\n"}, {"score": 1176.8253, "uuid": "5809a406-1a20-5bd6-9f37-bd60db49a8da", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0813wb-56-17937", "target_hostname": "educationinnovation.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://educationinnovation.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/07/what-do-you-think-you-hired-your-technology-to-do-.html", "page_rank": 1.1908348e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Education Innovation: What <em>Do</em> <em>You</em> <em>Think</em> <em>You</em> &quot;Hired&quot; Your Technology To", "snippet": "<em>You</em> <em>Think</em> <em>You</em> &quot;Hired&quot; Your Technology To <em>Do</em>?", "explanation": null, "document": "What Do You Think You \"Hired\" Your Technology To Do?\nEducational technology and milkshakes have something in common.\nMacDonald\u2019s, wanting to increase the sales of their milkshakes, hired researchers to help them figure the characteristics the customers seemed to care about.

You may have a certain notion of what the technology can do and how it will be utilized. You will \u201chire\u201d technology for one job, but don\u2019t be surprised if the students themselves \u201chire\u201d it for something else.\nFor example, you want to give your student access to the web to look up information and learn information literacy skills. That seems implicit to you. However, your students want to use the web to share information. You wanted them to consume, they wanted to produce and share. You have \u201chired\u201d the web to do a different job than the students have \u201chired\u201d it do.\nYou \u201chired\u201d Google Docs so students could work in small groups in the classroom on projects. Your students \u201chired\u201d Google Docs so they could collaborate with people, including content experts and other students, across the globe.\nYou \u201chired\u201d technology to aide student collaboration is groups of 2-3.

They \u201chired\u201d it to help them produce. You hired the technology to help students connect. They \u201chired\u201d it to comment and critique.\nAs Clay Shirky points out, new tools in new hands, take on new characteristics. In other words, what you \u201chired\u201d technology to do may not be what students or teacher end up \u201chiring\u201d technology to do once it is in their hands.\nBecause sometimes a milkshake is actually breakfast.

Then there are other scholars who hold a destructive and nihilistic view concerning such subjects as continuation, activity, breaking-up, existence, Nirvana, the Path, karma, fruition and Truth. Why? Because they have not attained an intuitive understanding of Truth itself and therefore they have no clear insight into the fundamentals of things. They are like a jar broken into pieces which is no longer able to function as a jar; they are like a burnt seed which is no longer capable of sprouting. But the elements that make up personality and its environment which they regard as subject to change are really incapable of uninterrupted transformations. Their views are based upon erroneous discriminations of the objective world; they are not based upon the true conception.\nAgain, if it is true that something comes out of nothing and there is the rise of the mind-system by reason of the combination of the three effect-producing causes, we could say the same of any non-existing thing: for instance, that a tortoise could grow hair, or sand produce oil. This proposition is of no avail; it ends in affirming nothing. It follows that the deed, work and cause of which they speak is of no use, and so also is their reference to being and non-being. If they argue that there is a combination of the three effect-producing causes, they must do it on the principle of cause and effect, that is, that something comes out of something and not out of nothing. As long as a world of relativity is asserted, there is an ever recurring chain of causation which cannot be denied under any circumstance, therefore we cannot talk of anything\ncoming to an end or of cessation. As long as these scholars remain on their philosophical ground their demonstration must conform to logic and their textbooks, and the memory-habit of erroneous intellection will ever cling to them. To make the matter worse, the simple-minded ones, poisoned by this erroneous view, will declare this incorrect way of thinking taught by the ignorant, to be the same as that presented by the All-knowing One.\nBut the way of instruction presented by the Tathagatas is not based on assertions and refutations by means of words and logic. There are four forms of assertion that can be made concerning things not in existence, namely, assertions made about individual marks that are not in existence; about objects that are not in existence; about a cause that is non-existent; and about philosophical views that are erroneous. By refutation is meant that one, because of ignorance, has not examined properly the error that lies at the base of these assertions.\nThe assertion about individual marks that really have no existence, concerns the distinctive marks as perceived by the eye, ear, nose, etc., as indicating individuality and generality in the elements that make up personality and its external world; and then, taking these marks for reality and getting attached to them, to get into the habit of affirming that things are just so and not otherwise.\nThe assertion about objects that are non-existent is an assertion that rises from attachment to these associated marks of individuality and generality. Objects in themselves are neither in existence nor in non-existence\nand are quite devoid of the alternative of being and non-being, and should only be thought of as one thinks of the horns of a hare, a horse, or a camel, which never existed. Objects are discriminated by the ignorant who are addicted to assertion and negation, because their intelligence has not been acute enough to penetrate into the truth that there is nothing but what is seen of the mind itself.\nThe assertion of a cause that is non-existent assumes the causeless birth of the first element of the mind-system which later on comes to have only a maya-like non-existence. That is to say, there are philosophers who assert that an originally un-born mind-system begins to function under the conditions of eye, form, light and memory, which functioning goes on for a time and then ceases. This is an example of a cause that is non-existent.\nThe assertion of philosophical views concerning the elements that make up personality and its environing world that are non-existent, assume the existence of an ego, a being, a soul, a living being, a \"nourisher,\" or a spirit. This is an example of philosophical views that are not true. It is this combination of discrimination of imaginary marks of individuality, grouping them and giving them a name and becoming attached to them as objects, by reason of habit-energy that has been accumulating since beginningless time, that one builds up erroneous views whose only basis is false-imagination. For this reason Bodhisattvas should avoid all discussions relating to assertions and negations whose only basis is words and logic.\nWord-discrimination goes on by the coordination of\nbrain, chest, nose, throat, palate, lips, tongue, teeth and lips. Words are neither different nor not-different from discrimination. Words rise from discrimination as their cause; if words were different from discrimination they could not have discrimination for their cause; then again, if words are not different, they could not carry and express meaning. Words, therefore, are produced by causation and are mutually conditioning and shifting and, just like things, are subject to birth and destruction.\nThere are four kinds of word discrimination, all of which are to be avoided because they are alike unreal. First there are the words indicating individual marks which rise from discriminating forms and signs as being real in themselves and, then, becoming attached to them. There are memory-words which rise from the unreal surroundings which come before the mind when it recalls some previous experience. Then there are words growing out of attachment to the erroneous distinctions and speculations of the mental processes. And finally, there are words growing out of inherited prejudices as seeds of habit-energy have accumulated since beginningless time, or which had their origin in some long forgotten clinging to false-imagination and erroneous speculations.\nThen there are words where there are no corresponding objects, as for instance, the hare's horns, a barren woman's child, etc.--there are no such things but we have the words, just the same. Words are an artificial creation; there are Buddha-lands where there are no words. In some Buddha-lands ideas are indicated by looking steadily, in others by gestures, in\nstill others by a frown, by a movement of the eyes, by laughing, by yawning, by the clearing of the throat, or by trembling. For instance, in the Buddha-land of the Tathagata Samantabhadra, Bodhisattvas, by a dhyana transcending words and ideas, attain the recognition of all things as un-born and they, also, experience various most excellent Samadhis that transcend words. Even in this world such specialised beings as ants and bees carry on their activities very well without recourse to words. No, Mahamati, the validity of things is independent of the validity of words.\nMoreover, there are other things that belong to words, namely, the syllable-body of words, the name-body of words, and the sentence-body of words. By. syllable-body is meant that by which words and sentences are set up or indicated: there is a reason for some syllables, some are mnemonic, and some are chosen arbitrarily. By name-body is meant the object depending upon which a name-word obtains its significance, or in other words, name-body is the \"substance\" of a name-word. By sentence-body is meant the completion of the meaning by expressing the word more fully in a sentence. The name for this sentence-body is suggested by the footprints left in the road by elephants, horses, people, deer, cattle, goats, etc. But neither words nor sentences can exactly express meanings, for words are only sweet sounds that are arbitrarily chosen to represent things, they are not the things themselves, which in turn are only manifestations of mind. Discrimination of meaning is based upon the false-imagination that these sweet sounds which we call words and which are dependent upon whatever\nsubjects they are supposed to stand for, and which subjects are supposed to be self-existent, all of which is based on error. Disciples should be on their guard against the seductions of words and sentences and their illusive meanings, for by them the ignorant and the dull-witted become entangled and helpless as an elephant floundering about in the deep mud.\nWords and sentences are produced by the law of causation and are mutually conditioning,--they cannot express highest Reality. Moreover, in highest Reality there are no differentiations to be discriminated and there is nothing to be predicated in regard to it. Highest Reality is an exalted state of bliss, it is not a state of word-discrimination and it cannot be entered into by mere statements concerning it. The Tathagatas have a better way of teaching, namely, through self-realisation of Noble Wisdom.\nMAHAMATI ASKED the Blessed One: Pray tell us about the causation of all things whereby I and other Bodhisattvas may see into the nature of causation and may no more discriminate it as to the gradual or simultaneous rising of all things?\nThe Blessed One replied: There are two factors of causation by reason of which all things come into seeming existence:--external and internal factors. The external factors are a lump of clay, a stick, a wheel, a thread, water, a worker, and his labor, the combination of all of which produces a jar. As with a jar which is made from a lump of clay, or a piece of cloth made\nfrom thread, or matting made from fragrant grass, or a sprout growing out of a seed, or fresh butter made from sour milk by a man churning it; so it is with all things which appear one after another in continuous succession. As regards the inner factors of causation, they are of such kinds as ignorance, desire, purpose, all of which enter into the idea of causation. Born of these two factors there is the manifestation of personality and the individual things that make up its environment, but they are not individual and distinctive things: they are only so discriminated by the ignorant.\nCausation may be divided into six elements: indifference-cause, dependence-cause, possibility-cause, agency-cause, objectivity-cause, manifesting-cause. Indifference-cause means that if there is no discrimination present, there is no power of combination present and so no combination takes place, or if present there is dissolution. Dependence-cause means that the elements must be present. Possibility-cause means that when a cause is to become effective there must be a suitable meeting of conditions both internal and external. Agency-cause means that there must be a principle vested with supreme authority like a sovereign king present and asserting itself. Objectivity-cause means that to be a part of the objective world the mind-system must be in existence and must be keeping up its continuous activity. Manifesting-cause means that as the discriminating faculty of the mind-system becomes busy individual marks will be revealed as forms are revealed by the light of a lamp.\nAll causes are thus seen to be the outcome of discrimination carried on by the ignorant and simple-minded,\nand there is, therefore, no such thing as gradual or simultaneous rising of existence. If such a thing as the gradual rising of existence is asserted, it can be disproved by showing that there is no basic substance to hold the individual signs together which makes a gradual rising impossible. If simultaneous rising of existence is asserted, there would be no distinction between cause and effect and there will be nothing to characterise a cause as such. While a child is not yet born, the term father has no significance. Logicians argue that there is that which is born and that which gives birth by the mutual functioning of such causal factors as cause, substance, continuity, acceleration, etc., and so they conclude that there is a gradual rising of existence; but this gradual rising does not obtain except by reason of attachment to the notion of self-nature.\nWhen ideas of body, property and abode are seen, discriminated and cherished in what after all is nothing but what is conceived by the mind itself, an external world is perceived under the aspects of individuality and generality which, however, are not realities, and, therefore, neither a gradual nor a simultaneous rising of things is possible. It is only when the mind-system comes into activity and discriminates the manifestations of mind that existence can be said to come into view. For these reasons, Mahamati, you must get rid of notions of gradation and simultaneity in the combination of causal activities.\nMAHAMATI SAID: Blessed One, To what kind of discrimination and to what kind of thoughts should the term, false-imagination, be applied?\nThe Blessed One replied: So long as people do not understand the true nature of the objective world, they fall into the dualistic view of things. They imagine the multiplicity of external objects to be real and become attached to them and are nourished by their habit-energy. Because of this a system of mentation--mind and what belongs to it--is discriminated and is thought of as real; this leads to the assertion of an ego-soul and its belongings, and thus the mind-system goes on functioning. Depending upon and attaching itself to the dualistic habit of mind, they accept the views of the philosophers founded upon these erroneous distinctions, of being and non-being, existence and non-existence, and there evolves what we call, false-imaginations.\nBut, Mahamati, discrimination does not evolve nor is it put away because, when all that is seen is truly recognised to be nothing but the manifestation of mind, how can discrimination as regards being and non-being evolve? It is for the sake of the ignorant who are addicted to the discrimination of the multiplicity of things which are of their own mind, that it is said by me that discrimination takes its rise owing to attachment to the aspect of multiplicity which is characteristic of objects. How otherwise can the ignorant and simple-minded recognize that there is nothing but what is seen of the mind itself, and how otherwise can they gain an insight into the true nature of mind and be able to free themselves from wrong conceptions of\ncause and effect? How otherwise can they gain a clear conception of the Bodhisattva stages, and attain a \"turning-about\" in the deepest seat of their consciousness, and finally attain an inner self-realisation of Noble Wisdom which transcends the five Dharmas, the three Self-natures, and the whole idea of a discriminated Reality? For this reason is it said by me that discrimination takes its rise from the mind becoming attached to the multiplicities of things which in themselves are not real, and that emancipation comes from thoroughly understanding the meaning of Reality as it truly is.\nFalse-imaginations rise from the consideration of appearances: things are discriminated as to form, signs and shape; as to having color, warmth, humidity, motility or rigidity. False-imagination consists in becoming attached to these appearances and their names. By attachment to objects is meant, the getting attached to inner and outer things as if they were real. By attachment to names is meant, the recognition in these inner and outer things of the characteristic marks of individuation and generality, and to regard them as definitely belonging to the names of the objects.\nFalse-imagination teaches that because all things are bound up with causes and conditions of habit-energy that has been accumulating since beginningless time by not recognising that the external world is of mind itself, all things are comprehensible under the aspects of individuality and generality. By reason of clinging to these false-imaginations there is multitudinousness of appearances which are imagined to be\nreal but which are only imaginary. To illustrate: when a magician depending on grass, wood, shrubs and creepers, exercises his art, many shapes and beings take form that are only magically created; sometimes they even make figures that have bodies and that move and act like human beings; they are variously and fancifully discriminated but there is no reality in them; everyone but children and the simple-minded know that they are not real. Likewise based upon the notion of relativity false-imagination perceives a variety of appearances which the discriminating mind proceeds to objectify and name and become attached to, and memory and habit-energy perpetuate. Here is all that is necessary to constitute the self-nature of false-imagination.\nThe various features of false-imagination can be distinguished as follows: as regards words, meaning, individual marks, property, self-nature, cause, philosophical views, reasoning, birth, no-birth, dependence, bondage and emancipation. Discrimination of words is the becoming attached to various sounds carrying familiar meanings. Discrimination of meaning comes when one imagines that words rise depending upon whatever subjects they express, and which subjects are regarded as self-existent. Discrimination of individual marks is to imagine that whatever is denoted in words concerning the multiplicities of individual marks (which in themselves are like a mirage) is true, and clinging tenaciously to them, to discriminate all things according to such categories as, warmth, fluidity, motility, and solidity. Discrimination of property\nis to desire a state of wealth, such as gold, silver, and various precious stories.\nDiscrimination of self-nature is to make discriminations according to the views of the philosophers in reference to the self-nature of all things which they imagine and stoutly maintain to be true, saying: \"This is just what it is and it cannot be otherwise.\" Discrimination of cause is to distinguish the notion of causation in reference to being and non-being and to imagine that there are such things as \"cause-signs.\" Discrimination of philosophical views means considering different views relating to the notions of being and nonbeing, oneness and otherness, bothness and not-bothness, existence and non-existence, all of which are erroneous, and becoming attached to particular views. Discrimination of reasoning means the teaching whose reasoning is based on the grasping of the notion of an ego-substance and what belongs to it. Discrimination of birth means getting attached to the notion that things come into existence and pass out of existence according to causation. Discrimination of no-birth is to see that causeless substances which were not, come into existence by reason of causation. Discrimination of dependence means the mutual dependence of gold and the filament made of it. Discrimination of bondage and imagination is like imagining that there is something bound because of something binding, as in the case of a man who ties a knot and loosens one.\nThese are the various features of false-imagination to which all the ignorant and simple-minded cling. Those attached to the notion of relativity are attached to the notion of the multitudinousness of things which\narises from false-imagination. It is like seeing varieties of objects depending upon maya, but these varieties thus revealing themselves are discriminated by the ignorant as something other than maya itself, according to their way of thinking. Now the truth is, maya and varieties of objects are neither different nor not different; if they were different, varieties of objects would not have maya for their characteristic; if they are not different there would be no distinction between them. But as there is a distinction these two--maya and varieties of objects-are neither different nor not-different, for the very good reason: they are one thing.\nMAHAMATI SAID to the Blessed One: Is error an entity or not? The Blessed One replied: Error has no character in it making for attachment; if error had such a character no liberation would be possible from its attachment to existence, and the chain of origination would only be understood in the sense of creation as upheld by the philosophers. Error is like maya, also, and as maya is incapable from producing other maya, so error in itself cannot produce error; it is discrimination and attachment that produce evil thoughts and faults. Moreover, maya has no power of discrimination in itself; it only rises when invoked by the charm of the magician. Error has in itself no habit-energy; habit-energy only rises from discrimination and attachment. Error in itself has no faults; faults are due to the confused discriminations fondly cherished by the ignorant concerning the ego-soul\nand its mind. The wise have nothing to do either with maya or error.\nMaya, however, is not an unreality because it only has the appearance of reality; all things have the nature of maya. It is not because all things are imagined and clung to because of the multitudinous of individual signs, that they are like maya; it is because they are alike unreal and as quickly appearing and disappearing. Being attached to erroneous thoughts they confuse and contradict themselves and others. As they do not clearly grasp the fact that the world is no more than mind itself, they imagine and cling to causation, work, birth and individual signs, and their thoughts are characterised by error and false-imaginations. The teaching that all things are characterised by the self-nature of maya and a dream is meant to make the ignorant and simple-minded cast aside the idea of self-nature in anything.\nFalse-imagination teaches that such things as light and shade, long and short, black and white are different and are to be discriminated; but they are not independent of each other; they are only different aspects of the same thing, they are terms of relation not of reality. Conditions of existence are not of a mutually exclusive character; in essence things are not two but one. Even Nirvana and Samsara's world of life and death are aspects of the same thing, for there is no Nirvana except where is Samasara, and no Samsara except where is Nirvana. All duality is falsely imagined.\nMahamati, you and all the Bodhisattvas should discipline yourselves in the realisation and patient acceptance\nof the truths of the emptiness, un-bornness, no self-natureness, and the non-duality of all things. This teaching is found in all the sutras of all the Buddhas and is presented to meet the varied dispositions of all beings, but it is not the Truth itself. These teachings are only a finger pointing toward Noble Wisdom. They are like a mirage with its springs of water which the deer take to be real and chase after. So with the teachings in all the sutras: They are intended for the consideration and guidance of the discriminating minds of all people, but they are not the Truth itself, which can only be self-realised within one's deepest consciousness.\nMahamati, you and all the Bodhisattvas must seek for this inner self-realisation of Noble Wisdom, and be not captivated by word-teaching.\nNavigate through the articles\n"}, {"score": 1164.5665, "uuid": "c1af2d8f-0fe8-50cc-9b7e-6def1a53ff08", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-33-14590", "target_hostname": "www.pj-thompson.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pj-thompson.com/blog/?m=201103", "page_rank": 1.297381e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "2011 March \u00bb <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Dead", "snippet": "<em>Do</em> <em>you</em>\u2026?", "explanation": null, "document": "No Comments\nThis isn\u2019t as grand a mystery as some I have blogged about, but it is a personal one.\nMy stepdad, Tom, the former Marine, used to work as a house painter. One day he came home from a job in one of the ritzier neighborhoods\u2014Hollywood Hills? Beverly Hills? Brentwood? Bel Air? I can\u2019t remember anymore, as this was many years ago now (the early 90s). Anyway, the people who lived in the house where he was working as a sub-contractor were chucking out a bunch of stuff to remodel. He came home with an enormous cabinet loaded on his truck. This cabinet was about four or five feet wide, about six or seven feet long, and divided in the middle, but it only stood about three or four feet high. It had a lovely blond wood finish. The drawers were deep but very shallow, making it resemble one of those for holding maps. It was totally cool and I totally loved it.\n\u201cI thought it might be good for holding all your art and crafts stuff,\u201d Dad told me. He was incredibly thoughtful like that. \u201cDo you want it?\u201d\nOf course I wanted it. So he and a buddy unloaded it from the truck. (It weighed a ton and a half, btw.) As they tilted it to get it through the door, I noticed someone had written across the unfinished bottom, \u201cKubrick\u201d\u2014like a maker\u2019s mark to help identify who the thing was meant for.\n\u201cWow, where did this come from?\u201d\n\u201cThat house I\u2019ve been working at.\u201d\n\u201cIs it Stanley Kubrick\u2019s house, by any chance?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to ask the main contractor.\u201d\nI was very excited at the thought of having something that might have belonged to Stanley Kubrick, one of my favorite directors. I knew he\u2019d lived in London for many years, and I thought he was originally from New York, but I wondered if there might be some L.A. connection. I thought the drawers would be a great size for film canisters or VHS tapes or some such. Dad duly asked the contractor and came back with disappointing news. \u201cIt\u2019s not Stanley Kubrick. I think he said it was some guy named Leonard Kubrick. He might be his brother or something, and I think he\u2019s in the movie business, too.\u201d\nDisappointing, but still cool, and still a really great cabinet. I did indeed fill it up with arts and crafts supplies. Sadly, I couldn\u2019t take it with me when I moved from the family manse and my mother felt much less reverence for it than I. To her it was a gigantic, unwieldy piece of furniture that always got in the way. She tried numerous times to get me to allow her to give it away, but I wouldn\u2019t, so she had someone move it out to the patio, put the bird cage on it, and there is has remained, sadly abused.\nKubrick\u2019s cabinet, complete with bird droppings\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s brother, Ma! She failed to see the significance, but I told a number of people about it. Some years later I decided to search the IMdb for this Leonard Kubrick. No such guy. In fact, further research also showed me that Stanley Kubrick only a sister, no brother. However, one strange thing emerged from the interdweebs: Kubrick\u2019s father was named Jacques Leonard Kubrick. He died in Los Angeles in 1985. Stanley also lived in Los Angeles for a brief period. One of his daughters (Vivian) was born here.\nThen I watched an absolutely fascinating documentary called Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Boxes which entailed the incredible collection of stuff from Kubrick\u2019s films still stored at his estate in London: mountains and mountains and mountains of cardboard boxes with every imaginable scrap of material from all his films. He never threw anything away, not one photograph or location report or planning session or cocktail napkin. The family and friends didn\u2019t think these boxes should be thrown away so they donated them en masse to the University of the Arts London\u2014an incredible film treasure. Before the archive went off to the U, though, filmmaker Jon Ronson was invited to the estate to go through those boxes and he made the documentary based on what he found, and on interviews with Kubrick\u2019s family, friends, and co-workers. I highly recommend this film, not just for Kubrick fans or film buffs, but for anyone who wants a view inside the mind of creative genius.\nAt one point, Ronson interviewed a gentlemen here in Los Angeles who had been responsible for collecting and reviewing, then storing all of the audition tapes for actors for Full Metal Jacket. Kubrick invited anyone who wanted to submit a tape to do so and there were hundreds and hundreds of them. Stored for years somewhere here in Los Angeles. Yeah, my imagination went there.\nBut really, that\u2019s all I have: imagination and admiration for Kubrick and a mysterious and cool cabinet with Kubrick scrawled across its bottom. For all I know, it could have belonged to Antonia Kubrick, beaded dressmaker; or Fernando Kubrick, herbalist; or Fitzhugh Kubrick, fancy pipe enthusiast. Imagination and speculative thinking, every bit of it. But that\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s a tenuous and threadbare connection to Stanley Kubrick, but it is the only definite one I have.\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s boxes\n"}, {"score": 1149.0394, "uuid": "235c12f4-657d-5d46-a3bf-213b0f0940f9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-35-01155", "target_hostname": "www.pj-thompson.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pj-thompson.com/blog/?m=201107", "page_rank": 1.2973552e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "2011 July \u00bb <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Dead", "snippet": "They <em>do</em>, however, sometimes reflect the views of the Cottingley Fairies.

She\u2019s proven time and again she can\u2019t be trusted not to jump over the wall and go walkabouts\u2014which, we suspect, is how she got lost from her previous owners. She does so love the back yard. She\u2019s quite insistent on going out there, fussing and whining until I relent.\nI always relent, because my dirty little secret is that I go out there as much for myself as her. Min makes a great excuse. I love to to feel the wind in my face, listen to the birds, watch the gloaming slowly overtake the leaves of trees and plants, golden and syrup-rich. It\u2019s serene, one of the few things in my life right now that fills me up rather than takes away.\nSo as I sat in my serene place last night, I thought\u2014mostly in a peaceful way\u2014about letting go of so many layers of things. Letting go of fears, letting go of needless guilt and worry, of giving it up to the inexorable ebb and flow of the universe. Not give up on life, you understand. Still in there, still fighting the good fight, just reconciling myself to the fact that the universe will always have its way in the end, no matter what I or anyone else does. What I needed, what I need, is to give up the illusion of control, to make peace with that.\nWe\u2019re none of us helpless flotsam in the grand old river of the universe. I truly believe things travel along with us, keeping us in the free-flowing stream as long as possible, as much as possible. Little markers of hope and fellow-feeling, sometimes larger things that buffer and stand guard. At times, the smallest things can bring the largest upwelling of hope, allowing us to float free. I don\u2019t know what these things are, where they come from, wouldn\u2019t care to define them in narrow human terms, but they are there as long as we allow them to be. We can\u2019t be protected forever. Nothing can be. Sometimes we\u2019re going to smash into rocks, sometimes we\u2019re going to dip below the surface. Sometimes, when the time has come, we\u2019re going to drown. It\u2019s the nature of the journey. It\u2019s easy to be philosophical about all this when I\u2019m in my serene place. Difficult when I\u2019m having trouble treading water.\nFrom the perspective of my usual chair last night I tried to think of some better way of treading water. I wondered if, along with the illusion of control, I also had an illusion of receiving help along the way. I looked at a patch of ground near the bird bath where a few days ago I\u2019d moved a brick that had been overgrown with moss. I saw a little face, tilted to the side, peering back at me from the fringe of the moss, just before the precipice where the brick had nestled. One little arm was raised as if she swam hard against the pushing tide of moss. I was far enough away to wonder if she might be an optical illusion, a trompe l\u2019oeil composed of bits of leaf matter, blossoms, and hope.\nI got up and drew close. There was a face, and a tiny arm, a small ceramic figurine lodged into the ground. When I pulled her out I saw she was a little fairy maiden, sitting on a leaf, resting one elbow on a thimble while the other, the one she\u2019d been swimming with, rested on air where she\u2019d broken off something. She had quite an Alice in Wonderland quality to her face, but I don\u2019t recall ever owning a piece of garden ceramic with such a whimsical girl. I\u2019d swear she hadn\u2019t been there when I moved the brick. My hand was right there two days ago, but I didn\u2019t remember seeing her. Clearly, she\u2019d nestled amongst the moss a while because she was partly embedded in the soil, leaving a hollow when I pulled her free. The moss had surrounded her as it had the brick. Perhaps I\u2019d been too distracted at the time and hadn\u2019t noticed her, or\u2026\nI looked up at the faces hanging on the garden wall. Flora and Ivy smiled serenely back at me. Green Man looked grumpy, as always, but I wouldn\u2019t absolutely swear there wasn\u2019t a twinkle in his eyes. Probably the gloaming. Magic things always happen in the heavy, rich light of twilight.\nTags:\n"}, {"score": 1139.7842, "uuid": "11c46ac5-ffac-5d63-b6df-fce66713852c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-33-14588", "target_hostname": "www.pj-thompson.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pj-thompson.com/blog/?m=201010", "page_rank": 1.2975455e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "2010 October \u00bb <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Dead", "snippet": "\u201cSince life <em>is</em> short and the world <em>is</em> wide, the sooner <em>you</em> start exploring it the <em>better</em>.

Thanks to thing-thinking, billions of people now live at unprecedentedly-high levels of prosperity, comfort and health. Thing-thinking has transformed the world economically, politically and socially. It has made mankind a geological force in its own right. It is literally changing the face of the earth, including its climate. Its influence is all-pervading: because it has worked.\nNevertheless, thing-think has its limits and dangers. It tends to treat people as if they were things \u0096 mere appendages of organisational machines. It tends to address human problems as if they are engineering challenges, with clear lines of cause and effect lending themselves to elegant, complete, solutions that can be imposed via command and control methods. It tends to measure only things and thing-attributes. In short, think-think is blind to the human factor. It\u0092s this blindness that lies behind today\u0092s big problems and lost opportunities.\nLet's try to be each other's guide to valuing tomorrow's world in time\nTHE LURKER's REFRAIN: WHY BOTHER!\nWhat about your own organisation, or organisations that you deal with a lot? What proportion of peoples\u0092 time, effort and emotional energy is invested \u0096 or squandered \u0096 indulging in and dealing with political activities and emotions which depress productive energy? Is it 10 per cent? 30 per cent? 50% per cent? Or perhaps even more? In our experience, in many organisations it\u0092s at least 30-50 per cent. Which means that the organisation\u0092s overall performance is reduced by at least 30-50 per cent. Which means the potential for improvement is staggeringly enormous.\nWhen push comes to shove, human organisations will discover they can improve their performance by doing two types of thing:\n\u0095 Do amazing, clever things\nmeanigs: knowledge & management\nIt is quite impossible to define a concept using only two words.\nManagement has a latin origin, it has a sense, in portuguese, of \"manejar\" or \"to handle\", this means that we are (in a metaphorical way, of course) manipulating).\nThis word was primarily used for shepherds.\nBy the other hand we have \"Knowledge\" that remits us to a philosophy branch.\nSuch as (greeg philosophers) : sensation,perception,imagination,memory,language,reasoning and intuition; differences between opinion and epistems.\nLater Bacon and Descartes; then Locke and Kant..........\nI support the point of view that there is a misleading use and a misleading understastandings of these two simples words.\nSo, thats is way it is usual and practical, in sciences and others branchs to define the terms we are dealing with.\nI am sure we have it.\nChris Macrae , 16-Feb-05 @ 22:38PM\nkm=trust*(human)being - the way back to revolutionary 2010\nMost western KM will not free itself from thing-think; it will not dare map nor value human relationship systems wholly; nor cannot it while ruled by the compound mathematical errora of current accounting\nthat all people are costs to cut, never an investment; all measures separate...\nI am biassed-perhaps - as the journalist co-authoring our book revaluing governance takes a whole chapter to crucify thing-think dressed up as KM, by the time you have seen the way he bursts that pretence you certainly won't stay unemotional\nLet me instead quote from Meg Wheatley's new book: Finding our way\n\"Current approaches in the west demonstrate that we believe that knowledge is a thing, a material substance that can be produced, measured, catalogued, warehoused, traded and shipped. The language of KM is littered with this \"thing\" thinking. We want to \"capture\" knowledge, to inventory it, to push it or pull it out from people. David Skyrme reports that both in Britain and US a common image of KM is \"decanting the human capital into the structiral capital of the organsiation\". I dont know how this imagery afects you, but I personally dont want to have my head opened, my cork popped, my entire body tilted sideways so thatw hat I know pours out of me into some orgasnaitional vat. The prospect is not what motivates me to notice what I know or share it.\nThese language choices have serious implications. They reveal that we think knowledge is an entity, something that exists independent of person or context, capable of being moved around and manipulated for organisational advantage. We need to abandon this language and more importantly the beliefs it engenders. As we rethink how we handle knowledge in organisations, our most important work is to pay serious attention to what we always want to ingnore: the human dimension\nThink, for a moment, about what you know about knowledge, not from a theoretical or organisational perspective but from your own experience of it. In myself, I notice that knowledge is something I create because I am in relationship -relating to another person, an event, or an idea. Something pulls me outside myself and forces me to react. As I figure out what going on or what something means, I develop interpretations that make sense to me. Knowledge is something I create inside myself through my engagement with the world. Knowledge never exists independently of this process of being in relationship with an event, an idea or another person. This process is true for all of us. Knowledge is created in relationship, inside thinking, refelcting human beings.\nHere we are concerned to reconnect disciplines and banish organisational silos and restore the value of people connecting to deeply systemising context, by using trust as the common bridge and allocating each discipline one other keyword\nso whynot KM = Trust & (Human) Being\nMy views on KM\nKnowledge is ocean; I am confused of KM\u0092s boundaries, subjectivity & objectivity.\nJust wondering, what could be the typical objectives of organization involved in KM and how can we measure the efficiency & effectiveness of KM system. Do we have any benchmark established in this field?\nThanks for your time\n- \"No Child Left Behind\"\n- \"Freedom of information Act\"\nHaving just returned recently from a short break abroad and CNN's blanket coverage of the American election I can honestly say that I am sick to the back teeth with the over-simplification of these terms and the reality that they convey. Being a brit with a rye sense of humour I can see the funny side of these Orwellian terms as I sit here now typing this. Of course if I could process the reality of what they mean for people everyday I'm sure my brain would just melt into some kind of mushy goo. I think each term is misleading in it's own way and you can come to your own conclusion as to why that is or isn't the case for yourself.\nThe one I find particularly distasteful as a manager of knowledge is the freedom of information act. I know that this is another way of packaging a series of processes designed to limit the way in which particularly sensitive information is released into the public domain. In essence, it allows for dissmenation of information through a controlled filter. Control, is of course, necessary in some instances of national security. However must the people who design this terminology wrap up this obvious necessity in language that implies freedom when the reality is that it delivers control?\nChris Macrae , 14-Feb-05 @ 13:19PM\nprofessions\nI love those who can be trusted to live the hippocratic oath , but isn't time we simultaneously campaigned to devalue the addictive ones that don't care a jot?\nAnyone like to co-blog with me here on < a href\" http://devaluation.blogspot.com/\" >devaluation\nchris wcbn007@easynet.co.uk\nOn a lighter note one story: one of the first ever egroups I joined was hosted by a whistleblowing New Zealander - we connected to post where have you spotted professions doing evil.\nThe most unforgetable story, albeit trivial: a widow was suprised but gratified to see so many former colleagues turn up at her husbands funeral - until 3 days later she got a bill.

We suppose that CFOs & managers (as other workers, too) can EXCLUSIVELY act on objective, doubtless evaluation, here on columns&numbers in balance sheets, if not to risk their job and their market standing.\nIn spite of an outstanding demographic change we have a phenomenon called urged early retirement and hiring 30-years-old instead of workers with 30 years of experience.\nThe basis and the evaluation of balance sheets for that is wrong OR knowledge has no value at all OR our assumption to evaluate only objective numbers is a fiction.\n(cp. Shoshana Zuboff: The support economy)\nErich\nChris Macrae , 10-Feb-05 @ 13:59PM\n2 examples of cutting strategy (instead of people)\nHaving had a walk around, I wanted to give you 2 examples of why strategy is more and more the last piece in any management map I believe in rather than the first\nConsider the good folk of makepovertyhistory\nI suggest to you MHP as a network of 200 networks does not have a strategy, it has an open vision that almost any volunteer can plug and play with. That's very different. I've been debating (& scoially networking) of how to get rid of poverty for 21 years ( 1 , 2 , 3 so I can just plug and play with MHP and who knows we might multiply each other's competnecs. I see no reason why not.\nExample 2: I can hear the doubters say, well ok Pro Bono may work like that. pro Business doesn't. Are you sure? My belief is that service business does revolve round identity, that's how it makes the most of humans rather than just machines. The first book to completely write up this leadership view (correct me if I am wrong) was 1994's Built to Last by Collins & Porras. I completely admit this suited me fine since Identity is what I have spent 30 years researching in over 30 countries. So whilst my friends and I were bringing out quite a deep practical book on how you would commune and do now Q&A around your biggest identity, what did the strategy professionals do? They promoted a measure as brand valuation, that only went up if you bought advertising, got bigger not better, and separated image from the reality of identity, and they got accountants to sanctify this in corporate reporting. They split up the identity of human relationship system siloising the promising from the doing (earning and serving the trust). And even when one of them lost everything for valuing itself the same way - let's promise true and fair but do whatever makes money, nobody has repealed this wicked strategy school ruse of utterly wrong brand valuation. And because nobody did that each other intangible has been split assunder from identity and mismeasured. All these folk should on the game of monopoly go to jail, and meanwhile the rest of us need to get rid of being ruled by this compounding mathematical mistake as fast as knowledge can be openly sourced.\nChris Macrae , 10-Feb-05 @ 11:44AM\n2 cents worth\nAnne- regarding your question: it might be best to open it up into what are the 5 most different aspects of KM. I recognise your description as one dimension, though oddly one that goes towards neighbours such as Organisational Learning - nothing odd in that except, the EU does not appear within KM funds to have connected people of that perspective here (well not often , and not singing out from any of the major KM projects unless I have missed one). Over at feb 10 of this thread I have inserted a visual exercise alowing people to choose their own specification of KM (or any discipline concerned with human relationships) http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/136840\nI actually came here to introduce strategy as one of my most misleading words.I was just writing up a response in an elearning module prepared for and with Organisation Design people. Below is a curve ball intended to get people to become at least 1% less certain about streategy being an exact game. The full context of the elarning module for the emrging Organisation Design experts is here . If anyone wants to co-edit a paralle module for KM folk, tell me!\nIs strategy a figment of Harvard's Imagination?\nSome reasons why you shoould consider this question\nIn a class given by Gary Hamel after his 1994 book Competing for the Future (which came out the same year as Collins & Porras Built to Last), you observer asked: Is there something that comes before strategy? Gary pulled out of his pocket a paper called In Search of Passion\nAnyone who has ever looked at how Harvard's Business cases are actually written will find they tell the history as reflected back by a CEO - how we manageed that perfectly. Such is always a reconstruction, it seldom goes into the mkistakes or the we nearly went completely wrong there. To have students study busines cases is jolly good theoretical fiction, never getting near the deepest human issues that actually happened (at least I have looked at hundereds of acses and not seen one told like that)\nNo wonder strategy doesnt map the way Harvard strategists used to captivate audiences with- one professor came out in 2004 with a conference talk which began up to 95% of worklers have no idea how to implenet the strategy.\nStrategy may have been something that did exist before we entered the service economy; but now all the value is in the trust systemisation of people to people relationships- well as organisational psycholgist says: we can define a service market as one where a customer can tell how a boss treats an employee by the way the emlpoyee treats the customer\nposted by macrae.nets @ 3:23 AM\nMisleading phrase or vocabulary with different meanings ?\nSorry to come into the discussion so late.\nThe focus seems to have changed so that we now discuss the knowledge management concept. It this really a misleading phrase? I do not think so. For me KM is central to most human interactions. It is at the same time all what Arturs lists: learning, knowledge, conversations, system thinking, futures...a very complex science- which opens the minds of the people who get involved in it , create understanding and inspiration.\nSo Knowledge management is about behaviour, about joint engagement and commun action - do you agree?\n"}, {"score": 1141.3226, "uuid": "13becfb0-b117-56db-a124-e6d867d68370", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1304wb-14-04129", "target_hostname": "barnabyisright.com", "target_uri": "http://barnabyisright.com/2012/03/11/better-late-than-never-hartchers-conscience-jarred/", "page_rank": 1.2021887e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Better</em> Late <em>Than</em> Never: Hartcher\u2019s Conscience Jarred \u00ab Barnaby <em>Is</em> Right", "snippet": "Tags: andrew forrest, class warfare, clive palmer, gina rinehart, peter hartcher, the monthly, wayne swan 3 Responses to \u201c<em>Better</em> Late <em>Than</em> Never: Hartcher\u2019s Conscience Jarred\u201d The Old and Unimproved Dave March 11, 2012 at 11:39 am # If Tony Abbott was slagging off the miners instead of Wayne Swan, the", "explanation": null, "document": "At last, a journalist from the lamestream media spots the galactic hypocrisy in Wayne Swan\u2019s rants against 3 local miners.\nWithout actually calling it that, of course (emphasis added):\nSwan\u2019s pronouncements strike a jarring note, for three reasons. First, the contemporary playbook for \u201cvested interest\u201d campaigning was written not by the miners but by the unions.\nIt was the ACTU\u2019s campaign against Howard\u2019s Work Choices that established the power of an aggressive third-party thrust into politics. The union movement\u2019s $30 million Your Rights at Work campaign discredited Work Choices, forced the Howard government into retreat and, finally, helped destroy the Coalition government. In the final humiliation, it even contributed to Howard\u2019s loss of his seat of Bennelong. Swan was a beneficiary of this campaign.\nSecond, the miners that Swan demonised are not the miners that successfully emasculated his original mining tax. It was BHP Billiton, Rio and Xstrata that aggressively campaigned against the tax and funded its $22 million worth of lobbying and advertising, and it was Twiggy Forrest who went into private negotiations with Kevin Rudd to try to reach a compromise on the tax.\nIt was the three multinationals that helped discredit the Rudd government, accelerated Rudd\u2019s downfall and forced the Gillard government to come to terms. Yet Swan does not mention these three multinationals in his critique of vested interests. Swan does not criticise the \u201cvested interests\u201d to whom he capitulated but the ones who were shut out of the negotiations. He is, in effect, punishing them for continuing to complain about a special deal to which he would not admit them .\nThe rest of Fairfax political editor Peter Hartcher\u2019s article is well worth reading too.

Through deliberate practice, we grow. The reason pros get good and amateurs don\u2019t is because they don\u2019t do enough of this deliberate practice.\nApparently, the amateurs stay in their \u201ccomfort zone\u201d, doing easy things, and so never grow. The pros, meanwhile, \u201cstretch themselves\u201d, by working effortfully in their \u201cgrowth zone\u201d; leaving their comfort zone makes them stronger, faster, longer, thicker and harder.\nUm\u2026How do I put this politely\u2026\nBollocks.\nOK, \u201cbollocks\u201d is a strong word. It\u2019s just, the thing is that these ideas are well and good in principle, but in practice they only hurt people. In practice, they will not get anyone to independently do what they need to do to reach pwnage. In practice, they boil down to a re-affirmation of a pattern of behavior that I rather prejudicially like to call ASM: \u201cAnglo-Saxon Masochism\u201d ( here we go again ) \u2014 what many often call the \u201cProtestant/Calvinist work ethic\u201d: no pain, no gain, bee arch; suffering breeds character, mofo.\nUnfortunately, in the absence of violence, fear and/or coercion (preferably all three), these ideas aren\u2019t going to help anyone.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: if you have someone there in your life who\u2019s constantly ready and willing to beat, scare or otherwise force you into working, then ASM will be effective. Very effective a few people may die or suffer nervous breakdowns, but we usually just call that \u201cnatural selection\u201d. Many of the very best-regarded sports teams, schools and military organizations use it all the time.\nBut I can\u2019t work like that \u2014 not independently. And I know you can\u2019t, either. And I don\u2019t want to live with fear, violence and coercion. Indeed, as soon as the apparatus of violence/fear/coercion is removed, many (former) sportsmen and soldiers become, well, fat people with lots of funny stories to tell about the good old days. And many former students become, well, fat people who used to know calculus.\nWe who speak English natively \u2014 and are therefore participating in the same wider society \u2014 have probably had some degree of ASM culturally ingrained in us; we\u2019ve been indoctrinated pretty well. That\u2019s why you and I have had so much trouble doing things you otherwise want to do \u2014 like acquire some form of knowledge or skill, or produce some kind of product or performance.\nOK, let\u2019s review. Simplistic cultural generalizations aside, here\u2019s the deal:\nBecause of our training, our default pattern is to use fear, coercion and violence on ourselves.\nThe idea of comfort zone, growth zone and panic zone is probably accurate.\nBut, because of (1), too many of us think our panic zone is our growth zone. Put another way, we suck at measuring the distance between the comfort zone and the growth zone. In fact, it turns outs that the comfort zone and the growth zone are incredibly close together. What you think is your comfort zone is probably your growth zone; sustainable \u201cdeliberate practice\u201d is much easier and much more enjoyable than most people are currently led to believe. Yes, as simple as a cloze deletion or a sentence recognition card is, you are actually learning. In fact, just for kicks I would like to rename the zones, as follows:\nComfort Zone \u2192 Boredom Zone\nGrowth Zone \u2192 Enjoyment Zone (aka The True Comfort Zone)\nPanic Zone \u2192 Panic Zone (aka Pain Zone)\nI don\u2019t like this \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d crap. And we don\u2019t need it. Comfort and growth are not mutually exclusive. Discomfort and growth are not the same thing \u2014 if they were, people with ill-fitting shoes would be the happiest, most successful, most productive in the world\n. Growth feels good. Or, at least, it can. Amateurs don\u2019t fail to get good because they stay in their \u201ccomfort\u201d zone, they fail to get good because either:\nThey stay in their \u201cboredom\u201d zone, and this leads them to put in less time, or\nThey never feel right about spending more time on the activity because it\u2019s so much fun \u2014 I have friends who could be professional writers who actively choose to avoid writing because \u201cit\u2019s fun\u201d, or\nConstant reboiling and three-day monking . They do eventually put in enough time, but it\u2019s dissipated over far too many years to reach \u201c critical mass \u201c. All human skill is depends on memory in some form. Think of this memory as, to mix metaphors, a puddle of radioactive material. We need to add to this puddle faster than decay or evaporation can do away with it.\nAnyway\u2026\nSo, how do we get to that true comfort = enjoyment = growth zone? How do we get so that we\u2019re consistently doing something? I\u2019d give you a complicated formula, but neither you nor I would remember it, and what good is a good idea that you can\u2019t keep in your head, ready to use, right? So here is what I do:\nSet appearance/situational/environmental goals rather than action/completion goals. Rather than setting a goal to do the right thing, set a goal to be in the right place. Set a goal to show up. No more. NO MORE. Don\u2019t get clever. Don\u2019t try to achieve. As soon as you start getting clever and adding stuff, your body will rebel.\nYou don\u2019t have to run tomorrow morning. You just have to have your shoes on and be standing outside. You don\u2019t have to eat healthy food, you just have to have (only) healthy food in your house. Once you\u2019ve fulfilled the situational goal, you can go back inside to eat potato chips (oh, wait\u2026none in the house \u2014 better run to the grocery store to get some) and watch Robot Chicken (oh wait, I only have Japanese versions\u2026) if you want.\nYou may think just \u201cbeing there\u201d, standing outside with your shoes on, doesn\u2019t do anything, and doesn\u2019t achieve anything. And you\u2019re right. But you\u2019re also wrong. Because by being there you have done some incredibly profound scale-tipping \u2014 you have made it easier to do something, than to not do it. You have turned an uphill mountain hike into a playful, downward slide. You are now working with gravity, instead of against it.\nThis is how and why I \u201cexecuted\u201d and continue to execute my Japanese project so well. I never set a goal to even listen to a specific number of hours of Japanese. That\u2019s far too mendokusai. Count? Are you joking? This isn\u2019t effing Sesame Street. I simply set a goal to be in a position/location such that there was Japanese entering my eyes and ears. My goal was to either be in a room where Japanese sounds could be heard, or to have my headphones on and Japanese playing in them (my music player only had Japanese things on it, so this was cake).\nThis is also why it was actually easier for me to go \u201call Japanese\u201d than \u201csome Japanese\u201d \u2014 \u201call Japanese\u201d requires no management overhead whatsoever. The only \u201cmanagement\u201d I did and do was shopping for more Japanese stuff. And we all love getting new stuff\n.\nCan you see the difference?\nSituational/environmental goals are actually very powerful. And people already recognize their negative power; they just don\u2019t realize that they also have positive power. Do you know why your parents didn\u2019t let you hang out with the bad kids? Not because you were actively going to do bad stuff, but because simply being with the bad kids was enough such that the situation would almost inevitably take itself in a bad direction, with or without your intervention and good intentions.\nDon\u2019t work to achieve something. Let the environment do the work for you.\nDon\u2019t do the right thing. Just be in the right place.\nDon\u2019t change yourself. Just change your surroundings. Your surroundings will then change you \u2014 always .\nOK, let\u2019s hit out some more examples:\nBad goal: Do/finish something.\nGood goal: Be where things (really) get done.\nBad goal: Listen to Japanese.\nGood goal: Have (only) Japanese to listen to.\nBad (action) goal: Read Japanese.\nGood (situational) goal: Have (only) Japanese books to read. Every-freaking-where \u2014 bag, bookshelf, bedroom, bathroom, car.\nBad (action) goal: Do SRS reps.\nGood (situational) goal: Have (only) SRS window open.\nBad (action) goal: Go somewhere.\nGood (situational) goal: Be in car. Be outside with shoes on.\nBad (action) goal: Write book.\nGood (situational) goal: Be at desk with writing tools.\nIn short, set up the right system (this does require some effort, but very little \u2014 we have a lot of economic/technological infrastructure that makes this very easy for us), and then let the system\u2019s inertia carry you all the way to your goal. The other cool thing is that you get you get an instant \u201cwin\u201d , you don\u2019t have to wait to get something \u201cright\u201d or \u201cfinished\u201d, to feel good.\nThere are no guarantees in terms of quantity and speed, but \u201c little and often \u201d is more than good enough in most situations. As I always say: no project ever dies of malnutrition, only of complete-and-absolute starvation. Most things fall through not because someone was doing too little, but because he wasn\u2019t doing anything at all. Most people don\u2019t fail at scheduling because of being bad at scheduling, but because they never even look at the schedules they so lovingly made.\nEach of us is like a river. We want to take the proverbial path of least resistance. Trying to use our willpower all the time \u2014 trying to \u201cdo\u201d and \u201cfinish\u201d things \u2014 is like trying to get the cooperation of every molecule in the river at every turn: tiring. By changing our environment, we basically tweak the path in small, simple but significant ways. And then we can go back to being our lazy selves for the remaining ~99% of the time, sliding down a path that we have altered to lead us right where we want to go.\nBe your river-like self . Don\u2019t climb up to Japanese. Slide down into it. Don\u2019t know how? Think something up, try something out. That 1300 grams of meat inside your skull isn\u2019t for decoration and it isn\u2019t for slogging; it\u2019s there for making your life simpler, easier and happier\n.\nIf you identify and take care of the preconditions, then goal achievement can happen as a side-effect, as an afterthought \u2014 as if you weren\u2019t even trying (and, in truth, you won\u2019t be).\nAnyway, that\u2019s my two cents. You guys always give great feedback, so I\u2019m excited to hear your stories and advice\n.\n"}], [{"score": 1131.8573, "uuid": "b3f1addc-2ab5-5bb6-946f-0bae07d1bf0a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-33-14592", "target_hostname": "www.pj-thompson.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pj-thompson.com/blog/?m=201105", "page_rank": 1.2974184e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "2011 May \u00bb <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Dead", "snippet": "<em>You</em> need to find what <em>is</em> genuinely yours to offer the world before <em>you</em> can make it a <em>better</em> place.

I lumber out to where the batteries are kept, rummage until I find the right ones, then shuffle over to the step ladder. If I\u2019d been fully cognizant, I would have gone for the step ladder first and just pulled the old battery out to shut it up, but my mind isn\u2019t really functioning. I climb up, yank the old battery out, put the new one in and the damned thing still peeps several more times, as if giving me one last neener-neener-neener before I can go back to bed.\nI fall back into bed, Min comes out of hiding, and we drift off again, feeling virtuous for accomplishing a mission even in 3 a.m. sleep-bedraggled state.\nUntil 4:35 a.m. When the @##$$%^&&&^!! thing starts peeping again.

I stumble back to the battery stash, get another battery, get back on the step ladder and, see, this is where things go seriously into the hash. I\u2019ve got enough brain cells firing that I remember there\u2019s a certain trickiness to changing the battery on the carbon monoxide monitor. The smoke detectors are easy. You just click the door open and the battery is right there, but pull and prod and poke as much as I can, the CM monitor will not open.\nIt does not cease from peeping though. Fool, I\u2019ve beaten you. Hahahaha. And, btw, neener-neener-neener.\nSo I rip it off the wall. This time I seriously am going to throw it onto the lawn because I know I haven\u2019t got the brain power to deal with the bastard. A tiny bit of adultness still left in the raging plain of blankness that is my mind persuades me to unlock the garage side door and place it on the workbench where I won\u2019t have to listen to it. I go back to bed. When my alarm goes off at 5:45 I hit it several times before I manage to get out of bed. In the shower, when sufficient quantities of water have revived at least some of my higher cognitive abilities, I remember that you don\u2019t open the CM monitor. You slide it up off its track to take it off the wall, flip it over, slide the panel off the back to reveal the battery compartment, and uh\u2026\nIn the sitting room, the closest room in the house to the garage, I can still hear that piercing peep, and when I open the front door it\u2019s screaming like some demon bird to be fed. Min has gone back under the bed. I go outside, make my apologies to the monitor, and change its battery. The peeping ceases. I now have two monitors which will have to be reattached to the wall, and while I\u2019m at it, I think I\u2019ll change the batteries in the other smoke detectors. Just in case.\nYou know, they encourage us to use the battery operated detectors rather than the hardwired ones because if there\u2019s a fire in your electrical system, they\u2019ll never go off and you\u2019ll die a horrible death.

The area is now part of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, a breathtaking natural wonder, but few people knew the old man lay there. Blowing sand had quickly covered up his remains and his possessions. His body was rediscovered by hikers in late 2007 and Bureau of Land Management anthropologists were called in to study the bones. The BLM nicknamed him Escalante Man. He carried a musket, percussion caps, polished stones, a horn, human molars from a young adult, and a large brass bucket fitted with a handle and chain bearing a patent date of December 15, 1866.\nThe old man, probably in his sixties, had rotting teeth and arthritic bones and may have just been overcome by weariness and disease when he died. The fact is, we don\u2019t know. The FBI, you see, took control of the excavation, declaring it a crime scene and excluding archaeologists from its April 16, 2008 excavation. They also excluded state officials and the local Indian tribes. A BLM archaeologist, Matt Zweifel, complained about it and was ordered by higher ups in BLM to cease and desist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing investigation. Our policy is we cannot comment on it,\u201d FBI spokesman Juan Becerra said at the time, stating that they had good reasons to keep the archaeologist away from the dig. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office also signed off on the investigation. Their refusal to talk to archaeologists or the public about this didn\u2019t prevent them from inviting a KUTV news crew to come by and have a look. They filed an upbeat news story about it showing the FBI in a favorable light. That news story isn\u2019t up at KUTV\u2019s archive anymore, but you can read the whole text here.\nTo this date, as far as I can determine, the FBI has never stated why they turned this into a crime scene investigation and circumvented state and federal laws regarding the treatment of the remains of Native Americans. The story got much play in 2008 and was taken up by a number of forums, had some fantastical speculation, then died as stories often do. I haven\u2019t found any references to it past 2008. For me, the most sensible answer as to why the Feds behaved as they did came from Ichneumon on the Darwin Central forum:\n[I]t\u2019s possible that something in the Escalante Man find matches details of some old but still remembered crime, or that there are signs he was murdered in a still significant way, or had on him bills or objects from a high-profile old crime, or was a prominent historical figure, etc. Maybe there are signs he died of an infectious disease that could still be virulent and the CDC is involved. There are lots of somewhat possible reasons for the feds to want to be involved.\nOn the other hand, maybe they just barged in before it was realized how old the body was, and now they\u2019re too embarassed to step back and say, \u201coops, never mind\u201d.\nYep, could be. But I\u2019ll leave you with one more piece of intrigue. Some years ago when I originally poked around about this story, I went to the BLM website\u2019s \u201cEnvironment Notification Bulletin Board.\u201d I found this entry and for some reason I decided to take a screen capture:\nIf you can\u2019t see the entire entry, click on the picture and it will take you to Photobucket and show the whole thing.\nThe dates shown on the right hand side of this fall under the labels of Last Updated and Created. I think it\u2019s interesting that the protesting BLM guy was quietly reburying bones at the end of the year when this controversy blew up. But what I find more intriguing is a recent re-visit to this BLM site. The entry shown above is no longer listed on the bulletin board, completely gone from the records as far as I can determine.\nMaybe they pulled the entry because it was old\u2014although I\u2019ve found things on the bb going back to 2006. Maybe I typed it in wrong\u2014all of the several times I searched for it. Maybe it\u2019s all a coincidence and the above entry has nothing to do with Escalante Man. Maybe. Maybe even probably. Maybe.\nTags:\n"}, {"score": 1111.1465, "uuid": "5c4095d4-00ff-5fbb-bf26-356d27d30995", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-35-01149", "target_hostname": "www.pj-thompson.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pj-thompson.com/blog/?m=201005", "page_rank": 1.2340544e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "2010 May \u00bb <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Dead", "snippet": "It wasn\u2019t all that hard, just a lot of prep work up front, but no more <em>than</em> if <em>you</em> made this in a crock pot.

", "explanation": null, "document": "No Comments\nI was reading Carl Jung\u2019s sort-of autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections yesterday. I like it because it isn\u2019t a typical autobiography\u2014Jung abhorred the very idea of writing one.\u00a0 It is exactly what the title states: a collection of memories, dreams, and reflections that went to the formation of the person Jung became.\u00a0 He wanted to peal back the layers of himself to see where his Self came from.\u00a0 There are many strange and memorable passages.\nIn yesterday\u2019s memorable passage, he was discussing his teenage years and an elaborate fantasy he used to entertain himself with on walks to and from school, a kind of alternate reality where all of the Alsace was one giant lake:\nThere would be a hill of rock rising out of the lake, connected by a narrow isthmus to the mainland, cut through by a broad canal with a wooden bridge over it, leading to a gate flanked by towers and opening into a little medieval city built on the surrounding slopes.\u00a0 On the rock stood a well-fortified castle with a tall keep, a watchtower.\u00a0 This was my house.\nHe goes on to describe a rather neat and spare little tower, with small but comfortable rooms, weaponry, canons, men-at-arms, and a great library \u201cwhere you could find everything worth knowing.\u201d\nThe nerve center and raison d\u2019\u00eatre of this whole arrangement, he goes on to say, was the secret of the keep, which I alone knew\u2026.Inside the tower, extending from the battlements to the vaulted cellar, was a copper column of heavy wire cable as thick as a man\u2019s arm, which ramified at the top into the finest branches, like the crown of a tree or\u2014better still\u2014like a taproot with all its tiny rootlets turned upside down and reaching into the air.\u00a0 From the air they drew a certain inconceivable something which was conducted down the copper column into the cellar.\u00a0 Here I had an equally inconceivable apparatus, a kind of laboratory in which I made gold out of the mysterious substance which the copper roots drew from the air\u2026.One was not supposed to look into it too closely, nor ask what kind of substance was extracted from the air\u2026.What the roots absorbed and transmitted to the copper trunk was a kind of spiritual essence which became visible down in the cellar as finished gold coins.\u00a0 This was certainly no mere conjuring trick, but a venerable and vitally important secret of nature which had come to me I know not how and which I had to conceal not only from the council of elders but, in a sense, also from myself.\nThis reminds me of Yggdrasil, the Norse Tree of Life, which Jung possibly had rattling around in his Germanic subconscious, but I like his actualization of the concept. I couldn\u2019t help thinking what a terrific idea this was, that perhaps I should \u201csteal\u201d it (with full and proper attribution, of course) and adapt it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not much of a high-fantasist, alas, and I\u2019ve become somewhat disenchanted with steampunk, so I don\u2019t really know what I am these days, except perhaps the crock at the end of the rainbow, sans the gold.\nJung goes on to say, This highly enjoyable occupation lasted for several months before I got sick of it.\u00a0 Then I found the fantasy silly and ridiculous.\nAh, I thought.\u00a0 Mid-novel ennui.\u00a0 I know that well enough.\u00a0 If any of you would like to \u201cadapt\u201d this idea yourselves, please remember to pay homage to Carl Jung\u2019s imagination.\nThere are many images of Yggdrasil, but I like the one below best, done by one of the students at Emerson Waldorf School, Chapel Hill, NC.\nTags:\n"}, {"score": 1130.9177, "uuid": "1c8a29e5-4f34-5a61-9626-699097cf0f99", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1104wb-11-12277", "target_hostname": "ngimagination.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://ngimagination.wordpress.com/category/imagination/", "page_rank": 2.672841e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Imagination</em> \u00ab Non-Governmental <em>Imagination</em>", "snippet": "The downside <em>is</em> that <em>you</em> can\u2019t customize the buttons at all, and let\u2019s face it, celebrities\u2019 faces tend to be more attractive <em>than</em> the ChipIn logo.

Recently, thanks to an email from one of the founders, I became aware of SearchKindly .\nTo recap previous posts about GoodSearch and GoodTree (the comments are a great read and have lots of interesting perspectives, including a response from GoodTree\u2019s founder ), GoodSearch lets you pick a charity and search either in your browser\u2019s searchbar or on their site. Your search donates one cent to your charity of choice and you get Yahoo search results. GoodTree gives you the same search functionality, except that your choice of charity is limited to 50 or so large NGOs and instead of Yahoo seach results you get that of Infospace, a public company with an ugly history that creates private label search engines. While those are big negatives, you can create your own personalized homepage, which you can\u2019t with GoodSearch. Both are for-profit companies that donate 50% of their revenue to the charities specified.\nSearchKindly is similar to the other two in that it allows you to direct someone else\u2019s money to charities via searching. Unlike the others, however, SearchKindly is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization that says it donates 100% of its revenue to charity. Instead of Yahoo or Infospace results , you get Google search results, which I regard as top notch.\nThe catch is that their money comes from banner ads on the cluttered SearchKindly site. The charity of the month (picked by the founders from user suggestions) gets about 1/3 of a cent from each page view of the SearchKindly site, and nothing from the search results themselves. When you search through the downloadable SearchKindly browser searchbar and press enter, it takes you to the SearchKindly site, where you have to wait for the ads to load and press enter again to get to your search results.\nThey certainly have an interesting idea. Google search is the best, and the fact that GoodSearch and GoodTree didn\u2019t have Google search powering their sites is a big downside for them. And you certainly can\u2019t argue with 100% of revenues going to the charities, even if it seems a little too good to be true (who pays for hosting/bandwidth/coffee?).\nI\u2019m not terribly bothered by the theoretical annoyingness of the SearchKindly ads. The more advertisers they can draw there to give money to charities, the better.\nBut waiting for the Flash ads to load so I can press enter the second time to get to the results is surprisingly bothersome. It\u2019s just a couple of seconds, but it seems much longer. I\u2019ve gotten spoiled on instantaneous search, and by making me wait until the ads load, the site reminds me of The Hunger Site .\nI like The Hunger Site, and I should go there every day, but I don\u2019t. I like to feel that I\u2019m helping the world by my actions, not by my patience, and while searching seems to be an active part of my life, visiting websites for the express purpose of being advertised to does not sound appealing.\nI want SearchKindly to thrive. It has the best search results and zero overhead. I want them to keep striving and innovating. If their ads loaded as automatically as lower-paying text ads, I\u2019d be a humongous SearchKindly supporter. As it stands now I\u2019m pretty ambivalent about all three offerings. I have SearchKindly\u2019s searchbar in my browser right now, and I\u2019m going to give it a few weeks to see if I get used to the waiting and clicking twice. Although GoodTree and (especially) Goodsearch have built up name recognition by going live earlier, there is little barrier to changing search providers, so maybe SearchKindly will gain a footing.\nFrom a business perspective, it will be interesting to see how SearchKindly does in comparison to GoodSearch and GoodTree. Per use, SearchKindly generates only 1/3 as much money to charity as the other two. So for it to become a major player in the charity search field, people have to find their service three times as useful as the others. And by \u201ctheir service\u201d I mean Google. So are Google search results worh three times as much to people as Yahoo\u2019s or Infospace\u2019s? Or do people even notice a difference? I do, and I\u2019m going with SearchKindly, at least for now.\nFrom a philosophical perspective, these are similar groups doing similar things. One is a nonprofit, the other two are for-profit, social entrepreneurial activities. Both have their pros and cons, and it will be interesting to see if one of the two revenue-distribution models gives a clear advantage to any party.\n"}], [{"score": 1110.6672, "uuid": "c886b86b-8092-5803-b6e6-2a0a0945c07f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0204wb-14-11425", "target_hostname": "www.insurancenetworking.com", "target_uri": "http://www.insurancenetworking.com/blogs/insurance_technology_IT_departments_projects_vendors_SaaS_BPO-26369-1.html", "page_rank": 1.3519216e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Is</em> Your IT as Good as <em>You</em> <em>Think</em> It <em>Is</em>?", "snippet": "<em>You</em> can no longer delude yourself into thinking <em>you</em> can <em>do</em> IT solutions (soup-to-nuts) <em>better</em> <em>than</em> any SaaS vendor, especially into today\u2019s market where utilization, agility, speed to market and lower TCO are key business drivers.", "explanation": null, "document": "Benjamin Moreland\nInsurance Experts' Forum, November 18, 2010\nDuring a recent interview with a senior-level leader within a large P&C insurer responsible for their outsourcing efforts, he made the comment that they plan to increase their use of BPO and explore SaaS solutions. However, he then went on to state that the biggest hurdle that they face in using SaaS is they don't really know how good they are to be able to compare if any vendor can do a better job than they can. This struck me as very on target, and reflects the state of many insurers, although most will not admit it.\nI\u2019ve worked in IT for over 25 years with some very large and distinguished companies, as well as smaller, not-so-well-known ones. In each case, I was fortunate to work with some very qualified and intelligent people. In most cases, we usually believed that \u201cour\u201d IT team could do the job better than anyone else. This is a great attitude to have from a team perspective, and fitting to some degree for companies at the time. However, this can no longer be acceptable with the maturation of BPO and SaaS. You can no longer delude yourself into thinking you can do IT solutions (soup-to-nuts) better than any SaaS vendor, especially into today\u2019s market where utilization, agility, speed to market and lower TCO are key business drivers. An insurer\u2019s IT team may know the business and their IT systems better than anyone, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they can support business solutions going forward better than anyone else.\nI\u2019m not suggesting that BPO and SaaS vendors can always support insurance applications more effectively and efficiently than an insurer\u2019s IT support staff, but insurers have to begin determining how well they actually perform to be able to decide if a SaaS or BPO vendor is a better long-term solution. It would be like creating a baseball team that does nothing but practice and play games among themselves and believe that they have the best team around.\nWithin most sports, the metrics to compare already exist. They do not exist within most IT development and support staff today. What is your current support level for your current applications? How much control do you really have over your applications and infrastructure? How secure is your data today? These are valid concerns stated by insurers today with respect to BPO and SaaS, but they should be the same questions insurers are asking of themselves.\nBPO and SaaS are beginning to mature in the insurance space. The economy and competitive forces will drive these solutions forward. Those insurers that know how well they do IT today and can compare their own capabilities to potential vendors will be the ones that are able to make the smart choices with respect to what to outsource and what to keep in house. Those that do not will be the \u201clessons learned\u201d stories over the next several years.

Books have been written identifying these characters, but most agree that the four creatures represent the totality of creation wrapped inside the existence of the Father.\u00a0 Their role that has been played out since the beginning of time is one that identifies and protects the holiness of the Father.\u00a0 The twenty four elders have put themselves is a posture of constant submission towards who God is.\u00a0 They represent those who have passed through the salvific efforts of God into a new reality.\u00a0 These are heavenly creatures, full of the knowledge of the divine, but do not have an earthly home.\nThe interesting part of this reading is found in vs. 4, with the antiphonal response of the heavenly creatures; Amen, Hallelujah.\u00a0 Glossed, this is con temporarily translated as \"we agree, Praise the Lord\".\u00a0 These are two words that are heard in church often, and are part of the Christian\u00a0 vocabulary that many people might take for granted.\u00a0 But there is deep meaning in this response.\u00a0 G.K. Beale notes this response as a \u201cformal expression of ratification\u201d(7) by the creatures.\u00a0 These words are the endorsements of the truth spoken by Christ\u2019s church.\u00a0 The creatures of heaven and operating in agreement with the redeemed church.\u00a0 The creatures, since they are holy beings, understand the function of the incarnation as rescue, and the activity of God recovering His world.\u00a0 It is a \u201creckless indiscrimination\u201d(8), salvation as the action and the very make-up of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nGod is also doing this with us, enlisting us in the saving action, by our entry into the kingdom through the sacraments.(9)\u00a0 We understand our Eucharist as a \u201cTransporting Feast\u201d, as Charles Wesley wrote, bringing us into a timeless reality of action with God.(10)\u00a0 The sacraments are the best vehicle of participation, a vehicle that God provided.\nBut what does this antiphon have to do with us today?\u00a0 Does it hold some sort of secret regarding our salvation?\u00a0 Gleaning contemporary meanings out of Revelation without diverting off into crackpot prophecy is a skill that is not practiced well by many church leaders.\u00a0 I think that our answer lies in the liturgical and textual analysis of v.4.\u00a0 Why are the heavenly creatures agreeing with the words of the redeemed?\u00a0 To think that the church holds more understanding of God than the creatures that have surrounded him in heaven for eons is bold.\u00a0 But to reference Dons Scotus again, the incarnation is a fundamental action that would have happened regardless of the fall.\u00a0 Christ came not because of sin, but because God desired a complete union with humanity that could only be finally realized by grace.\u00a0 This does not discount what Christ did regarding sin, or say that Adam and Eve were not truly perfect, but that the fundamental attribute of God is salvific.\u00a0 The creatures that have been responsible for naming and protecting the holiness of God are agreeing because as a saved people, we understand the things of God better than they do.\u00a0 The heavenly creatures can understand the idea of grace, but they can never understand it as an action because they haven\u2019t received it.\nThis makes salvation not about perfection, but a deep holy love and desire for relationship.\u00a0 Sacrifice for the sake of salvation is in the very being of God.\u00a0 The twenty four elders and living creatures were saying to the redeemed, \u201cThis is now your song to sing, because of grace and that you now know God in a way we cannot.\u00a0 While me may understand the complexities of his holiness, you understand him through the radical, sacramental power of grace.\u201d\u00a0 This provides a very Wesleyan way to look at the eschaton, as fulfillment that is couched in the marriage supper of the lamb.\u00a0 As humans we look towards this privilege with expectation.\nSacramental Vision today\nAt the heart of our sacramental vision is memory, the anamnesis, the constant active memory of the Church.\u00a0 We use our memory to locate ourselves not in the plight of postmodernity, but in the story of God.\u00a0 It orients us towards a narrative that is built out of rescue, renaming, and bringing the lowly to places of Holy prestige. It gives us coherence, meaning and a frame of reference that is built in the creator of the world.\u00a0 Because of this we \u201care not trapped and confined in the present moment but can locate it as the invention of temporal processes and actions, which gives us the wherewithal to transcend the limitations to which the here and now restrict us\u201d.(11)\u00a0 We do know what has happened before us and we know the design of the world.\u00a0 In participation with anamnesis is prolepsis, the active engaging of the future.\u00a0 We know that our world is on a timeline, and that it is originated with the divine.\u00a0 Placing our worship in the language of eschaton allows us to give service to this idea that is able to stay away from the language of revenge and judgement.\u00a0 We know that these things will happen, but that more is written regarding how humanity will be eternally positioned in relation to God.\u00a0 The liturgical Sanctus of the church is a recognition of how creation and end are in relation towards one another, and that end does not mean a final point, but a reconfiguration.\u00a0 Schmemann says \u201cThis is the ultimate purpose of all that exists, the end, the goal and the fulfillment,because this is the beginning, the principle of Creation.\u201d(12)\nWhen we worship, we place ourselves on this timeline.\u00a0 We shift back towards renewal, and again think that our sacramental actions are a reality and sign of our communion with God. The baptismal waters and the Lords table re-members us back into humanities proper place with God.\u00a0 But unlike Adam and Eve, we live knowing the radical sacramental powers of grace.\u00a0 Worship ceases to become a spiritual filling station and returns to the chief story of the Church.\u00a0 An ancient-future practice both grounds us and thrusts us towards the Trinity.\nThe Church\u2019s mission as an eschatological oriented people is one that understands we do have a storyteller.\u00a0 We tell of what happens when we will all know more about the story than ever imagined.\u00a0 Our Eucharist is the time in which we taste an appetizer of the anticipated heavenly reality.\u00a0 We are in between memory and hope, and we look forward to the time in which we will be able to do the things of heaven best; because we have a savior standing like a slain lamb that has brought us a redemption steeped with the grace that God gives his restored people.\n6 Authors own translation\n7 G.K.Beale The Book of Revelation (Eerdmans,1999) pg 929\n8 Eugene Peterson Reversed Thunder (Harper & Row, 1988) pg 153\n9 Ibid 166\n10 Daniel B Stevick The Altar\u2019s Fire (Epworth, 2004) pg 129\n11 Barry Harvey Can These Bones Live?

Then yesterday, lizziebelle posted an eery story that prompted me to get on with it.\nThis all started months ago. I was driving home from work southbound on Pacific Avenue in Venice. It\u2019s the last major north-south street before the beach. Past Venice Blvd. there\u2019s a long stretch with no cross streets, just alley entrances on the western (beach) side, all bearing names like \u201c28th Place.\u201d Pedestrians on this western side have to walk on the actual street because the houses and apartments crowd right up to the street edge, and parking is tight. Usually the traffic moves swiftly, people rushing to the Marina Peninsula or Washington Blvd. Sometimes when there\u2019s good beach weather, the traffic slows to a crawl, but even then it usually keeps moving. However, one night some months back it got seriously backed up, so much so that I actually had to come to a stop and sat there for several minutes.\nNow, there is one piece of property along the western side which doesn\u2019t have structures at street\u2019s edge. One place, a series of ancient, dark-colored joined cottages, is recessed back from the street with a dirt lot for parking cars along Pacific. The lot is also crowded on the southern side by old trees. As it happens, this odd-man-out piece of property is the one I stopped beside. I did what one does when sitting in traffic, looked around and registered things I usually speed by, and as I turned my head west I saw that I was aligned with a walkway running behind those cottages. It\u2019s was as clear as day back there, though it was evening. A woman sat on the small stoop behind the first cottage, her legs stretched in front of her, elbows resting on knees, head down and staring at the ground between her feet. Such an aura of despondency hovered about her that I kept looking, fascinated. She had dark, wavy hair worn down past her shoulders and a dark, rather shapeless dress. It hit her mid-calf and I saw that her feet and legs were bare. The dress could have belonged to any era from 1920 onward, even further back in time if it actually went to the ground and she\u2019d hitched it up to air our her calves.\nAs I stared and wondered why she was so sad, I guess she sensed me looking. Her head came up suddenly. Our eyes met. I was embarrassed to be caught, but such a look came over her face\u2026 The sorrow remained, but a spark had been added of something like defiance or anger or\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Something old and negative and about me\u2026but I thought not strictly about me, either. I just happened to be there to receive it.\nWell, then I was really embarrassed. She had every right to be angry with me for staring and intruding upon her despondency, so I hunkered my head between my shoulder blades and quickly shifted my eyes back to the road. Thankfully, the traffic moved not long after. I stole another look before passing the property. She still stared my way with\u2026whatever that negative surge was. I thought about her for the rest of the drive home, but\u2014as these things go\u2014promptly forgot about it when I got home and had chores and what all to do. Occasionally as I whizzed by that property each night, I\u2019d think about her fleetingly, getting embarrassed all over again, or puzzled and wondering what had been up with her. I might even have stolen a glance that way, but usually couldn\u2019t make anything out. It was quick, you know? I usually passed that place in seconds, in a hurry to get home.\nThen one night several weeks back, I was maybe not driving as fast, or the traffic slowed (but didn\u2019t stop), or\u2014I\u2019m not sure. This time as I drove by I took a good look towards that walkway. And I realized I couldn\u2019t see it. Not just that it was too dark or that a car stood in the way (there were no cars in the dirt lot), I mean I couldn\u2019t see it. Something blocked it. I was past by the time that registered, and that part of Pacific isn\u2019t friendly to people stopping and backing up. Too much traffic, not enough parking to pull over, and besides, I wanted to get home. I decided that I\u2019d try to remember to give it a better look the next night.\nI\u2019m easily distracted these days and it was actually several days before I looked again. There was definitely a gate blocking the view of the walkway, but it didn\u2019t look like a new gate. I thought, \u201cWell, it must have been open when I stopped here that time.\u201d I hadn\u2019t remembered seeing a gate, but you know, it had to have been there. So the next time I remembered, I slowed down, risking irate honks from the cars behind me, when I got to the place where I\u2019d been stopped before in direct alignment with the walkway. I recognized quite well the angle I\u2019d been looking from.\nRemember those trees on the south side of the dirt lot I mentioned? That night I realized that I not only could not have seen a walkway from that position, I couldn\u2019t even see the gate. To see the gate I had to be ten, fifteen, twenty feet north of there and looking at an angle. There was no visibility of the gate or walkway dead on.\nDead on. Dead on. I looked dead on that night, but I still have no idea how I saw. Or who. Or what.\nTags:\n"}, {"score": 1094.2075, "uuid": "ed2809db-fda9-584e-86d4-68d459743468", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-33-14587", "target_hostname": "www.pj-thompson.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pj-thompson.com/blog/?m=201008", "page_rank": 1.2828604e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "2010 August \u00bb <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Dead", "snippet": "Posted by PJ under human condition, quote of the day, writing \u201cNothing <em>is</em> irrelevant.

I\u2019ve written about it before, but I haven\u2019t practiced this ritual for some years now. Basically, I used to burn my regrets before the stroke of midnight sometime on new year\u2019s eve, and on new year\u2019s day I would release my hope into the world. How did I do this? By writing regrets and hopes on little slips of paper.\nBack when I had a functioning (and real) fireplace, I used to build a nice fire and toss the regrets into it. It was quite satisfying to watch them burn. The burning didn\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d the negative voices that brought up those recriminations and regrets, but at least I left them behind in the old year, turned to ash, forcing them to rise again from their immolation. The ritual was all about facing up to the things I didn\u2019t like about the year and about myself and my behavior. I\u2019m not just talking about \u201cI regret not exercising more\u201d or \u201d I regret not finishing my novel.\u201d Those things made the list, too, but it was important to face myself squarely and list things like, \u201cI regret envying X\u201d or \u201cI regret judging Y\u201d or \u201cI regret the shoddy thing I did to Z.\u201d Although mostly the items on the list were less specific and more general like, \u201cI regret taking things for granted.\u201d Didn\u2019t matter, as long as I took the time to make the list. And seriously? Burning them and thinking about them turn to ash was really quite fun. That\u2019s why I did it for as long as I did.\nAfter I moved from a place with a fireplace, burning these little suckers got more problematic. There was a memorable occasion when I lit bits of paper by candle and dropped them into a glass bowl to burn. After about twenty minutes of that (it\u2019s a lonnnng list) the glass cracked. I\u2019ve also been known to set off smoke detectors, which does rather take the shine off the meditative state I strive for in this ritual. So, like I said, many years since I\u2019ve done this. I could use the fire pit out back, I suppose, but little bits of burning paper have a tendency to go airborne and, seriously, I like my neighbors too much to burn their houses down. Talk about regrets.\nThe other part of this ritual, the hopeful part, got equally problematic with time. I used to go for a drive January 1 to one of the local piers and throw my hopes into the ocean. Some sank, some drifted out to sea, some drifted to shore\u2014but setting them loose into the world was the idea. Of course, I had to do this surreptitiously because throwing things into the ocean is illegal and the fines are pretty stiff. I got to feeling like it wasn\u2019t auspicious to begin the year committing a crime and polluting the ocean, so I stopped doing it. Instead, as I drove around town, I\u2019d take little handfuls of hopes and throw them out the car window to drift in my wake. As liberating as both these rituals felt, I also got to feeling bad about littering other peoples\u2019 neighborhoods and stopped that, too.\nI was thinking yesterday that we have a nice paper shredder that might like to eat up some regrets. Having them chewed to bits is not as effective a metaphor as burning them and reducing them to ash. Not as clean. But I suppose it will do.\nAnd the hopes? Well, I\u2019m going to visualize tucking them into the wings of doves and letting them fly away. It could take many, many doves to cover them all. I don\u2019t want to weigh any one dove down with too much hope. It makes it hard for them to fly free. But fly free they will, come new year\u2019s day.\nHappy New Year, everyone! May all your regrets turn to ash in 2011 and not rise again in 2012. May all your doves fly free with hope and find wonderful places to roost.\nTags:\n"}, {"score": 1102.13, "uuid": "8bfe3463-06ad-5cee-836b-150df638c0aa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800wb-46-15888", "target_hostname": "www.philosophyetc.net", "target_uri": "http://www.philosophyetc.net/2007/07/why-do-you-think-youre-conscious.html", "page_rank": 1.2624287e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Philosophy, et cetera: Why <em>do</em> <em>you</em> <em>think</em> you&#x27;re conscious?", "snippet": "<em>Do</em> <em>you</em> have any kind of explanation for that zombie-behavior?", "explanation": null, "document": "Providing the questions for all of life's answers.\nSaturday, June 30, 2007\nWhy do you think you're conscious?\nIf consciousness is epiphenomenal, then it plays no part in the actual causal explanation of why we believe ourselves to be conscious beings. That seems problematic, or so Peli Grietzer argues in an interesting email [quoted with permission]:\nThere's one aspect of the Zombie argument that I always felt was a tough bullet to bite, though, and I wonder if you have any thoughts: While various non-causal accounts of knowledge can handle the core-analytic kind of epistemological issues about phenomenal beliefs that arise from epiphenomenalism, I often fear that it leaves us with no decent scientific hypotheses as to the evolution of phenomenal beliefs, other than the amazing luck of humans evolving to believe they are not zombies coinciding with humans really not being zombies.\nThe obvious counter-argument is that it's no different than the \"lucky coincidence\" we assume when we reject brain-in-a-vat type sceptical scenarios despite lacking any good probabilistic reasons to do so, but there's a possibly critical difference. At least if our beliefs about the external world are true there is a natural story about how we came to have such beliefs and that story involves the external world, while if epiphenomenalism is true we still have no natural story about how we came to have beliefs about phenomenal consciousness, that [the story] involves phenomenal consciousness.\nThe technical version of the Zombie argument doesn't commit to epiphenomenalism in the same way the more vivid \"zombie world\" way of telling it does, though, so maybe it's more of a problem for epiphenomenalism than for the zombie argument.\nChalmers offers a neat answer : \" The content of a conscious being's direct phenomenal beliefs is partly constituted by underlying phenomenal qualities. A zombie lacks those qualities, so it cannot have a phenomenal belief with the same content.\" For example, my concept of phenomenal 'redness' is grounded in the phenomenal quality of redness that I experience. My Zombie twin talks about 'redness', but in actual fact his concept is empty, ungrounded. So he doesn't mean what I do by the term.\nOn this account, phenomenal qualities (consciousness) can influence what we believe after all. Not causally, of course, but more directly, through constitution. The physical facts alone do not suffice to fix the intentional facts (i.e. what our thoughts are about). Phenomenal properties are part of what it is to have a phenomenal belief -- a belief that's truly \"about\" those very qualities. So, although a zombie would make all the same noises, their words and cognitive processes (arguably not really \"thoughts\") wouldn't have the meaning that ours do.\nSo much for particular phenomenal beliefs like ' this is red'. The original challenge was to explain our general self-attributions of consciousness. Can \"phenomenal properties and the capacity to have them [still] play a crucial role in constituting its content\", as Chalmers suggests? Seems plausible enough; there's nothing in the zombie's mind for his alleged concept of 'consciousness' to latch on to, for example. Surely it must be empty, again. The upshot: if we weren't conscious, we wouldn't believe it after all. Sure, we would still utter things like \"of course I'm conscious!\" -- but they would just be so much meaningless babble.\nSo, zombies are incapable of any positive conception of consciousness (and thus derivative concepts such as zombiehood). But I can think of a residual problem: what of the even more general claim that physicalism is false (i.e. a minimal physical duplicate of our world is not a full duplicate of our world)? This claim involves no phenomenal concepts, and so presumably can be thought without any need for phenomenal properties -- they aren't constitutive of this belief, at least. But that leaves us with only physical factors to explain why we disbelieve in physicalism! Odd, no?\nThe only way out that I can see is for the epiphenomenalist to adopt the strong position that consciousness grounds all genuine intentionality, so that zombies can't have any real concepts, beliefs, or mean anything at all. This way, even our non-phenomenal beliefs (e.g. about whether physicalism is true) are partly constituted by -- or otherwise depend upon -- phenomenal properties.\n[ Correction: an alternative option has been pointed out to me: the belief against physicalism inherits its epistemic warrant from the phenomenal beliefs from which it is inferred. In case of zombies, there is no such warrant to be transmitted.]\nConsciousness explains why we have the beliefs we do, because without it, we wouldn't have any genuine beliefs at all.\n"}, {"score": 1082.4763, "uuid": "2bb47ed6-d328-5d12-983d-f8edfadaefff", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-45-17240", "target_hostname": "www.metromodemedia.com", "target_uri": "http://www.metromodemedia.com/blogs/posts/brucerosenblat3217.aspx", "page_rank": 1.3652791e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Post 3: Where <em>do</em> <em>you</em> <em>think</em> you&#x27;re going?", "snippet": "<em>You</em> Might <em>Think</em> o Christian Bielski: The Mackinac Policy Conference - &quot;Spring Break&quot;, Or Not?", "explanation": null, "document": "Bruce Rosenblat\nWho can forget the great bailout of banker George Bailey in the classic It's a Wonderful Life?

Detroit's six-county Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had a population of about 4.3 million and a workforce of about 2.1 million. The last accounting also showed that Detroit's urban area had a population of 3.9 million with about 80,500 people working in downtown Detroit, comprising about 21 percent of the city's employment base.\nAnd families and college graduates are leaving.\nThey read how Detroit's unemployment rate of 6.9 percent in April 2008 grew to 11.6 percent in May 2011 and that the city of Detroit's unemployment rate reached 20 percent.\u00a0 They read how thousands of jobs have been lost due to challenges in the auto industry.\u00a0 They read how we are a ghost town waiting for the last saloon doors to swing closed.\nWell, Main Street Bank and I aren't going anywhere.\nI say take a look at these facts:\nMichigan ranks fourth nationally in high-tech employment with 568,000 high-tech workers.\nMetropolitan Detroit has propelled Michigan's national ranking in emerging technology fields such as life sciences, information technology, and advanced manufacturing. In 2010, the Detroit area became the fastest growing region in the U.S. for high technology jobs. A report by Silicon Valley based TechNet group found Michigan to be the leading state for stimulating demand for broadband technology.\nMichigan has ranked as high as second nationally in new corporate facilities and expansions. Among metro areas with more than one million people, Metro Detroit has ranked as high as 4th in new corporate facilities.\nMetropolitan Detroit has one of the nation's largest office markets with 147,880,000 square feet, including the 5,500,000 sq\u00a0ft Renaissance Center, the 2,200,000 sq\u00a0ft Southfield Town Center, and the 1,395,000 sq\u00a0ft Cadillac Place joined with the 487,000 sq\u00a0ft Fisher Building.\nMetropolitan Detroit ranks among the nation's top five financial districts, housing Quicken Loans, Ally Financial, Ford Motor Credit Company, Chrysler Financial, Bank of America, Comerica, PNC Financial Services, Fifth Third Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Deloitte Touche, KPMG, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Virchow Krause-Baker Tilly International, and Raymond James.\nThe metro area is home to high-tech business incubators such as the Michigan Security Network, a consortium that coordinates business growth of cyber security, bio-defense, and border security sectors.\nMetropolitan Detroit is the nation's number one exporting region and busiest commercial port. The Ambassador Bridge is the busiest commercial border crossing in North America, carrying 27 percent of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada. Tourism in metropolitan Detroit is an important economic factor, comprising nine percent of the area's two million jobs.

Detroit's six-county Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had a population of about 4.3 million and a workforce of about 2.1 million. The last accounting also showed that Detroit's urban area had a population of 3.9 million with about 80,500 people working in downtown Detroit, comprising about 21 percent of the city's employment base.\nAnd families and college graduates are leaving.\nThey read how Detroit's unemployment rate of 6.9 percent in April 2008 grew to 11.6 percent in May 2011 and that the city of Detroit's unemployment rate reached 20 percent.\u00a0 They read how thousands of jobs have been lost due to challenges in the auto industry.\u00a0 They read how we are a ghost town waiting for the last saloon doors to swing closed.\nWell, Main Street Bank and I aren't going anywhere.\nI say take a look at these facts:\nMichigan ranks fourth nationally in high-tech employment with 568,000 high-tech workers.\nMetropolitan Detroit has propelled Michigan's national ranking in emerging technology fields such as life sciences, information technology, and advanced manufacturing. In 2010, the Detroit area became the fastest growing region in the U.S. for high technology jobs. A report by Silicon Valley based TechNet group found Michigan to be the leading state for stimulating demand for broadband technology.\nMichigan has ranked as high as second nationally in new corporate facilities and expansions. Among metro areas with more than one million people, Metro Detroit has ranked as high as 4th in new corporate facilities.\nMetropolitan Detroit has one of the nation's largest office markets with 147,880,000 square feet, including the 5,500,000 sq\u00a0ft Renaissance Center, the 2,200,000 sq\u00a0ft Southfield Town Center, and the 1,395,000 sq\u00a0ft Cadillac Place joined with the 487,000 sq\u00a0ft Fisher Building.\nMetropolitan Detroit ranks among the nation's top five financial districts, housing Quicken Loans, Ally Financial, Ford Motor Credit Company, Chrysler Financial, Bank of America, Comerica, PNC Financial Services, Fifth Third Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Deloitte Touche, KPMG, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Virchow Krause-Baker Tilly International, and Raymond James.\nThe metro area is home to high-tech business incubators such as the Michigan Security Network, a consortium that coordinates business growth of cyber security, bio-defense, and border security sectors.\nMetropolitan Detroit is the nation's number one exporting region and busiest commercial port. The Ambassador Bridge is the busiest commercial border crossing in North America, carrying 27 percent of the total trade between the U.S. and Canada. Tourism in metropolitan Detroit is an important economic factor, comprising nine percent of the area's two million jobs.

I wish I could give him badges for all of these things!\nWhat are badges? First, a badge is a recognized visual (physical or virtual) device or ornament or (heaven forbid!) piece of jewelry that typically designates in its design the symbol, insignia, colors, or name of the organization conferring it. That's important. That is, the very design of the badge acknolwedges the issuing body or community that has, collectively, agreed upon what counts as the minimum requirement for the badge.\nSecond, there is some equally visual symbolic representation of the knowledge, skill, goal, or feat for which the badge denotes mastery, accomplishment, service, or authority (such as when taking an oath to become a fire fighter).\nThird, the badge has to be accepted by a larger community as a legitimization of that which it represents. It stands in as the end result of a longer, hidden institutional process. A badge is a means of identification with the issuing organization, a conferal of some kind of status (as having met the requirements of that organization or of being employed by them). Badges can be used as advertisement or for branding too, but that is a bit different than what the Girl Scouts give out. We know \"legitimization\" is one implicit part of badging because, of course, the system is susceptible to parody or misappropriation (in researching girl scout badges I wandered into the whole world of porn badges . . . big surprise, that!) Or, for a hilarious treat:\u00a0 \"WE DON'T NEED NO STINKIN BADGES\": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqomZQMZQCQ\nFourth, the badge has to not just credentialize or certify learning but should also motivate it. By organizing a set of skills and interests (such as Tim's multimedia talents) into an actual, definable, measurable skill capable of assessment and judgment, badges inspire students to greater mastery. A hobby becomes definable as an intellectual, creative asset, something to be tended, improved, honed, perfected, advanced, and innovated. As with a game challenge, attainment becomes the floor not the end point, it becomes a step on a way towards even greater mastery. The badge inspires a certain form of learning by naming it and honoring it.\nNow let's go back to Tim. If I had established a badge system in \"This Is Your Brain on the Internet,\" I might well have had the class help me design the badge and then might have also worked with them to develop community standards or even a community certification group for deciding who had achieved badges in what area. Tim might have left the class with (a) a grade for the class; (b) a visual badge on his website that someone could click on and then find out all the various things Tim did to earn that badge in my class; and (c) several lines on his resume. That's something we'll work on the last day of class, thinking about the skills students learned in this unique, peer-driven class that one doesn't usually learn in a normal, hierarchical class where the teacher has the questions and the students write the best answers on the final exam.\nBadges are useful for certifying complex processes or skills that are not comprehended in our traditional grading systems.\u00a0 Think about what those are. According to most employers, the skills we do not grade are often the ones most important to future success in the work place. What we do not grade--interpersonal skills, collaborative skills, imagination, innovative, initiative, independence--are most of the things employers most want in future employees. At present, education, including higher education, doesn't have a system for measuring or counting those things. That's why a number of\u00a0 us have begun to investigate badging. And why the Mozilla Foundation is pioneering an Open Badge Project. Want to know more? Check it out here: http://openmatt.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/badges-in-the-real-world/\nAnd, in the meantime, I'm hoping to give Tim the Firestarter Multimedia Expert Badge . . . he's not only exemplifying his skills. Today, he is coming into my other class, \"Twenty-First Century Literacies,\" to work with the other students on perfecting their own video and multimedia editing and presentation skills.\nWhy do badges work better than grades? Obviously they don't in all situations. For over a hundred years grades have represented or summarized a teacher's estimation of the worth of a student as quantified by a series of tests, often of the item-response variety (invented in 1914). Badges are simply another way, a more flexible way, of certifying a range of skills that our machine-age multiple choice mode of testing doesn't fully comprehend but that are crucial to the ways we live, work, and learn.\nLogin or register to post comments\nbjoseph 1 year 1 week ago\nMore learning badge examples\nCathy, Great post!

China. David Hoffman is editor of Evolutionary Blues (P. O. Box 40187, San Francisco, CA 94140, $6 per copy), a peace journal where this interview first appeared (volume two). The interview is reprinted with permission.\nDavid: WHERE DO YOU SEE the arms race going?\nRobert: I was running around the track one sunny day, and I saw right behind me, connected to my own feet, my shadow. No matter how fast I ran, my shadow kept up with me, and it occurred to me that that was the metaphor for the arms race - a race with one's own shadow. No matter how fast you go, the other guy's going to keep up with you and stay connected with you; in fact, he's part of you. He is the projection of your body on the ground. No one will win the arms race, nor will anyone drop out. We can never outdistance the fear of those parts of ourselves that we have projected on others: Americans on Russians, Jews on Arabs, Protestants on Catholics, Whites on Blacks. Making the bomb the issue and disarmament the goal shields us only briefly from the realization that it is we ourselves - we human beings - that are the source of the danger.\nDavid: What implications does this have for dealing with the arms race?\nRobert: Since the arms race is a race with our fear, we are going to have to deal with it on a psychological as well as a technical level. A real change can't be had in human affairs by focusing exclusively on the technology, the weapons themselves. In addition, we must understand why it is we are afraid of our \"shadow.\" What is the origin of the fear of \"the other,\" and how can we deal with it? Why do we project on other people and societies qualities we have within ourselves, and then maintain that they are the bad guys and we the good? They are, of course, doing the same thing with us. Yet in our heart of hearts, we all know that it is only together that we constitute a whole. So I look at the arms race, and war itself, not in terms of a technical fix or some clever treaty that would reduce the number of weapons, which ultimately will be required, but rather at a different level having to do with the relationships among, and the psychologies of, peoples.\nDavid: Could you give an example of this projection in US-Soviet relations?\nRobert: The Russians are our shadow. We project on them what we fear in ourselves and they project on us what they fear in themselves. The Soviet's paramount social values have to do with providing a sufficiency for everyone, with some rough ideal of material equality; so they guarantee housing and education and medical care and safety in the streets. Our ideals have less to do with the substance of equality and more to do with the process of individual realization - with freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and so on.\nEach side feels vulnerable when attacked for falling short of its principles. For example, when we were criticized for denying Blacks the vote twenty years ago, we felt embarrassed and exposed. Similarly, the Russians squirm when instances of privilege are pointed out. Neither society yet lives up to its own ideals, and each projects on the other its own failures to do so and denounces it accordingly. At the same time, however, each society struggles to incorporate as much of the other's central values as it dares (the Russians, our freedoms; and we, their equity) without compromising its own primary commitment.\nDavid: But saying that we're each other's shadow doesn't mean we are any less of a real threat to each other, does it?\nRobert: Certainly not. The Soviets threaten us precisely because they're afraid of us. The threat isn't so much that they're sitting there hoping to conquer our land: they couldn't govern it if they had it - nor we theirs. The greatest threat derives from the fear they have of us and we of them, and we're afraid of them partly because we know that they're afraid of us. There's nothing more dangerous than a scared bear - or a scared eagle, for that matter. Somehow we've got to interrupt this cycle of fearing each other to get at the problem, which is probably a more useful formulation than saying that we have to establish trust. Trust is one of the last things to develop, even in a personal relationship between two people. It comes only after years of intimacy, and it is never borne directly out of conflict.\nDavid: So how do we break this spiral?\nRobert: Well, not by focusing on disarmament. There's almost no chance that nations are going to disarm willingly in the near term. We must recognize that fear of the other society is the most dangerous thing, and take conscious steps to reduce this mutual anxiety. For example, the confidence-building agreements we have with the Soviets giving each other advance notice of missile firings and troop exercises are good ways to avoid arousing certain sudden apprehensions. The only real safety lies not in getting rid of one or another type of weapon - it lies in inoculating ourselves against acting upon fear.\nDavid: This represents rather a major shift, historically speaking, doesn't it?\nRobert: Absolutely. Throughout human history it has been thought that to be stronger was to be safer, to be feared was to be more secure. Nuclear weapons change this: henceforth, to be feared is to be in jeopardy. By instilling fear in others, you diminish your own safety.\nThe only viable strategy that remains, given the presence of these weapons, lies in accepting parity, and eventually in mutually scaling back. We've got to stop trying, with one more technological thrust, to be number one again. That scares the other side more than anything, and it doesn't work. Your shadow keeps up with you.\nDavid: What does this have to say about the policy of deterrence?\nRobert: It suggests the existence of a hidden but deadly flaw in this policy, for deterrence is a strategy based upon fear. The subject is more subtle than we've realized. We've taken it for granted that it is the fear of retaliation that has been deterring aggression. I'm beginning to question that. Such fear does not deter my 4-year-old son from initiating fights with his 6-year-old brother - fights he knows he'll lose. Perhaps it is actually something other than fear of retaliation (or the absence of such fear) that deters (or releases) aggression. And perhaps the induced fear on which deterrent strategy is based actually constitutes a hidden threat to the safety that deterrence is supposed to provide.\nUltimately, to feel safer, we shall have to attend directly and explicitly to the safety of others. The ancient ethical prescriptions, common to all religions, become self- enforcing in a nuclear world.\nDavid: Some of this is not so different in a personal relationship, is it?\nRobert: No, it's not. In fact, the analogy is an instructive one. You can usually get to a place in a personal relationship where the expression of anger is permitted - it's something the human animal seems to need. You do this with the understanding that it's just something that occurs, and then you let go of it - you don't hang on to it because to do so sours the relationship. Since apparently there is something necessary about expressing anger, we need to create within society channels for doing it which aren't lethal. Athletics, of course, is one realm where on occasion you can express a certain amount of anger and even violence and have it dissipate into the world and do negligible harm. We also need to learn which particular escalations of that impulse to violence finally get out of hand and produce uncontrolled spasms of mutual destruction. For in international relations we are now capable of the ultimate nuclear spasm; it has been called \"omnicide\".\nDavid: So the fact of nuclear energy is forcing us to examine our tendency to violence?\nRobert: Yes, and to learn which of its manifestations we can no longer permit if we want to go on living on Earth. We have in the 20th century stolen God's fire for a second time, as it were, although this time the fire doesn't just burn your finger - it destroys your civilization. The ceiling this places over our impuIse to escalate violence is going to force a transformation in the nature of the human animal. There is, therefore, a respect in which we can be thankful that God placed this extraordinary energy down there in the nucleus, and that we have teased it out. The Promethean theft, 40 years ago, of God's nuclear fire is forcing us to reheed His commandments.\nDavid: The problem then isn't just nuclear war. Are you saying that because of the likelihood of escalation, war itself must somehow be eliminated?\nRobert: Yes, that's a necessary conclusion. In my twenties, I studied and worked with some of the physicists who first built nuclear weapons. The knowledge that these weapons work, how they work, and what they can do is lodged within me; and that secret knowledge sits side by side with the \"secret\" that human beings love war, as well as hate it. People fight, and when they do, things can get out of hand; but with nuclear weapons, to let things get \"out of hand\" is to commit suicide. This is more than a \"historical dilemma;\" it's the worst crunch we've ever faced. We're still prone to battle, yet horrified at where it may lead. We must find new channels for our fighting energy or we'll end up with one war too many, if only to let off steam and \"get it over with.\"\nDavid: Do you see any way out of this crunch? Will war always be with us?\nRobert: It's illuminating in approaching a war to look at the histories of some other human scourges such as illiteracy, slavery, and hunger. Let's deal first with illiteracy. A thousand years ago the only persons who knew how to read were priests and the very wealthy, and it was believed at the time that you could not learn to read unless you were close to God, unless you were a priest, or else rich enough to have a tutor. This special knowledge was hoarded and transmitted selectively from elite to elite. Gradually, though, it dawned on people that anyone who went through a certain process could learn to read. Through new institutions for literacy called \"schools,\" and then via universal compulsory education, a great transformation occurred: from the idea that anyone could learn to read, and ultimately to the idea that everyone learn to read and to write.\nThis is a prototypical example of what I call a psychotectonic shift. It is not a shift in genetics or biological evolution; it is a shift of our deepest assumptions about ourselves, a shift in what we take for granted, in what we think we are capable of. A psychotectonic shift is to the realm of moral understanding and human behavior what a paradigm shift is to scientific understanding and behavior. It is a reconceptualization of what it is to be human - a transformation of our \"self-model;\" and it projects a shift in human destiny with a full range of legal, political, economic, social and spiritual consequences.\nDavid: Could you illustrate this concept with another example?\nRobert: A psychotectonic shift with profound implication for mankind was the one surrounding slavery. For thousands of years it was considered a natural thing, if you could manage it, to enslave other people. Sometime about the eighteenth century, in England and in Europe, significant numbers of people began to raise doubts about the justification of one human being owning another. By mid- nineteenth century the issue came to a head in America, and what was still a widespread practice rapidly became totally unacceptable and outlawed. Abraham Lincoln presided over and came to symbolize this shift in people's mind set. As decades followed, instances of slavery around the globe were eradicated, so that now it is essentially non-existent. This does not mean, of course, that all exploitation has ceased. Someday \"wage slavery\" will undergo a similar transformation. In fact, I suspect that in the twenty-first century, leadership will fall to that society which provides the most satisfying work to its citizens of age 14 to 84 (or should it be 4 to 104). By the way, in the course of this, we'll probably have to completely transform our present educational practices; in a phrase, we'll have to design \"a better game than school.\"\nThese shifts in the shape and structure of the world mind are what I am calling \"psychotectonic\" shifts. Winston Churchill said, \"We shape our buildings; then they shape us.\" Just as our architecture shapes physical space, which in turn shapes our movement and behavior, so too there is a \"psychotectonics,\" created by us, that thereafter shapes our thought and action. Psychotectonics is the invisible \"architecture\" of the world moral \"space.\" And although often appearing as given and rigid, it is, in fact, quite malleable. It is we who create it and we who change it. This is the real power of this concept: we begin to take into consciousness, and assume responsibility for, powers we have unknowingly abdicated. An example of a psychotectonic shift being created before our very eyes is the current work of Amnesty International on torture and political imprisonment.\nDavid: What is it that causes psychotectonic shifts to occur?\nRobert: We can transcend a condition like illiteracy or slavery when we can thoroughly imagine and know how to produce another condition that's manifestly preferable. Perhaps it's easiest to see this with regard to hunger, which is a shift we are just now creating. Hunger is a phenomenon that communicates at a very deep level between human beings, so that there is actually a direct pain one experiences when one sees a hungry person. The only way really to rid yourself of this pain is to see the other person fed. The dynamic is something like that of a yawn by another person creating a yawn in you: it happens on a psychological and physiological level; it's an imitative, direct coupling to another person - something similar to, but much stronger than, the \"power of suggestion\".\nNow in the past we have mostly repressed this pain because we didn't know how to alleviate hunger systemically. But now that we do, I think nations will eventually adopt an implicit and explicit policy that human starvation and hunger are simply unacceptable. Actions that cause them, whether foreign or domestic, will be elevated into consciousness and will no longer be tolerated.\nSo to generalize, conditions like slavery, hunger or illiteracy become morally repugnant when we discover ways to discontinue the practices that sustain them. As long as the only way we can see to get a job done is to force another person to do it, we inure ourselves to his or her pain, and consider this a \"normal\" condition. As long as we see no way to get food to hungry people, we repress our true reactions. But when we find a way of dealing with these situations, of alleviating the other person's pain and thus our own, we move quickly to do this.\nWe like to think of new moral ideas as preceding the technical solutions, but widespread moral acceptance may as often follow the technical solutions. It's pointless to speculate on which comes first; they are deeply intertwined, and both the moral and the technological shifts are necessary to move mankind and transform our practice.\nDavid: Does all this suggest then that our job is partly that of the ad man, in a sense \"selling\" the world on ending hunger or making peace?\nRobert: Yes, I think so. If we're actually going to transcend war-making, and to end hunger as we've ended smallpox and slavery, we're going to have to use the skills of the best \"ad men.\" An idea must be good and timely in order to strike a resonance. But the speed at which \"an idea whose time has come\" can go forth into the world and belong to everybody is just dazzling - it moves like a sharp knife through soft butter, taking hold of everyone who is exposed to it. One way in which non-politicians can support political leaders is to hone ideas to the point where, when they are given public expression by a leader, they have that kind of rousing effect. If we want to see the world changed, it's our job to craft the rhetoric so that when it's spoken from a public forum, it moves people towards better goals - towards feeding the world, ending material and educational deprivation, establishing justice and equity, eliminating torture, and bypassing war-making.\nDavid: This calls to mind your attempts to get President Carter to take on the world hunger issue. Would you tell us about that?\nRobert: There were many who urged Carter to tackle the hunger problem, including members of his own family. The sources of my particular effort were manifold. Like many of us I had had images of starving children seared into my soul by television - especially by coverage of the Biafran starvation. In early 1977, as Jimmy Carter took office, I saw a film entitled The Hungry Planet, which simply and clearly detailed the steps necessary to the elimination of hunger in any social system. The technical answers - agricultural, economic and political - were public knowledge.\nCarter had been a farmer. He was clearly a spiritual man. I imagined that he might be willing to give the hunger problem the kind of leadership that Lincoln had given the issue of slavery. He was pushing human rights. What human right could be more basic than the right to eat?\nI had been struck by the way President Kennedy's summons to put a man on the moon and return him safely within the decade had galvanized and focused the nation into producing this result. Of course, putting a man on the moon and ending hunger are goals alike in neither substance nor significance. Yet Kennedy's call had helped make an old dream plausible, feasible, and finally doable. I thought that Carter, recalling the power of that historic summons, and knowing of the recent success of the World Health Organization's global campaign to eradicate smallpox, could provide leadership in the elimination of hunger by the end of the century. He had an opportunity to go down in history as the person who named and orchestrated a World War on hunger, a psychotectonic shift of unparalleled importance in the creation of humane human beings.\nSo, armed with an outline of a plan to end hunger by the end of the century, I began a series of trips to Washington. There were many steps on the way to a meeting with the President, and the openness of leadership to \"an idea whose time has come\" was always astonishing. I began with the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, detoured through a dozen senators and congressmen (including Humphrey and McGovern), met with the Undersecretary of Agriculture, the AID Director, various presidential assistants, Energy \"Czar\" Schlesinger, Budget Director Lance, U.N. Ambassador Young, Vice President Mondale and finally, the President. To all of them I communicated the message that there existed at the present time a historical opportunity to end hunger; that a formal commitment to doing so could now reasonably and responsibly be made; and that the making of such a commitment would in itself help in the realization of the goal. The budget for the program was approximately the same, on an annual basis, as that of the moon program, but extended for two decades instead of one.\nPresident Carter did create a Commission on World Hunger which issued a report confirming and proclaiming the feasibility of actually ending hunger on a world scale. Soon afterwards, his term of office came to an end. The task of mobilizing the will to end hunger on earth remains unfinished. Hunger awaits its Lincoln.\nDavid: Returning to your earlier point about the relationship between technology and morality, if the invention of the cotton gin helped make slavery morally unacceptable and the printing press and schools did the same for illiteracy, what will it be for war? Can we say that the invention of the atomic bomb is the technological innovation that will make war unacceptable?\nRobert: Well, the existence of nuclear weapons creates a situation in which we have a sharp, compelling incentive to examine our war-making tendencies. But such an examination reveals an important difference between the three psychotectonic shifts I've mentioned - having to do with slavery, illiteracy and hunger - and that of eliminating war. The difference stems from the fact that slavery, hunger and illiteracy are conditions that people live under, and that it's possible to imagine another set of conditions that could replace each of them. This alternate set of conditions may be extremely complex and require far-reaching changes in a society, such as in the case of slavery. Nevertheless an alternative can be imagined - dimly at first, then more and more concretely. With respect to hunger, for example, you imagine a world well-fed; you can specifically imagine loaves of bread in every culinary style on every table in the world. And in the case of illiteracy, you imagine a world where everybody reads.\nYou see books - millions of books. You see not just priests holding books with fancy calligraphy, but you see everybody reading, the Bible at first and then other books, printed books! And you imagine schools where reading is taught to all. This is not to say that imagination, although necessary, is also sufficient for transformation, for it leaves the actual work still to be done. But I want to stress that thoroughly imagining an opposite state is a prerequisite for the eradication of unwanted conditions.\nNow the point is that we've been dealing with conditions; but war is an activity. War differs from hunger, illiteracy and slavery because it is something we do, a complex societal activity that we participate in. If you imagine its absence, what you get is nothing; you get a non-activity. We call it peace, but the problem with peace, and the reason it's hard to create a desire for peace except in the immediate aftermath of a war, is that no one can imagine it, or everyone imagines it so very differently. \"Peace\" is not a set of activities that people do. That's why I maintain that the bypassing of war will require the delineation of a set of activities that can serve certain of the purposes that war has served, that provide people with something to do, and can meet the real needs that wars have met in the past.\nDavid: Are you suggesting that peace is actually not a viable goal for the \"Peace Movement\"?\nRobert: Yes I am, exactly. Peace is the absence of a very exciting activity - war. And nobody ever opted for nothing in place of something, especially something exciting. Peace has the connotation of peace and quiet, of serenity, of bliss; and people aren't actually attracted to that very much. It's boring after a while.\nAlso, if you look to see who is in favor of it, it's usually people who are living a privileged life, and who therefore wish to maintain the status quo. People who are experiencing hunger or injustice don't want peace; they are, in fact, willing to make revolutions and wars to secure food and justice. For people who are hungry or afraid, material well-being or security is of more immediate concern than peace.\nSo peace isn't the best way to express the goal of the anti-war movement. And you can't express it as \"antiwar\" either because that's merely \"against.\" We've got to figure out what it is we actually want, and then be for that.\nDavid: Is this the meaning of the question you've posed, \"Is there a better game than War?\"?\nRobert: Yes. And it's meant to be a provocative question, suggesting that war has in fact been an activity that men and women have played and have loved. They have also hated it, but it's crucial if we're ever going to bypass or transcend war-making that we admit our own eternal fascination with the business of it, with the fact that it provides moments of individual exhilaration, camaraderie, nobility, leadership, courage and glory that other human activities seldom match. The horrible side of war is well known and usually focused on, but until we acknowledge our secret attraction to it we're likely to keep on \"doing\" it.\nIn using the word \"game\" I do not mean to suggest that war is in any way frivolous. War is war - an immensely complex, irreducible activity of institutional character involving virtually all facets of society. In addition to provoking the recognition of our attraction to it, referring to war as a game suggests there are roles, moves, transactions, strategies, outcomes, winners and losers - and, most important, that we do have a choice as to whether to keep playing it.\nDavid: I suppose one of the reasons it's difficult to invent a game that is more engaging than war is that in playing war we get to experience vicariously the ultimate sacrifice, the giving of one's life. Denis de Rougemont, in Love In The Western World, saw in the act of dying for the one we love the supreme expression of eros.\nRobert: Yes, we have to acknowledge what genuine purposes wars have served - psychological as well as political. Then we've got to see if we can invent and design and authorize another game, another set of activities which meet those needs which wars have met.\nIncidentally, it's important to realize that the game of ending particular wars is completely different from discovering the game that replaces all war. Peacemakers who have an answer to the question \"What would I do if peace broke out?\" are apt to be more effective in their work.\nAt any rate, in my thinking I've moved past disarmament as a primary strategy and past peace as an immediate goal, and on over to the question of what the activities are which will replace the game of war and meet some of the same needs. We are beginning to design a game that is more fun to participate in than the old war games, or even the inseparably related \"stop-a-war\" games. The game that might be better than both these games is that of Completion - of completing ourselves through each other by incorporating into ourselves the empowering truths that other peoples embody and exemplify. That is really what our work in the Mo Tzu project is about.\nDavid: Would you describe that project and explain what you mean by this \"Mo Tzu\" work?\nRobert: In the fifth century B.C., during the time in Chinese history known as the Warring States period, Mo Tzu and a few of his followers would travel on foot to sites of developing conflict among the various feudal \"states\" and there attempt a kind of diplomatic aikido. If the opposing parties would not agree to sit down together and mediate their dispute, Mo Tzu would join the weaker side, offer training in how to withstand a siege, and then again sue for a negotiated solution. Precisely what his magic consisted of is not known, but his willingness to commit himself personally to a vision of a world without war is a source of inspiration to us.\nThe origins of our current Mo Tzu Project go back, I suppose, to my traveling to Vietnam during the war. I had learned in War and Peace about Pierre going to take a look at the Napoleonic War and how much it affected him to actually see war-making and to see people dying from violence. So I got on a plane and flew into Saigon on a regular tourist visa.\nI was President of Oberlin College at the time, and when I walked into the American Embassy and said I'd come to learn what was happening, they grabbed hold of me, thrilled that someone was there to see for himself. They even provided me with a helicopter and a personal pilot and took me wherever I wanted to go. I traveled all over and saw a lot of people, some grievously wounded and dying of burns, some children who had lost limbs. It engraved in my consciousness what the consequences of this \"glorious\" activity of war actually were to individuals.\nThen in 1978, another formative experience was a trip that my wife and I and our child made to the Soviet Union for a month, traveling by train across the whole continent to Japan, talking with hundreds of people on the way. It was on this trip that I began to see Soviet society as complementary to American.\nMore specifically though, the Mo Tzu idea developed in response to the suggestion that a peace institute be created at the University of California. I started to imagine groups of people who would actually go to the world's trouble-spots, immerse themselves in the situations, learn about them, and then see if there was something that could be done to broker a better relationship amongst the \"partners\" in conflict.\nThere is today a great deal of knowledge and experience regarding the process of negotiation between antagonistic nations. But before this knowledge can be applied to alleviating ongoing tensions and conflicts, there must first exist the sine qua non of successful negotiation: mutual respect, or to put it in Mo Tzu terms the willingness to see one's own culture and a rival one as complementary, as each bearing an aspect of a larger truth, a truth that embraces them both and compromises neither.\nThe peace institute I imagined was one which would focus at that more primary level of trying to build the willingness for diplomacy to work, to lay the groundwork needed before either governmental representatives such as Gromyko or Habib, or professional mediators such as Roger Fisher or John Burton, could bring their specialized skills to bear on the issue.\nThe definition of what among ourselves we call \"Mo Tzuing\" is \"finding what you love in what you hate.\" You might admit that you sometimes hate the Russians, for example, but if you can remember what it is you love within all that and use it as a handle, you can hold your hatred in its proper, subordinate place. Until you know what you love in what you hate, your hatred can assume command value over your behavior. But when you've found what you love and can maintain it as a clear vision, it becomes possible to surround your hatred and get past it. That's \"Mo Tzuing.\" And it applies as much to personal relationships as to relationships between whole cultures, societies, or nations.\nThe minute you find what you love in someone else, you're bigger yourself and stronger; you're more powerful. That will be, I think, the meaning of power in the twenty-first century. It's power that comes from the completion of self, from the incorporation into your behavioral repertoire of the other person's (or culture's) \"secrets\".\nAnd there's an interesting flip side to this: it is finding what you hate (in your \"enemy\") in yourself. For we only hate in others - whether in individuals or whole peoples - what we cannot accept in ourselves.\nDavid: What was the source of this understanding in your own experience?\nRobert: While teaching in a Black ghetto high school in Seattle in 1967, I came to feel that I was somehow incomplete as a person. There was something in these black teenagers, something they embodied, that I was attracted to and wanted to hang around. I noticed also that there was something attractive about me to them, something about me that they wanted to hang around. It was here that I first experienced the notion of the complementarity of cultures, and that's been a central idea for me ever since: that you can make yourself more whole and complete by assimilating the truths borne by other cultures. We need our enemies in order to complete ourselves.\nIt's interesting to trace the first stages of this process. As the sense of threat diminishes, we redesignate our former \"enemies\" as \"adversaries.\" With the first hint of positive mutual value, \"adversaries\" become \"rivals,\" a term which acknowledges each as a secret teacher of the other. Finally \"rivals,\" recognizing their mutual dependency, come to see themselves as \"partners.\"\nCompleteness is also a key concept in mathematics, so it's been with me since my formative intellectual years as a student of science. One learns that a set of things a set of mathematical objects, can be complete or incomplete. If you want to say where something is located, you need three numbers; if you use only two, your knowledge remains incomplete. And if you want to locate an event, you need four numbers - three spatial coordinates plus time. The notion of completeness is central in science and I believe it is central to the present human predicament.\nDavid: So this is how you relate to other cultures now?\nRobert: Yes, in looking at Black, Islamic or Russian culture, I try to identify that aspect of the truth they bear most prominently. Our initial reaction to other people is often negative because we see that they fail to embody something we take as supremely important. Only after getting through this can we appreciate what it is that they have to offer. I don't expect ever to assimilate fully into my perspective the way a Chinese sees the world or landscape, or the way Muslims feel about their friends. But to begin to see what such qualities are, and to square another way of seeing or being with your own so the two are not in contradiction, is the work that the world has urgently to get on with. Otherwise we're going to react out of our initial distaste and annihilate the differences.\nDavid: In a sense we commit a kind of psychic suicide, then, by severing ourselves from other cultures.\nRobert: I think so - by making them wrong, by humiliating them, by invalidating them. They in turn become angry with us. We cut ourselves off from engaging with other cultures and try to crush and expunge our differences instead of celebrating them. We need only reinterpret the old French maxim, \"Vive la Difference,\" to have the best anti- war cry imaginable.\nIn short, the activities that outmode and replace war must deal with incompleteness, whether it be of the body, mind or soul. No one activity embodies all these aspects. Nonetheless, to deal with want in any of its forms is to move towards by-passing war; and conversely, not to deal with want is to court war. We begin to see the outline of another grand human game on the horizon, coaxing us away from the thrills of the battlefield. It is the discovery and completion of one's own self as experienced in one's culture, and one's self as manifested in one's supposed enemy or shadow. This may well be an activity exciting enough and profound enough to supplant war. Completing ourselves is actually what we've always wanted; in fact, it is partly what we've sought for in vain through the cruel instrumentality of war. We now, finally, have the wisdom to get at these nurturing, self-completing truths directly. Hegel expressed this over a century ago:\n\"Each... part lives only by participating in and\neventually giving itself up to the whole... the 'self'\nor identity which is given up, however, is only the\nclaim on the part of a fragment to be the whole,\na truth claiming to be truer than it is...\"\nDavid: What kind of \"warrior\" will be needed for this new game you're proposing?\nRobert: What the world needs now are nonpartisans - people who specialize in introducing different cultures to each other, people who develop the skill to create in antagonistic nations or cultures the capacity to hold in check that ancient familiar impulse to fight. And this involves a philosophical shift in thinking away from dualistic, possessive presuppositions to a more inclusive world-view.\nIn traditional political or economic terms, the focus has been on who has what privilege, what right, what \"stuff,\" what power. Those issues tend to be divisive because the prevailing view, at least in the past, has been \"If I've got something, you don't have it\" or \"If I control this you don't\" - categories of exclusion which make for dispute. But mathematics has taught us about non-zero-sum games. A zero-sum game is one in which my gain exactly equals your loss, whereas a non-zero-sum game is one in which it's possible that we both gain. It's going to become a central value in politics to move past this zero-sum game framework and hold out for that solution in which everybody experiences a win simultaneously.\nDavid: What is the role of television in this work?\nRobert: Television is a revolutionary form of witness that makes us all onlookers. It can be a kind of world conscience. You know how each of us has a voice inside that serves as our moral conscience? Well television is the voice outside us. The images we received of the Biafran starvation and the My Lai massacre changed history.\nBut also, I want to find a way of showing on television the creativity and dignity of different peoples. At first, you don't experience another culture as having dignity; you tend to see a bunch of \"Martians.\" You may experience them as different and wrong-headed, as inefficient and making a lot of foolish errors, because often they are inept in areas where we excel. If they were good at just what we are good at, they would be bad at just what we are bad at. So usually when we come into a culture we notice the ineptness. But eventually we may come to understand that through their \"weaknesses,\" they are in part protecting and preserving their strengths. They are protecting a certain class of insights or a certain truth-seeking strategy that characterizes, even generates, their particular perception. They are protecting that and preserving it at all costs because that is their uniqueness, their essential gift.\nTelevision can be a very powerful tool in communicating this. It is interesting to note that the discovery of the transistor, which led to both television and computers, and the first man-made nuclear reaction occurred within a few years of each other. Used properly, the telecommunications revolution could serve as a technological counterweight to the threats posed by nuclear weapons technology.\nDavid: Do you see television as being able in the future to substitute completely for direct human contact?\nRobert: No, I think first-hand exchange and experience will always be essential. The value of groups like those doing this Mo Tzu work is due less to whatever particular insights they might bring to a situation, than to the consciousness that the mere fact of their presence as witnesses creates in parties to a conflict: namely, that there is a \"view from afar,\" visible to neither party.\nAnother function these groups serve is that of a mirror. And we need first to mirror the value, the truths of a given people, so that security and a sense of compassion will allow them some disidentification with the beliefs which are supporting their involvement in the conflict.\nDavid: Have your initial Mo Tzu efforts been encouraging?\nRobert: As we go about this work we are constantly aware of how small our contribution is relative to the size and seriousness of the problems in which we're immersed. But it's like throwing a stone into a lake: you don't see the water level rise, but you know the stone is sitting at the bottom, so you conclude that the water level must have risen. In our work it's hard to measure the effects, but when we have done well by a situation we feel the water level has risen. In 1982, our little band of travelers went to the Middle East in April, Ireland in May, Poland in October and Kenya in November.\nWe are not representatives of any government or any organization. But people who encounter us realize quickly that we're just as interested in the process and in the outcome as if we were professional diplomats. The human quality of our interest draws people into intense discussions. Our presence is an expression of our view that diplomacy has become too important to ordinary people to be left only to professional diplomats.\nAnd we've noticed that government figures are often more open and forthcoming with us than they could be with either fellow diplomats or journalists. When people realize that we're coming from a nonpartisan place, that our focus is to discover the complementarity in the parties to conflict, they become less righteous, defensive and belligerent. They often join us in looking for at least a theoretical solution - one which would leave both parties with their self-respect and each with a sense that they own a piece of the truth, while glimpsing the possibility of owning a larger truth by incorporating that of the other side.\nDavid: So at this point, do you feel you've really got a better game than war?\nRobert: This Mo Tzu work is exciting, as well as difficult and frustrating. It contains many of the elements of what I've called \"a better game than war.\" Yet in at least one vital respect Mo Tzu work is not adequate as a replacement for war. Mo Tzu work at this point is essentially an individual or a small group activity. But wars are more than individuals engaged in parallel activities. War is a collective activity and as such has been a provider of Myths - unifying overviews of triumph and tragedy in which each individual has a role. If another game can in fact be substituted for war, it will have to meet not only the individual's need for challenge and adventure, but also the collective need for an integrative myth that renders life and lives meaningful.\nDavid: Do you envision any way in which this could happen?\nRobert: For Mo Tzu work to begin to fill this collective need it would have to be multiplied many thousandfold and perhaps be given the status of an Event. Imagine that an agreement were negotiated among the nations of the world to exchange for two years, beginning in say 1985, a million people, going and coming from nation to nation in approximate proportion to population - a mammoth, multinational Peace-on-Earth Corps moving not just from America to developing nations but rather from each country to all the others, focusing on the issue of establishing relationships, and thereby building mutual security. An event on this scale could mark a turning point in human affairs and initiate the needed psychotectonic shift away from war.\nThe people of the earth are in a most dangerous passage. We have only the barest knowledge of each other, after centuries of relative isolation. And a little learning is a dangerous thing. We must move rapidly to reduce the danger, so greatly enhanced by nuclear weapons technology, by learning enough more about each other to overcome the fright of first encounter. Paradoxically, it is technology that makes this awkward passage both necessary and possible.\nThe global event here imagined could be financed with one percent of the world's defense budgets. Such an expenditure would surely enhance the security of individual nations, and that is precisely the purpose of national defense budgets.\nThe age-old mechanism for transcending civil strife - aligning against an external enemy - is no longer workable. There are no external enemies for all mankind to unite against. Thus, we'll have to transcend global civil war not by allying ourselves with former enemies in the face of a new enemy, but by learning enough about our adversaries to establish forbearance for the differences that have, during these first close encounters, so scared and agitated us.\nThe linchpin of forbearance for another people is to identify the truth or value their culture has borne forward through its particular history. And the key to evoking a reciprocal respect is to know the truths exemplified by one's own culture. Both sides must find what they love in what they may at first be inclined to hate. Then, and only then, can two cultures truly meet.\n"}, {"score": 1068.7272, "uuid": "fe1ad544-02d7-5bf6-8c9b-65292d8b0b57", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0003wb-04-33867", "target_hostname": "context.org", "target_uri": "http://context.org/ICLIB/IC04/Fuller.htm", "page_rank": 1.2010022e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Robert Fuller - A <em>Better</em> Game <em>Than</em> War", "snippet": "David: So at this point, <em>do</em> <em>you</em> feel you&#x27;ve really got a <em>better</em> game <em>than</em> war?

China. David Hoffman is editor of Evolutionary Blues (P. O. Box 40187, San Francisco, CA 94140, $6 per copy), a peace journal where this interview first appeared (volume two). The interview is reprinted with permission.\nDavid: WHERE DO YOU SEE the arms race going?\nRobert: I was running around the track one sunny day, and I saw right behind me, connected to my own feet, my shadow. No matter how fast I ran, my shadow kept up with me, and it occurred to me that that was the metaphor for the arms race - a race with one's own shadow. No matter how fast you go, the other guy's going to keep up with you and stay connected with you; in fact, he's part of you. He is the projection of your body on the ground. No one will win the arms race, nor will anyone drop out. We can never outdistance the fear of those parts of ourselves that we have projected on others: Americans on Russians, Jews on Arabs, Protestants on Catholics, Whites on Blacks. Making the bomb the issue and disarmament the goal shields us only briefly from the realization that it is we ourselves - we human beings - that are the source of the danger.\nDavid: What implications does this have for dealing with the arms race?\nRobert: Since the arms race is a race with our fear, we are going to have to deal with it on a psychological as well as a technical level. A real change can't be had in human affairs by focusing exclusively on the technology, the weapons themselves. In addition, we must understand why it is we are afraid of our \"shadow.\" What is the origin of the fear of \"the other,\" and how can we deal with it? Why do we project on other people and societies qualities we have within ourselves, and then maintain that they are the bad guys and we the good? They are, of course, doing the same thing with us. Yet in our heart of hearts, we all know that it is only together that we constitute a whole. So I look at the arms race, and war itself, not in terms of a technical fix or some clever treaty that would reduce the number of weapons, which ultimately will be required, but rather at a different level having to do with the relationships among, and the psychologies of, peoples.\nDavid: Could you give an example of this projection in US-Soviet relations?\nRobert: The Russians are our shadow. We project on them what we fear in ourselves and they project on us what they fear in themselves. The Soviet's paramount social values have to do with providing a sufficiency for everyone, with some rough ideal of material equality; so they guarantee housing and education and medical care and safety in the streets. Our ideals have less to do with the substance of equality and more to do with the process of individual realization - with freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and so on.\nEach side feels vulnerable when attacked for falling short of its principles. For example, when we were criticized for denying Blacks the vote twenty years ago, we felt embarrassed and exposed. Similarly, the Russians squirm when instances of privilege are pointed out. Neither society yet lives up to its own ideals, and each projects on the other its own failures to do so and denounces it accordingly. At the same time, however, each society struggles to incorporate as much of the other's central values as it dares (the Russians, our freedoms; and we, their equity) without compromising its own primary commitment.\nDavid: But saying that we're each other's shadow doesn't mean we are any less of a real threat to each other, does it?\nRobert: Certainly not. The Soviets threaten us precisely because they're afraid of us. The threat isn't so much that they're sitting there hoping to conquer our land: they couldn't govern it if they had it - nor we theirs. The greatest threat derives from the fear they have of us and we of them, and we're afraid of them partly because we know that they're afraid of us. There's nothing more dangerous than a scared bear - or a scared eagle, for that matter. Somehow we've got to interrupt this cycle of fearing each other to get at the problem, which is probably a more useful formulation than saying that we have to establish trust. Trust is one of the last things to develop, even in a personal relationship between two people. It comes only after years of intimacy, and it is never borne directly out of conflict.\nDavid: So how do we break this spiral?\nRobert: Well, not by focusing on disarmament. There's almost no chance that nations are going to disarm willingly in the near term. We must recognize that fear of the other society is the most dangerous thing, and take conscious steps to reduce this mutual anxiety. For example, the confidence-building agreements we have with the Soviets giving each other advance notice of missile firings and troop exercises are good ways to avoid arousing certain sudden apprehensions. The only real safety lies not in getting rid of one or another type of weapon - it lies in inoculating ourselves against acting upon fear.\nDavid: This represents rather a major shift, historically speaking, doesn't it?\nRobert: Absolutely. Throughout human history it has been thought that to be stronger was to be safer, to be feared was to be more secure. Nuclear weapons change this: henceforth, to be feared is to be in jeopardy. By instilling fear in others, you diminish your own safety.\nThe only viable strategy that remains, given the presence of these weapons, lies in accepting parity, and eventually in mutually scaling back. We've got to stop trying, with one more technological thrust, to be number one again. That scares the other side more than anything, and it doesn't work. Your shadow keeps up with you.\nDavid: What does this have to say about the policy of deterrence?\nRobert: It suggests the existence of a hidden but deadly flaw in this policy, for deterrence is a strategy based upon fear. The subject is more subtle than we've realized. We've taken it for granted that it is the fear of retaliation that has been deterring aggression. I'm beginning to question that. Such fear does not deter my 4-year-old son from initiating fights with his 6-year-old brother - fights he knows he'll lose. Perhaps it is actually something other than fear of retaliation (or the absence of such fear) that deters (or releases) aggression. And perhaps the induced fear on which deterrent strategy is based actually constitutes a hidden threat to the safety that deterrence is supposed to provide.\nUltimately, to feel safer, we shall have to attend directly and explicitly to the safety of others. The ancient ethical prescriptions, common to all religions, become self- enforcing in a nuclear world.\nDavid: Some of this is not so different in a personal relationship, is it?\nRobert: No, it's not. In fact, the analogy is an instructive one. You can usually get to a place in a personal relationship where the expression of anger is permitted - it's something the human animal seems to need. You do this with the understanding that it's just something that occurs, and then you let go of it - you don't hang on to it because to do so sours the relationship. Since apparently there is something necessary about expressing anger, we need to create within society channels for doing it which aren't lethal. Athletics, of course, is one realm where on occasion you can express a certain amount of anger and even violence and have it dissipate into the world and do negligible harm. We also need to learn which particular escalations of that impulse to violence finally get out of hand and produce uncontrolled spasms of mutual destruction. For in international relations we are now capable of the ultimate nuclear spasm; it has been called \"omnicide\".\nDavid: So the fact of nuclear energy is forcing us to examine our tendency to violence?\nRobert: Yes, and to learn which of its manifestations we can no longer permit if we want to go on living on Earth. We have in the 20th century stolen God's fire for a second time, as it were, although this time the fire doesn't just burn your finger - it destroys your civilization. The ceiling this places over our impuIse to escalate violence is going to force a transformation in the nature of the human animal. There is, therefore, a respect in which we can be thankful that God placed this extraordinary energy down there in the nucleus, and that we have teased it out. The Promethean theft, 40 years ago, of God's nuclear fire is forcing us to reheed His commandments.\nDavid: The problem then isn't just nuclear war. Are you saying that because of the likelihood of escalation, war itself must somehow be eliminated?\nRobert: Yes, that's a necessary conclusion. In my twenties, I studied and worked with some of the physicists who first built nuclear weapons. The knowledge that these weapons work, how they work, and what they can do is lodged within me; and that secret knowledge sits side by side with the \"secret\" that human beings love war, as well as hate it. People fight, and when they do, things can get out of hand; but with nuclear weapons, to let things get \"out of hand\" is to commit suicide. This is more than a \"historical dilemma;\" it's the worst crunch we've ever faced. We're still prone to battle, yet horrified at where it may lead. We must find new channels for our fighting energy or we'll end up with one war too many, if only to let off steam and \"get it over with.\"\nDavid: Do you see any way out of this crunch? Will war always be with us?\nRobert: It's illuminating in approaching a war to look at the histories of some other human scourges such as illiteracy, slavery, and hunger. Let's deal first with illiteracy. A thousand years ago the only persons who knew how to read were priests and the very wealthy, and it was believed at the time that you could not learn to read unless you were close to God, unless you were a priest, or else rich enough to have a tutor. This special knowledge was hoarded and transmitted selectively from elite to elite. Gradually, though, it dawned on people that anyone who went through a certain process could learn to read. Through new institutions for literacy called \"schools,\" and then via universal compulsory education, a great transformation occurred: from the idea that anyone could learn to read, and ultimately to the idea that everyone learn to read and to write.\nThis is a prototypical example of what I call a psychotectonic shift. It is not a shift in genetics or biological evolution; it is a shift of our deepest assumptions about ourselves, a shift in what we take for granted, in what we think we are capable of. A psychotectonic shift is to the realm of moral understanding and human behavior what a paradigm shift is to scientific understanding and behavior. It is a reconceptualization of what it is to be human - a transformation of our \"self-model;\" and it projects a shift in human destiny with a full range of legal, political, economic, social and spiritual consequences.\nDavid: Could you illustrate this concept with another example?\nRobert: A psychotectonic shift with profound implication for mankind was the one surrounding slavery. For thousands of years it was considered a natural thing, if you could manage it, to enslave other people. Sometime about the eighteenth century, in England and in Europe, significant numbers of people began to raise doubts about the justification of one human being owning another. By mid- nineteenth century the issue came to a head in America, and what was still a widespread practice rapidly became totally unacceptable and outlawed. Abraham Lincoln presided over and came to symbolize this shift in people's mind set. As decades followed, instances of slavery around the globe were eradicated, so that now it is essentially non-existent. This does not mean, of course, that all exploitation has ceased. Someday \"wage slavery\" will undergo a similar transformation. In fact, I suspect that in the twenty-first century, leadership will fall to that society which provides the most satisfying work to its citizens of age 14 to 84 (or should it be 4 to 104). By the way, in the course of this, we'll probably have to completely transform our present educational practices; in a phrase, we'll have to design \"a better game than school.\"\nThese shifts in the shape and structure of the world mind are what I am calling \"psychotectonic\" shifts. Winston Churchill said, \"We shape our buildings; then they shape us.\" Just as our architecture shapes physical space, which in turn shapes our movement and behavior, so too there is a \"psychotectonics,\" created by us, that thereafter shapes our thought and action. Psychotectonics is the invisible \"architecture\" of the world moral \"space.\" And although often appearing as given and rigid, it is, in fact, quite malleable. It is we who create it and we who change it. This is the real power of this concept: we begin to take into consciousness, and assume responsibility for, powers we have unknowingly abdicated. An example of a psychotectonic shift being created before our very eyes is the current work of Amnesty International on torture and political imprisonment.\nDavid: What is it that causes psychotectonic shifts to occur?\nRobert: We can transcend a condition like illiteracy or slavery when we can thoroughly imagine and know how to produce another condition that's manifestly preferable. Perhaps it's easiest to see this with regard to hunger, which is a shift we are just now creating. Hunger is a phenomenon that communicates at a very deep level between human beings, so that there is actually a direct pain one experiences when one sees a hungry person. The only way really to rid yourself of this pain is to see the other person fed. The dynamic is something like that of a yawn by another person creating a yawn in you: it happens on a psychological and physiological level; it's an imitative, direct coupling to another person - something similar to, but much stronger than, the \"power of suggestion\".\nNow in the past we have mostly repressed this pain because we didn't know how to alleviate hunger systemically. But now that we do, I think nations will eventually adopt an implicit and explicit policy that human starvation and hunger are simply unacceptable. Actions that cause them, whether foreign or domestic, will be elevated into consciousness and will no longer be tolerated.\nSo to generalize, conditions like slavery, hunger or illiteracy become morally repugnant when we discover ways to discontinue the practices that sustain them. As long as the only way we can see to get a job done is to force another person to do it, we inure ourselves to his or her pain, and consider this a \"normal\" condition. As long as we see no way to get food to hungry people, we repress our true reactions. But when we find a way of dealing with these situations, of alleviating the other person's pain and thus our own, we move quickly to do this.\nWe like to think of new moral ideas as preceding the technical solutions, but widespread moral acceptance may as often follow the technical solutions. It's pointless to speculate on which comes first; they are deeply intertwined, and both the moral and the technological shifts are necessary to move mankind and transform our practice.\nDavid: Does all this suggest then that our job is partly that of the ad man, in a sense \"selling\" the world on ending hunger or making peace?\nRobert: Yes, I think so. If we're actually going to transcend war-making, and to end hunger as we've ended smallpox and slavery, we're going to have to use the skills of the best \"ad men.\" An idea must be good and timely in order to strike a resonance. But the speed at which \"an idea whose time has come\" can go forth into the world and belong to everybody is just dazzling - it moves like a sharp knife through soft butter, taking hold of everyone who is exposed to it. One way in which non-politicians can support political leaders is to hone ideas to the point where, when they are given public expression by a leader, they have that kind of rousing effect. If we want to see the world changed, it's our job to craft the rhetoric so that when it's spoken from a public forum, it moves people towards better goals - towards feeding the world, ending material and educational deprivation, establishing justice and equity, eliminating torture, and bypassing war-making.\nDavid: This calls to mind your attempts to get President Carter to take on the world hunger issue. Would you tell us about that?\nRobert: There were many who urged Carter to tackle the hunger problem, including members of his own family. The sources of my particular effort were manifold. Like many of us I had had images of starving children seared into my soul by television - especially by coverage of the Biafran starvation. In early 1977, as Jimmy Carter took office, I saw a film entitled The Hungry Planet, which simply and clearly detailed the steps necessary to the elimination of hunger in any social system. The technical answers - agricultural, economic and political - were public knowledge.\nCarter had been a farmer. He was clearly a spiritual man. I imagined that he might be willing to give the hunger problem the kind of leadership that Lincoln had given the issue of slavery. He was pushing human rights. What human right could be more basic than the right to eat?\nI had been struck by the way President Kennedy's summons to put a man on the moon and return him safely within the decade had galvanized and focused the nation into producing this result. Of course, putting a man on the moon and ending hunger are goals alike in neither substance nor significance. Yet Kennedy's call had helped make an old dream plausible, feasible, and finally doable. I thought that Carter, recalling the power of that historic summons, and knowing of the recent success of the World Health Organization's global campaign to eradicate smallpox, could provide leadership in the elimination of hunger by the end of the century. He had an opportunity to go down in history as the person who named and orchestrated a World War on hunger, a psychotectonic shift of unparalleled importance in the creation of humane human beings.\nSo, armed with an outline of a plan to end hunger by the end of the century, I began a series of trips to Washington. There were many steps on the way to a meeting with the President, and the openness of leadership to \"an idea whose time has come\" was always astonishing. I began with the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, detoured through a dozen senators and congressmen (including Humphrey and McGovern), met with the Undersecretary of Agriculture, the AID Director, various presidential assistants, Energy \"Czar\" Schlesinger, Budget Director Lance, U.N. Ambassador Young, Vice President Mondale and finally, the President. To all of them I communicated the message that there existed at the present time a historical opportunity to end hunger; that a formal commitment to doing so could now reasonably and responsibly be made; and that the making of such a commitment would in itself help in the realization of the goal. The budget for the program was approximately the same, on an annual basis, as that of the moon program, but extended for two decades instead of one.\nPresident Carter did create a Commission on World Hunger which issued a report confirming and proclaiming the feasibility of actually ending hunger on a world scale. Soon afterwards, his term of office came to an end. The task of mobilizing the will to end hunger on earth remains unfinished. Hunger awaits its Lincoln.\nDavid: Returning to your earlier point about the relationship between technology and morality, if the invention of the cotton gin helped make slavery morally unacceptable and the printing press and schools did the same for illiteracy, what will it be for war? Can we say that the invention of the atomic bomb is the technological innovation that will make war unacceptable?\nRobert: Well, the existence of nuclear weapons creates a situation in which we have a sharp, compelling incentive to examine our war-making tendencies. But such an examination reveals an important difference between the three psychotectonic shifts I've mentioned - having to do with slavery, illiteracy and hunger - and that of eliminating war. The difference stems from the fact that slavery, hunger and illiteracy are conditions that people live under, and that it's possible to imagine another set of conditions that could replace each of them. This alternate set of conditions may be extremely complex and require far-reaching changes in a society, such as in the case of slavery. Nevertheless an alternative can be imagined - dimly at first, then more and more concretely. With respect to hunger, for example, you imagine a world well-fed; you can specifically imagine loaves of bread in every culinary style on every table in the world. And in the case of illiteracy, you imagine a world where everybody reads.\nYou see books - millions of books. You see not just priests holding books with fancy calligraphy, but you see everybody reading, the Bible at first and then other books, printed books! And you imagine schools where reading is taught to all. This is not to say that imagination, although necessary, is also sufficient for transformation, for it leaves the actual work still to be done. But I want to stress that thoroughly imagining an opposite state is a prerequisite for the eradication of unwanted conditions.\nNow the point is that we've been dealing with conditions; but war is an activity. War differs from hunger, illiteracy and slavery because it is something we do, a complex societal activity that we participate in. If you imagine its absence, what you get is nothing; you get a non-activity. We call it peace, but the problem with peace, and the reason it's hard to create a desire for peace except in the immediate aftermath of a war, is that no one can imagine it, or everyone imagines it so very differently. \"Peace\" is not a set of activities that people do. That's why I maintain that the bypassing of war will require the delineation of a set of activities that can serve certain of the purposes that war has served, that provide people with something to do, and can meet the real needs that wars have met in the past.\nDavid: Are you suggesting that peace is actually not a viable goal for the \"Peace Movement\"?\nRobert: Yes I am, exactly. Peace is the absence of a very exciting activity - war. And nobody ever opted for nothing in place of something, especially something exciting. Peace has the connotation of peace and quiet, of serenity, of bliss; and people aren't actually attracted to that very much. It's boring after a while.\nAlso, if you look to see who is in favor of it, it's usually people who are living a privileged life, and who therefore wish to maintain the status quo. People who are experiencing hunger or injustice don't want peace; they are, in fact, willing to make revolutions and wars to secure food and justice. For people who are hungry or afraid, material well-being or security is of more immediate concern than peace.\nSo peace isn't the best way to express the goal of the anti-war movement. And you can't express it as \"antiwar\" either because that's merely \"against.\" We've got to figure out what it is we actually want, and then be for that.\nDavid: Is this the meaning of the question you've posed, \"Is there a better game than War?\"?\nRobert: Yes. And it's meant to be a provocative question, suggesting that war has in fact been an activity that men and women have played and have loved. They have also hated it, but it's crucial if we're ever going to bypass or transcend war-making that we admit our own eternal fascination with the business of it, with the fact that it provides moments of individual exhilaration, camaraderie, nobility, leadership, courage and glory that other human activities seldom match. The horrible side of war is well known and usually focused on, but until we acknowledge our secret attraction to it we're likely to keep on \"doing\" it.\nIn using the word \"game\" I do not mean to suggest that war is in any way frivolous. War is war - an immensely complex, irreducible activity of institutional character involving virtually all facets of society. In addition to provoking the recognition of our attraction to it, referring to war as a game suggests there are roles, moves, transactions, strategies, outcomes, winners and losers - and, most important, that we do have a choice as to whether to keep playing it.\nDavid: I suppose one of the reasons it's difficult to invent a game that is more engaging than war is that in playing war we get to experience vicariously the ultimate sacrifice, the giving of one's life. Denis de Rougemont, in Love In The Western World, saw in the act of dying for the one we love the supreme expression of eros.\nRobert: Yes, we have to acknowledge what genuine purposes wars have served - psychological as well as political. Then we've got to see if we can invent and design and authorize another game, another set of activities which meet those needs which wars have met.\nIncidentally, it's important to realize that the game of ending particular wars is completely different from discovering the game that replaces all war. Peacemakers who have an answer to the question \"What would I do if peace broke out?\" are apt to be more effective in their work.\nAt any rate, in my thinking I've moved past disarmament as a primary strategy and past peace as an immediate goal, and on over to the question of what the activities are which will replace the game of war and meet some of the same needs. We are beginning to design a game that is more fun to participate in than the old war games, or even the inseparably related \"stop-a-war\" games. The game that might be better than both these games is that of Completion - of completing ourselves through each other by incorporating into ourselves the empowering truths that other peoples embody and exemplify. That is really what our work in the Mo Tzu project is about.\nDavid: Would you describe that project and explain what you mean by this \"Mo Tzu\" work?\nRobert: In the fifth century B.C., during the time in Chinese history known as the Warring States period, Mo Tzu and a few of his followers would travel on foot to sites of developing conflict among the various feudal \"states\" and there attempt a kind of diplomatic aikido. If the opposing parties would not agree to sit down together and mediate their dispute, Mo Tzu would join the weaker side, offer training in how to withstand a siege, and then again sue for a negotiated solution. Precisely what his magic consisted of is not known, but his willingness to commit himself personally to a vision of a world without war is a source of inspiration to us.\nThe origins of our current Mo Tzu Project go back, I suppose, to my traveling to Vietnam during the war. I had learned in War and Peace about Pierre going to take a look at the Napoleonic War and how much it affected him to actually see war-making and to see people dying from violence. So I got on a plane and flew into Saigon on a regular tourist visa.\nI was President of Oberlin College at the time, and when I walked into the American Embassy and said I'd come to learn what was happening, they grabbed hold of me, thrilled that someone was there to see for himself. They even provided me with a helicopter and a personal pilot and took me wherever I wanted to go. I traveled all over and saw a lot of people, some grievously wounded and dying of burns, some children who had lost limbs. It engraved in my consciousness what the consequences of this \"glorious\" activity of war actually were to individuals.\nThen in 1978, another formative experience was a trip that my wife and I and our child made to the Soviet Union for a month, traveling by train across the whole continent to Japan, talking with hundreds of people on the way. It was on this trip that I began to see Soviet society as complementary to American.\nMore specifically though, the Mo Tzu idea developed in response to the suggestion that a peace institute be created at the University of California. I started to imagine groups of people who would actually go to the world's trouble-spots, immerse themselves in the situations, learn about them, and then see if there was something that could be done to broker a better relationship amongst the \"partners\" in conflict.\nThere is today a great deal of knowledge and experience regarding the process of negotiation between antagonistic nations. But before this knowledge can be applied to alleviating ongoing tensions and conflicts, there must first exist the sine qua non of successful negotiation: mutual respect, or to put it in Mo Tzu terms the willingness to see one's own culture and a rival one as complementary, as each bearing an aspect of a larger truth, a truth that embraces them both and compromises neither.\nThe peace institute I imagined was one which would focus at that more primary level of trying to build the willingness for diplomacy to work, to lay the groundwork needed before either governmental representatives such as Gromyko or Habib, or professional mediators such as Roger Fisher or John Burton, could bring their specialized skills to bear on the issue.\nThe definition of what among ourselves we call \"Mo Tzuing\" is \"finding what you love in what you hate.\" You might admit that you sometimes hate the Russians, for example, but if you can remember what it is you love within all that and use it as a handle, you can hold your hatred in its proper, subordinate place. Until you know what you love in what you hate, your hatred can assume command value over your behavior. But when you've found what you love and can maintain it as a clear vision, it becomes possible to surround your hatred and get past it. That's \"Mo Tzuing.\" And it applies as much to personal relationships as to relationships between whole cultures, societies, or nations.\nThe minute you find what you love in someone else, you're bigger yourself and stronger; you're more powerful. That will be, I think, the meaning of power in the twenty-first century. It's power that comes from the completion of self, from the incorporation into your behavioral repertoire of the other person's (or culture's) \"secrets\".\nAnd there's an interesting flip side to this: it is finding what you hate (in your \"enemy\") in yourself. For we only hate in others - whether in individuals or whole peoples - what we cannot accept in ourselves.\nDavid: What was the source of this understanding in your own experience?\nRobert: While teaching in a Black ghetto high school in Seattle in 1967, I came to feel that I was somehow incomplete as a person. There was something in these black teenagers, something they embodied, that I was attracted to and wanted to hang around. I noticed also that there was something attractive about me to them, something about me that they wanted to hang around. It was here that I first experienced the notion of the complementarity of cultures, and that's been a central idea for me ever since: that you can make yourself more whole and complete by assimilating the truths borne by other cultures. We need our enemies in order to complete ourselves.\nIt's interesting to trace the first stages of this process. As the sense of threat diminishes, we redesignate our former \"enemies\" as \"adversaries.\" With the first hint of positive mutual value, \"adversaries\" become \"rivals,\" a term which acknowledges each as a secret teacher of the other. Finally \"rivals,\" recognizing their mutual dependency, come to see themselves as \"partners.\"\nCompleteness is also a key concept in mathematics, so it's been with me since my formative intellectual years as a student of science. One learns that a set of things a set of mathematical objects, can be complete or incomplete. If you want to say where something is located, you need three numbers; if you use only two, your knowledge remains incomplete. And if you want to locate an event, you need four numbers - three spatial coordinates plus time. The notion of completeness is central in science and I believe it is central to the present human predicament.\nDavid: So this is how you relate to other cultures now?\nRobert: Yes, in looking at Black, Islamic or Russian culture, I try to identify that aspect of the truth they bear most prominently. Our initial reaction to other people is often negative because we see that they fail to embody something we take as supremely important. Only after getting through this can we appreciate what it is that they have to offer. I don't expect ever to assimilate fully into my perspective the way a Chinese sees the world or landscape, or the way Muslims feel about their friends. But to begin to see what such qualities are, and to square another way of seeing or being with your own so the two are not in contradiction, is the work that the world has urgently to get on with. Otherwise we're going to react out of our initial distaste and annihilate the differences.\nDavid: In a sense we commit a kind of psychic suicide, then, by severing ourselves from other cultures.\nRobert: I think so - by making them wrong, by humiliating them, by invalidating them. They in turn become angry with us. We cut ourselves off from engaging with other cultures and try to crush and expunge our differences instead of celebrating them. We need only reinterpret the old French maxim, \"Vive la Difference,\" to have the best anti- war cry imaginable.\nIn short, the activities that outmode and replace war must deal with incompleteness, whether it be of the body, mind or soul. No one activity embodies all these aspects. Nonetheless, to deal with want in any of its forms is to move towards by-passing war; and conversely, not to deal with want is to court war. We begin to see the outline of another grand human game on the horizon, coaxing us away from the thrills of the battlefield. It is the discovery and completion of one's own self as experienced in one's culture, and one's self as manifested in one's supposed enemy or shadow. This may well be an activity exciting enough and profound enough to supplant war. Completing ourselves is actually what we've always wanted; in fact, it is partly what we've sought for in vain through the cruel instrumentality of war. We now, finally, have the wisdom to get at these nurturing, self-completing truths directly. Hegel expressed this over a century ago:\n\"Each... part lives only by participating in and\neventually giving itself up to the whole... the 'self'\nor identity which is given up, however, is only the\nclaim on the part of a fragment to be the whole,\na truth claiming to be truer than it is...\"\nDavid: What kind of \"warrior\" will be needed for this new game you're proposing?\nRobert: What the world needs now are nonpartisans - people who specialize in introducing different cultures to each other, people who develop the skill to create in antagonistic nations or cultures the capacity to hold in check that ancient familiar impulse to fight. And this involves a philosophical shift in thinking away from dualistic, possessive presuppositions to a more inclusive world-view.\nIn traditional political or economic terms, the focus has been on who has what privilege, what right, what \"stuff,\" what power. Those issues tend to be divisive because the prevailing view, at least in the past, has been \"If I've got something, you don't have it\" or \"If I control this you don't\" - categories of exclusion which make for dispute. But mathematics has taught us about non-zero-sum games. A zero-sum game is one in which my gain exactly equals your loss, whereas a non-zero-sum game is one in which it's possible that we both gain. It's going to become a central value in politics to move past this zero-sum game framework and hold out for that solution in which everybody experiences a win simultaneously.\nDavid: What is the role of television in this work?\nRobert: Television is a revolutionary form of witness that makes us all onlookers. It can be a kind of world conscience. You know how each of us has a voice inside that serves as our moral conscience? Well television is the voice outside us. The images we received of the Biafran starvation and the My Lai massacre changed history.\nBut also, I want to find a way of showing on television the creativity and dignity of different peoples. At first, you don't experience another culture as having dignity; you tend to see a bunch of \"Martians.\" You may experience them as different and wrong-headed, as inefficient and making a lot of foolish errors, because often they are inept in areas where we excel. If they were good at just what we are good at, they would be bad at just what we are bad at. So usually when we come into a culture we notice the ineptness. But eventually we may come to understand that through their \"weaknesses,\" they are in part protecting and preserving their strengths. They are protecting a certain class of insights or a certain truth-seeking strategy that characterizes, even generates, their particular perception. They are protecting that and preserving it at all costs because that is their uniqueness, their essential gift.\nTelevision can be a very powerful tool in communicating this. It is interesting to note that the discovery of the transistor, which led to both television and computers, and the first man-made nuclear reaction occurred within a few years of each other. Used properly, the telecommunications revolution could serve as a technological counterweight to the threats posed by nuclear weapons technology.\nDavid: Do you see television as being able in the future to substitute completely for direct human contact?\nRobert: No, I think first-hand exchange and experience will always be essential. The value of groups like those doing this Mo Tzu work is due less to whatever particular insights they might bring to a situation, than to the consciousness that the mere fact of their presence as witnesses creates in parties to a conflict: namely, that there is a \"view from afar,\" visible to neither party.\nAnother function these groups serve is that of a mirror. And we need first to mirror the value, the truths of a given people, so that security and a sense of compassion will allow them some disidentification with the beliefs which are supporting their involvement in the conflict.\nDavid: Have your initial Mo Tzu efforts been encouraging?\nRobert: As we go about this work we are constantly aware of how small our contribution is relative to the size and seriousness of the problems in which we're immersed. But it's like throwing a stone into a lake: you don't see the water level rise, but you know the stone is sitting at the bottom, so you conclude that the water level must have risen. In our work it's hard to measure the effects, but when we have done well by a situation we feel the water level has risen. In 1982, our little band of travelers went to the Middle East in April, Ireland in May, Poland in October and Kenya in November.\nWe are not representatives of any government or any organization. But people who encounter us realize quickly that we're just as interested in the process and in the outcome as if we were professional diplomats. The human quality of our interest draws people into intense discussions. Our presence is an expression of our view that diplomacy has become too important to ordinary people to be left only to professional diplomats.\nAnd we've noticed that government figures are often more open and forthcoming with us than they could be with either fellow diplomats or journalists. When people realize that we're coming from a nonpartisan place, that our focus is to discover the complementarity in the parties to conflict, they become less righteous, defensive and belligerent. They often join us in looking for at least a theoretical solution - one which would leave both parties with their self-respect and each with a sense that they own a piece of the truth, while glimpsing the possibility of owning a larger truth by incorporating that of the other side.\nDavid: So at this point, do you feel you've really got a better game than war?\nRobert: This Mo Tzu work is exciting, as well as difficult and frustrating. It contains many of the elements of what I've called \"a better game than war.\" Yet in at least one vital respect Mo Tzu work is not adequate as a replacement for war. Mo Tzu work at this point is essentially an individual or a small group activity. But wars are more than individuals engaged in parallel activities. War is a collective activity and as such has been a provider of Myths - unifying overviews of triumph and tragedy in which each individual has a role. If another game can in fact be substituted for war, it will have to meet not only the individual's need for challenge and adventure, but also the collective need for an integrative myth that renders life and lives meaningful.\nDavid: Do you envision any way in which this could happen?\nRobert: For Mo Tzu work to begin to fill this collective need it would have to be multiplied many thousandfold and perhaps be given the status of an Event. Imagine that an agreement were negotiated among the nations of the world to exchange for two years, beginning in say 1985, a million people, going and coming from nation to nation in approximate proportion to population - a mammoth, multinational Peace-on-Earth Corps moving not just from America to developing nations but rather from each country to all the others, focusing on the issue of establishing relationships, and thereby building mutual security. An event on this scale could mark a turning point in human affairs and initiate the needed psychotectonic shift away from war.\nThe people of the earth are in a most dangerous passage. We have only the barest knowledge of each other, after centuries of relative isolation. And a little learning is a dangerous thing. We must move rapidly to reduce the danger, so greatly enhanced by nuclear weapons technology, by learning enough more about each other to overcome the fright of first encounter. Paradoxically, it is technology that makes this awkward passage both necessary and possible.\nThe global event here imagined could be financed with one percent of the world's defense budgets. Such an expenditure would surely enhance the security of individual nations, and that is precisely the purpose of national defense budgets.\nThe age-old mechanism for transcending civil strife - aligning against an external enemy - is no longer workable. There are no external enemies for all mankind to unite against. Thus, we'll have to transcend global civil war not by allying ourselves with former enemies in the face of a new enemy, but by learning enough about our adversaries to establish forbearance for the differences that have, during these first close encounters, so scared and agitated us.\nThe linchpin of forbearance for another people is to identify the truth or value their culture has borne forward through its particular history. And the key to evoking a reciprocal respect is to know the truths exemplified by one's own culture. Both sides must find what they love in what they may at first be inclined to hate. Then, and only then, can two cultures truly meet.\n"}, {"score": 1061.3497, "uuid": "e8cf1dd0-597e-57a1-b0ec-03f4606959b9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0101wb-73-20995", "target_hostname": "www.altfeld.com", "target_uri": "http://www.altfeld.com/mastery/misc/nlp-reality-and-imagination.html", "page_rank": 1.1740001e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Reality and <em>Imagination</em>.

Can we take the high road on that one? ;)\nfollie\ny\nJonathan\nMost of you have been here before, so I want to thank you again for participating. I may act as facilitator... but YOUR comments and participation are what really make all this work out so well! This topic started primarily because... well, because I saw the movie \"the Truman Show.\" How many of you have seen it? (y/n)\ntranzpupy, follie, tangram, jazz, Occum\nn\ny\nJonathan\nOK -- I *loved* that movie. To keep it brief... but hit the highlights... Jim Carrey plays the 1st person to have ever been adopted by a Corporation. ;) And everyone in his life... is an actor in a show... based around HIM. Now, however improbably... the movie opens to his adulthood at the age of early 30's... and some things start to go awry. Like... he's by his car... and out of nowhere... a movie-set light... falls from the sky and crashes in the street in front of his house. He looks up, and there's nothing to be seen anywhere. Next... he's in his car... and something goes ka-flouey with his radio... and he picks up a signal as he's driving to work turning onto Flamingo Rd.... \"and he's turning onto Flamingo Rd now...\" then the radio goes back to normal, etc. He starts to get a sense that people... meaning, ALL people... are responding to HIM. And he begins to question the information he's getting. He questions the reality in which he lives. As the movie unfolds... you see him grapple with the issues surrounding whether or not he lives in a world which is actually real!

The essay argues AGAINST Jeremy-Bentham type arguments that people are only pursuing pleasure as the primary motivator of all of the behavior in their life.\nOllie_\nwhoops, here I go again...\nJonathan\nThis is VERY NLP related... because we're often eliciting people's values and strategies... so that we can help GIVE people more of what they want!\ntranzpupy\nor force them to go out and get it...\nJonathan\nThe essay says... what if there were a machine.... that you could hook yourself up to (like that described in the movie BRAINSTORM)... which could give you ALL the most intense and wonderful and completely supportive experiences you would ever want or need?\nOccum\nLike in the movie 'Strange Days' as well Jon.\nJonathan\nYes, Occum!!! What if you could keep such a machine on, ALL the time? Would you want to? If the content of the machine gave you ALL of the experience you would ever want or need? (leave out biological needs, & such, assuming you'd get all appropriate nutrition while you were hooked up to it, etc).\ntangram\nor Total Recall\nJonathan\nBut even if the experience of tasting foods, could be reproduced completely... WOULD YOU want to be hooked up to such a machine forever?\njaba\nHook me to the KEG, man\nOccum\nAny of those tangram.\nJonathan\nOr even for MOST of the time? Nozick argues that most people... would NOT. That they might enjoy it for a little while... but that they would back out of it...\nOccum\nI am already\nJonathan\nFor a variety of reasons... including feeling the need to have freedom of choice and a clearer sense of real vs unreal. Its VERY thought-provoking.\ntranzpupy\nhow about a need to impact the world around us...\nOccum\nChocolate cake only tastes good for so long.\nJonathan\nNow. The pleasure-as-good school-of-thought is very Utilitarian (John Stuart Mill). And I think pleasure DOES drive many of our actions. Either long-term pleasure, or short-term pleasure. But sneaking behind all this... is this issue of HOW do we know our reality is actually our reality... So. Now. With the above out of the way....\ntangram\nor the need for a sense of personal accomplishment\nsabren\nExploring as a Group...\nJonathan\nI'd like to see where you all take the conversation! EVERYONE can participate, of course! This goes to the heart of how we understand our own reality.\nfollie\nanother part of this same issue: if all we have is pure pleasure, whatever that may be, I think we can\njaba\nI am already hooked into such a machine, the question is: are you hooked into it too. Or are you created by the machine\ntangram\nWould you use it like television, or would you use it to explore and challenge yourself?\nfollie\n... I think we can't really appreciate it after a while, because we have nothing less pleasurable to compare it to\nJonathan\njaba -- yes, that's a well-offered argument ;)\nOllie_\nBack for good this time, hopefully. Can someone please DCC me the transcript so far?\nLaoTsu\nAm I butterfly dreaming I am a man or a man dreaming he is a butterfly\nJonathan\nLaoTsu -- good one!\nfollie\nsorry my comment got split in two - my keyboard doesn't know when not to hit the enter key sometimes :-)\nJonathan\nYes, follie.. how do we balance it ;)\ntangram\nThat would make learning different. Imagine driver's ed, but you spend several hours playing through driving tapes, learning how a car handles FIRST. With the obligatory Blood Flows Red on the Highway tape...\nOccum\nOr a fly dreaming that I am butter. ;-)\ntranzpupy\nThere's a short story about a man having horrible dreams, and a very pleasant waking life. So he wakes up from the dream... and discovers the pleasant one was the dream and he's stuck in the horrible life...\nOllie_\nLast night I dreamed I fell asleep. Or this morning did I dream I awoke?\nJonathan\nkinda negative, huh?\nOccum\nMy sister in law has incredibly vivid dreams, and sometimes she wakes up and it takes her a few minutes to realize that it was a dream. Shes even been mad at my brother before for stuff she dreamed he did.\nJonathan\nLOL Occum! OK. Lets back up from these very deep and weird comments ;) I love when that stuff happens! Morning dream-carryovers.\ntranzpupy\nI've been dreaming a lot lately, and when I wake up... the dream is gone... but just before I go to sleep, I get into the same state, and remember where I was in the dream... and it starts up from there... it's weird. There's a strange physical feeling that goes with it..\nOccum\nTrue story and she told me about this, this morning in fact.\nOllie_\nI've occasionally gone through half a day before realizing that a dream was a dream.\njaba\nThanks, it can be fun to thrash philosophically for a while, but more importantly how is it useful to distinguish between virtual reality and reality. When it ain't useful to distinguish them no more, lie back and enjoy where ever you are.\nOccum\nThe answer I think, depending on the experience, is that we can't always distinguish, at least not immediatly.\nOllie_\n& when I do realize it's always something in the dream that really obviously couldn't have really happened, and it's only because I haven't thought about it from that point of view that I didn't realize before.\nLaoTsu\nI was recording my dreams in a journal a while back and started to get really confused about what actually happened and what was just a dream. Very confusing.\njaba\nJonathan's story reminds me of insane people who don't want to come back to sanity. They are having more fun being insane.\nReality Verification Strategies\nJonathan\nOK! Lets tie this together again a bit. Let me ask a couple of BASIC questions of everyone!\nOccum\nFire away Jon.\nJonathan\n(1) How do you know that the monitor in front of you (not what I'm writing... but the actual physical object) is real? Go ahead, answer.\nOllie_\nyes, indeed, Ollie, real in what sense.\nfollie\nbecause I can touch it, I can't put my hand thru it, nor can I see thru it\ntangram\nI see more details than I would imagine.\nJonathan\nWell my past experience tells me so. We are really playing the percentages with real/unreal.\nOllie_\nIt is real in the sense that my experience of it is real, therefore it is a real part of my experience.\ntangram\nCould also apply that to touch and sound. I might imagine \"solid\", I don't spontaneously imagine \"needs dusting, and I wish that smudge weren't there\"\nLaoTsu\nIt can be sensed in all the senses VACOG.\nJonathan\nNow. We could hallucinate a glass panel on top of us, right? How would we know it wasn't real?\nOccum\nYes but there is a difference between a computer monitor in my dream, and a physical one. Good point Jon.\nLaoTsu\nMachines don't work right in a dream.\nOllie_\nLOL Lao... Ollie -- that's a great question to ask. Let me add to it.\nOllie_\nHow does your experience of a computer monitor in a dream differ from your experience of a \"physical\" computer monitor?\nJonathan\nIf you could imagine a monitor so real... and in your imagination.. you could focus on SO many details... that you really could see it there in front of you...\nOccum\nIts like I said before, we are playing the percentages.\nJonathan\nAnd take the time to make those details more vivid... would the imaginary monitor get closer to the real monitor in terms of your ability to recognize its \"realness?\"\nOccum\nWe go off of data and logic, and improve our map as we go.\ntangram\nOr how about when there actually is/isn't a window somewhere, but you thought otherwise. There's that delicious jarring moment when you figure it out.\nOccum\nummm, the subtleties of the experience. err the sub.., subb...,\nJonathan\nI want to get down to some more practical differences here.\nOccum\nAlso I would challenge you to see words on the computer monitor in your dream.\nJonathan\nIf you imagine a monitor, it is transparent, is it not? As opposed to OPAQUE.\ntangram\nOpaque. It shows an image, not the guts of the monitor, or the bookcase behind it.\nJonathan\nBut if you can imagine a painting, you could imagine painting the transparencies over with opaque paint, and hallucinate what's behind the monitor... going away out of view... being occluded. Can you do that? You may not be able to do it quickly, but can you do it?\njaba\nI'm not even sure it\ntangram\nI suppose I'd say, I could spend a whole lot of time imagining a monitor and making it as real as possible, but it would take so much effort I couldn't think about anything else.\nOllie_\nOccum: but if you're dreaming about a monitor which doesn't behave like a \"real\" monitor, then you're not dreaming about a \"real\" monitor, are you? What distinguishes a \"real\" monitor from a dream of a \"real\" monitor?\njaba\nI'm not even sure it's transparent - if the pictures/text are right on the surface\nJonathan\nI'm not suggesting \"wasting time.\" I'm only wondering how real we can make it. And then we'll talk about the differences... and the purposes of the differences, etc.\nOccum\nOllie: that's a distinction without a difference. If a monitor is in your dream it is by definition a dream monitor.\nJonathan\nBecause if these differences aren't USEFUL in a variety of circumstances then it isn't worth talking about for more than a little bit at a time.\ntangram\nYes. In fact, there was a painting in my building that showed a little square with a still life in a room, and the rest of the canvas was painted over in red and black outside this very neat little window. It drove me crazy. I wanted to see the rest of the room the still life was in.\nOccum\nRight, if distinctions aren't real then this talk is a waste of time.\njaba\nreality has certain consistent physical limitations\nOllie_\nOccum: You're avoiding the question, which is, what *is* a \"dream\" monitor, as opposed to a \"real\" one?\nJonathan\nNice one tangram! OK. So... your input channels... your sensory systems... are feeding information to your brain at real-time. You have your real-time sensory input systems. And that's a LOT of sensory data.\ntangram\nI know it's real because of the quantity of information I ignore\nOccum\nA dream monitor is one that is in your head when you dream.\nJonathan\nSo we have a great deal of the various cortexes devoted to paring down that sensory data and converting it over to real-time symbolic representations.\nOllie_\nAnd a real monitor is one that is in your head when you're not dreaming?\nOccum\nNo not in your head.\nJonathan\nHOW do we KNOW the difference between the symbolic representations that are \"just coming in\" vs. the ones we construct? We have to have some mechanisms for that.\nOllie_\nSo a real monitor isn't in your head? So how do you know it's there, then?\nJonathan\nThe brain knows the difference between real and not real -- EVEN if the strategy for recognizing the difference DIFFERS from person to person...!\nBro_Soul\nI think Bandler discusses that In Time for a Change.\ntangram\nWill it frustrate you if I repeat, not as much detail? Not as sharply focused, textured, irregular. Prone to moving location slightly if I don't think carefully.\nBro_Soul\nWhere Erickson had a crazy client..who could not tell reality from what is made up.\nJonathan\nHmmm tangram... the quantity of information that you ignore. NOW THAT... is a very sophisticated answer. And it may be more \"true\" than you know.\nBro_Soul\nIt is based on how we organize the information..the differences...\ntranzpupy\nthere must be some kind of energy monitor in us that figures out how much energy we are expending to product an image. If we are getting IN a real image\nJonathan\nI think... I think.. the conscious mind... in conscious states... trusts itself too much. OR... HOW ELSE would people emerging from a dream accuse other people of things these other people did while in their dreams!!!\nOccum\n"}, {"score": 1058.5098, "uuid": "4d156cd0-db8a-54a2-a93c-ec12d63046b5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1109wb-30-19537", "target_hostname": "camelliablossoms.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://camelliablossoms.wordpress.com/page/14/", "page_rank": 1.177533e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "&quot;What <em>do</em> <em>you</em> <em>do</em>?&quot;", "snippet": "One day my father, after listening to me complain, said, \u201c<em>Do</em> what <em>you</em> love because <em>you</em> will <em>do</em> a <em>better</em> job of it.\u201d And, \u201cI would much rather hire someone who knows how to learn <em>than</em> someone who\u2019s learned a bunch of stuff.\u201d", "explanation": null, "document": "January 10, 2010 by Camille Sheppard Dohrn\n\u201cAnd in the end\nThe love you take\nIs equal to the love you make.\u201d \u00a0- The Beatles\nThese are the lyrics that came to mind this afternoon on my way home from a friend\u2019s memorial service while thinking about what I might write this evening. \u00a0They followed after recalling the comments of a favorite poet reflecting on death. He notes that what ultimately brings those who grieve together is recounting memories of the things the deceased person loved. \u00a0I can\u2019t quote exactly as I don\u2019t remember the specific source, but my own take on this is that the only thing we really have to leave behind of any value is love.\nIn the last few months I have witnessed the passing of too many, both people and animals, close to me either through friendship or kinship. Grief has been a teacher. It doesn\u2019t go away just because I\u2019d rather feel differently. \u00a0And for my friends and family members grieving, there seems to be nothing I can do other than to stand by and honor the way they need to deal with these losses. \u00a0What is clear is that through these experiences what we retain of our relationships with those who are no longer with us is love. \u00a0And to follow on my thoughts from yesterday about value; the value we place on what we do and who we are in life; and how we ascribe value; the question I have is, how can we use any measure other than love? \u00a0And how can we possibly measure another\u2019s experience of love? \u00a0How is it that we have such a difficult time just \u201cbeing\u201d, and spend so much time \u201cdoing\u201d in order to fulfill some elusive idea of value which lies hidden in the mysteries of love?\nI can\u2019t answer those questions at 11:54 pm. \u00a0And I probably won\u2019t get this posted by midnight, so my version of today will end up being tomorrow\u2026 January 10. I guess there will be two January 10ths in my version of reality TV. \u00a0I wonder how many times that will happen in the course of this 365 day journey\u2026\nIt seems perfectly appropriate that the photographs I took today were landscapes. When I was in first college, I enrolled in business classes thinking that I should be a business major so I could get a good job. \u00a0I hated them. One day my father, after listening to me complain, said, \u201cDo what you love because you will do a better job of it.\u201d And, \u201cI would much rather hire someone who knows how to learn than someone who\u2019s learned a bunch of stuff.\u201d I switched tracks and ended up with degrees in French Literature, which I enjoyed every moment of. I have always remembered those words, but I was young and didn\u2019t see the big picture until later. \u00a0A number of years ago, in a jewelry workshop, I had an instructor who said, \u201cMake the thing that makes your heart beat faster\u201d. \u00a0It struck me that what he was referring to was really one of the great lessons in life. \u00a0Since then, I have often heard those words in my ears, but now I translate them as \u201cDO the thing that makes your heart beat faster\u201d. \u00a0To further translate, \u201cDo the thing that you love\u201d. \u00a0Its come full circle, but now I \u201cget it\u201d. I have a thing for mountains, they make my heart beat faster. I shoot lots of photographs of mountains. This one is not a \u201cphotographer\u2019s photo\u201d. It wasn\u2019t shot within an hour of sunrise or sunset. \u00a0Its just an ordinary mid-afternoon view of our beloved Mt. Rainier, the mountain that I look at almost every day as I walk my dogs. It always makes my heart beat faster. \u00a0I brought my camera today because this was the window of time I had to take Sherlock and Cody out for a walk and shoot something for my blog (I discovered that you can click on the photo to enlarge it if you want to see it better). I shot photos of the sun shining through curls of birch bark and glowing moss on forked branches. \u00a0I shot a photo of a couple picnicking at the end of path on a bench with the mountains in the background, but in the end, I had to post the thing that makes my heart beat faster. \u00a0Not the \u201cbest\u201d photo maybe, but the one of the view that feeds my soul.\nMt. Rainier and Lake Washington while out for a walk\nToday, as I sat listening to stories about my friend\u2019s life, I heard stories about what she loved. \u00a0Leaving the service, the friends and family who had arrived in ones and twos left together, bonded by the shared experience of our friend\u2019s love for us and by the stories we heard about what else she loved. En route to the reception, we got a bit lost and found ourselves on an upper skybridge looking out over Puget Sound instead of the lower skybridge which led to the elevator. I didn\u2019t have my camera, but the view was so beautiful that I had to see what I could do with my Blackberry.\nMt. Rainier in the distance and Elliot Bay\nWhen I started writing this blog earlier this week, I thought I was writing about being a stay-at-home mom and finding value in that role. \u00a0I thought I was writing about learning to honor the mundane in life as highly as those moments and things which are more often considered interesting and exciting. \u00a0I think I\u2019m still writing about that same journey, but I believe that the stay-at-home mom \u201clens\u201d is only one lens. \u00a0I had a conversation early this morning with a young male friend which convinced me that my role, with its lens, has its pitfalls, but it would be narrow-minded and perhaps arrogant of me to think that I, and even we (stay-at-home moms) struggle more than others with questions about our self-worth when we place ourselves in the context of our culture with its emphasis on \u201cdoing\u201d and \u201chaving\u201d rather than \u201cbeing\u201d.\n"}, {"score": 1057.6185, "uuid": "9f8f70bb-ad48-5b84-b25c-adfc640d53e9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-81-25674", "target_hostname": "outsideisbetter.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://outsideisbetter.typepad.com/outside_is_better_chad_br/notebooks/", "page_rank": 3.3623206e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "outside <em>is</em> <em>better</em> : notebooks", "snippet": "I want to keep some notes longer <em>than</em> that.

Books have been written identifying these characters, but most agree that the four creatures represent the totality of creation wrapped inside the existence of the Father.\u00a0 Their role that has been played out since the beginning of time is one that identifies and protects the holiness of the Father.\u00a0 The twenty four elders have put themselves is a posture of constant submission towards who God is.\u00a0 They represent those who have passed through the salvific efforts of God into a new reality.\u00a0 These are heavenly creatures, full of the knowledge of the divine, but do not have an earthly home.\nThe interesting part of this reading is found in vs. 4, with the antiphonal response of the heavenly creatures; Amen, Hallelujah.\u00a0 Glossed, this is con temporarily translated as \"we agree, Praise the Lord\".\u00a0 These are two words that are heard in church often, and are part of the Christian\u00a0 vocabulary that many people might take for granted.\u00a0 But there is deep meaning in this response.\u00a0 G.K. Beale notes this response as a \u201cformal expression of ratification\u201d(7) by the creatures.\u00a0 These words are the endorsements of the truth spoken by Christ\u2019s church.\u00a0 The creatures of heaven and operating in agreement with the redeemed church.\u00a0 The creatures, since they are holy beings, understand the function of the incarnation as rescue, and the activity of God recovering His world.\u00a0 It is a \u201creckless indiscrimination\u201d(8), salvation as the action and the very make-up of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nGod is also doing this with us, enlisting us in the saving action, by our entry into the kingdom through the sacraments.(9)\u00a0 We understand our Eucharist as a \u201cTransporting Feast\u201d, as Charles Wesley wrote, bringing us into a timeless reality of action with God.(10)\u00a0 The sacraments are the best vehicle of participation, a vehicle that God provided.\nBut what does this antiphon have to do with us today?\u00a0 Does it hold some sort of secret regarding our salvation?\u00a0 Gleaning contemporary meanings out of Revelation without diverting off into crackpot prophecy is a skill that is not practiced well by many church leaders.\u00a0 I think that our answer lies in the liturgical and textual analysis of v.4.\u00a0 Why are the heavenly creatures agreeing with the words of the redeemed?\u00a0 To think that the church holds more understanding of God than the creatures that have surrounded him in heaven for eons is bold.\u00a0 But to reference Dons Scotus again, the incarnation is a fundamental action that would have happened regardless of the fall.\u00a0 Christ came not because of sin, but because God desired a complete union with humanity that could only be finally realized by grace.\u00a0 This does not discount what Christ did regarding sin, or say that Adam and Eve were not truly perfect, but that the fundamental attribute of God is salvific.\u00a0 The creatures that have been responsible for naming and protecting the holiness of God are agreeing because as a saved people, we understand the things of God better than they do.\u00a0 The heavenly creatures can understand the idea of grace, but they can never understand it as an action because they haven\u2019t received it.\nThis makes salvation not about perfection, but a deep holy love and desire for relationship.\u00a0 Sacrifice for the sake of salvation is in the very being of God.\u00a0 The twenty four elders and living creatures were saying to the redeemed, \u201cThis is now your song to sing, because of grace and that you now know God in a way we cannot.\u00a0 While me may understand the complexities of his holiness, you understand him through the radical, sacramental power of grace.\u201d\u00a0 This provides a very Wesleyan way to look at the eschaton, as fulfillment that is couched in the marriage supper of the lamb.\u00a0 As humans we look towards this privilege with expectation.\nSacramental Vision today\nAt the heart of our sacramental vision is memory, the anamnesis, the constant active memory of the Church.\u00a0 We use our memory to locate ourselves not in the plight of postmodernity, but in the story of God.\u00a0 It orients us towards a narrative that is built out of rescue, renaming, and bringing the lowly to places of Holy prestige. It gives us coherence, meaning and a frame of reference that is built in the creator of the world.\u00a0 Because of this we \u201care not trapped and confined in the present moment but can locate it as the invention of temporal processes and actions, which gives us the wherewithal to transcend the limitations to which the here and now restrict us\u201d.(11)\u00a0 We do know what has happened before us and we know the design of the world.\u00a0 In participation with anamnesis is prolepsis, the active engaging of the future.\u00a0 We know that our world is on a timeline, and that it is originated with the divine.\u00a0 Placing our worship in the language of eschaton allows us to give service to this idea that is able to stay away from the language of revenge and judgement.\u00a0 We know that these things will happen, but that more is written regarding how humanity will be eternally positioned in relation to God.\u00a0 The liturgical Sanctus of the church is a recognition of how creation and end are in relation towards one another, and that end does not mean a final point, but a reconfiguration.\u00a0 Schmemann says \u201cThis is the ultimate purpose of all that exists, the end, the goal and the fulfillment,because this is the beginning, the principle of Creation.\u201d(12)\nWhen we worship, we place ourselves on this timeline.\u00a0 We shift back towards renewal, and again think that our sacramental actions are a reality and sign of our communion with God. The baptismal waters and the Lords table re-members us back into humanities proper place with God.\u00a0 But unlike Adam and Eve, we live knowing the radical sacramental powers of grace.\u00a0 Worship ceases to become a spiritual filling station and returns to the chief story of the Church.\u00a0 An ancient-future practice both grounds us and thrusts us towards the Trinity.\nThe Church\u2019s mission as an eschatological oriented people is one that understands we do have a storyteller.\u00a0 We tell of what happens when we will all know more about the story than ever imagined.\u00a0 Our Eucharist is the time in which we taste an appetizer of the anticipated heavenly reality.\u00a0 We are in between memory and hope, and we look forward to the time in which we will be able to do the things of heaven best; because we have a savior standing like a slain lamb that has brought us a redemption steeped with the grace that God gives his restored people.\n6 Authors own translation\n7 G.K.Beale The Book of Revelation (Eerdmans,1999) pg 929\n8 Eugene Peterson Reversed Thunder (Harper & Row, 1988) pg 153\n9 Ibid 166\n10 Daniel B Stevick The Altar\u2019s Fire (Epworth, 2004) pg 129\n11 Barry Harvey Can These Bones Live?

Books have been written identifying these characters, but most agree that the four creatures represent the totality of creation wrapped inside the existence of the Father.\u00a0 Their role that has been played out since the beginning of time is one that identifies and protects the holiness of the Father.\u00a0 The twenty four elders have put themselves is a posture of constant submission towards who God is.\u00a0 They represent those who have passed through the salvific efforts of God into a new reality.\u00a0 These are heavenly creatures, full of the knowledge of the divine, but do not have an earthly home.\nThe interesting part of this reading is found in vs. 4, with the antiphonal response of the heavenly creatures; Amen, Hallelujah.\u00a0 Glossed, this is con temporarily translated as \"we agree, Praise the Lord\".\u00a0 These are two words that are heard in church often, and are part of the Christian\u00a0 vocabulary that many people might take for granted.\u00a0 But there is deep meaning in this response.\u00a0 G.K. Beale notes this response as a \u201cformal expression of ratification\u201d(7) by the creatures.\u00a0 These words are the endorsements of the truth spoken by Christ\u2019s church.\u00a0 The creatures of heaven and operating in agreement with the redeemed church.\u00a0 The creatures, since they are holy beings, understand the function of the incarnation as rescue, and the activity of God recovering His world.\u00a0 It is a \u201creckless indiscrimination\u201d(8), salvation as the action and the very make-up of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nGod is also doing this with us, enlisting us in the saving action, by our entry into the kingdom through the sacraments.(9)\u00a0 We understand our Eucharist as a \u201cTransporting Feast\u201d, as Charles Wesley wrote, bringing us into a timeless reality of action with God.(10)\u00a0 The sacraments are the best vehicle of participation, a vehicle that God provided.\nBut what does this antiphon have to do with us today?\u00a0 Does it hold some sort of secret regarding our salvation?\u00a0 Gleaning contemporary meanings out of Revelation without diverting off into crackpot prophecy is a skill that is not practiced well by many church leaders.\u00a0 I think that our answer lies in the liturgical and textual analysis of v.4.\u00a0 Why are the heavenly creatures agreeing with the words of the redeemed?\u00a0 To think that the church holds more understanding of God than the creatures that have surrounded him in heaven for eons is bold.\u00a0 But to reference Dons Scotus again, the incarnation is a fundamental action that would have happened regardless of the fall.\u00a0 Christ came not because of sin, but because God desired a complete union with humanity that could only be finally realized by grace.\u00a0 This does not discount what Christ did regarding sin, or say that Adam and Eve were not truly perfect, but that the fundamental attribute of God is salvific.\u00a0 The creatures that have been responsible for naming and protecting the holiness of God are agreeing because as a saved people, we understand the things of God better than they do.\u00a0 The heavenly creatures can understand the idea of grace, but they can never understand it as an action because they haven\u2019t received it.\nThis makes salvation not about perfection, but a deep holy love and desire for relationship.\u00a0 Sacrifice for the sake of salvation is in the very being of God.\u00a0 The twenty four elders and living creatures were saying to the redeemed, \u201cThis is now your song to sing, because of grace and that you now know God in a way we cannot.\u00a0 While me may understand the complexities of his holiness, you understand him through the radical, sacramental power of grace.\u201d\u00a0 This provides a very Wesleyan way to look at the eschaton, as fulfillment that is couched in the marriage supper of the lamb.\u00a0 As humans we look towards this privilege with expectation.\nSacramental Vision today\nAt the heart of our sacramental vision is memory, the anamnesis, the constant active memory of the Church.\u00a0 We use our memory to locate ourselves not in the plight of postmodernity, but in the story of God.\u00a0 It orients us towards a narrative that is built out of rescue, renaming, and bringing the lowly to places of Holy prestige. It gives us coherence, meaning and a frame of reference that is built in the creator of the world.\u00a0 Because of this we \u201care not trapped and confined in the present moment but can locate it as the invention of temporal processes and actions, which gives us the wherewithal to transcend the limitations to which the here and now restrict us\u201d.(11)\u00a0 We do know what has happened before us and we know the design of the world.\u00a0 In participation with anamnesis is prolepsis, the active engaging of the future.\u00a0 We know that our world is on a timeline, and that it is originated with the divine.\u00a0 Placing our worship in the language of eschaton allows us to give service to this idea that is able to stay away from the language of revenge and judgement.\u00a0 We know that these things will happen, but that more is written regarding how humanity will be eternally positioned in relation to God.\u00a0 The liturgical Sanctus of the church is a recognition of how creation and end are in relation towards one another, and that end does not mean a final point, but a reconfiguration.\u00a0 Schmemann says \u201cThis is the ultimate purpose of all that exists, the end, the goal and the fulfillment,because this is the beginning, the principle of Creation.\u201d(12)\nWhen we worship, we place ourselves on this timeline.\u00a0 We shift back towards renewal, and again think that our sacramental actions are a reality and sign of our communion with God. The baptismal waters and the Lords table re-members us back into humanities proper place with God.\u00a0 But unlike Adam and Eve, we live knowing the radical sacramental powers of grace.\u00a0 Worship ceases to become a spiritual filling station and returns to the chief story of the Church.\u00a0 An ancient-future practice both grounds us and thrusts us towards the Trinity.\nThe Church\u2019s mission as an eschatological oriented people is one that understands we do have a storyteller.\u00a0 We tell of what happens when we will all know more about the story than ever imagined.\u00a0 Our Eucharist is the time in which we taste an appetizer of the anticipated heavenly reality.\u00a0 We are in between memory and hope, and we look forward to the time in which we will be able to do the things of heaven best; because we have a savior standing like a slain lamb that has brought us a redemption steeped with the grace that God gives his restored people.\n6 Authors own translation\n7 G.K.Beale The Book of Revelation (Eerdmans,1999) pg 929\n8 Eugene Peterson Reversed Thunder (Harper & Row, 1988) pg 153\n9 Ibid 166\n10 Daniel B Stevick The Altar\u2019s Fire (Epworth, 2004) pg 129\n11 Barry Harvey Can These Bones Live?

Most of the times women do not drink, smoke or stay out on the sun like men usually are. Therefore, women have a better chance of preserving their skin.\nI found some information on the internet that men age better than women because the following reasons. 1. Men exfoliate their skin on the regular basis when they shave. 2. We all know that sebaceous gland produce oil and keep skin moist and plump. Testosterone stimulates more sebaceous gland to produce sebum. Therefore, the male skin becomes moist and tick. The moisture and thickness of the skin will delay the skin from becoming wrinkles. It also prevents from external damage. We know that most men do not use a facial moisturizer as compare to female. It may be that is one of the reasons. 3. Men skin is generally 20%ticker than women, and they sweat more. Sweating is a good way of getting rid of toxins and keeps the skin clean. On the other hand, as women age or slowly get to menopause, the estrogen level will be decrease. Therefore, less sebum will be produce. This causes the skin to become thinner and more wrinkles.\nI hate to admit it but with the salt and paper and the laughing line, men age better. However, with all this information provided, I still believe that women age better because they are more active than ever before, they get treatment for the hormonal imbalance issues, they eat healthy, and in general, they appear much prettier and age better.\nThank you.\n"}], [{"score": 1041.4756, "uuid": "beea6441-ef8b-57f1-b089-0c233fbb164e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0304wb-46-23933", "target_hostname": "www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk/articles/uncommon-hypnosis/what-is-hypnosis.html", "page_rank": 1.2906862e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "What <em>is</em> Hypnosis - Uncommon <em>Knowledge</em>", "snippet": "The first step to being confident within a situation <em>is</em> to truly imagine being confident in that time and place.

I was chatting at a party the other day when a friend of a friend asked me the dreaded question - \"What do you do for a living?\" I say 'dreaded question' because as soon as you mention 'hypnosis' you usually get a barrage of all kinds of half-baked assumptions and mythology.\nHypnosis Unwrapped DVD - learn hypnosis at home\nPrecision Hypnosis Training - advanced hypnosis skills to blend hypnosis invisibly into any interaction\nInstead of saying 'hypnosis', I actually prefer to talk about 'updating instinctive responses' or 'enabling your unconscious mind to work for your best interests' but, you know, people like the word hypnosis. It conjures up all kinds of weird and wonderful images and - let's face it - people like drama!\nHow many times have I heard: \"Where's your swinging watch?\" or \"Can you make me eat onions?\" So anyway, this friend of a friend asks: \"Can hypnosis make me more confident? And how does it work?\" Bearing in mind that I was off duty!\nWell, firstly, how it works is pretty easy once we clear away all the piercing eyes, swinging watches and black-caped mumbo jumbo. Hypnosis is a natural state akin to night time dreaming, which happens during the Rapid Eye Movement phase of sleep, otherwise known as REM.\nREM sleep is called 'paradoxical sleep' because brain wave patterns are similar to how they are during wak-ing hours. During the last three months in the womb, the human neonate experiences more REM than at any other time during its life. It's during this time that many human instincts are 'programmed' - such as empathy, fear of heights and the ability to learn language.\nBy this time my new friend was looking glazed - quite trance-like, in fact. But by now I was warming to my subject and continued...\nSo if instincts are laid down through the REM state before birth, then it makes sense, during life outside the womb, to go back into the REM state in order to change your responses to things. Which is what hypnosis does.\nYour instincts try to help you out, but sometimes they've just learned the wrong response. So your instincts may have learned to produce anxiety when it's not actually helpful - such as during public speaking, dating or socializing.\nI've never heard anyone say they consciously decided to bring on a panic attack or a blush - these things just get switched on instinctively. So for 'hypnosis', think 'instinctive programming'. You can understand why you have a problem, but if you want the problem to disappear, it's your unconscious responses that ultimately need to change.\nWhen hypnosis has done its job we hear things like: \"I didn't even expect to feel different but, you know, as soon as I got into that interview room I just felt so much more relaxed!\" When people talk like this what they are telling me is that their instincts have updated. This is not the same as consciously learning something. And this is why we use hypnosis.\nGamely trying to keep up and perhaps wishing he hadn't asked, my new friend's next question was: \"Is this why hypnotists used the swinging watch method - so they can artificially induce the REM state in their subjects?\"\n\"Yes, I replied - now you're beginning to understand what most people never do, what hypnosis is and why it works.\" But you know the watch swingers hadn't made the connection between the REM state and the eye movement caused by the watch swinging induction - they just knew that somehow it worked.\nThe first step to being confident within a situation is to truly imagine being confident in that time and place. Your imagination is aligned to your instincts, and so can program them. People can imagine something scary, sexy or annoying, and their instincts can produce emotional responses - even when those these things aren't actually happening in reality.\nThe more dream like and rich this imaginative experience is, the more fixed the new hypnotic blueprint or 'template' will be for actually being more confident in those times in the future.\nUsing hypnosis for confidence means that you no longer have to try to be confident, because the confidence starts to become and feel natural.\nBut my new friend hadn't finished yet. \"What about problems? Can people cause them by doing negative self hypnosis?\"\n\"Sure they can,\" I said. If you think about an upcoming event at the same time as feeling nervous, then you are priming your instincts to feel anxious in that future event. But we use hypnosis to get people performing to the best of their potential.\nYou know the rest of the party was a bit of a blur, but I recall thinking that all truly successful people have learned to use hypnosis positively whether they realize it or not.\nIn summary\nSo to sum up, hypnosis mimics the REM state to help you program your instincts to create the sort of re-sponses you require.\nblog comments powered by Disqus\nUncommon Ideas for Therapists - FREE fortnightly e-bulletin\nDo you help people on a regular basis?

The fact that storytelling <em>is</em> now a tool for corporate <em>knowledge</em> management means that <em>you</em> should have a bright career ahead - even if <em>you</em> did get turned down for the Edinburgh Festival fringe!", "explanation": null, "document": "David J. Skyrme\nThis article was prompted by a thought from Jerry Ash (founder of the Association of Knowledge Work ) during a telephone conversation we had earlier this week. He is studying knowledge assets from a personal, rather than corporate, perspective. This personal focus on KM is a topic I revisit occasionally (see Have You Done Your Annual IC Review in I3 UPDATE/ENTOVATION International News No. 57 , January 2002). But what makes it more relevant now is the growing number of highly knowledgeable people, often with significant KM experience, seeking jobs. If we are in a knowledge economy, and the source of most knowledge is people, what can individuals, many of them \"let go\" by their former employers, do to improve their chances of getting a knowledge job that suits them. I'm not going to repeat all the usual advice given in career and job seeking manuals etc. (except perhaps to reiterate that I see far too many generic CVs sent out in a scattershot manner), but suggest a new angle from a knowledge perspective.\nWhat is a Knowledge Job?\nMost of us these days do work that is knowledge-intensive. The nature of this work varies greatly, depending on the domain of knowledge, the tasks involved, the organizational context etc. Much of it is relatively unstructured, not easily lending itself to automation. Sure, we use computers as information retrieval and processing tools, but it us as humans who normally decide how to go about a task and which knowledge we shall and shall not use. However, because we are in a 'job', our employer and boss 'pigeon holes' us into a role, and quite often determines what we should do.\nA 'job' is a set of work tasks associated with a role. Because the nature and volume of work tasks is increasingly dynamic, and the skills needed for successful execution vary task by task, the chances of having the right person in the right role for the right task at the right time is quite low; it requires expertise in work scheduling and pattern matching to mesh available human resources to required tasks. As consulting and other project-based organizations know, matching tasks with people and human resource scheduling is a core competency that allows them to put together temporary teams selected for the tasks in hand. Unfortunately too many organizations still think in terms of jobs within business functions, since that's the way their organization is designed. This means that too often, individuals are stuck doing tasks they don't enjoy and organizations are not carrying out their portfolio of work in the optimum way.\nA large number of individuals are indeed moving away from the job scenario as are organizations moving towards more flexible work arrangements. These individuals do temporary work assignments that fit in with their lifestyle interests and patterns. They are 'free agents' who decide which work packages interest them. Of course, many people stick to 'jobs', even when unhappy, because of stability, financial security and pension rights, but even these certainties are getting flimsier daily.\nSo the first point to consider when you are considering your next career move, is do you want a job, or do you really want a certain type and mix of work assignments? Do you want to fit into an existing job or create your own job? What I am suggesting is that for many people seeking a knowledge 'job' could be a constraint on your career, compared to exploiting your knowledge anchors (see below).\nKnowledge Anchors\nPeople perform better at those tasks that interest and stimulate them and for which they are competent. Obvious really, but it often takes people many years to fully understand their inner drives and core capabilities. Indeed, in terms of careers, Edgar Schein suggested that it was often mid-life (late 30s and 40s) before an individual's career anchor becomes clear. Our anchor is the \"dominant motivator\" that guides us into the type of work we want to do. Schein in his book 'Career Anchors: Discovering Your Real Value (1990)' identified 8 main anchors that are found in different people. These are technical/functional, general management, autonomy/independence, security/stability, entrepreneurial/creativity, service/dedication (to a cause), challenge and lifestyle. Most people find that one anchor is dominant. By analogy, I suggest each of us has just a few types of knowledge anchor, which determine the type of knowledge work that motivates us. I propose the following:\nThe expert - you have expertise in a domain of knowledge or a particular skill. You enjoy honing your knowledge and exercising your core skills. You are the recognized \"expert\" and stay with your choosen knowledge domain over many years.\nKnowledge analyst - you love assimilating knowledge from many sources. You have many of the attributes of the expert (but are perhaps not as self-opinionated or self-promotionalist) and also of the packager. Others respect your views and like your 'rational' knowledge to support their arguments.\nKnowledge leader - you have a broad area of knowledge and build bridges between knowledge (and people) in different domains. You are a generalist, not a specialist. You see the big picture and how knowledge supports organizational objective. You're the future CKO or CEO.\nKnowledge networker - you are a knowledge broker and connector. You connect people to people and people to knowledge. A hybrid of expertise and leadership - you're scope is not too broad and you have a large address book. You don't know all the answers yourself, but you know a person who does.\nKnowledge custodian - you like everything to be in its proper place. You love classifying knowledge and organizing content into taxonomies. You get upset if knowledge renegades upset the system. You're probably the knowledge centre manager.\nKnowledge creator - you're an ideas person. Always thinking of new things to do, you never seem to have time to see them through to implementation.

Skyrme\nThis article was prompted by a thought from Jerry Ash (founder of the Association of Knowledge Work ) during a telephone conversation we had earlier this week. He is studying knowledge assets from a personal, rather than corporate, perspective. This personal focus on KM is a topic I revisit occasionally (see Have You Done Your Annual IC Review in I3 UPDATE/ENTOVATION International News No. 57 , January 2002). But what makes it more relevant now is the growing number of highly knowledgeable people, often with significant KM experience, seeking jobs. If we are in a knowledge economy, and the source of most knowledge is people, what can individuals, many of them \"let go\" by their former employers, do to improve their chances of getting a knowledge job that suits them. I'm not going to repeat all the usual advice given in career and job seeking manuals etc. (except perhaps to reiterate that I see far too many generic CVs sent out in a scattershot manner), but suggest a new angle from a knowledge perspective.\nWhat is a Knowledge Job?\nMost of us these days do work that is knowledge-intensive. The nature of this work varies greatly, depending on the domain of knowledge, the tasks involved, the organizational context etc. Much of it is relatively unstructured, not easily lending itself to automation. Sure, we use computers as information retrieval and processing tools, but it us as humans who normally decide how to go about a task and which knowledge we shall and shall not use. However, because we are in a 'job', our employer and boss 'pigeon holes' us into a role, and quite often determines what we should do.\nA 'job' is a set of work tasks associated with a role. Because the nature and volume of work tasks is increasingly dynamic, and the skills needed for successful execution vary task by task, the chances of having the right person in the right role for the right task at the right time is quite low; it requires expertise in work scheduling and pattern matching to mesh available human resources to required tasks. As consulting and other project-based organizations know, matching tasks with people and human resource scheduling is a core competency that allows them to put together temporary teams selected for the tasks in hand. Unfortunately too many organizations still think in terms of jobs within business functions, since that's the way their organization is designed. This means that too often, individuals are stuck doing tasks they don't enjoy and organizations are not carrying out their portfolio of work in the optimum way.\nA large number of individuals are indeed moving away from the job scenario as are organizations moving towards more flexible work arrangements. These individuals do temporary work assignments that fit in with their lifestyle interests and patterns. They are 'free agents' who decide which work packages interest them. Of course, many people stick to 'jobs', even when unhappy, because of stability, financial security and pension rights, but even these certainties are getting flimsier daily.\nSo the first point to consider when you are considering your next career move, is do you want a job, or do you really want a certain type and mix of work assignments? Do you want to fit into an existing job or create your own job? What I am suggesting is that for many people seeking a knowledge 'job' could be a constraint on your career, compared to exploiting your knowledge anchors (see below).\nKnowledge Anchors\nPeople perform better at those tasks that interest and stimulate them and for which they are competent. Obvious really, but it often takes people many years to fully understand their inner drives and core capabilities. Indeed, in terms of careers, Edgar Schein suggested that it was often mid-life (late 30s and 40s) before an individual's career anchor becomes clear. Our anchor is the \"dominant motivator\" that guides us into the type of work we want to do. Schein in his book 'Career Anchors: Discovering Your Real Value (1990)' identified 8 main anchors that are found in different people. These are technical/functional, general management, autonomy/independence, security/stability, entrepreneurial/creativity, service/dedication (to a cause), challenge and lifestyle. Most people find that one anchor is dominant. By analogy, I suggest each of us has just a few types of knowledge anchor, which determine the type of knowledge work that motivates us. I propose the following:\nThe expert - you have expertise in a domain of knowledge or a particular skill. You enjoy honing your knowledge and exercising your core skills. You are the recognized \"expert\" and stay with your choosen knowledge domain over many years.\nKnowledge analyst - you love assimilating knowledge from many sources. You have many of the attributes of the expert (but are perhaps not as self-opinionated or self-promotionalist) and also of the packager. Others respect your views and like your 'rational' knowledge to support their arguments.\nKnowledge leader - you have a broad area of knowledge and build bridges between knowledge (and people) in different domains. You are a generalist, not a specialist. You see the big picture and how knowledge supports organizational objective. You're the future CKO or CEO.\nKnowledge networker - you are a knowledge broker and connector. You connect people to people and people to knowledge. A hybrid of expertise and leadership - you're scope is not too broad and you have a large address book. You don't know all the answers yourself, but you know a person who does.\nKnowledge custodian - you like everything to be in its proper place. You love classifying knowledge and organizing content into taxonomies. You get upset if knowledge renegades upset the system. You're probably the knowledge centre manager.\nKnowledge creator - you're an ideas person. Always thinking of new things to do, you never seem to have time to see them through to implementation. Your thinking goes off in several directions but you do come up with breakthrough ideas and innovative approaches.\nKnowledge entrepreneur - you may not have the best ideas yourself, but you do recognize those that have potential. You are the bridge between the creator and the packager. You have a good story to tell and are committed to making a difference.\nKnowledge packager - if you didn't do knowledge work you would probably be an engineer or mechanic. You assemble all the knowledge components to make something worthwhile. You help knowledge creators realize their dreams.\nKnowledge visualizer - you like pictures, so you get away from those boring bulleted Powerpoint slide shows. You make your points in images, diagrams and perhaps even cartoons and music.\nKnowledge activist - you are committed to a cause and will marshal the knowledge you need to support your case.

As consulting and other project-based organizations know, matching tasks with people and human resource scheduling is a core competency that allows them to put together temporary teams selected for the tasks in hand. Unfortunately too many organizations still think in terms of jobs within business functions, since that's the way their organization is designed. This means that too often, individuals are stuck doing tasks they don't enjoy and organizations are not carrying out their portfolio of work in the optimum way.\nA large number of individuals are indeed moving away from the job scenario as are organizations moving towards more flexible work arrangements. These individuals do temporary work assignments that fit in with their lifestyle interests and patterns. They are 'free agents' who decide which work packages interest them. Of course, many people stick to 'jobs', even when unhappy, because of stability, financial security and pension rights, but even these certainties are getting flimsier daily.\nSo the first point to consider when you are considering your next career move, is do you want a job, or do you really want a certain type and mix of work assignments? Do you want to fit into an existing job or create your own job? What I am suggesting is that for many people seeking a knowledge 'job' could be a constraint on your career, compared to exploiting your knowledge anchors (see below).\nKnowledge Anchors\nPeople perform better at those tasks that interest and stimulate them and for which they are competent. Obvious really, but it often takes people many years to fully understand their inner drives and core capabilities. Indeed, in terms of careers, Edgar Schein suggested that it was often mid-life (late 30s and 40s) before an individual's career anchor becomes clear. Our anchor is the \"dominant motivator\" that guides us into the type of work we want to do. Schein in his book 'Career Anchors: Discovering Your Real Value (1990)' identified 8 main anchors that are found in different people. These are technical/functional, general management, autonomy/independence, security/stability, entrepreneurial/creativity, service/dedication (to a cause), challenge and lifestyle. Most people find that one anchor is dominant. By analogy, I suggest each of us has just a few types of knowledge anchor, which determine the type of knowledge work that motivates us. I propose the following:\nThe expert - you have expertise in a domain of knowledge or a particular skill. You enjoy honing your knowledge and exercising your core skills. You are the recognized \"expert\" and stay with your choosen knowledge domain over many years.\nKnowledge analyst - you love assimilating knowledge from many sources. You have many of the attributes of the expert (but are perhaps not as self-opinionated or self-promotionalist) and also of the packager. Others respect your views and like your 'rational' knowledge to support their arguments.\nKnowledge leader - you have a broad area of knowledge and build bridges between knowledge (and people) in different domains. You are a generalist, not a specialist. You see the big picture and how knowledge supports organizational objective. You're the future CKO or CEO.\nKnowledge networker - you are a knowledge broker and connector. You connect people to people and people to knowledge. A hybrid of expertise and leadership - you're scope is not too broad and you have a large address book. You don't know all the answers yourself, but you know a person who does.\nKnowledge custodian - you like everything to be in its proper place. You love classifying knowledge and organizing content into taxonomies. You get upset if knowledge renegades upset the system. You're probably the knowledge centre manager.\nKnowledge creator - you're an ideas person. Always thinking of new things to do, you never seem to have time to see them through to implementation. Your thinking goes off in several directions but you do come up with breakthrough ideas and innovative approaches.\nKnowledge entrepreneur - you may not have the best ideas yourself, but you do recognize those that have potential. You are the bridge between the creator and the packager. You have a good story to tell and are committed to making a difference.\nKnowledge packager - if you didn't do knowledge work you would probably be an engineer or mechanic. You assemble all the knowledge components to make something worthwhile. You help knowledge creators realize their dreams.\nKnowledge visualizer - you like pictures, so you get away from those boring bulleted Powerpoint slide shows. You make your points in images, diagrams and perhaps even cartoons and music.\nKnowledge activist - you are committed to a cause and will marshal the knowledge you need to support your case. You can also be a knowledge maverick, questioning the status quo and raising doubts in others about the efficacy of their hard-won knowledge. Although an irritant to the powers that be, it is often you who initiates change.\nKnowledge seeker - ever curious, you are always asking \"why\" and seeking new knowledge. Even after you retire, you will go on knowledge delivery cruises to new exotic locations. The pursuit of knowledge for your personal fulfilment is your key driver. You couldn't care less if it's useful to others or not, but are always willing to share it enthusiastically.\nStoryteller - you cut into the bullshit and encapsulate knowledge into highly memorable stories. You have a strong imagination and look for analogies and metaphors. The fact that storytelling is now a tool for corporate knowledge management means that you should have a bright career ahead - even if you did get turned down for the Edinburgh Festival fringe!\nAnchors Away\nYou probably recognize some of your traits in the above anchors. Once you've clarified which two or three are your primary anchors - the kinds of knowledge role in which you excel and are motivated - you have the knowledge to frame or hone your knowledge proposition. You don't have to be seeking a job or work to do this. Just as its wise to keep your CV up to date for any eventuality, its a good discipline to have your knowledge proposition components ready for whatever situation might arise, with clients, business partners or peers.\nThe problem with many knowledgeable people, whether knowledge workers or knowledge job seekers is the tendency to adopt a 'knowledge push' strategy: here are my credentials, my CV etc. CVs and capability profiles these days are almost too predictable. Even though many are factual and good, few inspire the recipient. The ones that stand out are those that exhibit some degree of creativity and offer something of interest to potential clients. This calls for researching your targets (potential buyers, employers) and finding a proposition that is attractive to them. Don't wait for jobs to be advertised or vacancies to come available. A good proposition that demonstrates value to the recipient will create job openings or work opportunities that were not there before (80 per cent of the roles I filled in my corporate career were jobs designed by myself).\nYour approach should mirror your anchor. That way you are portraying your capabilities in a way that you do well. For example, if you are a knowledge packager, why not send your proposition on a CD as a short HTML file with links to more in depth knowledge resources? If you are a visualiser, why not send a pictorial brochure or a video? And if you are a storyteller, don't even bother to write anything down. Grab your target, take them into a pub and spin a convincing story - isn't that how many dot.com companies got their seed funding?!\nBut there again, by suggesting you sell yourself in ways that may be unconventional, perhaps I am revealing one of my own anchors as a knowledge maverick.\nThanks for the stimulus, Jerry, and we look forward to publishing some of your thoughts on personal KM in the near future.\nI3 Update / Entovation International News:\n"}, {"score": 1033.1483, "uuid": "8420ae1e-7f33-56a7-88e1-ba9f9d26a93a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-76-20479", "target_hostname": "www.helpingyouharmonise.com", "target_uri": "http://www.helpingyouharmonise.com/perceptionetc", "page_rank": 1.4247458e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Perception, <em>Imagination</em> and Technique | Helping <em>You</em> Harmonise", "snippet": "Rather, what I <em>think</em> <em>is</em> going on <em>is</em> that process of paying close attention to a sung duet, then articulating what <em>you</em> heard, <em>is</em> a way of training your powers of perception.", "explanation": null, "document": "Rehearsing\n:\nSince writing earlier in the year about the effectiveness of duetting as a coaching and rehearsal tool, I\u2019ve been reflecting again on why it works so well. One key point about it is that it\u2019s not about the people who are singing \u2013 it\u2019s the people who are listening who have the chance to grow. It offers people the opportunity to learn about the inner workings of the music they sing \u2013 how the parts around them interact \u2013 and also about the voices of their fellow singers \u2013 tone colour, vibrato, vowel shapes, expressive nuances.\nBut what is interesting is what the brain then goes on to do with all that information.\nArticulating what you\u2019ve heard verbally is a useful part of the process, since it brings categories of perception to the ensemble as a whole, giving each other things to listen out for next time. But if you try and make conscious changes to your performance in response to the mutual feedback, you find yourself over-compensating and increasingly struggling to control what you\u2019re doing. Besides, if you\u2019ve duetted all combinations of parts, you have far more information about what you\u2019ve all heard than could possibly be acted on consciously all at once.\nRather, what I think is going on is that process of paying close attention to a sung duet, then articulating what you heard, is a way of training your powers of perception. Until you stopped to think about it, you may not have been making such fine-grained distinctions between vowels colours or timbres, or how these interact in different parts of the voices. And it is this capacity to perceive in detail that underlies the improvement in ensemble performance that you get from duetting: each individual observation is useful in itself, but the increase in perceptiveness you get from making it is much more fundamental.\nBecause, if you think about it, if you can\u2019t perceive something, you can\u2019t imagine it. When I was a child I used to try and imagine a colour that nobody else had ever seen before, but yearn as I might to be truly creative, I could only ever conjure up colours that I knew, let alone anyone else. However wild our imaginings, they are always built from the stuff we perceive in the world around us.\nAt the same time, the reason that learning new analytical concepts is so empowering is that it allows us to perceive patterns that were always there, but previously hidden to us. So our knowledge of the world gives us filters to organise and make use of information from our senses, while our senses feed our brains the material from which to build our creative conceptions of how the world is, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 how it could be. So, if we want to be able to bring colour, nuance, expression and an apparently telepathic level of ensemble to our performances, we need to be able to hear those qualities first. The level of our artistic and technical attainment is absolutely bounded by the quality of our perception.\nThis is because our control over our performances is regulated by a feedback loop that monitors what we do, compares it to an imagined ideal, and suggests changes to bring the real sounds closer to the ideal. This loop can either be individual (when we practise by ourselves) or involve other people (such as the conductor in a rehearsal, or the instrumental teacher in a lesson). Either way, we practise until we can reliably \u2018get it right\u2019 \u2013 where getting it right means the external reality matches the internal vision. So, if we don\u2019t have the perceptual skills to make fine-grained distinctions, we reach an apparent \u2018match\u2019 and stop practising sooner than someone who can really hear the differences.\nA rehearsal method that builds our powers to listen, then, underpins both our capacity to fulfil our artistic vision in performance, and the detail and richness of that vision in the first place.\n"}, {"score": 1031.7867, "uuid": "f75505a9-0367-5318-bb49-a45a252357f7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1506wb-13-14516", "target_hostname": "www.academiclifecoaching.com", "target_uri": "http://www.academiclifecoaching.com/blog-life-coaching-for-teens/2012/04/02/constructive-curiosity-asking-a-better-question-than-what-did-you-learn-today-in-school/", "page_rank": 1.2130169e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Constructive Curiosity: Asking a <em>Better</em> Question <em>Than</em> \u201cWhat did <em>you</em> learn", "snippet": "One of the Best Videos I\u2019ve Seen on the Case to Revolutionize Education \u2192 Constructive Curiosity: Asking a <em>Better</em> Question <em>Than</em> \u201cWhat did <em>you</em> learn today in school?\u201d Curiosity can be a powerful tool that builds relationships or it can be simply annoying.

If <em>you</em> have not yet bowed down to Christ the Lord, then <em>do</em> not hesitate.", "explanation": null, "document": "Definitions of God\u0092s knowledge:\na. Knowledge.\nKnowledge is a simple act of the understanding, apprehending that a thing is, and comprehending its nature and relations, or how it is. God\u0092s knowledge is His essence knowing; it is one eternal, all-comprehensive, indivisible act. It is independent of anything outside God, it is total, perfect and essential.\nb. Remembrance.\nIt is God\u0092s knowledge in respect to things already past. It is not implied that God forgets and then recollects what has escaped His notice. Rather this term has an anthropomorphic slant. When God \u0093forgets\u0094 or \u0093does not remember\u0094 (as in the forgiveness of sins) it is asserted that He will not bring the matter up once again, not because of a deficient memory.\nConversely, when God remembers the thought is conveyed that God knows what has already happened, and is fully conscious of it. The Bible speaks of \u0093a book of remembrance\u0094 (Malachi 3:16), and \u0093the books were opened\u0094 (at the Last Day). All history is well-known to God.\nPrescience.\nIn regards to things future, or to come, God\u0092s knowledge is called foreknowledge or prescience (1 Peter 1:2).\nPredestination is founded on the prescience of God and on the supposition of all futurity being present to Him. If we allow that God from all eternity foresaw all things, He must thus have foreseen them in consequence of His permitting or foreappointing them. Hence events are not certain merely because foreknown; but foreknown because certain on account of predetermining reasons.\nOmniscience.\nThis Latin-derived word is used to describe the universality of the objects known by God. It is infinite knowledge (Psalms 147:5); eternal (Acts 15:18; Isaiah 46:10); universal, extending to all persons, times, places and things (Hebrews 4:13); and perfect, relating to what is past, present and to come. He knows all, infallibly and perpetually (Jeremiah 10:6,7; Romans 11:33).\nThis knowledge is peculiar to God (Mark 13:32; Job 36:4). It is incomprehensible to us how God knows all things, yet is it evident that He does (Psalms 139:6).\nWisdom.\nWisdom presupposes knowledge, and is the practical use which the understanding makes of the material of knowledge. This is determined by the will. God\u0092s wisdom is infinite and eternal. It is the selection of the highest possible end, the manifestation of the glory of God. It is involved in selecting and directing in every area of His operations the best possible means to secure that end.\nSuch wisdom is shown to us in the great acts of creation, providence and grace.\nIs the knowledge of God a communicable attribute?\nThe absolute knowledge that is in God is obviously incommunicable to any other, for to suppose that a creature would be all-knowing is to attribute infinity to that creature, which is absurd.\nIt is incommunicable because this attribute of God is constantly connected in Scripture with His omnipresence, and forms a part of almost every description of that attribute; for, as God is a Spirit, and therefore intelligent, if He is everywhere, if nothing can exclude Him, not even the most solid bodies, nor the minds of intelligent beings, then are all things naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do. Where He acts, He is; and where He is, He perceives.\nHe understands and considers things absolutely (not relatively, like us). He sees things are they are in their own natures, powers, properties, differences, together with all the circumstances belonging to them.\n\u0093Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.\u0094 They are known from all eternity, before they were made, in their possible, and known, now they are made, in their actual, existence. This type of knowledge is therefore incommunicable.\nAngels and human being have some knowledge, limited and growing; it is grounded upon God\u0092s knowledge and derived from God, totally dependent on God\u0092s unlimited knowledge.\n\u0093The speculative knowledge of God\u0094\nThis refers to such divine knowledge when the truth of a thing is known without a respect to any working or practical operation. The knowledge of things possible is in God only speculative.\nSometimes it is called a practical knowledge because it tends to operation and practice. It is the principle of working about things that are known. It is the knowledge God has of the things He has decreed, terminating in the act of creation, which is not a natural and necessary act (for God), as the loving Himself, and delighting in Himself is. Creation was wholly free, for it was at His liberty whether He would create or not. \u0093He hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion\u0094 (Jeremiah 10:12).\nSuch also is His knowledge of the things He has created, and which are in being. His knowledge in such a case terminates in the government of them for His own glorious ends. By this knowledge \u0093the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down their dew\u0094 (Proverbs 3:20).\nSo God\u0092s speculative knowledge is the knowledge whereby He knows the essence, qualities, and properties of what He creates and governs. By such knowledge His glory is enhanced, and the common good of the world over which He resides is assured. Only God has such knowledge.\nSpeculative knowledge then is God\u0092s knowledge of Himself and things possible. Practical knowledge is His knowledge of His creatures and things governable; yet this practical knowledge is not only of things that are made, but of things which are possible, which God might make, though He will not.\nDoes God have a knowledge of all sin?\nNot only does God know all details about every creature but also about all their actions, most particularly the ways of men. \u0093Doth he not see all my ways, and count all my steps\u0094 (Job 31:4). Their wanderings are known to Him (Psalms 56:8). He sees all their goings (Job 34:21). He exactly ponders man\u0092s behaviour (Proverbs 5:21).\nAs God knows all the actions of creatures, so He knows all the thoughts of them. \u0093He tries the heart and the reins\u0094 (Psalms 7:9). \u0093Hell and destruction are before him, much more then the hearts of the children of men\u0094 (Proverbs 15:11). So much so that David in worship exclaims, \u0093Thou understandest my thoughts afar off\u0094 (Psalms 139:2).\nGod being omniscient, He is also holy and righteous. If He were not all-knowing, He could not be the Judge of all the earth, but since nothing is concealed from His eyes, He, being omnipotent, is able to exercise His justice and equity unto all. He examines us by the standard of His law. |He will render to each one according as his deeds, and according to the imagination of his heart, for God who fashioned the heart, understands the motions of it (Psalms 33:13,15).\nThis is the glory of God at the last day, \u0093to manifest the secrets of all hearts\u0094 (1 Corinthians 4:5). And the prophet links the power of judging and the prerogative of trying the hearts together: \u0093But thou, O Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart\u0094 (Jeremiah 11:20). Furthermore: \u0093I, the Lord, search the heart, I try the reins, to give every man according to his way, and according to the fruit of his doings\u0094 (Jeremiah 17:10).\nJudgement being reserved for the Last Day, we ought not to think that God is indifferent or somehow grown careless to righteousness, even though we witness heaps of injustice around us. The Judge of all the earth will certainly do right; He knows the difference between right and wrong. He keeps record, and though we may suffer injustice from the hands of man, being defrauded of what is ours, we may assure ourselves that God will right all wrongs, for He knows about them unfailingly.\nUnbelievers may arrogantly assume that they can get away with despising God\u0092s law. They think that they can go on enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin, and nobody notices. But God does! And it is with Him that we have to do.\nIf you have not yet bowed down to Christ the Lord, then do not hesitate. Flee to Him who alone is able to deliver you from the wrath to come (1 Thessalonians 1:9-10). In Him alone is there good hope. Through His shed blood your sins will be cancelled and forgiven, so much so that God \u0093will remember them no more.\u0094\nWhat would the implications be if God had no knowledge of future events?\nGod knows all future things, all things to come. Everything which is the object of God\u0092s knowledge without Himself was once only future.\nIf this were not so, then all the prophecies in the Bible, at least those which have already been fulfilled, have no explanations whatsoever. If God does not know the future, then who does? If the Creator is lacking, how much more the creature that came from His hands? Who wrote the happenings of the future? How could it be done? It would remain for us an enormous mystery.\nAgain, what about the prophecies in Holy Writ that still await fulfilment? If God were not omniscient, how can we believe them? And if we defer from believing them, then we are acting as judges over the Word of God, editing here and there according to our whims. This would blasphemously imply that we are stronger than God.\nIf God is ignorant of the future, than we mortals are in this respect, at least, greater than God. For we know some things still future. We know when the next solar eclipse will happen; we know when the next elections will take place, and so on. Some future things are known by men; and we must allow God a greater knowledge than any creature.\nAgain, if God is unaware of the future, then His eternal decree comes to nought. It could not be true, for in decreeing and determining all things whatsoever, He must know the future. If He doesn\u0092t then His decree of creations, providence and grace is a fiction. But to admit this is the height of impiety.\nAnother point: if God did not know all future things, He would be mutable in His knowledge, and therefore a changeable God. He would be becoming better and better every day, graduating from relative ignorance to relative intelligibility. But a mutable God is not infinite, and therefore no God at all.\nIf God were ignorant of the future, He would naturally be ignorant of all contingencies. He would not know all things that shall accidentally happen. We speak about chance happenings, for in our ignorance they so appear. But the Scripture affirms that God knows and even arranges all contingencies to happen (1 Kings 22:39). Is the Scripture therefore at fault? If we admit this we would be destroying the very foundations of our faith.\nHow does God know all things?\nAs there is a vast distance between the essence of God and our being, so there is between the thoughts of God and our thoughts. We think about God\u0092s knowledge, then, our conclusions must be taken from His Word.\n1. God knows by His own essence. |He sees the nature of things in the ideas of His own mind. He sees the events of things in the decrees of His own will. He knows them by knowing Himself, not by viewing the things.\nGod does not depend on the creature to acquire information from it. If it were so, God would then obtain a perfection from those things which are below Himself.\nAs He sees all things possible in His own power, because He is able to produce them, so He sees all things future in His own will, decreeing to effect them.\nHis knowledge is then more noble, and of an infinitely height elevation than ours, or the knowledge of any creature can be. He knows all things by one comprehension of the causes in Himself.\n2. God knows all things by one act of intuition. If God knows by His own essence, He knows all things by one act. What God sees He pierces into by one glance from eternity to eternity.\nGod does not know things discursively from other things. Neither does He know things successively, one after the other. He does not deduce one fact from another.\nThis is concluded because of God\u0092s eminency. God is above all, and therefore cannot but see the motions of all. It is also because all the perfection of knowing are united in God. Man uses his senses; he fixes his gaze upon one object at a time; it is God\u0092s perfection that He can behold all at once.\n3. God knows all things independently. Since God is infinite in all His attributes, then His omniscience was not acquired from someone or somebody else. He does not receive His knowledge from anything outside Him; He needs no tutor and no book. \u0093who hath been his counsellor\u0094 (Isaiah 40:13).\nHis works could not be foreknown to Him, if His knowledge commenced with the existence of His works (Acts 15:18); if He know them before He made them, He could not derive a knowledge from them after they were made.\nAgain, how could His understanding be infinite if it depended upon a finite object, as upon a cause?\n4. God knows all things distinctly. His understanding is infinite in regard to clearness. \u0093God is light, and in him is no darkness at all\u0094 (1 John 1:5).\nThere is no blemish in His understanding. Nothing renders His vision obscure. Man discerns the surface and outside appearance of things; little or nothing of the essence of things. Our best is seeing \u0093as in a glass darkly\u0094 (1 Corinthians 13:12). But God knows the forms and essence of things, and every circumstance. All things are open to Him (Hebrews 4:13). \u0093He brings out the host of heaven by number, and calleth them by names\u0094 (Isaiah 40:26). On the other end of the scale, He numbers the hairs on every human head.\nGod\u0092s knowledge is never confused because of external factors: \u0093Darkness and light are both alike to him\u0094 (Psalms 139:12). What is darkness to us is not so to Him.\n5. Another characteristic of His knowledge is its infallibility. His understanding is infinite in regard of certainty; every little bit of what He knows is as far from failing as what He speaks. \u0093What he hath thought shall come to pass, and what he hath purposed shall stand\u0094 (Isaiah 14:24.\u0094 \u0093His counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure\u0094 (Isaiah 46:10).\nIf we do not uphold His infallibility in knowledge, then we would have to conclude that His knowledge is imperfect; and since He knows by His essence, His essence also would be imperfect.\nIt is therefore impossible that God should err in His understanding.\n6. God also knows immutably. His understanding, if infinite, must be unchangeable.\nThe knowledge of possible things, arising from the knowledge of His power, cannot be changed unless His power be changed, and God become weak; the knowledge of future things cannot be changed, because that knowledge arises from His will, which is irreversible. \u0093The counsel of the Lord that shall stand\u0094 (Proverbs 19:21).\n7. God knows everything perpetually. Since He knows by His essence, He always knows, because His essence never ceases. He does not know only in habit, but in act.\nTime does not affect God or His knowledge. A thousand years are no more to God than a day, or a watch in the night (Psalms 90:4).\nGod, being the highest degree of being, and unique in being, is therefore the highest degree of understanding.\nKnowledge is one of the most perfect acts in any creature. God therefore has all actual, as well as essential and habitual knowledge; His understanding is without bounds, unaffected by the passage of time.\nHow does knowing about the knowledge of God bring comfort to the Christian?\nThe Christian is a person born of the Spirit, and has a citizenship in heaven; God the Father is his father in heaven, and he is adopted into His family.\nNow since God has an infinite knowledge and understanding, and is all-powerful, then the providence exercised by God in the world must be for his benefit (Romans 8:28). For no father would neglect to provide for the wants of his family. God is omniscient and therefore sees all things; He is good, and therefore does not neglect the welfare of His children. He conducts everything to the appointed end, and included in that end is the ingathering of His church and its final glorification.\nFurthermore, our knowing about God\u0092s omniscience is comforting because of the Day of Judgement. God knows those who are His, and He will certainly own them at the last day, and they will be manifested for what they truly are, the sons of God (Romans 8:19). For this great event every mature Christian longs with anticipation. His wrath will not consume us then, for Christ has already bore the curse on our behalf. The books will indeed be opened (cf. Daniel 12:10), but His people, whose names are written in the book of life, will be vindicated, for there is \u0093no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus\u0094 (Romans 8:1). God knows about it, for it is He Himself who justifies believers (Romans 8:31-33).\nGod\u0092s knowledge is a source of unspeakable comfort to Christians because they thus are convinced that our standing before Him is not because of anything done by us (for in us dwells no good thing), but in Christ alone, who is made for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption. God knows our estate, our thoughts, our deeds; such knowledge drives us incessantly to cling to the Lord Jesus, to His righteousness imputed to us, and nothing else.\nOur knowledge that God is omniscient fills us with wonder, awe and praise. It is so comforting to own the all-seeing Jehovah as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He knows us by name, He knows our temptations and thus provides us a way to escape (1 Corinthians 10:13); He knows our cares and invites us to lay them before Him (1 Peter 5:10); though we do not know our future, our God knows it well enough. This thought should eliminate all anxiety as we approach the throne of grace with thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6,7).\nDavid enjoyed assurance that He will continue to dwell in the house of the Lord forever (Psalm 23); he mentions several blessings from above, all because \u0093The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want\u0094 (v.1). God sees all our needs and circumstances, and though He often uses trails to sanctify us, He knows how much and how long, and treats us as individual children. There is nothing too minute or too big for Him. Such knowledge of His all-encompassing providence must prove a source of comfort for those within His family.\n"}, {"score": 999.67145, "uuid": "9f01ddc2-5022-5914-b8e2-487eae7638d0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0816wb-91-21490", "target_hostname": "altongansky.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://altongansky.typepad.com/imaginationwork/2007/05/index.html", "page_rank": 1.1880112e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Imagination</em>@Work:", "snippet": "One idea that keeps writers going <em>is</em> the <em>knowledge</em> that their books may live beyond them.

(Wittgenstein, Zettel no. 274f.) [1]\nThe following few lines on an unimaginably wide topic remain within the limits of imagination. In considering imagination, even if its limits are at stake, one has not necessarily to be imaginative. It is a privilege of reflection that you can think about something without becoming what you think about. That is why I will proceed quite ordinarily: firstly with some remarks on Garrett Green\u2019s paper, secondly with a few hints how limits \u2018in general\u2019 could be considered, with at least two examples of the limits of imagination: otherness and memory.\n1 Some Remarks on Garrett Green\u2019s Limits of Imagination\n1 Metaphors of Imagination\na. \u2018Imagination\u2019 is omnipresent for us, because there is even no perception without the presence of imagination. To see something means also to imagine the backside of it; to hear something means (to try) to hear it \u2018as\u2019; to taste something is immediately affective, evocative and associative, likewise to feel or to smell something. There is always the ingredient of imagination in it; be it the remembered presence of the past, the expectation of the future, or at least the significant horizon of the present sensibility. Before any intentional representation, there is the representative character of the presence itself; being spatio-temporally connected to time and location, being \u2018for us\u2019 in a perspective and horizon and thereby being significant. To put it semiotically: everything is sign, everything is interpretative and thereby always as well imaginative. The \u2018as\u2019 of representation may be a latter rationalisation by analysis, but the representing and significating character of every presence means to be imaginative, at least for us. Everything for us is imaginative\u2014but imagination is not everything for us.\nThe basic imagination is not a possible subject of experience \u2013 dark and enlightening, inscrutable and unavoidable \u2013 but itself an ingredient and a condition of all perception, experience and cognition. That is why we have no empirical concept of imagination like that we have from any thing, but just a (more or less) rational construction of this transcendental power of theoretical, practical and aesthetic reason. Such constructions are not articulated by completely defined terms, because in regard to such conditions (not given to experience but always in and with it) we cannot achieve a final definition, but by conceptual or beforehand by pre-theoretical metaphors and similar figures. Such metaphors are as manifold as one can imagine and even more than we can imagine actually. [2]\nb. Green structures his exploration of imagination (following M.H. Abrams and R. Kearney) by two prominent root metaphors, the mirror and the lamp, [3] which represent two traditions. The mirror stands for the platonic mimesis-model, where the imagination is the counterpart of reason, disturbing the rational access to truth. However, for Plato [4] imagination is not only suspicious mirroring. Remember the \u2018phytourgos\u2019 creating the ideas, or also the imaginative myths and their function in \u2018enlightening\u2019 the access to the ideas. The creator of ideas is not less imaginative than the philosopher with his ingenious \u2018mirror of ideas\u2019. Even the mirror mirrors only by light. Platonism tends to an imaginative transcendence of mere mimesis, evident in mystics and in the platonism of the Renaissance, if man is seen as \u2018alter deus\u2019, not only inventing spoons. [5]\nVice versa, is a lamp really a fitting metaphor for the productive imagination? A lamp is an \u2018enlightened\u2019 metaphor for discovery, not for invention, at any rate not for creation. Furthermore, metaphors like the creator, the genius (malignus or benignus) or perhaps the sun (or nature) are images for the productive power of imagination. [6] That is why I would restrict the (suspected) \u2018true lamp-function \u2026to produce virtual worlds\u2019 (7) neither to Romanticism nor to the \u2018lamp\u2019 (nor to virtual worlds). The \u2018ways of worldmaking\u2019 are not a past extremism of imagination, but present as well and not always extremist. And if one imagines an \u2018imaginatio Dei\u2019 in the gen. subj. (like in the intellectus archetypus), God would not be capable of creation just by a \u2018lamp\u2019. Is a quite pale metaphor, if one tries to imagine the division of light and darkness and other ways of worldmaking. [7]\nTherefore the metaphorical schema of mirror and lamp seems a little bit too clear and too unimaginative. The suggestive power of such a schema is dangerous: it can restrict (limit) the research and its imagination to mere re-identification of what is suggested and pre-understood. The schema itself misleads historical and philosophical imagination (and memory): it \u2018mirrors\u2019 a clich\u00e9 (or stereotype) and functions itself not as a lamp to enlighten the past, the actual or the future possibilities (foremost not their creation). Expressed metaphorologically: the critique of metaphors is a way of discovering the limits of imaginations (as of metaphorical schemata), and this critique is more or less directed by rationality, but needs imagination (and memory) to become aware of what is lost by the criticised metaphors.\nc. Green conceives of the \u2018biblical world view\u2019 in connection with the \u2018ancient Greek ontology\u2019 (3), with the consequence that in medieval times imagination is suspicious (3), even if \u2018the Hebrew scriptures and the Greek philosophical tradition\u2019 are \u2018the principal sources of the concept\u2019 of imagination (4), represented by Adam [8] and Prometheus. [9] Especially in regard to \u2018Adam\u2019 one can question the justification of suspicion. His invention of names is a first act of human imagination, and not an illegitimate one. [10] So, why should imagination in OT (or more precisely in the Priesterschrift/Pg) be suspicious? At any rate \u2018the making of\u2019 the OT is an impressive document of human imagination, not only in \u2018Canticum\u2019. A judgement about the \u2018imagination in the scripture\u2019 could not be oriented by the explicit remarks, but would have to be a research on the \u2018work of imagination\u2019 in the genesis of OT and NT. Green\u2019s description of this tradition of suspicion shows critically, how the critique of a special use of imagination (the images of God and especially their veneration) narrowed the possible horizon of Christian culture, because the special aspect and the historical context of this critique seem to be forgotten. The suspicion of imagination thereby is not only pragmatically inconsistent but a severe undercutting of the opened horizon of imagination by the scripture.\nAgain a metaphorological remark: the imagination should not to be limited by remarks at the surface of scripture, but it is factually limited by the imaginations given by scripture (and its variety of \u2018imagining God\u2019). The given images and their tradition is a limiting background to imagination. But this limit does not only exclude imaginations, It includes and opens up further imaginations as well. In this regard I would follow Green\u2019s helpful \u2018inversion of perspective\u2019, not to reconstruct religious imagination as \u2018expression of experience\u2019 but vice versa as enabled and guided by the prior tradition in accordance with scriptural imagination. [11] Then it is not the question to find totally \u2018new\u2019 imaginations for \u2018your own and new experience\u2019, [12] but to become aware of the meaningful form of experience enabled by the traditional imaginations, helpful for its articulation. And this traditional background does not avoid innovation in imagination, because the traditional metaphors are not merely dead, but quite vivid if they are used imaginatively (against Ricoeur).\nd. If one has chosen the too clear schema of mirror versus lamp, one could have the idea of searching for further metaphors to mediate the distinction. Kearney\u2019s suggestion in this regard, the \u2018labyrinth of mirrors\u2019, [13] seems to be inspired by his object of research, Romanticism. It fails in my opinion, not because of the reason Green gives, that it may be pessimistic, self-deconstructive and a merely negative answer to the challenge of limits and more differentiation. But first it lacks light, because a dark labyrinth of mirrors is difficult to distinguish from a cave without fire. Second it is just an \u2018unlimitation\u2019 of the mimesis by its self-reflectiveness. But farewell to the model of \u2018original and copy\u2019 is not merely a negative answer. Moreover it could be a way of losing the restriction of imagination by the original/copy-model. [14] But this loss of a regulative \u2018arche\u2019 is a loss of limits. The (anti-idealistic) Romantic metaphor of a labyrinth of mirrors is a destruction of rationality\u2019s primacy, opening philosophy and literature to the \u2018dark side of life\u2019, fascinated by human\u2019s abyss after its repression by \u2018enlightenment\u2019. [15] Kearney\u2019s search for \u2018a third way\u2019 seems nevertheless to be induced by his suggestive distinction. That is rightly criticised by Green\u2014but he seems to follow Kearney\u2019s constellation, when he gives his answer. The rejection of Kearney is justified by the thesis, that he dismisses \u2018a central feature\u2019 of imagination in the modern period: the focusing lens, but before this, Green reveals his view of the state of the imagination, not with reference to Descartes and Vico nor to Leibniz and Cassirer, but by reference to Kant.\n2 Kant and the \u2018Einbildungskraft\u2019\nGreen\u2019s main reference for \u2018placing the question of imagination at the centre of modern philosophical attention\u2019 is Kant (3ff). His \u2018discovery of the \u201cproductive\u201d imagination can be seen as the watershed\u2019 (4), firstly because he sees its \u2018transcendental function\u2019 for mind and senses in connecting both, secondly because he explores not only its mediating function but its productivity (synthetical function), and in consequence thirdly raises \u2018the modern problem of limits\u2019 (4) by the thesis of the active, original role of imagination (4) with the question of warranty for its productions. The challenge then is \u2018to find norms\u2019 guiding the imagination \u2018into the pathways of truth\u2019 (5).\nFor Green the accent on the \u2018modern period\u2019 seems to be crucial. But his definition of this \u2018watershed\u2019 shows a rather broad river of the history of ideas and problems: The question of warrants for the products of imagination, raised by its productivity, and how trustful they are (4), is neither properly raised by Kant nor a (quite suggestive imagination) \u2018watershed\u2019 in the history of this problem. This question is quite older, remember the Mystic, the Renaissance and the Baroque traditions, or think for example of Descartes\u2019 problems with the \u2018genius malignus\u2019, and Vico\u2019s critique of rationalism and his rehabilitation of \u2018memoria, imaginatio, ingenium\u2019. [16] Imagination\u2019s productivity was not Kant\u2019s discovery, and the quest for reasonable limits not at all, rather his concept of the transcendental status of imagination, especially of its cognitive function (as \u2018synthesis intellectualis\u2019 of sensible perception and rational apperception by transcendental \u2018schemata\u2019) and of course the specifically critical quest for intelligible limits.\nIf one is oriented by Kant, one cannot avoid further location and precision of imagination in the two editions of his first critique. Green gains his thesis of the basic and central function of imagination for Kant by reference to the first critique, mainly to the first edition, in regard to which Heidegger formulated his thesis: In the Critique A Kant distinguishes three (subjective) sources of knowledge, the intuitive (sensible) apprehension, the imaginative reproduction and the conceptual recognition. Each of them is connected with a transcendental synthesis by which firstly the sensible impressions are apprehended, secondly past representations are reproduced and thirdly the past and the present representations are recognised as connected. Heidegger interpreted this threefold synthesis with Kant\u2019s threefold \u2018Bildung\u2019 (image-formation) and assumes that they all are functions of imagination: the synthesis of apprehension may be the \u2018Abbildung\u2019, the synthesis of reproduction with the \u2018Nachbildung\u2019 and the synthesis of recognition with the \u2018Vorbildung\u2019. The crucial point of this interpretation is that the three \u2018syntheses\u2019 shall be the expression of the one power of a transcendental imagination, which shall be the invisible and unknown root connecting the two stems of experience. [17] But the identification of this root with the imagination is not exegetically proved in Kant, as Henrich showed in his critique of Heidegger\u2019s interpretation, the one because the root remains unknowable and the second cannot be identified with any certain faculty. [18] Heidegger\u2019s identification of Kant\u2019s precritical three ways of \u2018image-formation\u2019 with the three ways of synthesis is nevertheless a quite innovative interpretation, but Kant-exegetically wrong as also Makkreel noted. [19] The precritical image-formation is empirical and associtative, the three snytheses produce transcendental unities for representing experience.\nIf one looks for Kant\u2019s opinion in regard to the limits of imagination, one has to distinguish his writings. Roughly sketched one finds first in the precritical writings three ways of \u2018image-formation\u2019 (Nach-, Ab- and Vorbildung); second in the first Critique two mediating functions of the \u2018synthesis speciosa\u2019, [20] the figurative syntheses and the schematism, producing not \u2018mere\u2019 images, but the sense of sensibility for the \u2018reading of the book of nature\u2019 by the determining use of judgment; and third in the third critique the reflective, \u2018playing\u2019 use of judgment in \u2018reading (and writing) the book of life and culture\u2019, or said with Cassirer, reading \u2018creation\u2019 in art and life (\u2018Grundph\u00e4nomen der Gestaltung\u2019). [21] Fourth, in the later work, especially in his \u2018Anthropologie\u2019 precritical empirical features of imagination reappear like sensible fancy, association, and affinity (\u00a728/\u00a731). Two distinctions are basic in the later writings, the active imagination (Einbildungskraft) versus the passive fancy (Phantasie), and both versus the memory. [22]\nIn addition to Green I would suggest to consider the question of limits also in regard to the third critique, at least because Kant\u2019s theory of imagination (as \u2018reflektierende Urteilskraft\u2019) is developed there with its mediating function (whether it is convincing or not). In regard to the first critique, the obvious limits are perception (given sensibility), the givenness of categories and the rules of synthesis, so to say the transcendental grammar of knowledge. In regard to the second critique one can extrapolate the transcendental grammar of the will as prescriptive rules, which imagination has to follow. The regulative ideas of God, immortal soul and freedom are the three topics of imaginative activity, further sketched with regard to the exemplary role of Jesus in the treatise on \u2018Religion\u2019. [23] There one could find the limits in the critique of dogmatics, transcending the moral-philosophical limits of imagination.\nIn regard to the third critique one finds a transcendence of the \u2018defining judgement\u2019 (bestimmende Urteilskraft) into the \u2018reflective\u2019 (reflektierende), [24] which is unlimited as \u2018free play\u2019 (KdU \u00a79), producing arbitrary forms (KdU \u00a722). [25] Nevertheless in the production like in the reception there is not an outer but an inner order of imagination in the inner fitting of the form judged by the sense of taste (purposiveness without purpose or perhaps one can say \u2018nonintentionality\u2019). The limit is the regulative idea of beauty, not as outer correspondence, but as a form of inner coherence or fitting. In the case of nature it is the paradigmatic phenomenon of \u2018the sublime\u2019 (KdU \u00a723\u201329) and in history the coherence with the (imaginative) order of teleology with culture as \u2018ultimate purpose\u2019. [26]\nIn these regards the judgement is not given by \u2018objective\u2019 criteria, but by subjective ones requesting objective validity. The \u2018free play\u2019 is free in an order, which limits imagination and is also created by it. But this order is not to be objectively proved. One can call it a cultural order, a \u2018subjective objectivity\u2019, regulating teleologically what is expected (or to be hoped for), what is beautiful and what may be the realisation of \u2018the good\u2019. If one follows Makkreel, it is a \u2018way of life\u2019 felt by the \u2018sensus interior\u2019 [27] (as the \u2018feeling of life\u2019), using the imagination to \u2018perceive\u2019 the \u2018focus imaginarius\u2019. Thereby it is the form of life in religion limiting the religious imagination\u2014but i.e. the quest for one clear and distinct, even objective limit is invalid.\nConsequently, the question of limits is not to be decided only by a \u2018grammar of cognition or knowledge\u2019 or by a norm without context, but the question is pluralized in as many questions as there are orders, cultures and as well religious forms of life. Even within these different orders, the question will to be answered differently: think for example of the different limits in different sciences like aesthetics, theology and mathematics. There is no need and as far as I see no way to answer the question in the same way for different orders even in regard to the \u2018one\u2019 cultural order of sciences. And even in theology the question will be answered differently in exegetics, in dogmatics and in hermeneutics. But at any rate, the pluralism of possible and actual orders and limits is only a judgment by a spectator. Because someone lives in an order and within limits, they are (historical and cultural) given to him (as a gift?). And the symbols of this feeling of life are not only given by imagination in producing and reproducing representations (Vorstellungen), but more than perception, in the creating of presentations (Darstellungen). [28]\nIf one reconstructs the limits of imagination (in theology) by an inner coherence of a form, by a fitting in a cultural order, one need not pretend to make a \u2018descriptive reference to a real\u2019 as the main limit of imagination, but just the internal relation to a regulative paradigm. That would mean for example, that not the (pretended) objective reconstruction of the historical Jesus is the limit of religious and theological imagination (and interpretation) but in beforehand the (itself imaginative) reflective judgement expressing a belief like \u2018the word of the cross\u2019. [29] And if the historical reconstruction pretends to be merely a critique of theology\u2019s imaginative interpretation of this word, [30] it would thereby fall below the given limit of imagination (with the invalid pretension of transcending the limits to compare them). The limit cannot only be exceeded but undercut as well. Theology without imagination would be uninspiring, a mere \u2018definition- or description-machine\u2019. The spectator-judgement would miss the symbolic cognition of God as the \u2018focus imaginarius\u2019 of Christian (feeling of) life.\nThe hint to Kant\u2019s third critique could get further explication in regard to Cassirer. He has explicitly drawn the outlined consequence of cultural distinction of the quest for limits. His main thesis of the \u2018symbolic energy of the mind\u2019 can be understood as a theory of \u2018culture by imagination\u2019, because this \u2018energy\u2019 is the (prepredicative) synthesis of sensibility and sense like in Kant\u2019s theory of judgement. For the development of culture it is the productive imagination discovering and inventing new perspectives and horizons (or new aspects on traditional ones). That is why Goodman\u2019s already mentioned \u2018ways of worldmaking\u2019 is \u2018grounded\u2019 by Cassirer: new worlds, or less hyperbolically new worldversions (new orders or variations of them), are anticipative imaginations of real possibilities. By Cassirer\u2019s principle, the productivity of imagination becomes omnipresent, not basically limited, but limits arise by distinctions of different \u2018forms\u2019 and \u2018functions\u2019 of imagination as cultural formation (Gestaltung). Limiting imagination is then drawing distinctions given by different symbolic forms and functions. Thereby Green\u2019s thesis of analogy between science, art and religion [31] could get further explication, not by a theory of analogy, but by a theory about the production of symbolic forms.\n3 The lens and the paradigmatic imagination\nAgainst Kearney, Green suggests [32] the focusing lens (5ff, 9ff) (used equivalent with filter and a radio receiver [7f]), first to combine productive and reproductive imagination, second to avoid the loss of reference (like in the labyrinth of mirrors) in \u2018projecting \u2026 a nexus of coherent images\u2019 (7), third to bridge sensibility and understanding (which according to Green Kant never succeeded in doing [33] ). By the metaphor of the lens the duplicity of production and reproduction becomes that of the perceptive and creative use of imagination (7)\u2014parallel to the use of models \u2018of\u2019 and \u2018for\u2019 something. So the lens is not only useful in a microscope but also in a film- or slide-projector (7)\u2014the light can come from the inside and from the outside. The lens-metaphor itself is focused on the role of imagination in perception and puts the stress on clear and precise apprehension [34] (\u2018the intuited data is not supplemented or mixed with something foreign but rather organized in such a way as to make its [!] structure apparent\u2019, 8). But what has happened to the productivity of imagination? How can one produce new images with a mere lens?\na. One could remark that the lens cannot combine the aspects of mirror and lamp, because the \u2018enlightening\u2019 function of the lamp no longer appears in the lens-metaphor. Green seems to interpret the productive imagination no longer as productive but as \u2018focusing or filtering\u2019, directed by the opposition of perceiving the actual world against producing virtual ones. The lens seems not to be a combination and bridging, but a critical reduction of the twofold imagination into a twofold reproductive one. With the lens-metaphor there is firstly no light from imagination itself, secondly its function is orientated by perception of \u2018the real world\u2019, and thirdly \u2013 and that is why Green is right in his consequence that \u2018the problem vanishes\u2019 (8) (i.e. the relation of reproduction and production) \u2013 there is no longer a so-called production, or at least not the production Kant deals with.\nThis is shown when Green exemplifies the two uses of imagination, especially the \u2018truly productive fashion, to conjure images of the unreal, for example, in fantasy, fiction, projections of future possibilities\u2019 and calls it \u2018incompatible\u2019 (8) with the reproductive one (as not possible in the same act). But they are not only incompatible at the same time; they are furthermore not reducible to a focussing or projecting use of a lens. You will never get a fiction by mere focussing, no lens will produce the projected film and the receiver is nothing without the invented and sent music. So to say: no vision, no imagination by a lens itself. World-making is not merely a question of filtering and focusing.\nThis loss of productivity in the conceptual metaphor of imagination results in the consequence that Green sees in the \u2018lamp\u2019-metaphor \u2018the danger that imagination will lose its foothold in reality and take flight in illusion or fantasy\u2019 (9). He seems to be guided by the difference of \u2018imaginary versus real\u2019 (10), with the normative accent on \u2018the real\u2019 as the decisive \u2018ens realissimum\u2019, whereas the imaginary is mere illusion. This accent on the \u2018realistic\u2019 use of imagination (bound to perception) with the critique of illusion (as non- or anti-realistic) resembles Kant\u2019s critique of fancy against the productive imagination. But, why should it be only a danger to \u2018take flight in fantasy\u2019? Why should the imagination always get a \u2018foothold in reality\u2019? And who is judging there? The interpretation of Christ by resurrection for example appears today to not just a few as without any \u2018foothold\u2019, and the significance of this interpretation cannot be proved by \u2018reality\u2019. There is no \u2018way\u2019 of limitation without a perspective of its user, and his \u2018foothold\u2019 (his life-world) could be decisive for the function of transcending \u2018mere reality\u2019.\nBy the way, it is to be noticed, that Green prefers technomorphical metaphors (lens, filter, radio receiver, slide projector, prescription glasses). On the one hand this is plausible, because imagination is a cultural technique (perhaps the main technique [35] ). One could say that by imagination technique is produced as in the invention of instruments, capable of what you cannot do \u2018by your hands\u2019 or by the senses. The lens focuses in a way the eyes are not capable of. So the products of imagination are used as metaphors for the productive power. It is the same manner of invention in the case of the mirror or the lamp: the inventions are (with Goodman) exemplifications and expressions for the inventive power, an imagination as metaphor for imagination. On the other hand, if one notes this genesis of metaphor, one could consider why there are not chosen other cultural fields than the technical one? Take for example the fire as natural \u2018donation\u2019 (imagined as divine origin), able to destroy and to produce, fascinating and dangerous, bridging nature and culture; or think of the author, be it the author of the \u2018book of life\u2019 or the \u2018book of nature\u2019, of \u2018scripture\u2019 or of \u2018scriptures\u2019; think of love, full of imagination, sometimes blind, but a profound way of creative perception; or think as well of the artist. There are many fields of imaginations, fitting as metaphors for imagination\u2014and opening other perspectives and horizons of seeing and thinking imagination.\nGreen chooses products with the function of reproduction (inwards or outwards by the lens and the filter) or for getting information (receiver)\u2014but not for products with the function of production or itself productive. The metaphor of the lens itself is an image for imagination to focus its function for perception. Within this reproductive aspect the intended bridging is simpler than the one between production and reproduction. It seems to me, that Green restricts the field of attention to a selection of products and only one aspect in order to make his guiding metaphor plausible. Opening the field again, extending the horizon, the problems would return.\nb. In the explication of his \u2018distinguishing the real from the imaginary, fact from fiction, reality from illusion\u2019 (10), [36] Green refers back to Ricoeur\u2019s early theory of metaphorical reference as redescription. [37] However, Ricoeur himself rejected this theory in his later works, because the model of description and descriptive reference does not fit the use and function of metaphors (for example as \u2018con- and refiguration\u2019 of \u2018life-world\u2019). [38] And a major function of innovative metaphors (I would add as well of the imaginative variation of traditional, topical metaphors) is not mainly \u2018to refer to something given\u2019, but furthermore to invent new perspectives, to transcend actual horizons, to become aware of contingency by the imagination of other possibilities etc. All of them are not mainly questions of reference, but of presentation of the unseen, the absent side of actuality (be it the past or the future or even what never will be \u2018real\u2019).\nGreen hints that the background to the lens metaphor is his theory of \u2018paradigmatic imagination\u2019 (does that mean, Green deals only with a special sort of imagination?). Paradigmatic is, according to him, \u2018the human ability to apprehend meaningful patterns\u2019 (9) and to recognize them. Again one can ask what has happened to the imagination as invention and creation of such patterns. Anyway, this paradigmatic ability may be \u2018exemplary\u2019 because it lets us \u2018see one thing as another\u2019. [39] This ability he defines: \u2018paradigmatic imagination is the metaphorical or analogical faculty\u2019 (9). [40]\nFirst of all, imaginations of a paradigm, like in scientific or aesthetic invention must be distinguished. Whether such an invention becomes a paradigm is not always a question of the \u2018quality\u2019 of this invention, but has also to do with the present conditions. That would be a question of \u2018paradigm-theory\u2019, not mainly of imagination. An other case is the imagination within a paradigm, which is no less relevant for us. But when Green explicates his definition as \u2018the ability to grasp something unfamiliar by recognizing similarity, by seeing that it is like something else that we already know\u2019 (9), the definition sounds more like Aristotle\u2019s definition of metaphor [41] than of a \u2018scientific revolution\u2019 by inventing or discovering a new horizon. Secondly, it is significant (like the technomorphical metaphor of the lens) that Green prefers visuality. however, it should not only be \u2018seeing\u2019, but also \u2018tasting\u2019 or \u2018thinking\u2019 etc. as well. I would suggest \u2018to interpret \u2026\u2019, because the range of semiotics is broader, and goes beyond the primacy of the eye and perception.\nThirdly, concerning the \u2018as\u2019 (\u2018ability to see one thing as another\u2019 [5, 9]) one could consider whether it is not necessary to distinguish the \u2018everyday-as\u2019 of any representation from more specific one, like the metaphor of the \u2018paradigm\u2019 seems to think of: It could be, as I would suggest, a conceptual or an unconceptual (like metaphorical) \u2018as\u2019. [42] One can conceive one\u2019s neighbour\u2019s dog called Paul \u2018as a dog\u2019. In this case it is identified and conceptualised as a special sort of animal, subsumed under the term \u2018dog\u2019 in the porphyrian way of order. It is seen \u2018as a dog\u2019 (or one could object, it\u2019s not seen as, but you see simply a dog, while the \u2018seeing as\u2019 is a reflective form of analysis). This terminological subsumption may be the same in the case of the rational function as in the conceptual metaphors \u2018we live by\u2019. But think of the name \u2018Paul\u2019 if the neighbour is one of those strange theologians which still deal with the old texts of the NT. The name becomes a resonance, an irritating interaction, perhaps with focus and frame, at any rate it is more than a mere quotation, it is a transfer with the structure of a metaphor (from individual to individual). To call a \u2018mess-machine\u2019, containing fleas and barking all the time you desire calm, \u2018Paul\u2019 indicates a quite individual view of Paul, be it St. Paul or the dog. Only the form of life could decide what is meant, the way the neighbour speaks with his dog or about St. Paul. Another neighbour, doing research on German literature, may be even more irritated, because Paul is a little black poodle, which his neighbour not only speaks to, but also seems to be sometimes a little bit afraid of. And the way Paul looks at him appears to the neighbour sometimes really diabolic.\nAt any rate, there is more than seeing similarities or seeing Paul as a dog. There are irreducible differences and semiotic dynamics, not to be conceptualized in the porphyrian way of order or in analogy. The \u2018as another\u2019 is more than subsumption. The stress should be on the \u2018another\u2019\u2014because metaphorically you interpret one as \u2018an other\u2019, and not only \u2018Paul\u2019 by the term or concept dog. One could even consider changing the \u2018as\u2019 into \u2018through\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019, to indicate that there is not only a subsumption under a term, but an interpretive interaction (a play of productive imagination) of one and an always remaining different other, the concrete dog and the more or less individual and imaginative devil or the St. Paul given by memory. The relevant difference could be explained as well in regard to the \u2018like\u2019, with its implication of \u2018unlike\u2019 (as Peirce indicated with his concept of metaphor as parallelism, [43] and I.A. Richardson with his theory of \u2018unlikeness\u2019, further explicated by Ricoeur\u2019s theory of \u2018to be and not to be like\u2019). There is basically an unlikeness, an irreducible difference of the known and the unknown, the old and the new, resisting against any subsumption of the new and unknown, responsible for the absurdity, if you take the metaphor literally. I suggest therefore an \u2018indirect\u2019 understanding of the imaginations: in the case of representation one can remember the \u2018appresented\u2019, the hidden and the forgotten\u2014all of it limits of representation; in the case of metaphors one should not read them as descriptions (not even as redescriptions) but as interpretations by significant difference with the \u2018detour\u2019 via the irreducible other.\nFor the question of limits is a consequence: an imagination taken as description or as an assertion becomes absurd like a metaphor taken literally. Thereby the limit is not the pretended \u2018realism\u2019 of \u2018redescribing\u2019 the world. A limiting difference appears in regard to metaphor by its other, be it the term, the definition or the description. There are other semiotic strategies of interpretation, which cannot be reduced to metaphor\u2014and similarly vice versa. Thereby the modes and functions of interpretation limit each other by distinction. A main distinction is the orientation in a horizon or to transcend it, by identity or difference, by identification in the world or by \u2018dissemination\u2019 through new possibilities. In regard to the function and dynamics of imagination as in metaphoricity I suggest a distinction between an orientation by identity, identification and further precision (like mostly in science), and the expanding of one\u2019s horizon by discovering or inventing new aspects, in an orientation by difference, not already identified, with a productive vagueness (in innovation in science and in literature, for example).\nIn regard to the latter, I thoroughly agree with the consequence Green draws: \u2018It is thus quite true to say both that imagination sets limits by its choice of paradigm and that imagination knows no limits, because of the open-ended nature of the analogy embodied in the metaphor or model\u2019 (11). That is the relevant paradox of imagination: living in an order\u2014and transcending it, like interpreting the OT imaginatively or giving rise to the NT by imaginative interpretation of passion and cross. [44] The genesis of a (new or variant) order arises by imagination, but following this imagination is within this (new) order. Imagination can give rise to an order\u2014and can live within the old or the new one. It can be limited by its (or by an already given) order, but the order can be limited by the imagination of a new or variant order.\nGreen\u2019s thesis of the \u2018open-endedness\u2019 I would understand by the hermeneutical reason of the openness of understanding, the infinite process of interpretation or in semiotics by the endless chain of signs and the difference of the immediate and the dynamic object (and not by the \u2018nature of the analogy\u2019). Anyway, if the innovating imagination can set new limits and (in this special case) \u2018knows no limits\u2019\u2014does Green end finally with \u2018Imagination Unlimited\u2019?\n4 Religious imagination and its norm\nIn regard to religious imagination, Green follows his orientation by \u2018reality\u2019 and the perceptive/apprehensive function with the primacy of the eye (11, \u2018to view reality\u2019). The religious difference according to him is (only or mainly?) made by the special objects of religion (11f), furthermore it shall be the religious offer of \u2018a way of seeing the world as a whole\u2019, i.e. \u2018a way of living in the world\u2019 (which is already much more than \u2018seeing it as a whole\u2019) by giving \u2018an ultimate frame of reference for grasping the meaning of life\u2019 and living in accordance with it (12). That means religious imagination gives a worldview implying an ethos.\nThe question of limits is raised \u2013 following Green in this paper \u2013 theologically by the invisibility of God. Thereby the limit of imagination is the divine freedom against all \u2018pre-cision\u2019 of images (13). This primacy of freedom I would question, because it seems to be a theistic principle, which is either limited or even revoked by incarnation, passion and death of Christ. In this way divine freedom is ordained by love not with the consequence that freedom limits love but vice versa, the self-precision of God in Christ limits his freedom\u2014or better, is made precisely by his own love of the other, concretely of the sinner. And this limitation may also be taken as paradigmatic for the ethos of religious imagination: not to enjoy merely the freedom of imagination but to use it imagining this love and in accordance with it. Otherwise one would risk remaining in an \u2018aesthetical existence\u2019 (or would imagine even God as existing only \u2018aesthetically\u2019). So, if one searches for a normative theological limit, one could use the christological (i.e. trinitarian) perspective of the Christian religion to explore the limits. One implication is for example the justification of anthropomorphism in Christian religious speech (and as well in Christian theology) [45] and therefore a \u2018principle\u2019 (or better a point of view) critical against technomorphism if God is interpreted by the model of causality, or against several phytomorphisms interpreting God by the way of nature, or as well against a \u2018mathemamorphism\u2019 interpreting God \u2018more geometrico\u2019.\nBy the christological grounding it would become possible to explicate Green\u2019s programmatic remarks, that the question of limits requires \u2018a theology of the normative imagination\u2019 (14). If imagination is limited normatively (and no longer descriptively) in theology, the guiding metaphor cannot be mirror, lamp or lens only. Whereas Green seems to be guided by the distinction of imagination and reality, in his programmatic preview he changes the distinction to imagination and normativity. It is a change from a more descriptive to a strict normative direction. And Green sees the question for limits as answered by a normative grammar (\u2018the grammar of the normative paradigm of the faith\u2019).\nThis program has already been explicated a few times, for example in J\u00fcngels \u2018Metaphorische Wahrheit\u2019: his basic metaphor of theology is the \u2018identification of the resurrected with the crucified man Jesus. In so far as this basic metaphor is an expression for an event, which becomes understandable only in the history of God coming into the world, this basic metaphor remains reliant upon interpretation by further christological and theological metaphors\u2019. [46] The beginning of Christian religion and its theology in this aspect is the metaphor of resurrection of the crucified. As beginning it is the limit, and what is interpreted is the dynamic object of the following imaginative interpretations. Its ground as its limit directs this \u2018great chain\u2019 of imagination: \u2018the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as event of the justification of the sinner. In this event the free choice of theological metaphors has its ground and its limit\u2019. [47] The problem is simply, that on the one hand \u2018the ground\u2019 seems to be the metaphor of resurrection of the crucified, on the other the pre-interpretative self-identification of God with Jesus as an \u2018ontological-event\u2019 of God\u2019s coming into the world. The status of the main metaphor and of the \u2018event\u2019 is ambiguous\u2014and J\u00fcngel seems to tend to a special ontological position (with a \u2018Seinsereignis\u2019).\nIf one searches for a normative founding of religious (and thereby theological) imagination, there arise at least three problems: Firstly an unmetaphorical founding of metaphorical speech, with the inconsistent revocation of the basic interpretativity of everything. [48] Likewise if one tries to found the religious semiosis asemiotically, for example by an \u2018immediate\u2019 revelation (whatever that may be) or a preinterpretative \u2018event of being\u2019 (Seinsgeschehen). When everything is imaginative, revelation and truth cannot be \u2018nude\u2019. But, one can object, because imagination is not everything, it is limited and directed by revelation, which have to be distinguished from all interpretative imaginations, like the dynamic object from the immediate one. But if the dynamic object and its rules of interpretation are only discovered by abduction (which seems to be the semiotical version of imagination), one can never go back behind this basic way of givenness\u2014if one does not try to critisize religion in general as mere and void imagination. But within the chain of signs one can draw the distinction of the (itself imagined) ground of imagination and its imaginations. That would mean a selflimitation of imagination, in order not to overwhelm its ground, and this distinction itself is imaginative. This distinction would be an expression of the initial otherness by which imagination is directed, or by a creative passivity raising the activity of imagination. Otherwise the imagination could become a void image-machine.\nSecondly, the problem of the relation between the religious and the theological imagination. I would suggest here a distinction: Theology participates in the religious metaphors, especially if it is directed by Christ as the \u2018paradigm of faith\u2019. But the horizon and the methods of theology are different from religion\u2019s. That is why the limits of theological imagination are different from those of religious speech. To consider if and how \u2018resurrection\u2019 is an imaginative metaphor [49] could be offensive in religious contexts, but in theological science especially in a hermeneutical and semiotic perspective it makes sense (and is not mere \u2018anti-realism\u2019). In exploring lost, actual or future possibilities of imagination, there is a (responsible) \u2018epoch\u00e8\u2019 of religious limits in theology.\nThirdly, to limit theological imagination normatively by the incarnation and resurrection could become too small a limit, which could be transcended by theological imagination (without missing the sense of revelation). If any considerations of possibilities are limited for example by a strict concept of heresy, so that the imaginative explorations become suspicious if they are not usual or orthodox enough, the imaginative development of speech or even J\u00fcngel\u2019s own tendency to adoptianism would be preliminarily excluded. In regard to Green\u2019s thesis, one can doubt his metaphor that \u2018religions employ imagination\u2019 (11). [50] How do we know who is who\u2019s employee? Is there not a genuine productivity of imagination itself, not working only by instructions of religion? The \u2018free play\u2019 of \u2018reflective judgement\u2019 cannot be strictly regulated in advance\u2014if one doesn\u2019t want to lose its imaginative power, its own dynamic. I guess religion lives by imagination, not only occasionally, but at any rate. Religion like theology without imagination could become uninspired and uninspiring, and that is why imagination should not be limited by a \u2018real reference\u2019 to interpret it as ordered.\nTake for example Green\u2019s definition of religion \u2018seeing the world as a whole\u2019 (12). By imagination one could discover as well that the world is not \u2018a whole\u2019 but fragmented and not already \u2018perfect\u2019, but marked by sin. That is why we imagine what we hope in an imaginative anticipation. And in respect to the \u2018way of life in the world\u2019, the normative aspect of imagination hopes for a life, which is not already realized, but imagined (and just given by imaginative memory of Christ). Thereby one could be aware of the (too strict) limit of \u2018seeing as\u2019 and \u2018focussing\u2019 the \u2018real world\u2019. Religious imagination is of course limited by the present state of the world, but especially in the Christian \u2018paradigm\u2019 it goes beyond this too limited actuality. One could even put in the place of a norm that religious (and theological) imagination should not be limited by the facticity of the present world, if they won\u2019t lose their imagination of the coming one\u2014like that imagined in the parables of Jesus.\n2 A few further remarks on quest for limits\n1 Who\u2019s limits?\nOne \u2018grammatical remark\u2019 in advance\u2014or at least: In the preceding few lines I followed mostly Green\u2019s decision to restrict the question of \u2018limits of imagination\u2019 to the gen. obj.: How imagination is or is to be limited. But to take the question in this aspect seems to presuppose that there is a chaotic power, coming out of the deep, raising the need to order the chaos. [51] So far, so usual; but in the critical quest for the limits, there may appear as well the question, what is limited by imagination in the gen. subj.\u2014for good or for bad. Think for example, that the small worlds of rationalism or the restriction of sense for merely \u2018real things\u2019 (if only what is to be counted counts) could be widened by a sense for the possible. [52] Mere stabilisation, pure repetition or a solipsistic identity may be limited by the imagination, that it could be different and that there are others (possibly and really). But there appears already a limit of imagination (gen. subj.) in a negative sense: what is limited by imagination \u2018for bad\u2019 like the other person or God as well, as they are restricted by imagination, or the presence, past or future as limited by what I can imagine (and what I cannot). This negative limiting by imagination is usually to be criticised, but one shall remember the positive limiting as well. And at any rate one should keep in mind, that if there are \u2018upper\u2019 limits, imagination should or cannot go beyond, there may be as well \u2018lower\u2019 limits of imagination, one should not fall below. Lack of imagination could be a problem as well\u2014and the problem is not always that theology becomes too imaginative.\n2 Limiting imagination by imagination\nAlready imagination itself cannot be imagined as omnipotent; in other words, a major limit of imagination would be its omnipotence, i.e. the unimaginability of an omnipotent imagination (even this \u2018chimera\u2019 can be imagined, but not \u2018consistently\u2019, so it is probably not real). At first sight there seems to be no self -limitation of imagination, while it is omnipresent in every perception, judgement, conclusion, in any representation or speech, and even in everything we do or don\u2019t do. But in memory of the neoplatonic tradition I suggest an imaginative experiment: Imagine an omnipotent imagination, imagining everything, even everything just possible, and not only what will become real, but as well the infinite amount of unreal possibilities. What will happen to this huge power of imagination? I just cannot imagine, that it could imagine everything at the same time, so there would appear a sequence, at least within the imaginations. But even if it would be possible \u2018in uno et eodem actu\u2019, could the imagination distinguish what will become real? That would have to be an owned act of drawing distinctions. And if everything imagined would become real by an \u2018intellectus archetypus\u2019, it would loose the unreal possibilities (they would be unimaginable for the then not omnipotent imagination).\nHowever, the decisive point would be, that the imaginations would have to be imagined as imaginative by themselves. Otherwise for the omnipotent imagination there would be imaginative otherness unimaginable. If there are imagined imaginative imaginations, they cannot be as impotent not to imagine in their own way, not ordered by an \u2018all inclusive\u2019 imagination. By this own power and dynamic of the imagined imaginations, they are creating new and own orders. If they were always directed by the omnipotent imagination, it would imagine them incompletely and thereby would show its own incompleteness. That is why the autonomous power of the imaginations limits the omnipotence of an unimaginable omnipotent imagination. [53] Initially it cannot be \u2018complete\u2019 and omnipotent, only and perhaps it may become omnipotent finally. But if finally in an \u2018all inclusive\u2019 teleology all other imaginations are (re)integrated, there would be a loss of their deviation and their irreducible otherness\u2014they would be remain on the way of teleology as \u2018burned out finiteness\u2019.\nIf such an omnipotent imagination is by itself inconsistent while unthinkable (if thinking is to be consistent), even logically impossible and thereby eternally unreal\u2014it is nevertheless imaginable. It shows, that the possibility of imagination goes beyond the thinkable unreal possibilities of Leibniz. But this thesis entails that imagination need not to be consistent. If Leibniz argued for the unreality of \u2018mere indifference\u2019 and arbitrarity, that they are not thinkable (and I don\u2019t discuss the reasons of his argumentation), he nevertheless put this unthinkable impossibility in an imagination: the chimera\u2014\u2018unthinkable\u2019 but by imagination imaginable. He shows that imagination goes further than thinking\u2014for good or for bad. It seems that the logical limits of imagination are not the same of those of thinking. One can imagine an entity with inconsistent predications, and one can limit such imaginations by rationality, but to imagination there is possible even the impossible.\n3 No need to prove\nThe last imaginable limit of such an imagination would be that \u2018everything is imagination\u2019 and \u2018life is a dream\u2019, even the dreamers are dreamt. Remember Leibniz, when asked how we could distinguish life from a mere dream, answered that it really could be that life is just a dream. [54] But if we were not disturbed, if we don\u2019t wake up or be awakened, there would arise no problem. That is why Blumenberg asked for his dream of happiness answered: not to wake up. This puzzling case of the baroque \u2013 in concrete the question \u2018is there something independent?\u2019, \u2018is everything just illusion?\u2019 \u2013 is since Descartes of course a background of all work to prove the \u2018existence of an external reality\u2019, of critique of the suspicion that everything could be illusion. But these proofs are themselves dependent on an imaginative conjecture. The \u2018will to prove\u2019 the real is provoked by imagination. If one lets oneself be confused by this suspicion, one shows the subtle power of imagination\u2014while trying to reduce it to the real. To prove, what is usually usual, where no need to prove is given, is itself an effect of an intrigue of imagination. But, do we need to prove of \u2018the other of imagination\u2019? As long as I am not disturbed by intriguing imagination, I see no need to prove the difference. The fitting answer instead would be to follow the suggestive imagination, conceding that life could be a dream\u2014while living with the difference, letting it unproved but quite clear enough to live by.\n4 Three questions\nIn such an \u2018ordinary\u2019 way I would suggest three aspects of the limits of imagination, indicating three forms of limitation, each irreducible to the other: a. What is not (to be) imagined; b. What you shall not imagine; c. What you cannot imagine.\na. What is not imagined is first of all a descriptive question. Even if we say what we see, we see not only what we say, or we experience not only what is possible by language. If one understands imagination in the tradition of \u2018Einbildungskraft\u2019, i.e. as power of imagination, there immediately arises the question of other powers. And if you draw the distinction of inner and outer ones, you will ask for relations and balance of powers, of the inner powers and of their relation to the outer ones. [55]\nIn the critical view these distinctions are of course made \u2018from inside\u2019, but nevertheless are necessary to avoid confusion. Awareness of contingency is possible by imagination, but it is as well awareness of facticity. You can imagine, what is not, or what could be different, but if you just imagine, what is, you are dreaming or you have a problem of perception. \u2018Imagination unlimited\u2019 would be a severe sickness. If one could not distinguish between usual perception and imagination, it could become a sickness even to death\u2014which is immediately evident, if one were to try it. But to distinguish critically imagination from perception like the possible from the real is far less easy. The whole project of \u2018enlightenment\u2019 is an immense trial of \u2018illuminating\u2019 this difference, to distinguish the real and the unreal, being from seeming (Schein) or perception and true judgment from illusions and imaginations. Metaphors and concepts are imaginative and reflective answers to perception\u2014while perception is guided by metaphors and concepts. There is an interpretative circle, reciprocity of conditions, where the distinction is not only descriptive but \u2018regulative\u2019, and a distinctive way of orientation.\nGreen\u2019s strong distinction between \u2018illusory\u2019 and \u2018realistic\u2019 imagination [56] is an application of this basic distinction to imagination itself\u2014and that is quite plausible. But what happens to \u2018illusory\u2019 imagination, imagining for example the unreal possibilities (like in fiction), which have been for Leibniz a decisive argument for freedom and morality?\nTo argue for an imaginative transcendence of the merely given, the ordinary reality and the actual world(s) and even the parabolic presentation of the \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 only makes sense against (and in) this background of \u2018ordinary life\u2019\u2014but they are not exhausted by this background they are transcending. If Musil argued for a \u2018sense for the possible\u2019 (and thereby for a sense of the possible), it makes sense against the background of the \u2018sense for the real\u2019 and it makes sense for this real (to transform it for example). But if the possible would be restricted to be only legitimate as \u2018real possible\u2019, the imaginative transcendence would become too small.\nb. The most common ways of responding to the quest for limitation are the various more or less normative ones. [57] They are itself at least threefold: the epistemic, the ethical and the aesthetical limits. To call all of them \u2018normative\u2019 is possible because they operate always with a critical restriction, whose principle of critique is not merely descriptive or just \u2018analytical\u2019 but dependent on a concept of reason, rationality, truth, freedom or \u2018beauty\u2019, itself implicitly normative (or with Green: dependent on a valid paradigm). Only by such a background-principle does the critique of certain uses of imagination make sense (like of the \u2018dialectical pretence\u2019, the betrayal and self-deception, or of functionalising art etc.). All of these limits are usually valid as well in religion, but as the differences show not culturally and historically invariable. The variability is not a case of arbitrarity, but of factual contingency, appearing arbitrary just for an abstract spectator. For one who lives in and by these normative limits, they are \u2018essential\u2019.\nThe main example for such a limit in Green\u2019s studies is scripture as the paradigmatic, classic and canonical \u2018work of imagination\u2019. [58] And he applies his main metaphor to this case: \u2018The scriptures are not something we look at but rather look through, lenses that refocus what we see into an intelligible pattern\u2019. [59] But \u2013 of course \u2013 are these lenses combined together like in a microscope or in a telescope? If you look at them, it seems not so. Only if you look through them, there is by this use (to live by them) a meaningful \u2018unity\u2019. [60]\nGreen\u2019s reference (or reverence?) to Calvin may evoke the connotation of \u2018tota scriptura\u2019, and raises again the question, whether scripture itself is the norm or whether the norm is a way of looking through scripture, where the \u2018user\u2019 is responsible. [61] Luther\u2019s canonical approach \u2018whether they set forth Christ or not\u2019 [62] is a focus, framing the scriptures and the use of them\u2014but is in itself quite manifold. Don\u2019t the Apokrypha \u2018set forth Christ\u2019, or the gnostic writings as well? Evidently it is implied \u2018how to set forth Christ\u2019 and how to do so in the use of scriptures. And for this normative implication scripture\u2019s user is responsible for. In other words: the norm is not given like a book. The responsibility for the norm cannot be delegated to an object, but the Christian himself is responsible for \u2018setting forth Christ\u2019. Otherwise the scripture could be overcharged by a kind of \u2018sacramental\u2019 view: if scripture \u2018is the revelatory point of contact between God and the people of God\u2019. [63] .\nThereby the question of limits appears in a new aspect: the selectivity and exclusion by scripture and by its use draw the line between orthodoxy and heresy, so to say between orthodox (legitimate) and heretical (illegitimate) imagination. Green himself is engaged in the stabilisation of this distinction, of the sharp line between \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019, [64] and that makes sense if (like in the second century) the Christian paradigm is questioned or even unknown, not at least by Christians themselves. But I would hesitate to respond only by stabilisation and with reference to an \u2018objectively\u2019 given normative limit. Not only because scripture in itself is not \u2018orthodox\u2019, but also because the actual and future life of Christian tradition(s) depends on the imaginative use of it. And imagination is not mere stabilisation (that is moreover a semiotic tendency of definitions and \u2018orthodox\u2019 terms) but furthermore labilisation. Of course one risks ambiguity by imaginative labilisation of a tradition, but to avoid this risk would limit imagination too strictly and could prevent future possibilities or even the possibility of future. If you begin with imagination, you cannot be sure in advance to get an orthodox result\u2014the openness implies as well an openness to heresy. And how do you know whether an actually heretical imagination will remain heretical? The parables of the \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 for example have been quite heretical in their time.\nc. The third question is an intriguing one, normally \u2018appresent\u2019 and often (regarded as) not worth being aware of. In imagination\u2019s work, there is an invisible limit, you cannot transcend, and which ends your possible world(s). [65] What you cannot imagine is not only a relevant limit; it is also significant for your perspective and horizon. What you cannot imagine is the limit of your world\u2014limits you cannot or at any rate you don\u2019t go beyond. [66] \u2018What you cannot imagine\u2019 is beyond your horizon, always \u2018appresent\u2019. That is why your horizon is a limit of your imagination not \u2018merely\u2019 normative.\nWhat one perceives is given to the senses; what one cannot perceive, one can imagine, for example the backside of the perceived other. But what is the reason for this \u2018ultimate\u2019 limit of imagination? Why does our imagination end somewhere, remarkable only ex post and often first by others? It seems to indicate a historically variable difference within the realm of possibilities. The possible sometimes becomes real\u2014but is impossible to be imagined at a certain time and in a historical perspective. It shows, that imagination is only possibly capable of all possibilities, and this \u2018possibly\u2019 is void without historical context and individuality. Therefore it is a main challenge for historical understanding, to become aware of what has been possible in and for a time, and furthermore how and when new possibilities arose. Such historical exploration of possibilities is for example the main question of Blumenberg\u2019s (imaginative) phenomenology of histories (of science and modernity) like in the case of \u2018The Genesis of the Copernican World\u2019.\nThis limit of \u2018what you cannot imagine\u2019 appears equally synchronically in the \u2018case\u2019 of the other. The irreducible difference of the other as other (called \u2018radical\u2019 otherness) is a possible subject of imagination (like of reflection), but itself is \u2018beyond imagination\u2019. \u2018What you cannot imagine\u2019 is the irreducibly different. Otherwise it would become only a function of one\u2019s imagination\u2014and imagination would forget the unimaginable. Therefore I would suggest as the other of imagination not in general \u2018reality\u2019, \u2018perception\u2019 or \u2018facticity\u2019, but the unimaginable. And that may have quite different forms of \u2018appearance\u2019\u2014remaining absent, appresent or at last \u2018beyond one\u2019s horizon\u2019. And, I guess, this limit is of major interest for religion and theology, because although \u2018revelation\u2019 will be located (or locative), it is in a salvific way unimaginable, if it is not a mere function of expectation or hope. I would even suppose to imagine that it remains in a certain way unimaginable, i.e. inexhaustible to imagination. Since it has taken place in the world, it is not to be reduced to a \u2018fact\u2019 or \u2018event\u2019, rather it remains a challenge to imagination as to memory to imagine the meaning of revelation.\n5 Memory as a limit of imagination\nA main limit of the huge company of Imagination Ltd., omnipresent, engaged in every interpretation, but never definitively taking responsibility for \u2018reality\u2019, may be memory\u2014to remember what could become overwhelmed and forgotten by imagination. In his book La m\u00e9moire, l\u2019histoire, l\u2019oublie [67] Ricoeur discusses the old topic of rhetoric, that memory and imagination are intimately linked to each other. What you can remember, you need not to imagine. But whenever you remember, you are more or less imaginative. And when nothing is given to memory, no testimonies, no documents, no further information, there you mainly imagine and you have to do so, like in regard to any \u2018beginning\u2019, may it be of the world, of humanity, of culture or of your life. [68]\nProbably the problem arises for Ricoeur in the discussion of his theory of history, especially around his reference to Hayden White\u2019s tropology of history. Because, if history is emplotment by tropes, historians argue against the dominance of literature, narration and thereby fiction over the past and the facts. [69] Ricoeur for his part does not re-enter the discussion of \u2018reference to the real\u2019 or, like Green that of \u2018realistic\u2019 imagination, but instead he asks for the limits of representation (not without a sidelong look to poststructuralism) against the traditional \u2018colonialisation of memory by imagination\u2019. [70] The question is, what happens to the past like to the other, if it becomes a mere function of imagination? Ricoeur is in my opinion not wrong to challenge the dominance of representation in the view of the past: \u2018la pr\u00e9sence en laquelle semble consister la repr\u00e9sentation du pass\u00e9 para\u00eet bien \u00eatre celle d\u2019une image\u2019 and therefore \u2018la m\u00e9moire [devient] une province de l\u2019imagination\u2019. [71] . Against this \u2018h\u00e9ritage grec\u2019 he develops a critique of imagination and tries to distinguish both as two different intentionalities. There appears the well known aporia, how to represent the absent and the past, if not by representation and imagination. And is not memory just an image of the past (image-souvenir)? But Ricoeur\u2019s response to this aporia is not a mere reprise of Plato\u2019s \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 (as true mimesis), nor an epistemic or ontological \u2018realism\u2019, but a search for a \u2018trustful\u2019 memory (\u2018ressemblance fid\u00e8le\u2019 [72] )\u2014that is to say an ethic of memory, how to do justice to the past. [73]\nWith regard to the aporia of representation in the presence of imagination there appears already in Aristotle (according to Ricoeur) the \u2018trace of the other\u2019 of presence and representation: \u2018L\u2019absence, comme l\u2019autre de la pr\u00e9sence!\u2019 [74] . The traces of otherness as of absence in the presence of representation appear at the border of imagination\u2014and indicate its limits. In his interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s thesis \u2018The memory is blessed with the past\u2019 [75] , Ricoeur stresses that \u2018the past\u2019 means, that memory is affected by time and in between the experience and the memory comes otherness and anteriority. I would suggest, that memory has a dimension of passivity by which it comes to consciousness. And insofar memory is affected by time and by the diachrony of past, Husserl could call it a form of \u2018passive syntheses\u2019 (like association). Thereby this dimension of passivity should become relevant for imagination as well like it is in association. [76]\nBut what happens to imagination in Ricoeur\u2019s study after the memory is liberated from its primacy? It seems to be forgotten among the memory of memory: \u2018un oublie de l\u2019imagination\u2019. After the scrutiny of past\u2019s conquest by imagination, it seems to rest aside as a successfully \u2018killed\u2019 emperor\u2014while the freed memory is reconceptualized as a trustful response to the claim of the past. There is no new understanding of imagination\u2014in severe discordance to Ricoeur\u2019s earlier works referring emphatically to it. And I wonder why Ricoeur does not recur to the schema of \u2018chiasm\u2019 to correlate memory and imagination.\nEven if there is no new view of imagination developed, there are implications in this direction: one could reconceptualize the imagination of the past (as in the case of the religious memory in Christianity) as directed by the \u2018trustful memory\u2019, that is to say as a (use of) imagination responding to the quest for present and future interpretation last and not least of the passion narratives. I would suggest, that the imagination can fruitfully be understood in accordance with the \u2018memoire fid\u00e9le\u2019\u2014and one could understand Green\u2019s \u2018faithful imagination\u2019 as further explication in this direction. [77] But if Green says apodictically \u2018Only in faith does the imagination correspond to God\u2019, [78] one could hesitate as in the case of the sharp line against \u2018heresy\u2019. Does that mean, that \u2018faithless\u2019 imagination never \u2018corresponds to God\u2019? A productive understanding could be, that the imagination, even the illusory one, corresponds to God\u2014for good or for bad. And this critical distinction becomes (a bit) clearer in the view of faith, but concerning the correspondence, faith can \u2018judge\u2019 only with severe self-limitation. There is no spectator-view from which one can \u2018judge\u2019 about \u2018correspondence to God\u2019.\nIf one reads Green\u2019s \u2018faithful imagination\u2019 against the background of Ricoeur\u2019s \u2018La memoire\u2019 there is \u2013 vice versa \u2013 a lack of memory as limit of imagination in Green\u2019s view. In accordance I would suggest that his theory of imagination should be combined with a theory of memory, which could \u2018limit\u2019 and direct the imagination. This part is done in Green\u2019s theory by revelation and scripture\u2014but why not by memory, especially by the \u2018memoria passionis\u2019? One could for example interpret the metaphor of \u2018resurrection\u2019 as an imaginative memory of the crucified, and if this memorial dimension were lost, there would arise severe theological problems.\n6 Otherness as a limit of imagination\nAs already hinted in regard to Ricoeur, otherness is a decisive limit of imagination. It provokes imagination, but is never to be exhausted by it. As evident as that may be, to \u2018reflect\u2019 on othermess as limit is nevertheless intriguing, because reflection \u2018reduplicates\u2019 it (like a mirror of culture), without being \u2018capable of\u2019 it, and is itself limited by otherness as a limit of reflection. [79] But imagination is vice versa as well a way of the presence of otherness, opening up the self or the \u2018old\u2019 world to become \u2018an other\u2019.\nM.J. Ferreira [80] points out with Kierkegaard that imagination is the vivid \u2018renewal\u2019 of the self\u2014which has implications for its necessity for any eschatology and soteriology. The transcending vision of a \u2018new\u2019 world, becomes by imagination an other than the old world. [81] Therefore only imagination shall be able to hold together the tension of \u2018has been/now\u2019 and of \u2018now/not yet\u2019. [82] But as was remarked with regard to memory, the \u2018has been\u2019 is not exhausted by imagination. There is a loss of the past as of the other by \u2018only\u2019 imagining it.\nThat is why one should consider Ferreira\u2019s view of renewal of the self according to Kierkegaard: \u2018The paradox of re-newal is implied in the claim that in the choice which constitutes the ethical a person \u201cbecomes himself, quite the same self he was before, down to the least significant peculiarity, and yet he becomes another, for the choice permeates everything and transforms it\u201d\u2019. [83] It sounds like Ricoeur\u2019s refiguration as transforming the self by the (imaginative) configuration. But are this \u2018choice\u2019 and the \u2018re-newal\u2019 possible by one\u2019s imagination alone? If there is not the other, one could never come from idem to ipse-identity. The imagination by \u2018myself\u2019 is not capable of the inexhaustible other, who is basic for the ipse-identity. In this regard I guess, finitum non capax infiniti. And does it not lack memory if Ferreira notes, \u2018we cannot do justice to non-ideal or concrete objects except through imagination\u2019? [84] One may hold the view, that only the inexhaustible imagination is capable of the inexhaustible other\u2014like infinitum capax infiniti. But is not the other infinite for us\u2014and not exhaustible to our finite imagination? That is a plausible reason for \u2018\u201cour incapacity to do justice to the uniqueness of each object or event\u201d\u2019 [85] , especially to the other.\nThere appears an irritating paradox of imagination exemplifying its power and its limit together: By inventing and presenting other possibilities (and possible others) imagination can change your point of view, perhaps even yourself and your form of life. Imagination imagines an other self and an other life. But imagination is not capable of the irreducible other, especially of the so-called \u2018radical\u2019 otherness. One may try to solve this paradox with the insight that imagination together with memory is the form of the other\u2019s presence to myself. But this reduplication of the other in an \u2018inner\u2019 and an \u2018outer\u2019 is not produced by productive imagination alone, even if the other is imagined. There is an exteriority at stake \u2018more exterior\u2019 than imagination can imagine.\nThe possible use of imagination (as of memory) to open one\u2019s self to the other shows that imagination (like representation) is not to be restricted to the often-criticised domination or control of it. But imagination gets easily into the danger of it. There remains the important difference (and thereby the limit) between the imagined other (as in the other possibility imagined) and the unimaginable other, irritating and transcending the imagined one.\nI would suggest understanding \u2018revelation\u2019 for the reason of this limiting difference as the religious origin of the awareness of this difference. And thereby one could understand the difference in the genetivus subjectivus of \u2018imaginatio Dei\u2019, not in a metaphysical sense, but as a difference of the imagination of the other and the other\u2019s imagination. [86] Of course this difference is itself imagined, but it is imagined as not only imagined, rather as given to imagination by memory.\nTo apply the paradox of imagining otherness to the theological topic of \u2018imagining God\u2019 I would suggest to put it in the duplicit (paradox?) rule: aliquid quo maius imaginari nequit et maius quam imaginari possit. You cannot imagine anything more perfectible than God, but he is always more than you can imagine. The positive dynamic of excellence-imagination is at the same moment negated because this other is beyond every imagination. What is beyond imagination, you cannot imagine\u2014even if you do so (and you cannot avoid to do so).\nJust as a final example for this intriguing paradox, I suggest recalling Ricoeur\u2019s final trope of \u2018forgiving\u2019 as a kind of \u2018memory (and imagination!) for good\u2019. Forgiving the other is not possible by forgetting as a loss of memory, but by a \u2018renewing\u2019 imagination of his future. The structure is to \u2018d\u00e9lier l\u2019agent de son acte\u2019, [87] and that shall be possible by a new view of the other, expressed in the words \u2018tu vaux mieux que tes actes\u2019. [88] I am not quite clear about \u2018how that works\u2019, at any rate it is highly imaginative, [89] imagining the other in the light of his future possibilities \u2018for good\u2019. But one limit is quite clear, this renovation of the other is not possible by one\u2019s imagination alone; it becomes possible and hopefully real just by a \u2018work on memory\u2019 and by the \u2018renewing\u2019 presence of the other. One could consider that both need another other to succeed in the renewing imagination. Because, how far does our capacity of forgiving go? Where is the limit of the imaginative \u2018Tu vaux mieux \u2026\u2019? It is Derrida, who questioning Ricoeur\u2019s view in advance, writes: \u2018il faut, me semble-t-il, partir du fait que, oui, il y a de l\u2019impardonnable. N\u2019est-ce pas en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 la seule chose \u00e0 pardonner? La seule chose qui appelle le pardon?\u2019 [90]\nNotes\n[1] \u2018Das \u201cwirklich Unendliche\u201d ist ein \u201cblo\u00dfes Wort\u201d./ Besser w\u00e4re zu sagen: dieser Ausdruck schafft vorl\u00e4ufig blo\u00df ein Bild,/\u2014das noch in der Luft h\u00e4ngt; dessen Anwendung du uns noch schuldig bist./ Eine unendlich lange Kugelreihe, ein unendlich langer Stab./ Denk dir, davon sei in einer Art M\u00e4rchen die Rede./ Welche Anwendung k\u00f6nnte man, wenn auch nur fiktiv, von diesem Begriff machen?/ Die Frage sei jetzt nicht: Kann es so etwas geben? Sondern: Was stellen wir uns vor?/ La\u00df also deiner Einbildung wirklich die Z\u00fcgel schie\u00dfen!\u2019, Zettel Nr. 274f.\n[2] That is why one could ask, whether \u2018imagination\u2019 is only \u2018one\u2019 phenomenon to be conceptualised in \u2018one\u2019 concept\u2014or moreover a heterogeneous complex where one finds only equivocations and resemblances. A conceptual homogenisation of this complex tends to metaphysics (what could be avoided by the awareness of the metaphoricity of speech about imagination).\n[3] To structure them by mirror and lamp as reproductive and productive is a retrospective and constructive distinction, seemingly already guided by Kant.\n[4] According to Green\u2019s thesis (in regard to Plato) \u2018imagination is chained to the bodily senses\u2019 (3) cf. H. Blumenberg, H\u00f6hlenausg\u00e4nge, Frankfurt a.M. 1989 (\u2018caves exits\u2019), and in regard to the decline of mimesis cf. H. Blumenberg, \u2018Nachahmung der Natur\u2019. Zur Vorgeschichte der Idee des sch\u00f6pferischen Menschen, Wirklichkeiten in denen wir leben. Aufs\u00e4tze und eine Rede, Stuttgart 1981, 55\u2013103.\n[5] Cf. Green\u2019s affirmation of Michelangelo\u2019s Adam as \u2018theomorphic rendering of man\u2019 (Imagining God, 87, see 95). A main reference for this view is (quite critically) G. Pico della Mirandola, Liber de Imaginatione/On the Imagination, ed. by H. Caplan, New Haven 1930.\n[6] It would be a separate topic to discuss \u2018 illumination\u2019 in comparison to imagination. I guess that the \u2018lamp\u2019 may be a secular version of the illumination-tradition.\n[7] Beyond Goodman\u2018s theory one finds fine studies on the images of the world in J.-J. Wunenburger, La vie des images, Strasbourg 1995, cf. his theoretical background J.-J. Wunnenburger, Philosophie des images, Strasbourg 1997 (in regard to the question of limits s. 249\u2013269: La faiblesse de l\u2019image).\n[8] R. Kearney, The wake of imagination: Ideas of creativity in Western culture, London etc. 1988, 39\u201343 maintains, \u2018the Original Sin is the \u201cbirth of the human power of imagining\u201d\u2019 (39)\u2014which is simply wrong. Imagine only that Adam and Eva had not to imagine in naming all creatures.\n[9] See H. Blumenberg, Arbeit am Mythos, Frankfurt a.M. 1979, is a reception-history of the Prometheus-myth.\n[10] And the \u2018fall\u2019 is not regarded as an act of imagination but of a betrayal in connection with the quest for cognition and life.\n[11] G. Green, Imagining God: Theology and the Religious Imagination, New York etc. 1989, 118\u2013123 (with G. Lindbeck). But this traditional background seems not to disallow new imaginations, not given by scripture, like Green\u2019s own \u2018lens\u2019-metaphor. Transcending the given imaginations cannot be illegitimate. That is why the scripture (as it is rather a intrinsic pluralistic \u2018limit\u2019 with many ways of \u2018imagining God\u2019) is not the only limit of imagination, because it seems to be the use and function of imagination, what are decisive for its religious legitimacy. One remark on the \u2018inversion of perspective\u2019: I guess it is questionable to correct the expression-model by its mere \u2018inversion\u2019. If the schema \u2018from experience to expression\u2019 may be misguiding, its inversion \u2018from expressions to experience\u2019 may be so as well. I would suggest as schema the more or less imaginative interrelation of experience and expression, a bi-directional dynamic.\n[12] This suggestive implication of Ricoeur\u2019s \u2018metaphore vive\u2019 is thoroughly questioned\u2014as well by Green, even if he refers to Ricoeur\u2019s early metaphorology. Instead of the desire for new, creative metaphors, there is the demand for the imaginative use of traditional ones (and what one normally takes for new is usually [not \u2018merely\u2019] a imaginative variation of tradition).\n[13] As Green notes (5). More precisely: \u2018the postmodern paradigm is typified by the metaphor of the looking glass\u2014or to be more precise, of an interplay between multiple looking glasses which reflect each other interminably \u2026 a labyrinth of mirrors which extend infinitely in all directions\u2019 (Kearney, Wake of Imagination, 253). But for Kearney it seems to be more a hermeneutic and destriptive use (not programmatic), and therefore plausible.\n[14] Cf. for the problem Ph. Stoellger, \u2018Der Wert der Herkunft: Zur theologischen Vorgeschichte der Originalit\u00e4t und ihrer ewigen Wiederkehr\u2019, in: J.

Literature and its paradigmatic function for the philosophy of language is not guided mainly by the Kantian tradition but \u2013 as far as I see \u2013 by Renaissance, Baroque and early Romanticism.\n[17] M.

Essais d\u2019hermeneutique II, Paris 1986, 213\u2013236, where he considers whether the concept of imagination he developed in his theory of metaphor semantically could be used as well in regard to pragmatic questions (in social action).\n[24] Cf. AA XX, 220f (first version of the introduction in KdU).\n[25] By the way, I suggest challenging Kant\u2019s separation of the active imagination from the passive, the productive from the reproductive. Firstly because it is a version of Kant\u2019s dualism he evolved against Leibniz, and this dualism did not stand the test of time and raised first of all the quest for a \u2018bridging\u2019 of reason and sensibility. Cassirer (going back to Leibniz and Renaissance-tradition) challenged this dualism with his thesis of \u2018symbolic pregnance\u2019. Secondly because one basic dimension of imagination (even of the productive one) is the association, which Husserl explored in his \u2018Analyses of Passive Synthesis\u2019 (See esp. E. Holenstein, Ph\u00e4nomenologie der Assoziation: Zu Struktur und Funktion eines Grundprinzips der passiven Genesis bei E. Husserl, Den Haag 1972.).\n[26] Cf. Makkreel, Imagination and Interpretation, 130ff.\n[27] Makkreel, Imagination and Interpretation, 90ff. Cf. I. Kant, Anthropologie, \u00a713 (AA \u00a715), where he distinguishes the \u2018inner sense\u2019 (sensus internus) from the \u2018interior sense\u2019 (sensus interior). The first is just the ability of perception in empirical intuition, the second the feeling of pleasure and displeasure.\n[28] By the latter the \u2018primacy of representation\u2019 is transcended. The \u2018foothold in reality\u2019 of such presentations is life in its subjective objectivity.\n[29] Cf. for the \u2018historical Jesus\u2019 and imagination D. Brown, Tradition and Imagination: Relevlation and Change, Oxford 1999, 279ff.\n[30] Think for example of the quite unimaginative struggle for or against the historicity of the (metaphor of) resurrection.\n[31] G. Green, Imagining God: Theology and the Religious Imagination, New York etc. 1989, 41ff, 61ff. For analogy see 68ff, 88f, 99f, 105f, 130ff.\n[32] In \u2018imagining imagination\u2019, i.e. in a second-order reflection on imagination, itself imaginative; cf. Green, Imagining God, 92. This pragmatic consistency is remarkable\u2014and implies the metaphoricity of theology (whereas Green says \u2018scripture is a work of imagination; and theology is an interpretation of imagination\u2019, ibid., 106).\n[33] That would be the point, where a view on Vico and Cassirer could be helpful. See for Vico: Ph. Stoellger, Metapher und Lebenswelt: Hans Blumenbergs Metaphorologie als Lebenswelthermeneutik und ihr religionsph\u00e4nomenologischer Horizont, T\u00fcbingen 2000, 103\u2013127; and for Cassirer: Ph. Stoellger, \u2018Die Metapher als Modell symbolischer Pr\u00e4gnanz: Zur Bearbeitung eines Problems von Ernst Cassirers Pr\u00e4gnanzthese\u2019, in: D. Korsch/E. Rudolph (eds.), Die Pr\u00e4gnanz der Religion in der Kultur: Ernst Cassirer und die Theologie, T\u00fcbingen 2000, 100\u2013138; idem, \u2018Von Cassirer zu Blumenberg: Zur Fortschreibung der Philosophie symbolischer Formen als Kulturph\u00e4nomenologie geschichtlicher Lebenswelten\u2019, in: W. Voegele (ed.), \u2018Die Gegens\u00e4tze schlie\u00dfen einander nicht aus, sondern verweisen aufeinander\u2019: Ernst Cassirers Symboltheorie und die Frage nach Pluralismus und Differenz, Loccumer-Protokolle 30/98, 108\u2013149.\n[34] Green calls the \u2018mimetic task\u2019: \u2018reproducing in an organized gestalt whatever aspect of reality we are apprehending\u2019, and the \u2018creative task\u2019: \u2018forming the raw material of intuition into meaningful shapes and sounds that we can recognize\u2019 (9). Both aspects are directed by an \u2018apprehended reality\u2019 and by \u2018raw material\u2019, and not by creating the material by inventing new \u2018gestalts\u2019 for example. It is to be conceded of course, that no imagination is \u2018imaginatio ex nihilo\u2019, neither retrospective (memoria!) nor prospective (expectations of the \u2018new\u2019). Cf. for perception/apprehension in regard to imagination J. Sallis, Force of Imagination: The Sense of the Elemental, Bloomington/Indianapolis 2000, 106ff, 111ff.\n[35] See H. Blumenberg, H\u00f6hlenausg\u00e4nge.\n[36] This parallelisation is to be questioned, because it suggests, that the imaginary is mere illusion. Greens lens-metaphor already goes beyond this problematic suggestion.\n[37] See Jeanne Evans, Paul Ricoeur\u2019s Hermeneutics of the Imagination, New York etc. 1995.\n[38] See for further exploration of Ricoeur\u2019s self-corrections Ph. Stoellger, Metapher und Lebenswelt, 243\u2013252. And cf. as well his later critique of imagination (with the consequences for his earlier metaphorology); see below 2.5.\n[39] Again Green shows his orientation by explication: \u2018to recognize \u2026the heuristic model that illuminates another \u2026aspect of the world\u2019 (9)\u2014and not to see the world in contrast to imagined virtual ones, to invent other worlds etc.\n[40] I don\u2019t want to enter here the discussion about \u2018analogy\u2019, but I would suggest at least one precision in the concept of analogy, like E. J\u00fcngel has given: one better should not refer theologically to the \u2018analogia attributionis\u2019, but to Kant\u2019s \u2018analogia relationis\u2019. It could be discussed, whether one should abstain from analogy because of the implicit ontology, or one should adopt Vico\u2019s tradition of \u2018setting\u2019 analogies in the ontological open horizon, especially in Green\u2019s stressed \u2018modern period\u2019.\n[41] \u2018\u03c4\u1f78 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b5\u1f56 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u2019 (Poetic 1459a) [ http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1459a ].\n[42] The German expressions, I have in mind are \u2018begrifflich\u2019 and \u2018unbegrifflich\u2019; vgl. H. Blumenberg, Schiffbruch mit Zuschauer, Frankfurt a.M. 1979, 79ff. One may combine this suggestion with Green\u2019s, Imagining God, 139: \u2018The grammar of as \u2026 is not ontological but analogical. The point of using as is heuristic: not to affirm that something is or is not the case but rather to draw attention to one possibility among others by proposing an analogy\u2019.\n[43] Cf. CP 2.277; Chr. Strub, \u2018Peirce \u00fcber Metaphern: Zur Interpretation von CP 2.277\u2019, in: H. Pape (ed.), Kreativit\u00e4t und Logik: Charles S. Peirce und das philosophische Problem des Neuen, Frankfurt a.M. 1994, 209\u2013232.\n[44] There appears the unavoidable memorial aspect.\n[45] Cf. J\u00fcngel, \u2018Anthropomorphismus als Grundproblem neuzeitlicher Hermeneutik\u2019, in: idem, Wertlose Wahrheit: Zur Identit\u00e4t und Relevanz des christlichen Glaubens, Theologische Er\u00f6rterungen III, M\u00fcnchen 1990, 110\u2013131. Anthropomorphism in theology also means metaphoricity in theology. If the \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 is articulated in parables as parables, the theological speech of the \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 cannot avoid parables (i.e. metaphors) as well. Cf. Kant, Anthropologie, \u00a729 (AA \u00a732): \u2018Die Einbildungskraft ist indessen nicht so sch\u00f6pferisch, als man wohl vorgiebt. Wir k\u00f6nnen uns f\u00fcr ein vern\u00fcftiges Wesen keine andere Gestalt als schicklich denken, als die Gestalt eines Menschen\u2019; cf. ibid., \u00a727 (AA \u00a730).\n[46] J\u00fcngel, \u2018Metaphorische Wahrheit: Erw\u00e4gungen zur theologischen Relevanz der Metapher als Beitrag zur Hermeneutik einer narrativen Theologie\u2019, in: idem, Entsprechungen: Gott-Wahrheit-Mensch, Theologische Er\u00f6rterungen, M\u00fcnchen 21986, 103\u2013157, 152f: Die \u2018Grundmetapher\u2019 sei die \u2018Identifikation des Auferstandenen mit dem gekreuzigten Menschen Jesus\u2019. \u2018Insofern diese Grundmetapher als Ausdruck f\u00fcr ein Ereignis dieses nur im Zusammenhang der Geschichte des zur Welt kommenden Gottes verst\u00e4ndlich werden l\u00e4\u00dft, bleibt diese Grundmetapher allerdings auf die Auslegung durch weitere christologische und theologische Metaphern angewiesen\u2019.\n[47] J\u00fcngel, ibid., 150: \u2018das Leben, Sterben und Auferstehen Jesu Christi als Ereignis der Rechtfertigung des S\u00fcnders. In diesem Geschehen hat die freie Wahl theologischer Metaphern sowohl ihren Grund als auch ihre Grenze\u2019.\n[48] That is (de facto) a problem of J\u00fcngels \u2018Metaphorische Wahrheit\u2019, not of Greens theory of religious imagination. He explains imagination as the \u2018how\u2019 of revelation, as the \u2018Ankn\u00fcpfungspunkt\u2019 with E. Brunner (Green, Imagining God, 29\u201341, 62, 84\u201388, 99, 110)\u2014where the problem arises that the revelatory \u2018imaginatio Dei\u2019 (in gen. subj.!) may be limited by an \u2018anthropological constant\u2019. But if revelation comes \u2018secundum modum recipientis\u2019, like J\u00fcngel emphasizes, human imagination should not be overwhelmed\u2014but perhaps it is given a horizon of real possibility never imagined by itself. The otherness of revelation is or has been beyond human imagination, that is why this \u2018locus\u2019 is expanded by God\u2019s revelatory imagination in a way that human imagination (of God) is not the same after revelation (cf. even the Jewish imaginations of the Messiah).\n[49] This hermeneutical suggestion of understanding the testimony/witness of resurrection is to be distinguished from the naive anti-realistic thesis \u2018there is no resurrection because it is not historically proven\u2019. This wrong conclusion by a pre-hermeneutical way of \u2018historical critique\u2019 lacks any understanding of the \u2018absoluteness\u2019 and expressive character of basic metaphors.\n[50] And \u2018ceterum censeo\u2019: imagination just \u2018to view reality\u2019 (11) is too limited. Think for example of the eschatological imaginations, \u2018viewing\u2019 a \u2018reality\u2019 not already real. \u2018What can we hope for?\u2019 is a quest for imagination, not simply viewing something real.\n[51] Green himself seems not to hold this imaginative view, at least not in regard to the \u2018realistic imagination\u2019. But I am not sure about his view of the \u2018illusory\u2019 one. Cf. Green, Imagining God, 62ff.\n[52] Cf. E.S. Casey, Imagining: A Phenomenological Study, Bloomington 1976, 119: \u2018 Imagining is entertaining oneself with what is purely possible\u2019.\n[53] One could choose another view of imagination: as an \u2018objective\u2019 power, the imaginative dynamic of all imaginations. But than as \u2018integral\u2019 it would lack the concreteness of imagining, the individuality and irreducible difference. Such an imagined omnipotence would imply by its instantiations the genesis of difference and a succession\u2014as well an irreducible difference to itself. Forms of such an idea are not imagination as F(subj.), but as F(language) or F(culture).\n[54] According to him we would realize the difference just by the \u2018little inconsistencies\u2019 in the dreams.\n[55] By the way, it should be noted that not themselves imaginative limits of imagination are its media and the body/flesh of the \u2018imaginator\u2019. The theory of images developed by H. Belting, Bild-Anthropologie: Entw\u00fcrfe f\u00fcr eine Bildwissenschaft, M\u00fcnchen 2001 (esp. 11\u201355) operates with these two limits.\n[56] Green, Imagining God, 62ff. The distinction itself follows the tradition like Husserl ( Phantasie, Bildbewu\u00dftsein, Erinnerung: Zur Ph\u00e4nomenologie der anschaulichen Vergegenw\u00e4rtigungen, Husserliana 23, Den Haag 1980, 16\u201330 etc. If imagination produces \u2018Vergegenw\u00e4rtigung\u2019 (representation) and perception \u2018Gegenw\u00e4rtigung\u2019 (presentation), the primacy of presence is grounded by the principle of the self-presence of \u2018the self\u2019\u2014and lacks this grounding if the structure of \u2018idem\u2019 is challenged by the \u2018ipse\u2019 or \u2018ille\u2019. The classic phenomenological principle \u2018the self-presence\u2019.\n[57] The question is of course not only to be put as \u2018What\u2026\u2019, but also \u2018How\u2019.\n[58] Green, Imagining God, 106. Revelation is an \u2018act of imagination\u2019 (who\u2019s?) and theology the \u2018interpretation of imagination\u2019 (ibid.).\n[59] Green, Imagining God, 107.\n[60] Cf. Green, Imagining God, 113ff.\n[61] Cf. as well Green: \u2018The choice of scripture, like the choice of eyeglasses, is personal but not therefore simply private or arbitrary\u2019 ( Imagining God, 108).\n[62] Cf. Green, Imagining God, 118.\n[63] Green, Imagining God, 125.\n[64] Ibid., 116ff (with reference to Luhmann!). Green objects to the \u2018expression-model\u2019 (from Schleiermacher to Tracy) as not able to draw this line (ibid., 121)\u2014and thereby it seems that they themselves appear to him a bit heretical.\n[65] The limits of your actual world are not the limits of your imagination, because you can transcend the limits of actuality like of reality. That is why a \u2018realistic\u2019 imagination may be too limited and why the \u2018illusory\u2019 imagination is intrinsic and necessary in order to live by imagination, also in religion.\n[66] The limit between what you do and what you cannot is of course not to be observed, not a visible line.\n[67] P. Ricoeur, La m\u00e9moire, l\u2019histoire, l\u2019oublie, Paris 2000.\n[68] Cf. Blumenberg, H\u00f6hlenausg\u00e4nge, ch. 1.\n[69] It is of course an old tradition since Plato divided the \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 in \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 and \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7, and only the first was related to truth by him.\n[70] P.

Kant, Anthropologie, \u00a731 (AA \u00a734): \u2018Phantasie, d.i. sch\u00f6pferische Einbildungskraft, mu\u00df sich nicht darein [in das Ged\u00e4chtnis] mischen, denn dadurch w\u00fcrde das Ged\u00e4chtnis untreu\u2019.\n[74] Ricoeur, ibid., 21.\n[75] Aristoteles, \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2, 449b (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5), according to Ricoeur, Das R\u00e4tsel der Vergangenheit, 92.\n[76] It is remarkable that Husserl developed his theory of passive syntheses with reference to Kant\u2019s theory of productive imagination. He saw in Kant\u2019s productive syntheses of imagination that what he calls \u2018passive Konstitution\u2019 as \u2018Zusammenspiel der sich best\u00e4ndig h\u00f6her entwickelnden Intentionalit\u00e4ten des passiven Bewu\u00dftseins, in denen sich passiv eine \u00fcberaus vielgestaltige immanente und transzendente Sinngebung vollzieht und sich organisiert zu umfassenden Sinngestalten und Seinsgestalten\u2019; cf. E. Husserl, Analysen zur passiven Synthesis: Aus Vorlesungs- und Forschungsmanuskripten 1918\u20131924, M. Fleischer (ed.), Den Haag 1966, 275; cf. E. Holenstein, \u2018Passive Genesis: Eine begriffsanalytische Studie\u2019, Tijdschrift voor Filosofie 33, 1971, 112\u2013153, 117f. That is why the emphatic accent on the productivity and activity of imagination shows a limit of the concept of merely \u2018productive\u2019 imagination, lacking a sense for passivity. But, cf. Kant, Reflexionen zur Anthropologie, AA XV, 133 (no. 338): \u2018Einbildungskraft ist activ. wir spielen mit ihr. Gesetz der association. \u2013 Phantasie ist passiv. Sie spielt mit uns. Gesetz ist noch nicht bekannt, e.g. Der Vollendung\u2019. Just the negative connotation in regard to the later is questionable.\n[77] Green, Imagining God, 126\u2013152. \u2018Christian faith can be characterized accordingly as faithful imagination\u2014living in conformity to the vision rendered by the Word of God in the Bible\u2019 (134, cf. 112f). Cf. G. Green, Theology, Hermeneutics, and Imagination: The Crisis of Interpretation at the End of Modernity, Cambridge 1999, 187ff, esp. 199ff.\n[78] Ibid., 112.\n[79] \u2018Otherness\u2019 in this regard is of course not the \u2018alter ego\u2019, but the so called \u2018radical otherness\u2019, inexhaustible by any representation, reflection or imagination.\n[80] M.J. Ferreira, \u2018Repetition, concreteness, and imagination\u2019, Philosphy of Religion 25, 1989, 13\u201334.\n[81] But not as in apocalyptic or gnosis as another world. Christian eschatology imagines this world as creation in eschatology transformed\u2014and not creation revoked by an obscure \u2018world\u2019s end\u2019.\n[82] Ferreira, ibid., 24: \u2018Imagination alone makes re-newal possible because it alone can hold oppositions \u2013 old-yet-new \u2013 in tension\u2019. What has happened here to memory? And what to \u2018the other\u2019? The \u2018alone\u2019 marks one necessary condition, but not more as I suppose.\n[83] Ferreira, \u2018Repetition\u2019, 24f, with S. Kierkegaard, Either/Or, vol. II, trans. W. Lowrie, Princeton 1959, 227.\n[84] Ibid., 26.\n[85] As Ferreira, ibid., 29 quotes R. Unger, Passion: An Essay on Personality, New York 1984, 210.\n[86] By this hint, one could challenge Green\u2019s interpretation of \u2018imago Dei\u2019 as \u2018imaginatio Dei\u2019 only in the gen. obj. Cf. Imagining God, 84\u2013104. If the imago is the (power of) imaginatio, God himself may be imaginative as well\u2014and as well imagining us. That is why I understand the title of Green\u2019s study as well in a second sense. Thereby the imaginatio Dei should be read in the double genitive. And the difference of the gen. subj. to our gen. obj. is a theologically important limit of our imagination, the difference of the imagining other to the imagined one.\n[87] Ricoeur, La memoire, 637.\n[88] Ibid., 642.\n[89] What does Ricoeur not remark as imaginative! But cf. Ferreira, ibid., 27: \u2018The old cannot be made new without a vision of possibilities\u2019, an inclusive vision and finally actualised.\n[90] J.

The author of Soul Retrieval, a bestselling book on personal transformation, Ingerman's new book asks if there is a way to focus our individual spiritual practices on group problems and magnify the results. Specifically, the book is concerned with \"transmuting\" toxins to alleviate damage to the environment.\nIngerman holds a bachelor's degree in biology and advanced degrees in counseling. Her book combines a high level of scholarship with personal and group efforts to practice alchemy. Ingerman's journey includes an analysis of numerous \"miracles\" involving water, from Moses using magic words to part the Red Sea to Brazilian shamans practicing rainmaking to eastern yogis using holy water to heal afflictions. The book concludes with scientifically- controlled experiments in cleaning polluted water.\nThe excerpt below is from the chapter on Imagination. It is a bold, personal statement about the need to visualize the outcome of transmutation -- heaven on earth -- and concludes with a passionate call for us to \"dream lucidly in our waking state.\" It's a very moving riff by one of the world's outspoken spiritualists.\nMore information about author Sandra Ingerman and the book, Medicine for the Earth, follows the excerpt. If you want to hear another strong personal statement from Ingerman, check out the two-minute iPod-ready video for this book at the following URL:\nOn Imagination\nby Sandra Ingerman\nI have written Medicine for the Earth for those of you who are seeking a better life by seeking a true spiritual path. I am attempting to teach a very powerful means for people to heal themselves, others, and the planet, rather than trying to show how to use spiritual principles to gain material objects and wealth or to manipulate the universe to achieve power over others.\nI am addressing people who have discovered that material objects or wealth do not create happiness and who instead are seeking good for their souls by finding true meaning in life and bringing passion and creativity into their daily lives.\nIn writing about the power of the imagination, I am asking people to reach for their highest potential and use their imagination to create better conditions for healing life on the planet. We need to imagine a planet with clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, not how to buy a new expensive car. It is fine to use your imagination to manifest material things, but it will anchor you to here, preventing you from experiencing the divine union necessary to heal ourselves and transmute environmental pollution.\nTo do this, we must change our consciousness and examine the difference between using our imagination to serve small, egoic desires and utilizing it to serve our highest potential and humanity.\nTo align with what is for the highest good for ourselves and the planet, we use our own imaginative creative energies along with asking, \"Thy will be done.\" In this way we partner with the power of the universe and avoid making the mistake of thinking our own ego knows what is best for all concerned.\nThere are specific traps to watch out for in working with creative powers. As you work more with your imagination and creative powers, you can avoid being trapped by egoic desires through aligning your own vision with the spiritual powers of the universe. In this way you work in harmony with the powers that be and avoid accidentally misusing your power. Further, in working on your own spirituality and use of spiritual power, you must simultaneously examine your own emotional state and psychological development so that you do not use your spiritual gifts and knowledge in a negative manner. The well-known black magician Aleister Crowley (1875-1947), for example, had a clear understanding of the connection between the microcosm and the macrocosm but used his understanding and knowledge for only selfish purposes and to control others around him. Aleister Crowley paid quite the price for this, living a miserable life and suffering a terrible death.\nI am on a path to bring heaven to earth. To accomplish this goal, I encourage everyone to use spiritual methods that create the miracles to heal all beings on the earth, and to always reach for your highest potential. This is what will feed your soul and will create the happiness you are looking for. There is no greater food for the soul than to benefit all of life. Imagine if we all gathered our spiritual forces together to heal our communities and environment.\nThe dilemma of knowing when to ask \"Thy will be done\" and when to use our active imagination comes down to who is making the decision. The confusion usually occurs when it is our ego talking. If you find yourself pursuing material goals, then your ego is making the choices, and to avoid problems you might be better off requesting, \"Thy will be done.\"\nThere is another aspect of the issue of creating from an egoic state that must be addressed. We are part of the whole and therefore not separate from the forces of nature. You can create what you believe, but you must also acknowledge and work in harmony with the laws of nature. In Part IV of Medicine for the Earth, we will see how we do not have power over nature, and for your transmutation work to be successful, you must be in alignment with the power of the universe. The key is harmony with yourself as well as with spiritual and natural forces when using your imagination to create.\nPart of our fall from grace is feeling separate from source, while the other part is feeling separate from our spirit. When we ask our spirit to say what it wants, the answer will always involve love. It only requests acts of kindness and love.\nIn Welcome Home: Following Your Soul's Journey Home, I describe a spiritual teaching I once received from Isis about discovering joy in life:\n'So my advice to you and to the people who live around you is to step back from your life. Use your imagination to envision what you would like your life to be like. Try to imagine what joy and happiness feel like. Reach back to at least one experience in which you felt happy. What situations and experiences do you think would help you regain those feelings? Trust yourself and have faith that you can create this feeling again in your life.'\nAs I travel around the world giving workshops and lecturing, I notice that people have a preoccupation with negative prophecies. However, I believe that the so-called Armageddon is here now and has been for quite some time. We are now experiencing fires, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, disease, drought, famine, and pestilence. Further, I am curious about why people get so excited when they speak about doom and gloom to come when natural disasters have occurred throughout recorded history.\nI believe this is the result of knowing that our lives are empty and lack meaning. We want something to change this. We don't want to take responsibility for making those changes, but instead want something -- even a disaster -- outside of our control to force our lives to change.\nBut do we really need tragedy to change? Unfortunately, sometimes learning through tragedy is how human beings grow. While tragedy is not essential for change, when we experience a tragedy in our lives, we value life more; learn the great importance of health and come to appreciate what we have; reprioritize what is important to us; and discover how to live in the present, because that is all we have.\nHowever, many of us focus on negative prophecy because we don't want to take responsibility for changing our lives. Caroline Casey says in Making the Gods Work, \"It is better to create prophecy than to live prediction.\" As my good friend Coreen says: \"What future are we voting for?\"\nMoreover, in visioning a new future, it's important not only to vision our future as we want it, but also to realize that our future is created by our present. To manifest visions of the future, we must shape and sculpt our present accordingly; we must sow the seeds of the plants we wish to reap.\nAs I have already stated, shamans around the world have a saying: \"We are dreaming the wrong dream.\" Many spiritual traditions and philosophers view this world as the world of illusion.\nI, too, believe that we are all dreaming here. And what we need to learn to do is dream lucidly in our waking state. Let's dream together a pure, clean planet of beauty, where we can live in harmony with ourselves, the rest of life, and nature. Let's all dream about perceiving heaven on earth now.\nAbout the Author\nSandra Ingerman, MA, is the author of Soul Retrieval: Mending the Fragmented Self, Welcome Home: Following Your Soul's Journey Home, A Fall to Grace, Medicine for the Earth: How to Transform Personal and Environmental Toxins, and Shamanic Journeying: A Beginner's Guide.

This book is urgently needed.\"\n-- Larry Dossey, M.D.,\nauthor of Reinventing Medicine\nand Healing Words\n\"A masterpiece of alchemy with practical ways to transform and heal our lives and the earth.\"\n-- Alberto Villoldo, Ph.D.,\nauthor of Shaman, Healer, Sage\nand Dance of the Four Winds\n\"In this beautifully written book, Sandra Ingerman shows us how to work with our spirit allies to restore the health and vitality of degraded natural environments. A major contribution to the integration of shamanic procedures with radical ecology.\"\n-- Ralph Metzner, Ph.D.,\nauthor of Green Psychology\nFrom cross-cultural legends recounting shamanic cures to the biblical accounts of the parting of the Red Sea and Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes, many spiritual traditions are rich in stories about seemingly inexplicable transformations of the natural world. The ancient healing art of transmutation, in which toxic substances are transformed into \"safe\" substances, is mentioned in all the world's great spiritual traditions, including Hinduism and Taoism. And while many have tapped this body of work to heal the self, it has yet to be used to heal our environment.\nFor twenty years, Sandra Ingerman has studied alternative ways to reverse environmental pollution. In this book, Ingerman takes us on a remarkable journey through the history of transmutation, teaching us how we can use this forgotten technique to change ourselves and our environment. She provides us with creative visualizations, ceremonies, rituals, and chants derived from ancient healing practices that produce miraculous, scientifically proven results. In one dramatic illustration of what can be accomplished when consciousness and awareness fuel our actions, Ingerman describes her own success in transforming the nature of chemically polluted water.\nCopyright \u00a92006 by Sandra Ingerman.

I'm trying to sell cereal here.\"\nEven amongst ourselves, I suspect that because we don't talk about them, the models we use are often unclear and worse, probably narrow and limiting.\u00a0 They make us see the world a certain way. If I think good communication needs to be entertaining, then those are the ideas I gravitate towards.\u00a0 I wonder if that's why agencies sometimes develop a \"style\" - everything's funny, or it's all slice of life, or it's all stark and minimalist.\u00a0 It's that old adage - if you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\u00a0 And it reminds me of an even older adage : \"there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"\nAnyway, all of that is by way of saying there have been a few fantastic posts recently on the subject that should be required reading for everyone.\nIf there's anyone out there who doesn't already read the esteemed writings of Mr. Russell Davies, I urge you to check out this post from yesterday.\u00a0 He lays out what he calls his schtick, the speech he's been trotting around to conferences and the like the past few years.\u00a0 I've seen him give it a couple of times and it's quite good.\u00a0 It's a succinct argument for re-evaluating the way we work, and challenges some of the most common dogma like \"communication needs to be simple\" or \"strategy comes before execution.\"\u00a0 But he also has a great presentation style - handwritten slides - that break out of the usual powerpoint monotony.\nThis provoked an interesting response from Scamp, a London copywriter, who argues against some of Russell's points, making a case for simplicity.\u00a0 You can also read Russell's response to his response in the comments.\nAnd on a related note there is this great piece from Michael Beriut in the Design Observer (the web magazine he founded and edits) coming clean about his creative process.\u00a0 It's wonderful.\nFor over twenty years, I've been writing proposals for projects. And almost every one of them has a passage somewhere that begins something like this: \"This project will be divided in four phases: Orientation and Analysis, Conceptual Design, Design Development, and Implementation.\" All clients want this. Sometimes there are five phases, sometimes six. Sometimes they have different names. But it's always an attempt to answer a potential client's unavoidable question: can you describe the process you use to create a design solution that\u2019s right for us?\nThe other day I was looking at a proposal for a project I finished a few months ago. The result, by my measure and by the client's, was successful. But guess what? The process I so reassuringly put forward at the outset had almost nothing to do with the way the project actually went. What would happen, I wonder, if I actually told the truth about what happens in a design process?\nIt might go something like this:\nSomewhere along the way an idea for the design pops into my head from out of the blue. I can\u2019t really explain that part; it\u2019s like magic. Sometimes it even happens before you have a chance to tell me that much about your problem! Now, if it\u2019s a good idea, I try to figure out some strategic justification for the solution so I can explain it to you without relying on good taste you may or may not have. Along the way, I may add some other ideas, either because you made me agree to do so at the outset, or because I\u2019m not sure of the first idea. At any rate, in the earlier phases hopefully I will have gained your trust so that by this point you\u2019re inclined to take my advice. I don\u2019t have any clue how you\u2019d go about proving that my advice is any good except that other people \u2014 at least the ones I\u2019ve told you about \u2014 have taken my advice in the past and prospered. In other words, could you just sort of, you know...trust me?\nI think many of us can identify with what Michael is saying. He talks about after 20 years finally being confident enough to fess up, and this is where it gets really interesting.\u00a0 He mentions a different model, recently put forth in this book , by a Harvard Business School prof and a theatre professor.\u00a0 It argues that linear process models are really hold-overs from the industrial revolution, and the writers suggest a better model for a creative, knowledge-based industry might be taken from the collaborative arts, specifically theatre:\nThe iterative process, the role of improvisation, the adjustments that are made in response to audience feedback, all of these elements are a part of any design process.\nThis sounds like a fascinating answer to this problem.\u00a0 I'm going to go pick up the book.\u00a0 And I'm glad this stuff is being discussed, because I think our agency processes (along with agency compensation ) tend to hurt us as often as they help.\nPosted by Jason Oke on September 26, 2006 | Permalink\nTrackBack\nTrackBack URL for this entry:\nhttp://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d8341c15db53ef00d8353490d853ef\n"}, {"score": 984.3357, "uuid": "34ced109-db12-5f27-b012-f6e3eebd6a97", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1102wb-42-22671", "target_hostname": "kilbabo.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://kilbabo.wordpress.com/tag/imagination/", "page_rank": 1.2006347e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Imagination</em> \u00ab kilbabo", "snippet": "I still <em>do</em> this to this day.

It is a great little adventure story for children as well as throwing in little\u00a0witticisms\u00a0and puns that keep the adults chuckling (e.g., Harold \u2018draws\u2019 up his covers at the end of the book).\nThe thing that stuck with me about this book as a child is that the world is what you make of it (also a great line by Linda Hunt in \u2018Silverado\u2019). I am a person who thinks in stories and images (probably why narrative theology and literary criticism is most interesting to me). As a child I would often entertain myself on\u00a0road-trips\u00a0by examining the landscape around me and imagining what kind of fantastical scene or story could take place on that landscape. I still do this to this day. Furthermore this book was a stimulus to pursue all sorts of serious imagination from a very early age. If Harold was capable of such adventures with only his purple crayon, then what kind of imaginings was I capable of in my own head (which has at least a 256 color\u00a0palette). I think a good imagination is a necessary for life in general but especially for the intellectual life which I am currently pursuing.\nAs an adult I take many more messages from this book. Harold is a very logical character. He needed a moon for his walk in the moonlight, so he drew a moon. I want to pursue biblical studies so I am learning the biblical languages, German, etc. Another great analogy I draw from Harold is his anchor in the story. In the story Harold goes for an adventure but can\u2019t find his window when he wants to get back home. Throughout the story, the moon is with him. It is only when Harold realizes that the moon is always in the middle of his window at night that he correctly orients his world and finds his room. As a Christian, Christ and his Word are my moon, that I try to correctly orient my world around in order to be where I am supposed to be.\nMaybe I am reading too much into this little children\u2019s tale but it has that kind of simplicity that allows for such musings and analogies. I recommend this book to children and adults alike. It is fun, it is imaginative and it is worth a few minutes of time. If for nothing else than to join a small boy and imagine the world in purple. Thanks John for the impetus of this post and I look forward to further installments in this series.\nAbout Me\nI am a Ph.D. student in Biblical Studies at Durham University. This is my blog. These are my thoughts (at least, hopefully, some of the better ones).\nRecent Posts\n"}, {"score": 975.9207, "uuid": "8768b164-d635-55c1-9424-f3685b20fc8e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1200tw-88-12463", "target_hostname": "behappyanddowhatyoulove.com", "target_uri": "http://behappyanddowhatyoulove.com/blog/do-what-you-love-2/do-what-you-love/", "page_rank": 1.3816267e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Do</em> What <em>You</em> Love! | <em>Do</em> What <em>You</em> Love Journey", "snippet": "Role models in finfing out what <em>you</em> love to <em>do</em> are important because they push us to be <em>better</em> and it\u2019s said that what we see in them <em>is</em> already in us to a lesser extent.", "explanation": null, "document": "Do What You Love, Now\n5 Ways to Find Out Your True Dreams\u2026 and 12 Tips as Bonuses\nIt\u2019s now 5 am and I just got up. And I\u2019m\u2026 happy to do what I\u00a0love this early, I was\u00a0the first surprised of it! I haven\u2019t found any other job than being an author and a lifedesign coach that I feel this trilled to get up early and disappointed if I didn\u2019t. Have you found out what animates you enough that you would not mind doing this \u201cconcession\u201d? If not, here\u2019s how to find it, and if you did we\u2019ll make sure it is really what you love.\nDoing what you love implies that you are excited about something, that you feel driven to do it no matter what once you\u2019ve found it! You might be paid for doing what you love but even if you had all the money in the world you would still do it. It\u2019s a mission you have that sometimes you can\u2019t explain and it gives purpose to your life. You radiate happiness doing it!\nLoving what you do, doing what you love, may respond to all the human needs we saw earlier, responding to your physiological, security, belonging, self-esteem, self-transcendence and more particularly the self-actualization needs. It\u2019s why we feel so compelled to do it, even though society won\u2019t really push for it. An unfulfilling underpaid instrumental job lacks to answer to all we need. A job of passion can sometimes lacks to respond to your need for money , but with some imagination and all the possibilities available in our days you can find a way to bring enough income.\nDoing what you love for life can be for a work or for a passion. If it\u2019s a passion that you aren\u2019t going to live on, you might need an instrumental job to support you, so try to find something that you enjoy as well, as happiness has so many positive results for someone.\nSo Actually What Do You Love?\nFinding out what you do love to do\u00a0can be hard to pin down and without a method you can be searching it a long time. I sure did, and combining experiences, knowledge and self-improvement methods I came up with tips so you can be able to find it quickly and easily.\nHow\u00a0to Find Out What You Love to Do and Define Your Dreams\nWay # 1: What Do You Love to Think About?\nWhat are the dreams you think about?\nTo begin from the start, try to note what you think about in your regular life; what subject do you think about when you have spare time , when you\u2019re driving, in your bath, shower, even on the toilet? Spot the emotions that you feel when you think of those subjects, ditch what seems to drain you from your energy and choose what excites you. The excitement is a good gage to know you love what you do! Note it and make sure you don\u2019t restrain yourself, you can find ways to do it later with my guidance.\nAlso search into your old dreams . Find out what you\u2019ve always dreamed of accomplishing but put aside for whatever reason. If you still love it, it\u2019s time or never to start going toward it!\nWhat you actually dream about can give you \u201cin you face\u201d clues on what you love. It\u2019s meaningful that it\u2019s a subject that psychology adores; it\u2019s really true that dreams can reveal a lot about yourself and what you want. What did you dream about those last months? To explore your dreams more deeply, note them as soon as you wake up. For example, I dreamed that I was to do what I love, I was realising my dream to be an author and my books were on store shelves. I was really excited about it and it pushed to\u00a0do it.\nWay # 2: What Are You Doing Good \u2013 Your Talents and Who You Really Are\nTo find out what you love to do, you could do a personality test online to know more about yourself if you\u2019re mixed up or tried to stay away from finding it. A lot are free online but you might have to pay for complex ones. I love the Myer-Briggs\u2019 one, to find out personalities, I even do it mentally as a hobby to try classifying people I know intuitively so I know more how they think and how to interact with them. But be careful with the results, sometimes they do not express exactly your wide self. Use them only as guidance and find deep within yourself if they really make sense on who you are and doing what you love.\nNote also your talents, what are you really good at, because it\u2019s easier to love something you\u2019re already excellent in. If you\u2019re not really talented for what you love to do, worry not, for you can develop it with time \u2013 hours of practice make experts.\nWay # 3: Do What You Love Experiences and Dreams\u00a0Which\u00a0Seem to Come Together in Your Life?\nTry to find out the dreams and/or the experiences you had that come together in your life. You might know people that were always attached to certain domain and ended up really happy finding their way in it, talk to them about how they got there.\nSome of my dreams were that I have to do something important. Even if I thought it was in sports, I was sick and injured so I was stopped. Then I remembered I wished to write a book. In life, on the \u201cside\u201d, I always had been good in school without forcing it, I could come up with a good text on top of my mind, I dreamed of going to university, I tried journalism, I loved reading since a young age. I dreamed of helping people on massive scale being happier and doing what they love. All those experiences and wants really come together today along with other dreams like staying home with my children.\nAs you map out past experiences you can find out ways they come together to find out what you loved to do in the past and what you love now.\nWay #4: Do You Have People Who Inspire You to Do What You Love?\nRole models in finfing out what you love to do are important because they push us to be better and it\u2019s said that what we see in them is already in us to a lesser extent. My role model number 1 is Gandhi; I\u2019m inspired by his non-violent fighting spirit, his good virtues and the fact that he actually changed things with them.Readingabout him, I found out his struggles, how human he was, and that he just did what he had to do which in turn showed me anyone is capable of exerting his principles.\nNow who are your role models? It can be famous people, your mother or someone you know that is doing what they love. I know that I find people around me who are doing what they love really inspiring, and that\u2019s the thing, we can be role models ourselves and help out others believing that themselves can do what they love too!\nFind out what it tells about you.\nWay #5: Is It You or Others\u00a0Who Love What You Do\u00a0and Dream to Do?\nIt\u2019s a big topic but with some guidance one can easily find out for himself. Was it pushed onto you to be a doctor (or replace by another career) too? I know I was mixed up because of expectation of others, even though they wanted to help, it ended up taking me more time to find out what I love. I studied a little to be a doctor and I was really unhappy. I loved the idea of being one, but it was deviating from my dreams of helping all the people I could and the way to get there was \u201churting\u201d me \u2013 I hated chemistry homework!\nSociety also put emphasis on some careers that are judged better and people herd up to get there, ending up unhappy in their lives. Is it really helpful? I don\u2019t think so. Nowadays about 50% of workers hate their jobs. Wow, that\u2019s so sad! Society also pushes on us a model of consumption and values we might not really adhere to in our natural and unconditioned state, so make sure to identify what you really crave for.\nOnce you found your dreams on doing what you love\u00a0or re-found it if you put it away in the past, it\u2019s now time to believe in what you love to do and keep doing it. At the least it will make you happy, and at the most you could have the life of your dreams with it!\nBonus\n12 Tips to Do What You Love Now, and For the Rest of Your Life!\nHere is food for thoughts to help you realize what you love to do for life\u00a0:\nDo What You Really Love Tips\nIdentify what you love to do with the precedent theory;\nBring it into your life more, keep yourself 15 minutes, then more and more time to do exactly what you enjoy;\nGet rid of what you don\u2019t love anymore (next topic);\nBelieve in yourself all the way;\nDon\u2019t talk to people about your dreams if you think they would bring you down, find people that can encourage you if you can. Join together, maybe you can start a happiness and do what you love group ;\nFind resources to make it a reality. Fuel your passion every day, be happy and excited about it. Read on the topic such as other articles on Be Happy and Do What You Love website, join forums, think about it on spare times, live it more and more;\nWhen a disappointment arises, because there might be bumps in the road, use your energy to propel you in the right direction instead of complaining! Don\u2019t give your attention to things that don\u2019t really matter.\nTake time to relax too and replenish your energy daily and take the week-ends off, it\u2019s important! For example after a week-end you can have a better perspective on how to achieve what you love to do. Keep time for meditating where you have more answers about your passions in the end.\nKeep dreaming on what you\u2019d love to do. It\u2019s the first step to bring what you want into reality. We all evolve and it\u2019s normal to want to take another step toward a new realization in your life.\nThink about ways that you can have enough income with your passion;\nPin down what you DON\u2019T want in your life and figure out ways to stay away from it. It can be changing having to work 40 hours per week, not have enough time for friends and family, etc\u2026\nPush or dissipate what is seen as limitations. Age isn\u2019t really important, as humans could live up to 130 years if you pay attention to yourself. In fact, you\u2019ve got enough time ahead of you and you\u2019re young at 50 years old! If you\u2019re a woman/a minority/etc. I know it\u2019s said that we\u2019re all are equals nowadays but we\u2019ve got to make it happen in reality, don\u2019t stay in old ways of thinking, be yourself and you too can do anything respectful if you want!\nNow please use the remaining of the free time you have today to think about what you love to do for the rest of\u00a0your life, take notes about it\u2026 and repeat everyday!\nIf\u00a0 the Do What You Love Now helped you, thanks for reading and sharing with the tools below!\nYours for happiness and success,\nMarie-Eve\n"}, {"score": 974.7497, "uuid": "4ebcc587-9c9a-5f22-8003-efbd88c343ca", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0711wb-73-17991", "target_hostname": "www.wholefamily.com", "target_uri": "http://www.wholefamily.com/marriage-center/item/1506", "page_rank": 1.1737217e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Nurturing <em>Imagination</em>", "snippet": "A Therapist&#x27;s Comments &quot;Mommy, I&#x27;m Bored&quot; What to <em>Do</em> -- or Not <em>Do</em> \u00bb Join the Austen-Kutchinskys as they struggle to make their new blended family work.

If a guy comes up with 5 patterns and manages to explain them like you would, you're inclined to think he gets it. But if a guy comes up with 5 sort-of-like-it explanations, containing some salient points, while omitting others, what do you give him?

The result is The Bible Wasn\u2019t Written To You , a free electronic book available in many formats.\nOne of the things that this book affirms is the power of a good Bible translation. Some people have this idea that Bible translations are hiding secrets from readers that can only be uncovered by reading the original languages. While I will be the first one to affirm the need for scholars to master Biblical languages, I think that for the layperson, dabbling in Biblical languages almost always does more harm than good. If you look at any of the major English translations to come out in the last century, they\u2019ve been produced by large groups of highly trained professionals. Conspiracy theories abound about one Bible\u2019s or another\u2019s hidden agenda, but that\u2019s just hogwash. Bible translations don\u2019t hide the truth, they reveal it. And that truth is clearer to you when reading in your own language than if you were reading the Bible in its original languages.\nAnother thing this book talks about quite a lot is reading the Bible \u201cChristianly.\u201d How should New Covenant people read and apply the First Covenant? Not everyone has been satisfied with my solution, but I think that in most cases my approach to reading the Bible acknowledges the revolution brought on by the incarnation while also allowing us to read the Old Testament without twisting it to fit into New Testament shapes.\nI hope that BBB readers will read this book and tell me what you think.

Chris Bartholomew, editor/publisher/owner of the speculative fiction small press known as Static Movement, is one such person. Chris is an advocate for new writers finding their way in the publishing world. She has a long list of accomplishments as an author, editor and publisher, with over fifty books edited under her watch, and over two hundred and fifty short stories in several magazines and books published under her byline.\nShe is a friend of the Liquid Imagination family, as we consider Static Movement to be one of our sister publications (along with many others). The busy publisher took time out of her hectic schedule to answer twenty questions that cover her past, present and future in the small press, as well as her views on the publishing industry, and some friendly advice for those new to writing.\n1) Chris, what inspired you to take on the duties of editor/publisher with Static Movement, effectively playing a very large role in the small press?\nI loved being published and wanted there to be someplace where other people could get their stories read. There are so many venues that I wasn't sure the world needed another one, but I stepped out there and have a readership, and quite a few writers.\n2) Eventually you decided to take Static Movement into print with two special print editions of the webzine, and currently you are publishing many original, themed print anthologies through your Static Movement imprint. What inspired that change?\nI was working with Paul Campbell for RAZAR magazine when we decided to do the first ezine print issue, Static Movement Print Special No. 1, which was published by RAZAR Magazine in early 2007. Static Movement Print Issue No. 2 was published in late 2009 by Liquid Imagination led by John Arthur Miller.\nThe themed anthology books didn't start until Summer of 2010, when I decided (with a LOT of help) to publish books that were originally being published by Lame Goat Press. After those five books were published, the person with the printer that I go through asked me if I'd like to continue on with print books and I said yes. So\u2026 what inspired the change to Static Movement Imprint for printed books was the closing of Lame Goat Press, and a lot of encouragement from other presses out there and the writers who wanted to submit to a print version of Static Movement.\n3) You have a third special print edition of the webzine coming soon as well. How is that coming along?\nAlmost all of the stories are in. Lee Kuruganti is illustrating all of the stories, which takes time, so we are waiting for her work. I estimate a few months for this to come out. She is also choosing the cover, and I'm hoping it will be from the ezine, since she has done all of the ezine covers for the last five years.\n4) As an editor, what are some of the things you look for in a publishable story?\nI like unique stories, well-written. If the idea is good but the story needs correction, I try to work with the writer to make it publishable. Most of the time, a writer is willing to make changes, sometimes they are not, because they are happy with it the way it is\u2026 when that is the case, I don't publish it. I don't worry about mistakes as they can be corrected. I read the story, and if it's good I'll take it.\n5) In addition to being an editor and publisher, you are also a writer in your own right with well over 200 publishing credits to your name. How did you discover the joys of fiction writing?\nI am from a family of readers. I only started writing for publication after meeting a bunch of writers on a forum that is now out of existence, probably mid-2004. After your first acceptance it's pretty much an addiction, for me anyway. I love it when someone picks up one of my stories, and having a bookcase full of books that I am in is nice.\n6) As the publisher of an ezine communicating primarily with e-mail, how often do people mistake your name for that of a man? (Full disclosure: I made that mistake early on).\nAt first, I'd say for over a year people thought I was a man and I think that probably helped me rather than hurt me. Most people know now, and if I'm referred to as 'he' on a forum, someone corrects the person who made the mistake. I still get 'Dear Sir' in some submissions, and I usually just write back putting (Mrs.) Bartholomew in my email to them, or I say, 'you really should just say 'Dear Editor' unless you know for sure whether someone is male or female.\n7) You have a couple dozen anthology books on the market currently with many more to come. Any chance you may get a break in your busy schedule to focus on your writing again in the near future?\nI think that now, with 14 editors on staff at Static Movement, there will be a time when I'm not personally doing so many. That will be when I'll get the time to write. I'm currently doing several anthologies myself. Four have recently opened, but I won't open a new one until another one closes. There was a time when I was doing 25 alone!\nI do make some writing time though, I'm working on a story for Yarns for Our Youth 2 for my grandson, and for another anthology that is due February 1st, 2011\n8) Your main playground in fiction has been short stories. Do you think there is a novel inside you waiting to get out?\nWe'll know the answer to that if I ever sit down and write one. I love flash, but now am able to write to 5,000 so it's possible. It is a bit hard to go on, and on when you are used to using as little words as possible to convey the story, but I'm learning. My family has been after me to write a book, we'll see.\n9) What is your take on some of the changes in the publishing industry; are there certain concerns you have regarding the future as book sales continue to stagnate or fall across the board, bookstores continue to close up shop and the overall doom that some forecast? Some believe that what is happening to publishing has similar parallels to what happened to music a decade ago.\nI hate it that so many bookstores are closing, but I don't take that as meaning people don't want to read, I believe it's because people don't have the money to spend on books that they used to. You look online and there are many small presses closing, because the money is not online either. It's the economy. Will it bounce back then? I don't think that it will any time soon.\n10) You read a multitude of fiction submissions every day, but when you step away from that to curl up with a good book, who are some of the authors that you like to read?\nI don't read best sellers anymore \u0096 I don't have time. If I read it's either one of the 25 published Static Movement books or another anthology my work is in from another publisher. I have a couple of boxes of books that I could read, but I'm just not really interested as I spend so much time reading submissions.\n11) As a writer you mostly stick to the speculative genres of science fiction, fantasy and horror. Why do you think you favor those over other genres?\nI grew up watching horror and science fiction. Fantasy is something you can get lost in so I like that too. Horror is my favorite though to write, fantasy being second.\nAs an avid risk-taker, I have had many episodes of near-death in my life that helped shape my writing direction. Not only am I an experienced skydiver, but during one of my jumps my main parachute ripped up. Instead of cutting away and using my back-up I decided to ride it out and land with the damaged one. I admit that I could have easily died and my jump master was certainly unhappy with my decision, but I say that taking risks is a part of life.\nI enjoy being scared and being able to scare others. There is often a stigma attached to us horror writers that we must all be odd people in order to invent some of the things that we use in our writing. I reject these kinds of generalities, grounded in the knowledge that I am a good and moral person and don't believe that authors of any stripe should be cast in one role or another.\n12) What kind of music gets you going (i.e. bobbing your head, singing or dancing)?\nRap is my favorite music; I don't listen to anything else if I can help it. The only time I listen to music is in the car, not in the house. When I'm reading submissions or writing I might have a movie playing in the background, but more than likely it's just quiet here.\n13) What are some of the movies you will watch repeatedly?\nMidnight Lace with Doris Day is my very favorite movie of all time, if I had a copy I would watch that a lot. I watch the new Batman movies often, I LOVE Cloverfield. With hundreds of movies you can imagine that, with no TV, I watch many movies over and over.\n14) You also write nonfiction. Specifically you write articles about the true crimes of serial killers as the editor for Serial Killers Magazine. Is there a fascination with that particular subject matter?\nThere is no fascination with serial killers. I saw a call for writers and I responded. My work has gotten a lot of good feedback, especially here locally so I kept up until they asked me to be head writer, but I've slowed down there a lot too.\n15) In regards to writing for Serial Killers Magazine, how thin is the line between journalism and awareness versus exploitation and glamorization, considering the true, horrific nature of the real events?\nThe thing is this stuff sells, so you can see where Serial Killer Magazine came from. I am not glorifying the killers; I'm just telling it like it is to a readership that wants to know. It's a place to write for.\n16) What do you think your strengths as a writer are?\nProbably my voice. Many people never find their voice, and I have found mine. The best thing that I think is a strength is knowing that you can write, gives you confidence to withstand the critics and rejections. Confidence is a good thing to have for a writer.\n17) What is the one thing in your writing you would like to do better?\nThere is a question I cannot answer, because if I knew the answer I would fix it. Editing helps me grow as a writer, when I see something that does not work and then see that I do it too\u2026 we are always growing and learning.\n18) Which school of thought are you from in terms of writing approach?\nThere are two schools of thought on writing a story, neither one inherently better than the other. One requires the writing of an outline and, perhaps, a character sketch before the author begins a tale. Proponents of this method argue that you cannot hope to achieve your goal unless you have a plan of action in place. I do not ascribe to this method of writing. Instead, she prefers to begin writing and let the story roll out and take her along for the ride. This can sometimes lead to surprising revelations and take you in directions that you'd never thought you would go. I believe that this is the truly exciting side of writing.\n19) As a short fiction enthusiast and a beacon for the hard working writers in the small press, what advice do you have for newer writers?\nNever try to write like someone else, always be true to you. Never set goals such as: if I don't get published by a certain time I'm a failure and am quitting. Success takes as long as it takes. Never rush a story to the ending; it'll be done when it's done. Never listen to criticism unless you can handle it. Don't take one person's word for anything, and always look on the positive side of things. Don't keep your rejection slips as most people do. Read them, learn from them, and then throw them away.\nAt my webzine, when I reject a story, I do not expect that person to carry that thought through all of their writing. Everyone is different, all editors are different, and one may hate something you wrote when the next one will love it. Always go forward. Self-confidence is one of the most indispensable character traits that a young writer can possess. It is not necessary to be arrogant, but you must believe in what you are doing and you must believe that you will succeed.\n20) With well over 200 writing credits, your work is probably not too hard to find. Where can readers find your fiction and poetry?\nMost of my writing is in anthologies now, some can be found online, and some of it was in ezines that are closed and gone now. My credits page has links to some work though at www.staticmovement.com/Credits.htm\nStatic Movement can be found at www.staticmovement.com.\n"}, {"score": 971.267, "uuid": "bc46fec5-333c-5a00-872b-45475491ad4b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-13-08491", "target_hostname": "www.liquid-imagination.com", "target_uri": "http://www.liquid-imagination.com/Issue4/Interview3.html", "page_rank": 1.2054608e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Liquid <em>Imagination</em>", "snippet": "You&#x27;ve been quoted as saying, &quot;Writing, like art, <em>is</em> something I&#x27;ve been doing since I was a kid.&quot; At Liquid <em>Imagination</em>, we attempt to blur the boundaries between fiction&#x2F;poetry and art. As a poet, writer and artist, how could we <em>do</em> this <em>better</em>?", "explanation": null, "document": "Interview with Kaolin Fire\nby Sue Babcock and the other curious writers at American Zoetrope\nYou are the founder and editor of GUD (pronounced \"good\"), which is Greatest Uncommon Denominator, an award-winning print/pdf magazine with two hundred pages of literary and genre fiction, poetry, art, and articles.\nAs such, how many people do you have working on GUD? How many do you have helping? Do you have \"reading editors\" to help sort through the slush? Do you have people behind the scenes? GUD has evolved. Where will it be in ten years? Where will the literary world be in ten years, and how does fantasy and horror figure therein?\nGUD is a shop with a ton of hats and very few heads. Everyone involved in even a minor role gets a spot on the GUD masthead unless we're trialing them--and as interns are my purvey and I have too much to do already, mostly they just get dropped by the wayside. I'm hoping to be working with a marketing intern at the moment, but I think I owe her an email.\nWe've not gone the \"reading editors\" route--any given issue's \"instigator\" is responsible for slush, though they can ask the rest of us to chip in at any point. We've had a few folks offer to read, but it's a hurdle we haven't quite managed to work out.\nTen years--I don't do well at planning things out further than tomorrow. It's painful to see big mags go by the wayside.\nGUD intends to go quarterly, but we need to get the finances a little more stable to really make that leap. Right now whoever can chip in does, and it's a very expensive hobby--especially with the economy the way it is.\nI don't see the literary world changing in any drastic way, nor fantasy/horror/etc. I don't keep up with the latest genre/subgenre trends too much. Things seem to cycle. But really--who knows? The world could end tomorrow.\nTell us more about GUD. How much is one issue of GUD? How much is a year's subscription? What makes it different than the other magazines out there?\nA single PDF of GUD is $3.50 (also available for most ebook devices, including Kindle). A single print copy is $10 (plus shipping, if outside US). A 2-issue (year's) subscription is $18. We don't at the moment offer subscription pricing on PDFs--but we do sporadically offer other deals around our PDFs; in the past we've run \"Dollar Downloads\" and \"Choose your Price\" deals. And if you folks are nice I might let slip that choose your price page...\nYou can order here: GUD Magazine\nGUD's mission is to blend the genre and lit camps and sate those with a penchant for both. We strive for writing that pushes the bounds of its pigeonhole and can reach out to open-minded folks of either camp, not stumbling on its common negatively-associated tropes. And if all that sounds boring, then I apologize for putting it poorly.\n\" Night Bird Soaring \" is currently up for the sidewise awards and you can read it in full on the website to get a better feel for _some_ of the sort of stuff we publish:\nAnd if you create an account on the site, you'll get one randomly selected poem or story for download, free (sitting in your account).\nI love the way GUD gives a snippet of the stories in the archives. Does that seem to pull sales in?\nI honestly don't know if the snippets we make available drive sales--but I'm thrilled that you apppreciate them. It's amazingly hard to get feedback of any sort on things like that, and we put a lot of effort into selecting just the right amount of snippet for each piece. I rather hope it does help drive sales, but if nothing else I know it makes the site look more fleshed out.\nOne thing to note is that we sell very few \"individual\" PDFs--I'd expected tht would be a more attractive item, but maybe we haven't hit the right price point or maybe were just not showcasing them well enough.\nCan you separate Kaolin the web-designer from Kaolin the GUD frontman personality? Or are they both the same?\nThere are a number of different Kaolins with various synergies--some of them help each other out, some of them not so much. And some of them only in certain circumstances. I try very hard not to pollute any particular brand by mixing something too unrelated.\nFor instance, Kaolin the flash game developer can link back to GUD with all sorts of things, but it doesn't make sense for GUD to link back to that Kaolin (despite the little game room I added to GUD's website--that's about trying to get people to spend more time at the website, and may well either disappear or become much more writer/story-focused).\nI'm very conscious of separating the different Kaolins--though sometimes I do let things bleed over more than I, perhaps, should.\nWhich is your favorite Kaolin?\nMy favorite Kaolin depends on the day. Whichever one gets to be creative and productive, ideally. Kaolin the poet, Kaolin the writer, Kaolin the book-cover-maker, Kaolin the game developer, even Kaolin the website-maker (I'm not much of a designer, so I'm especially proud when I pull off a website design that doesn't suck--for pro projects we hire real designers, but for instance i think the latest site I did for a friend turned out rather well.\nMy least favorite Kaolin lately is Kaolin the systems administrator--I had a bit of a meltdown earlier this week trying to do a side job. Someone else's chatroom I was hosting temporarily took my server down for about three hours. That was painful because I host a lot of sites on that server (including GUD).\nThe story Altered and The Lion and the Mouse have a wonderful surreal, quirky quality to them. Is this something you strive for, or is that what just pops out. Do you have a favorite genre, style or voice in your writing?\nre: wonderful surreal, quirky quality--thanks! By and large that's what pops out, though it is something I like and something I strive to polish/achieve. It's definitely natural to me.\nAs far as style or voice goes, I really strive for a certain cadence. I read all of my works out loud, these days, as I'm writing (well, as I'm editing as I write), just to make sure the flow is consistent.\nI consider science-fiction my favorite genre to write, but find myself doing magic realism much more frequently (I think it lends itself better to flash--at least for me--than something properly solidly SF). Though those two pieces are both science-fiction (in my mind), they also have a certain \"just so\" sensibility to them that makes me think magic realism.\nI really like to play with reality, beliefs, play with what you might be thinking, expecting, and hope to get the reader pulled in with that sort of play, find the \"anything could happen and it'll work within the context of the story\" point.\nPlaying with reality and belief sets. That really sounds fun, but it must be hard to do. I mean, balancing the 'could be' with your readers' trust.\nYes, the reader's trust tends to be very fragile. . And an editor's trust even more fragile, I think, given how much we've been burned. That's our jaded more than anything else, I think, though also just \"well, we've seen that so make us care\".\nThis doesn't sound boring to me at all, more like out-of-the-box line blurring. I have to wonder where 21st century fiction is going. Our language changes so much with technology and the influx of folks from the far corners.\nWhat will become of old-fashioned genre fiction?\nI think there will always be a place for old-fashioned genre stuff. Maybe it will become more the niche and genre-bending more the norm--and if that happened maybe GUD would include more straightt-genre stuff. All the same we do consider it (just as we consider straight lit stuff) and publish some of both, but we're definitely looking for stuff that is more than the sum of it's tropes.\nDo you, as an editor, ever get totally blown away by a story--having obviously read so many? How often does that lightning strike? Do those make all the slush worthwhile or do you find yourself becoming jaded?\nI've definitely been blown away by stuff. Most frequently it's a short piece, and I have to let it sit to see if it's more a novelty thing or if it has staying power. (sometimes it winds up being a novelty piece with staying power, and that usually gets a thumbs up, too--staying power is most important). The longer a piece is, when I start out excited, the more chance it has to disappoint. But of course, the longer it is, the more chance it has to develop something deeper, carve it out...\nLightning strikes maybe a few times an issue--more often I'll be excited by something but not quite sure, which will entail more discussion with colleagues, letting it sit, reading it a few more times. Each of our editors brings a fairly disparate and diverse background, so something one of us thinks is worthwhile on basis of freshness might get \"outed\" by another more familiar with a certain realm.\nWe all suffer burnout on a somewhat regular basis, but we pinch hit and take breaks. I think we all started out relatively jaded--we knew what we were getting into, having for the most part done slush before, and the rest of it. But for all that common jade, we know there's great stuff in there.\nNovelty and staying power. Given these, it almost sounds like flash fiction is a good place for new writers to start.\nYou know, master something short before risking the story to lethargy and disappointment.\nShort stories and flash fiction are different beasts. I think it's good to write longer fiction to work on some skills like sentence flow, character development, scene development... While flash is where you can work on plot and hook more easily, and work on more advanced sentence flows than people will generally let you get away with with longer pieces.\nThat said, some people just write one or the other more naturally, and if they're happy there that's probably where they should stick unless they're, erm, stuck.\nMore advanced sentence flows. Can you elaborate on that?\nMore advanced sentence flows--things that play with what you're \"taught in school\"; things that aren't necessarily complete, or proper, but have a certain resonance that shows you're doing what you're doing because it's right for the story, not because you don't know what you're doing. Flash fiction tends to allow you license to write with more poetic and/or minimalistic flows (though it doesn't require that, of course--but in a smaller story folks have more patience for it, and so you can accomplish more drastic effects).\nAnd if that all just sounds like hand-waving, it might be a bit. Hard to articulate\nWhen you go back and read the stories you selected for a particular issue, does it make you feel good, like you know they all work and you love re-reading them. Or do you look at some of them and say, why did I select that one?\nOne of the benefits of a really long acceptance cycle is I'll probably always remember why I accepted a piece in an older issue.\nI don't think any of us have any regrets except for the stories we tried to buy that got away.\nYou've been quoted as saying, \"Writing, like art, is something I've been doing since I was a kid.\" At Liquid Imagination, we attempt to blur the boundaries between fiction/poetry and art. As a poet, writer and artist, how could we do this better? Is it possible to create a NEW TYPE OF ART through the merging of the two?\nWell, I've only just been poking around Liquid Imagination (and the Flash challenge has me bemoaning my lack of writing time lately--I'm part of a number of writing groups, and one in particular has been keeping me writing, but I seem to just miss the deadlines--or forget--three times out of four).\nI'm a big fan of blurring boundaries (so long as they don't just turn into a muddy morass). I'd like to do more of that with GUD (and it's nice to see Murky Depths doing short story-driven comics and such), but it's a tall order--I do see each as a separate discipline, and any crossover falls to the least common denominator; to pull something off that blends really takes a certain sort of savant.\nThere's room for new forms of art in anything--a form is pretty much just a set of self-imposed limitations. Poets have done a lot with that; artists as well. Stories ... stories are almost separate in that you can tell a story in prose, in poetry, in a painting. So I'm getting myself mixed up in nomenclature--that happens.\nTwitfiction seems to be a big new form of late, and I've been having a lot of fun with that. And before that seems like a huge jump from the topic--I've been thinking of producing a chapbook of twitfiction--one twitfic to a page--where each twitfic was tightly integrated with a piece of art representing or broadening it. On my list of to-do... which never ceases to grow. Some day.\nMaybe technology will steer art up some new avenue. What do you think?\nTweet the meat is where I started, I really appreciate them as a market. Very consistent. And having the limited submission period and theme somehow makes it easier to write to. . I recoend trying to write the full numbe they let you submit every week.\nA story in 140 characters is tough. I've written around 40 of them and I have maybe 5 I'm really proud of. Which is probably around the same ratio for others' published stuff I've read. There are a number of twitfiction markets--nanoism, tweetthemeet, thaumatrope, escarp, outshine, picfic just to name a few. .\nI keep meaning to write a long intro post over at GUD about them.\nHaiku is a good comparison. You get a lot more room with twitfiction than haiku but you're expected to be grammatical.\nThe most famous short short short story is Hemingway's six word: For sale: baby shoes. Never worn.\nWhat is your recommendation on submitting collaborated of works, which might include poetry or fiction with artwork, to GUD or any other progressive venue. I am not talking about digital poetry, but, say something like an abstract digital art and an accompanying poem, that together have clear synergism.\nThings that are separate but \"go together\" are a hard sell--and it's hard to say really the best way to submit them. Best in my opinion would be if the poem were actually integrated with the digital art somehow; then it would go under the \"art\" category. We do get submissions of self-illustrated stories and poems, but have yet to receive one where we were interested in either the art or the story/poem--as I replied to the other (though after your follow-up), creating a good blend of things is much harder, imo, than creating a good solitary piece.\nI wouldn't say you'd need a query letter, so much as just explaining the synergy in the cover letter--why the pieces are more powerful together and should not be considered separately.\nWhat are some of the biggest turn offs in regards to stories submissions you've received? (if you notice this in the writing, you're less likely to even finish reading it, much less publish it)\nDo you have a preference to POV used?\nDo you typically prefer stories written in past tense?\nWhat are some examples of stories you adore?\nDo you feel editing has made you a better writer? (quicker at spotting your own weaknesses)\nTurnoffs--certainly bad spelling and bad grammar. And doing colloquial speech can be tricky also. Anything that comes off as purple, or asyouknowbob.\nWhen I'm reading, even when I am open minded to a piece, a part of me will be wondering--did the story need to start here, or could it have started further down? It's always sad when I get to the end and I'm still wondering that, though often I'll not go more than a page of that and give up on something\nAlso when I'm reading, if I'm not terribly entranced by the writing, I'll jump to the end to see if there's something more to it that might be prised out from what's there--or just to sate my curiosity.\nSome of the saddest items for me are those that I'm really glad I read but just don't feel have the \"something extra\" I'm looking for, or I feel I liked them on too personal a \"just Kaolin\" sort of level.\nI don't have a preference for POV but have noticed my colleagues grumbling about a preponderance of first person.\nSame with tense--I think past is generally preferred but at the same time it's good to have a mix.\nAs for stories I particularly adore, see Issue 0. and the upcoming issue 5.\nEditing (and in particular, slush, and choosing to pay real money for stories) has made me a lot more conscious of my shortcomings as a writer (hopefully in a good way)\nHave you ever considered make an iPhone or Blackberry app that would tie the various aspects of your creative experience together?\n(for instance, something that would allow phone users access to written or spoken content in some dynamic form)\nI'm open to ideas.\nThe one iphone app I've done that's in the store (I've done demos for people that haven't made it to the store yet or are just meant as prototypes) is Falling Up, a nasty little twist on the standard \"falling tetronimos\".\n(and hey--it's free )\nWhat projects are you currently working on? And when will they be made available to the public?\nOh, my. What am I working on? I have lists--and lists of lists. As to when they'll be available, I can't really say.\nThe only thing I'm sure of is Issue 5 of GUD is in progress and should be published \"soon\", and we've already bought up content for Issue 6. We'll be reopening slush shortly for Issue 7.\nBeyond that... flash games, writing of my own, poetry, the odd bit of art. It just sort of happens when it happens. GUD and work have been my big focuses lately, with work winning more often than not (something has to pay for GUD, after all).\nYou can see some of my flash games and other computer games here.\nI'm hoping to write some choose your own adventure games ala Tina Connolly's \"Hard Choices\", which I turned into a flash game here.\nAnd most recently I've been writing a lot of twitfiction (though I fell off the bandwagon a few weeks ago :/ ). I have a separate twitter account for keeping track of those bits I've gotten published: http://twitter.com/q8p\nI tend to update http://twitter.com/Kaolinfire with whatever I have going on; and http://twitter.com/gudmagazine with whatever GUD has going on.\nI think when one follows inspiration, there is a bit of chaos that flows into one's life. Sometimes it seems one can follow a river, until it becomes a waterfall, and you don't know where it's taking you; you just know you need to let go and follow it. And all those projects you intend to do? Well, the current took you a different direction.\nI wonder if this is true for you? I wonder if the same inspiration and creativity that allows you to write for Strange Horizons is the same inspiration that allows you to draw, edit, or design websites. Yes, they're separate. Yes, they might even blur (like genres). But is the source the inspiration comes from the same?\nThere's definitely a chaotic flow that I follow (and I do love chaos--my math-fu is a little weak, but I did manage to sit a chaotic dynamical systems course \u2014 great stuff and ties into cognition as well\u2026\nThe vast array of projects stems somewhat from my need to be doing /something/, and just maybe not \"this\" something. One thing I've had to learn is how to reduce the scope of my ambition for any particular project. I take something large I want to do, break it into concepts, and then try to come up with smaller projects that will help me study those concepts and hopefully make the final project more bite-sized when I get to it.

This deeply rooted acceptance gives kids a unique perspective on how technology can be further used to make our lives easier, and helps researchers predict future needs for innovation.\nWhat can we learn from the digital natives?\nWe asked this question back in September, and it\u2019s one\u00a0that research firm Latitude sought to answer with its KIDS \u2013 Kids Innovation Discovery Series initiative. Now, Latitude is back to find out how technology, specifically robotics, can be used to inspire new opportunities for learning and creativity.\nLatitude\u2019s Robots @ School study, which was conducted this month, asked kids across the world to illustrate and write a story that answers this question: \u201cWhat would happen if robots were a part of your everyday life \u2014 at school and beyond?\u201d\nThe results provide a compelling look on how youngsters feel about modern technology, and most importantly, reveals that tech has a huge potential for blurring the lines between learning and play.\u00a0Steve Mushkin, founder and president of Latitude explains :\nEducation and learning are moving, at least in many children\u2019s eyes, beyond acts of knowledge transmission toward acts of exploration and creation.\u201d\nWith children so easy to embrace\u00a0robotics, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a ton of potential for integrating intelligent technologies into learning environments. Besides, the idea of \u201cexploring and creating\u201d sounds a heck of a lot better than answering true/false questions out of a booklet. Clearly there are tons of new and interesting ways to learn, and technology is, in many ways, responsible for this.\nTaking a deeper look at the stories the children created, the survey found that unlike many adults who see technology as separate from humanness, it seems that \u201ckids tend to think of technology as fundamentally human: as a social companion that can entertain, motivate, and empower them in various contexts.\u201d\nWhile this dreamy perspective is partially the result of childhood imagination (something kids from any generation can have), it is clear that kids are eagerly anticipating new ways that tech can enhance their lives.\nSure, it\u2019s easy to dismiss how children look forward to the future and dream without inhibitions, but that\u2019s exactly what some of the greatest innovators of our time have done. Children don\u2019t just react, they imagine, and that\u2019s why this study can\u2019t be overlooked.\nCheck out the full study, including the kids stories and illustrations here .\u00a0You\u2019ll also want to check out the infographic below, which is based on the results.\nFollow @TNWinsider OR rss\nAbout the Author\nHarrison Weber is the East Coast & Design Editor at TNW in NYC.

He just published a book called \"The Nature of Technology: What it is and how it evolves.\" Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, an early employee at Sun Microsystems, says of Arthur, that the Java operating system was \"launched based on Brian Arthur's ideas.\" Also, John Seeley Brown, who was the former director of Xerox PARC, where the computer revolution was essentially birthed, said \"hundreds of millions of dollars slosh around Silicon Valley every day based on Brian Arthur's ideas.\"\nHere is an interview he recently gave to Edge.org (my favorite website for thinking bigger than big)\nI would also love to talk to you more about what is a \"Soul,\" and what is the value of \"Intuition.\" I don't think there is any technologist or Imagineer who has a better Intuition than Steve Jobs.

We contain multitudes.\"\nThere just so happens to be a talk this Wednesday at the Harvard Club by Franz de Waal on his \"The Age of Empathy.\"\nAnd, regarding \"Transparency,\" you may want to check out an essay that one of your, and my, favorite thinkers, Larry Lessig, wrote about Transparency.

In the UK and other Western nations, government seeks to connect research funding with economic productivity. But good research, he argued, need not be so directly associated with GDP\u2013indirect contributions and contributions over time are just as valuable. Drawing on Foucault\u2019s notions of governmentality, he pointed out that early universities, and research, produced good citizens or sovereign subjects but have since been taken over by economic rationality. And since homo economicus cannot be divorced from civil society in liberal governmentality, it does us a disservice to treat them as mutually exclusive processes. He also pointed out that we cannot value research in economic terms without also valuing it in civil terms. (See Karin Knorr Cetina\u2019s recent paper, \u201cComplex Global Microstructures\u201d ( pdf ) and her discussion of modes of living forward.) He also suggested that while the arts and humanities are crucial players in the research arena, they are not good in and of themselves, and he recommended Mark Taylor\u2019s End of the University as We Know It as a solid discussion of what needs to change. (I wish more art and design research engaged this kind of relational thinking.) He warned that validating research with the words \u201ccreative\u201d or \u201cinnovative\u201d is highly problematic, not least because it is extremely difficult to value or know when they happen or work. Nigel also argued that universities need to be reorganised and generate different (non-government) sorts of income, and in doing so they will be reinvented.\nThe next session was called \u201cProvocations\u201d and it involved pairs of researchers quickly (and sometimes quite humourously) taking on some, well, provocative statements about research.\nCuriosity-driven research is a dead duck ( James Dekker & John Reynolds )\nDefined as research done without regard for its end-use, or done for its own sake; expensive, difficult to get right and there are better things on the menu. (Yes.) But the search for solutions should not be confused with the search for knowledge. Blue-skies research provides the building blocks for our world and gets us to ask more questions.\nThe only valuable research is research which has commercial value ( Margaret Kilvington & Nick Lewis )\nWe act as if there is such a thing as non-commercial research; commerce doesn\u2019t just mean trade of goods, it means social intercourse. But public value doesn\u2019t just mean more widgets, and we need other ways of knowing other things.\nPublically-funded researchers should have to justify the value of their research ( Andrew Kibblewhite & Maria Margh )\nUsing other people\u2019s hard-earned cash, you have to make a good case. Justification confronts weaknesses and creates linkages. But how do we define public, justification or value? [Note to self: v. interesting, look into these issues.]\nThen was a choice of three \u201cHot Spots\u201d \u2013 one on curiosity, one on commercialisation, and one on communication. I chose to attend Brennan Wood \u2018s session, \u201cTelling the Truth,\u201d even though I was really nervous that someone was actually going to claim that research yields truth. But then he began by saying that if we want to realise the value of research in NZ it means communicating the value of research\u2013in fact, communication can be seen as the primary measure of scientific value. (I think that many of my creative practitioner colleagues would take issue with this but I suspect that\u2019s because they\u2019re quite clued in to the fact that not all forms of communication are equally valued.) Brennan brought up attempts to communicate with aliens as one of the ways in which we have attempted, and failed, to introduce ourselves to others and establish long-term relationships. Following Jackie O, he said we really want science for the love, the money and the companionship, and he said that the companions of scientists are other scientists, funders and citizens\u2013and we need to know how to communicate effectively with each.\nIs scientist-to-scientist communication too difficult? What strategies might persuade scientists that communication is less the \u2018about\u2019 and more the \u2018doing\u2019 of science? What innovative strategies can scientists use to create communication from their work as this work unfolds? How can public communication about science be enhanced in NZ?\nWe then split into groups to discuss the questions above, and our group focussed on the differences between public communication and publicity. I\u2019m not sure what to take from that, but I did get the sense that NZ cultural expectations favour modesty over anything that could be construed as self-promotion. (Personally I struggle with this, both as a foreigner and a woman who has long been told that greater modesty would make others more comfortable. But this isn\u2019t the time or place to get into that.) I\u2019m also not sure what kind of conversation can happen when people only have 10-15 seconds each to speak; it tended to reduce all our comments to media sound bites (and mine were pretty lame at that). Nonetheless, I hope to run into the man who asked us how we could move beyond disseminating our own research and start creating curiosity in non-researchers, as well as the confidence to seek out information on their own. I thought this was a brilliant question that no one answered.\nAfter lunch, Nigel Thrift and Bryan Crump wrapped up the \u201cImagining Value\u201d session with a discussion. Nigel pointed out that the future of research will rely on funding from large companies unless the government is able to provide it. This will undoubtedly involve establishing boundaries around things like academic freedom and intellectual property. There will be things like non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements, or 6-month delays on publication so that companies can do something with the research first. Bryan asked how we could provide solutions (applied research) before we had knowledge (basic research), and Nigel simply responded that there would be both. (Does anyone actually argue that we should only pursue basic OR applied research?) However, Nigel also claimed that the corporate sector will (can?) never take over the role of government as the primary research funding source, and he suggested that if only 10% of funding applications succeed there is a serious problem, not least because it\u2019s so demoralising, and that some people think that less than a 30% success rate is a problem. (The Marsden Fund success rate is just under 10% and I know that some researchers have applied every year for 5+ years, and fail to see why they should keep trying.) Nigel also mentioned that role that humility plays in all of this, and I would have loved to hear him say more on this because humility needn\u2019t be equated with modesty.\nPreviously\n"}, {"score": 961.4185, "uuid": "da80dfc9-4f81-5c0c-b98e-f1fbeadb2eec", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1208wb-32-08824", "target_hostname": "kumagoropower.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://kumagoropower.deviantart.com/journal/poll/888006/", "page_rank": 1.3510721e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "kumagoroPOWER&#x27;s poll: <em>You</em> <em>think</em> I&#x27;m...", "snippet": "Your art <em>is</em> so much <em>better</em> <em>than</em> mine, and I&#x27;m 17!

I guess you can tell which type of person I am. This post is 10 suggestions for books about India that are better than Shantaram.\nI tried to read Shantaram when I was living in Delhi, but ended up literally throwing it across the room. I thought it was poorly written and more about the fevered imagination of its writer than about India. In fact, it offers very little insight into India, if you ask me; and the longer I spend in India getting to know it, the more true this statement becomes.\nSince that time, however, I\u2019ve read lots and lots of book about India, by Indians and foreigners, and almost all of them are much, much better. Except Eat, Pray, Love. If you actually want to know something about India \u2014 rather than about an ego-driven writer \u2014 I suggest the following 10 books, in no particular order.\n(If you want to learn more about a book, below, hover your cursor over the image; and to buy it, simply click on the image and you will be whisked to the U.S. Amazon site.)\n1. A Search in Secret India by Paul Brunton. A cult classic, this book was published in 1934 and it\u2019s about the author\u2019s sincere, strange and ultimately inspiring search for spiritual truth in India. After many false starts, dead-ends and kooky run-ins, he lands at the feet of Sri Ramana Maharishi. Which in itself a metaphor for the spiritual journey. This is the book that introduced Sri Ramana Maharishi to the west (and he still remains one of the greatest Indian saints of the 20th century).\n2. Empire of the Soul by Paul William Roberts. This is the book I hope Shantaram readers graduate to read. It is about two lengthy trips journalist Roberts took to India, separated by many years; and about how he reconciles some of the extraordinary experiences he had there. Roberts is known for hard-boiled books about war-torn countries like Iraq, so when he writes about his spiritual awakening, it rings true.\n3. Out of India by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. The introduction to this book of short stories is alone worth the price of the book. It\u2019s hands-down the best piece of writing I have ever read about what it is like to be a foreigner in India. Absolutely priceless. If you recognize her name, it\u2019s because she was the screen-writer for the Merchant-Ivory film productions (including A Passage to India, see #6.)\n4. India\u2019s Unending Journey by Mark Tully. Mark Tully was the BBC\u2019s chief correspondent in India for many years. He has the character to overcome his profession\u2019s limitations and admit that the chief thing he learned in India was to be certain only about uncertainty. And he says it\u2019s the most valuable thing he has ever learned.\n5. India: A Million Mutinies Now by V.S. Naipul. What can I say? It\u2019s the classic. Personally, I admire this book more than I like it.\n6. Passage to India by E.M. Forster. Very recently, the Consul General of India in Toronto \u2014 a remarkably cultured woman \u2014 told me she thought Forster really captured India in this book. I told her I feel like Fielding. Mutual understanding was firmly established. It was the best book I studied at university, I still remember the discussion about the meaning of the Marabar Caves. The film is good too!\n7. Maximum City by Suketu Mehta. This is one of the best books I have read recently. It has an ambitious scope and many small wonderful moments, and seemed Dickensian to me in its attempt to capture the spirit of the times in a big, broiling, magnificent city. This is Bombay (Mumbai): gangsters and hero cops, foot-path poets and down-to-earth movie stars. You will learn a lot more about what Bombay is really about in this book than in Shantaram.\n8. Kim by Rudyard Kipling. This is my favourite book of all time. If you\u2019ve never read it, throw out everything you think you know about Kipling, who was the most famous writer of his time. The book follows the story of teenage Kim, son of an Irish immigrant and \u2018friend of all the world\u2019, who travels the roads of India with his guru, an elderly Tibetan lama on a spiritual quest for a river of enlightenment. It is unique and uncanny in its ability to absolutely immerse you into the scene and the story. You can feel the oppressive heat of the plains and the crisp air of the mountains. You can imagine Kim\u2019s excitement about rejoining his friend on the road after a stint locked-up at school. You can feel the old man\u2019s pain as his quest seems to elude him, and the love he engenders in Kim, his disciple. And you will be carried away by the transcendent ending.\n9. City of Djinns by William Dalrymple. I was torn, not sure which Dalrymple book to put on this list. They are all good, especially Nine Lives. He is a solid as a rock in terms of research, reporting and writing. But this is his first book about India and it\u2019s about Delhi (Dilli), my home-away-from home in India \u2014 and in fact, his real home. He lives there now. He has an Indian soul. The book is both a personal narrative about living in India for a year and about the history of Delhi. (And if there\u2019s one thing Delhi has, aside from crowds of people and traffic, it\u2019s history.) It\u2019s by turns informative and funny. I keep intending to find out if International Backside taxi stand really exists. P.S. Dalrymple is the found of the Jaipur Literature Festival.\n10. Freedom at Midnight by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre. On the stroke of midnight, August 15, 1947, India became free. This is the classic book about the biggest event in modern Indian history: the freedom struggle, partition and birth of a nation. You cannot begin to know or understand modern India if you don\u2019t have a grip on its struggle for independence and the larger-than-life players who made it happen, especially Gandhi, Nehru, Mountbatten and Jinnah. The film Gandhi , directed by Richard Attenborough, gives you a lot of the same information, but this book fills in all the holes.\nIf you enjoyed this post, you can\u2026.\nGet updates and read additional stories on the Breathedreamgo Facebook page .\nBuy Song of India , a collection of 10 feature stories about my travels in India.

So far I have read only the last and latest selection, from The Wandering Cherub by Silesius Angelus, who wrote in the seventeenth century.\nIn the stack of magazines, read and unread, that I can never bring myself to throw away, there are any number of articles suggesting that science, too, explores the apophatic\u2014reality that eludes words\u2014dark matter, dark energy, the unexpressed dimensions proposed by string theory, the imponderable strangeness described by quantum theory. These magazine essays might be titled \u201cLearned Ignorance,\u201d or \u201cThe Cloud of Unknowing,\u201d or they might at least stand beside Plato\u2019s and Plotinus\u2019s demonstrations of the failures of language, which are, paradoxically, demonstrations of the extraordinary power of language to evoke a reality beyond its grasp, to evoke a sense of what cannot be said.\nI love all this for a number of reasons, one of them being that, as a writer, I continually attempt to make inroads on the vast terrain of what cannot be said\u2014or said by me, at least. I seem to know by intuition a great deal that I cannot find words for, and to enlarge the field of my intuition every time I fail again to find these words. That is to say, the unnamed is overwhelmingly present and real for me. And this is truer because the moment it stops being a standard for what I do say is the moment my language goes slack and my imagination disengages itself. I would almost say it is the moment in which my language becomes false. The frontiers of the unsayable, and the avenues of approach to those frontiers, have been opened for me by every book I have ever read that was in any degree ambitious, earnest, or imaginative; by every good teacher I have had; by music and painting; by conversation that was in any way interesting, even conversation overheard as it passed between strangers.\nAdvertisement\nAs a fiction writer I do have to deal with the nuts and bolts of temporal reality\u2014from time to time a character has to walk through a door and close it behind him, the creatures of imagination have to eat and sleep, as all other creatures do. I would have been a poet if I could, to have avoided this obligation to simulate the hourliness and dailiness of human life. This is not to say that books could not be written about walking through a door\u2014away from what? toward what? leaving what wake of consequence? creating what stir of displacement? To speak in the terms that are familiar to us all, there was a moment in which Jesus, as a man, a physical presence, left that supper at Emmaus. His leave-taking was a profound event for which the supper itself was precursor. Presence is a great mystery, and presence in absence, which Jesus promised and has epitomized, is, at a human scale, a great reality for all of us in the course of ordinary life.\nI am persuaded for the moment that this is in fact the basis of community. I would say, for the moment, that community, at least community larger than the immediate family, consists very largely of imaginative love for people we do not know or whom we know very slightly. This thesis may be influenced by the fact that I have spent years of my life lovingly absorbed in the thoughts and perceptions of\u2014who knows it better than I?\u2014people who do not exist. And, just as writers are engrossed in the making of them, readers are profoundly moved and also influenced by the nonexistent, that great clan whose numbers increase prodigiously with every publishing season. I think fiction may be, whatever else, an exercise in the capacity for imaginative love, or sympathy, or identification.\nI love the writers of my thousand books. It pleases me to think how astonished old Homer, whoever he was, would be to find his epics on the shelf of such an unimaginable being as myself, in the middle of an unrumored continent. I love the large minority of the writers on my shelves who have struggled with words and thoughts and, by my lights, have lost the struggle. All together they are my community, the creators of the very idea of books, poetry, and extended narratives, and of the amazing human conversation that has taken place across millennia, through weal and woe, over the heads of interest and utility.\nWe live on a little island of the articulable, which we tend to mistake for reality itself. We can and do make small and tedious lives as we sail through the cosmos on our uncannily lovely little planet, and this is surely remarkable. But we do so much else besides. For example, we make language. A language is a grand collaboration, a collective art form which we begin to master as babes and sucklings, and which we preserve, modify, cull, enlarge as we pass through our lives. Some students in France drew my attention to the enormous number of English words that describe the behavior of light. Glimmer, glitter, glister, glisten, gleam, glow, glare, shimmer, sparkle, shine, and so on. These old words are not utilitarian. They reflect an aesthetic attention to experience that has made, and allows us to make, pleasing distinctions among, say, a candle flame, the sun at its zenith, and the refraction of light by a drop of rain. How were these words coined and retained, and how have they been preserved through generations, so that English-speaking people use them with the precision necessary to preserving them? None of this can be ascribed to conscious choice on the part of anyone, but somehow the language created, so to speak, a prism through which light passes, by means of which its qualities are arrayed. One of the pleasures of writing is that so often I know that there is in fact a word that is perfect for the use I want to put it to, and when I summon it, it comes, though I might not have thought of it for years. And then I think, somewhere someone was the first person to use that word. Then how did it make its way into the language, and how did it retain the specificity that makes it perfect for this present use? Language is profoundly communal, and in the mere fact of speaking, then writing, a wealth of language grows and thrives among us that has enabled thought and knowledge in a degree we could never calculate. As individuals and as a species, we are unthinkable without our communities.\nI remember once, as a child, walking into a library, looking around at the books, and thinking, I could do that. In fact I didn\u2019t do it until I was well into my thirties, but the affinity I felt with books as such preserved in me the secret knowledge that I was a writer when any dispassionate appraisal of my life would have dismissed the notion entirely. So I belong to the community of the written word in several ways. First, books have taught me most of what I know, and they have trained my attention and my imagination. Second, they gave me a sense of the possible, which is the great service\u2014and too often, when it is ungenerous, the great disservice\u2014a community performs for its members. Third, they embodied richness and refinement of language, and the artful use of language in the service of the imagination. Fourth, they gave me and still give me courage. Sometimes, when I have spent days in my study dreaming a world while the world itself shines outside my windows, forgetting to call my mother because one of my nonbeings has come up with a thought that interests me, I think, this is a very odd way to spend a life. But I have my library all around me, my cloud of witnesses to the strangeness and brilliance of human experience, who have helped me to my deepest enjoyments of it. Every writer I know, when asked how to become a writer, responds with one word: Read. Excellent advice, for a great many reasons, a few of which I have suggested here.\nAnd this brings us to the subject of education. In the United States, education, especially at the higher levels, is based around powerful models of community. We choose our colleges, if we have a choice, in order to be formed by them and supported by them in the identities we have or aspire to. If the graft takes, we consider ourselves ever after to be members of that community.\nAs one consequence, graduates tend to treat the students who come after them as kin and also as heirs. They take pride in the successes of people in classes forty years ahead of or behind their own. They have a familial desire to enhance the experience of generations of students who are, in fact, strangers to them, except in the degree that the ethos and curriculum of the place does indeed form its students over generations. These gifts are very often made, the donors say, out of gratitude and in celebration, and I have no reason to doubt it. I am even inclined to look charitably upon the fondness of donors for seeing their names on buildings and fountains, to consider it the expression of a desire to implant themselves immortally in the consciousness of a beloved community. In any case, many of our colleges and universities have been richly adorned over many years with assets and resources we are far too ready to take for granted. There are literally hundreds of places in this country where an open and committed student can enjoy an education that would be extraordinary by any except the very high standard so many of these institutions do sustain. This is not to devalue the achievements of any specific university, only to speak the pleasant truth about American higher education in general.\nFrom time to time I, as a professor in a public university, receive a form from the legislature asking me to make an account of the hours I spend working. I think someone ought to send a form like that to the legislators. The comparison might be very interesting. The faculty in my acquaintance are quite literally devoted to their work, almost obsessive about it. They go on vacation to do research. Even when they retire they don\u2019t retire. I have benefited enormously from the generosity of teachers from grade school through graduate school. They are an invaluable community who contribute as much as legislators do to sustaining civilization, and more than legislators do to equipping the people of this country with the capacity for learning and reflection, and the power that comes with that capacity. Lately we have been told and told again that our educators are not preparing American youth to be efficient workers. Workers. That language is so common among us now that an extraterrestrial might think we had actually lost the Cold War.\nThe intellectual model for most of the older schools in America\u2014for all of them, given the prestige and influence of the older schools\u2014was a religious tradition that loved the soul and the mind and was meant to encourage the exploration and refinement of both of them. Recent statistics indicate American workers are the most productive in the world by a significant margin, as they have been for as long as such statistics have been ventured. If we were to retain humane learning and lose a little edge in relative productivity, I would say we had chosen the better part. Since we need not choose between one and the other, I think we ought to reconsider the pressure, amounting sometimes to hostility, that has lately been brought to bear on our educational culture at every level, particularly in the humanities and the arts.\nHere I have wandered into the terrain of societal tensions, by which the dear old United States is much afflicted at the moment. There is a notion with a brutal history that a homogeneous country is more peaceful and stable and, in a very deep sense, more satisfying than one with a complex and mingled population like ours. To an alarming extent, we have internalized this prejudice against ourselves. I have read that the word \u201cheterogeneous,\u201d which was originally a term of geology, was first applied to society by the French writer Chateaubriand to describe America. Ironically, he was in America to escape the French Revolution and its aftermath, as thorough a social dissolution as has occurred in modern history. But he wrote that America was too diverse to be stable. Heterogeneous stone is not as solid as homogeneous stone. Oh, the power of metaphor.\nIn fact, Europe has gone berserk from time to time over this anxiety about mixed populations, most recently in the former Yugoslavia a few years ago. There is talk now that Belgium will cease to exist, having fallen into ethnic and linguistic halves, and there is fear that this will trigger divisions in other parts of Europe. This same anxiety is tormenting contemporary Africa, and it is one source of the disasters that have befallen Iraq. The assumption behind it is that people who differ from oneself are therefore enemies who have either ruined everything or are about to. It is the old assumption of Chateaubriand that difference undermines stability and strength.\nWhen this assumption takes hold, the definition of community hardens and contracts and becomes violently exclusive and defensive. We have seen Christians against Christians, Muslims against Muslims, fighting to the death over distinctions those outside their groups would probably never notice and could certainly never understand. When definitions of \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d begin to contract, there seems to be no limit to how narrow these definitions can become. As they shrink and narrow, they are increasingly inflamed, more dangerous and inhumane.\nThey present themselves as movements toward truer and purer community, but, as I have said, they are the destruction of community. They insist that the imagination must stay within the boundaries they establish for it, that sympathy and identification are only allowable within certain limits. I am convinced that the broadest possible exercise of imagination is the thing most conducive to human health, individual and global.\nIn fact, we in America have done pretty well. By human standards, which admittedly are low. That we have done relatively well, I submit, is due to the fact that we have many overlapping communities and that most of us identify with a number of them. I identify with my congregation, with my denomination, with Christianity, with the customs and institutions that express the human capacity for reverence, allowing for turbulence within these groups and phenomena. Since we are human beings, turbulence is to be expected. If the effect of turbulence is to drive me or anyone back on some narrower definition of identity, then the moderating effects of broader identification are lost. And this destroys every community\u2014not only through outright suppression or conflict. Those who seemingly win are damaged inwardly and insidiously because they have betrayed the better nature and the highest teaching of their community in descending to exclusion, suppression, or violence. Those of us who accept a historical tradition find ourselves feeling burdened by its errors and excesses, especially when we are pressed to make some account of them. I would suggest that those who reject the old traditions on these grounds are refusing to accept the fact that the tragic mystery of human nature has by no means played itself out, and that wisdom, which is almost always another name for humility, lies in accepting one\u2019s own inevitable share in human fallibility.\nI am a little sensitive on this point because another identification I hold passionately is with the academic community, which has its fair share of skeptics and agnostics, some of whom are well enough informed historically to mention Michael Servetus from time to time, to make an occasional offhand remark about the Thirty Years War. On all sorts of grounds I would go to the barricades to defend their right to make me uncomfortable, of course. They have caused me to ponder many things, to my great benefit. There are many examples now of friction between the extremes of these communities, and when it takes the form of radical opposition of either to the other the result is a decline from the humane standards that at best dignify them both.\nThere are excitements that come with abandoning the constraints of moderation and reasonableness. Those whose work it is to sustain the endless palaver of radio and television increasingly stimulate these excitements. No great wonder if they are bored, or if they suspect their audiences might be. But the effect of this marketing of rancor has unquestionably been to turn debate or controversy increasingly into a form of tribal warfare, harming the national community and risking always greater harm. I think it is reasonable to wonder whether democracy can survive in this atmosphere. Democracy, in its essence and genius, is imaginative love for and identification with a community with which, much of the time and in many ways, one may be in profound disagreement.\nDemocracy wrote itself some interesting history in the second half of the last century. When I was in high school, there were essentially three choices available to a bright girl like myself. I could be a teacher, I could be a nurse, or I could be a homemaker. My chemistry teacher was so sure I would finally be a nurse that he gave me much better grades than I had earned, so that this path would not be closed to me. And my unknown in the final exam was sodium chloride. But my biology teacher noticed that my drawing of the frog we were supposed to have dissected was entirely too imaginative to reflect any acquaintance at all with the actual innards of the thing, and he, wisely, advised me to pay no attention to the chemistry teacher.\nIt was my brother who told me I should be a poet. This was not a career, as he or I understood it, but a highly respectable use of solitude. I never had any real aspiration, only the knowledge that adulthood would come and I would want to while it away harmlessly enough to be considered a credit to my family. This may not reflect well on me, but it\u2019s the truth, and I find it worth telling here because I was in fact pulled along into a broader and broader world by the generous interest of my brother, and of friends, a pastor, and various teachers. I believe I would have been happy with my unaspiring life\u2014which always included a great deal of reading. But I am certain that I am happier with the very different, very interesting life that has befallen me.\nWhen I was in college, at Pembroke, which has since disappeared into Brown, we women enjoyed exactly the same rigorous and ambitious education that the men did. Why? One dean explained to us that educated men preferred to have educated wives, and that corporations often interviewed the wife when they made decisions about whom to hire. Education made women socially presentable. This sounds appalling, but I don\u2019t think it was ever a real consideration for anyone. The faculty loved to teach, and they taught well, and a certain percentage of those they taught were women.\nJust at that time the great social transformation began, set in motion by Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and many others, which called into doubt the whole system of discrimination that had governed most lives, not only in America but throughout the world. Almost suddenly an expanding field of possibility lay open to women, certainly to me. And almost as suddenly I had reasonable uses to make of my brains and my education. By chance I benefited profoundly from the self-transformation of communities and institutions that have been most central to my life. They changed my experience, and they also changed my mind. If I had lived a generation earlier, I might have thought about many of the things that interest me now, but not with the discipline that comes with writing about them or teaching, and not with the rigor that comes with being exposed to response and criticism. And, of course, I would have had no part in conversations that I consider important. So my mind has been formed by the uses I have been able to make of it. It is true for everyone that the experience that society gives to us, or denies us, is profoundly formative. Because I have lived at the cusp of great social change, I am perhaps especially aware of this fact. I am aware not only of the benefits I have enjoyed, sharing the life of this community, but also of the good service we can do one another by contributing as we can to the health, generosity, and courage of our community.\nI have talked about community as being a work of the imagination, and I hope I have made clear my belief that the more generous the scale at which imagination is exerted, the healthier and more humane the community will be. There is a great deal of cynicism at present, among Americans, about the American population. Someone told me recently that a commentator of some sort had said, \u201cThe United States is in spiritual free-fall.\u201d When people make such remarks, such appalling judgments, they never include themselves, their friends, those with whom they agree. They have drawn, as they say, a bright line between an \u201cus\u201d and a \u201cthem.\u201d Those on the other side of the line are assumed to be unworthy of respect or hearing, and are in fact to be regarded as a huge problem to the \u201cus\u201d who presume to judge \u201cthem.\u201d\nThis tedious pattern has repeated itself endlessly through human history and is, as I have said, the end of community and the beginning of tribalism.\nAt this point in my life I have probably had a broader experience of the American population than is usual. I have been to divinity schools, and I have been to prisons. In the First Epistle of Peter we are told to honor everyone, and I have never been in a situation where I felt this instruction was inappropriate. When we accept dismissive judgments of our community we stop having generous hopes for it. We cease to be capable of serving its best interests. The cultural disaster called \u201cdumbing down,\u201d which swept through every significant American institution and grossly impoverished civic and religious life, was and is the result of the obsessive devaluing of the lives that happen to pass on this swath of continent. On average, in the main, we are Christian people, if the polls are to be believed. How is Christianity consistent with this generalized contempt that seems to lie behind so much so-called public discourse? Why the judgmentalism, among people who are supposed to believe we are, and we live among, souls precious to God\u2014300 million of them on this plot of ground, a population large and various enough to hint broadly at the folly of generalization? It is simply not possible to act in good faith toward people one does not respect, or to entertain hopes for them that are appropriate to their gifts. As we withdraw from one another we withdraw from the world, except as we increasingly insist that foreign groups and populations are our irreconcilable enemies. The shrinking of imaginative identification which allows such things as shared humanity to be forgotten always begins at home.\nTo look only at certain effects of this cynicism that manifest themselves in my experience: It is my good fortune to work with many gifted young writers. They are estimable people. The Writers\u2019 Workshop is as interesting and civilized a community as I have ever encountered, and it owes the successes of its long history to the fact that it works well as a community. A pretty large percentage of these fine young spirits come to me convinced that if their writing is not sensationalistic enough, it will never be published, or if it is published, it will never be read. They come to me persuaded that American readers will not tolerate ideas in their fiction. Since they feel that anything recognizable as an idea is off-limits to them, they sometimes try to signal intellectual seriousness by taking a jaundiced or splenetic view of the worlds they create and people. They are good, generous souls working within limits they feel are imposed on them by a public that could not possibly have an interest in writing that ignored these limits\u2014a public they cannot respect.\nOnly consider how many things have gone wrong here, when a young writer is dissuaded by the pessimism that floats around the culture from letting her or his talent develop in the direction natural to it. If the writer is talented, the work might well be published, and the American reading public will look once more into the mirror of art and find sensationalism, violence, condescension, cynicism\u2014another testament to collective mediocrity if not something worse. Maybe even spiritual free-fall. But the writer is better than this, and the reading public is better than this. And the publishing industry is better than this, too. The whole phenomenon is a mistake of the kind that is intractable because so much that passes for common wisdom supports it. A writer controlled by what \u201chas to\u201d figure in a book is actually accepting a perverse, unofficial censorship, and this tells against the writerly soul at least as surely as it would if the requirement being met were praise to some ideology or regime. And the irony of it all is that it is unnecessary and in many cases detrimental because it militates against originality. But the worst of it is that so long as a writer is working to satisfy imagined expectations that are extraneous to his art as he would otherwise explore and develop it, he is deprived of the greatest reward, which is the full discovery and engagement of his own mind, his own aesthetic powers and resources. So long as a writer is working below the level of her powers, she is depriving the community of readers of a truly good book. And over time a truly good book can enrich literally millions of lives. This is only one instance of the fact that when we condescend, when we act consistently with a sense of the character of people in general which demeans them, we impoverish them and ourselves, and preclude our having a part in the creation of the highest wealth, the testimony to the mysterious beauty of life we all value in psalms and tragedies and epics and meditations, in short stories and novels. In the same way we diminish the worth of the institutions of society\u2014law, journalism, education, and religion as well\u2014when we forget respect and love for the imagined other, the man or woman or child we will never know, who will take the good from these institutions that we invest in them, or who will be harmed or disheartened because our institutions are warped by meagerness and cynicism.\nIt is very much in the gift of the community to enrich individual lives, and it is in the gift of any individual to enlarge and enrich community.\nThe great truth that is too often forgotten is that it is in the nature of people to do good to one another.\nThis essay was excerpted from When I Was a Child I Read Books , a collection of essays to be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in March, copyright Marilynne Robinson.\nFollow Commonweal on Facebook and Twitter\nkeywords\n"}, {"score": 957.2431, "uuid": "c2f4bfbd-e921-5189-ad4b-5a3789189dd2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0603wb-39-11350", "target_hostname": "www.twoaspirinsandacomedy.com", "target_uri": "http://www.twoaspirinsandacomedy.com/extras/Ch2-Imagination.html", "page_rank": 1.2206444e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Imagination</em> and Culture", "snippet": "<em>You</em> have to <em>do</em> more <em>than</em> &quot;wish upon a star&quot; to make your dreams come true.

The physicist's great breakthrough came from imagining what he might see if he were riding a photon through the depths of space. It made sense for him to give credit to imagination, although in everyday discourse a contrary position is taken for granted - that wise people are those realistic types who keep \"their feet on the ground.\" We have all been warned against indulging our imaginative tendencies: we should not daydream or even speculate much about what might have been, or what may yet happen. The ability to distinguish between the two is supposedly the main difference between sanity and insanity. Sane people are those who live in the world of reality, except for rare, fleeting, and unimportant moments of escapism.\nWell, it's not quite that simple. Though you and I may never entertain such a fantasy as riding a photon, we do have a rich imaginative life, whether we notice it or not. We could hardly get through the day without it. Daydreams may constitute about half of the thousands of thoughts and images we produce in a day.\nIn Defence of Fantasies\nHere I intend to defend the imagination. Oddly, people normally feel ashamed of their daydreams. The imagination is an indispensable aspect of realistic, practical thinking, not its antithesis. Realism and fantasy depend on each other. I want to explore the influence of fantasies (both our own and those that writers and actors create for us) on the quality of our human relationships - the ethical dimension of our experience. This exploration is preliminary to a larger discussion of the social use of fictional cultural products.\nDreams and daydreams can yield practical solutions to empirical problems. Einstein said that \"the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.\" He was not the only scientist who used fantasy in that way. I'll illustrate by mentioning three other geniuses whose imagination gave them their greatest research insight.\nThe chemist Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 had been working in 1858 on the structure of organic compounds when he dozed off in front of his fireplace. He imagined atoms in\n\"long rows sometimes more closely fitted together all twining and twisting in snake-like motion. But look! What was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis.\"\nThis image of a snake biting its own tail revealed to him the structure of the benzene ring - the basis of all organic chemistry.\nOr consider Nikola Tesla, one of the greatest inventors of all time, who is best known for discovering alternating current. Tesla's fantasy life was remarkable. In his autobiography, he described visions that seemed so real that he could not always tell which ones were tangible and which ones not. Yet he was far from being mad, and indeed he put his visualizing capacities to work in the realm of physics.\n\"When I get an idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever; the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form this final product of my brain. Invariably my device works as I conceived that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In twenty years there has not been a single exception.\"\nAnd finally, my third example is Elias Howe, who invented the sewing machine in 1845. He had been attempting to invent such an instrument for years. One night he fell asleep at his workbench and dreamed of being captured by cannibals in Africa. They carried him home on a pole and dumped him into a pot, preparing to boil him. Although he managed to loosen the ropes from his hands and tried to climb out of the pot, the cannibals kept poking him down again with their spears, which had holes in the points.\nHowe awoke with a shock. \"Holes in the points!\" he exclaimed. \"That's it!\" Of course, the solution to his problem was to put the hole in the point of the needle, instead of at the back, as in needles for hand sewing.\nThe brilliance of Howe, Einstein, Tesla, and Kekul\u00e9 can be attributed to their ability to play with fantasies and dreams in the back of their minds, yet notice the images and bring them up into consciousness, work through the practical implications, and then put the ideas into a form that others could see.\nThe Power of Imagining\nRelatively few people have such rich fantasy lives as these scientists and I don't want to exaggerate the sheer power of thoughts. You have to do more than \"wish upon a star\" to make your dreams come true. Nevertheless, the imagination is often consequential for ordinary people. Let me illustrate with three factors that show the power of images: the \"self-fulfilling prophecy;\" the placebo effect; and the relationship between health and emotional relationships.\nThe Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. A \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" occurs when an expectation about what others will do increases the probability that they will do exactly as predicted. Here, an image of the future influences the reality that actually takes place. The most famous example is the \"Pygmalion effect\" established by psychologist Robert Rosenthal. He found that teachers, by expecting high or low levels of achievement from their various students, actually make it more likely that the students will perform accordingly well or poorly. This happens even if the teacher does not tell anyone what he or she expects. Indeed, Rosenthal and his colleagues experimented by telling teachers that they had invented a new test that would predict which of their students would \"bloom\" that year. They told the teachers which students were likely to develop. Actually, they had randomly selected those students; they had no such test. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the students who had been predicted to bloom actually performed better on standardized tests than the other students. Apparently the teachers had unconsciously encouraged them more.\nThis phenomenon of self-fulfilling prediction has been shown to be involved with other expectations, such as an employer's anticipation that some workers will be better at their jobs than others.\nThe placebo effect. Self-fulfilling prophecies are well understood. In contrast, no one is quite sure how the placebo effect works. Here too, a belief evidently changes physical reality. A patient is given a sugar pill or some other inert substance (placebo), but is told that it is a potent medication that will cure his disease. Whenever placebos are administered, the proportion of people who feel better is considerably higher than the proportion who spontaneously recuperate without any treatment. Positive placebo reactions have been reported as ranging from 21 percent to 58 percent. Placebos can be genuinely helpful to patients. However, for the placebo to work, the doctor has to deceive the patient. Ordinarily physicians do not resort to this kind of lying.\nHealth and Emotions. For at least a generation, physicians have recognized the benefits of meditative calm for the health and emotional well being of their patients - especially those with stress-related disorders such as high blood pressure. Now they know that other states of mind besides meditation also are beneficial - not just calm, but a various intense positive feelings, such as love, joy, sexual pleasure, enthusiastic excitement, religious awe, tender affection, and laughter.\nOne might not be surprised to find small correlations between emotional well being and physical health, but the magnitude of the association is extraordinary - larger than the statistics pharmaceutical companies seek when testing the effectiveness of new drugs. People who feel close to no one and whose lives are lacking in love are at least three to five times more likely than other people to die prematurely. I review this research in Chapter 3.\nSo far as Two Aspirins and a Comedy is concerned, we are interested in the relationship between the imagination and the creation of cultural products, especially fiction - which are created, not instrumentally to address a practical problem, but rather expressively, for entertainment purposes. This distinction is worth elaborating.\nInstrumental and Consummatory Fantasies\nThe social philosopher George Herbert Mead distinguished between two kinds of acts: instrumental and expressive (or consummatory). The former type of act is a component of some other, larger-scale project. The consummatory act, on the other hand, is performed for its own sake as the direct fulfillment or expression of an impulse. For example, when I switch on my computer, that is an instrumental act - one phase of a larger act, checking my e-mail. But if my e-mail contains unexpectedly good news, I may dance around the room in joy - not as a phase of any other larger plan of action, but simply as an expression of elation. Mead would call the dance a consummatory or expressive act. Any act done for the sake of doing it, and not for some practical end, is consummatory. Religious ritual is consummatory, for instance, while magic is instrumental - done for the sake of gaining control over the forces that determine good or bad luck.\nWe can also distinguish between instrumental and consummatory fantasies. During some fantasies we are working out anticipated problems or attempting to interpret a situation by holding an internal debate between contrasting perspectives. These are \"instrumental\" imaginings that may, if they work out well, give us a new sense of clarity about, say, a moral, political, or scientific problem and enable us to act decisively. Dialogues with imaginary or internalized others about real problems or controversies are usually instrumental fantasies, whether or not they seem entirely rational or lucid.\nHowever, many other fantasies, such as your daydream about driving a snazzy sports car, are consummatory; you think about them for the sheer pleasure of experiencing them and not because they are a phase of addressing any other realistic end. Fiction - a novel, poem, movie, or other entertainment product - is predominantly meant as a consummatory experience, enjoyable simply as a moment of diversion or wish-fulfillment. However, even a frothy little romantic comedy may occasionally strike a deep chord in a viewer, bringing to mind a troubling unresolved issue and unexpectedly serving instrumentally to bring new insights. Stories may have greater influence than the readers realize.\nPopper's Three Worlds\nIdeas can exist in two states - either subjectively in the privacy of one's mind or in an objective form that others may witness. Ideas - indeed, all the components of culture - can go back and forth between the two states; they originate in someone's imagination, then may be manifested in some physical state, which others in turn may perceive and mull over privately in their own minds.\nTwo Aspirins and a Comedy explores the movement of ideas and feelings back and forth - from subjective experience into objective, empirical reality, which in turn stimulates new subjective experiences, and so on, ad infinitum. The interaction between objectivity and subjectivity interests me.\nNot all ideas ever become manifested in objective reality; most notions perish without having been shared. Those that do get expressed in an objective state may be ephemeral and obscure (a single sentence uttered in a public place, for example) or may last as long as the Sphinx.\nCulture contains only those ideas that have been manifested objectively, at least in a fleeting way. Culture originates in the imagination, but its existence must also be physical, objective, so as to move from one mind to another. A writer puts words onto a page; years later, a reader harvests them. A television crew puts a tender relationship onto tape; years later, a viewer's tears and hormones flow while watching it.\nSometimes culture contains ideas that no longer exist in any living person's mind, but which remain physically present, ready to be apprehended again by another mind. Take the ancient Etruscan language, for example. Today many of the written words have been decoded and about 100 texts have been translated for the first time in millennia. The ideas encoded in Etruscan writing existed objectively, but not subjectively, since no one could read them.\nWhen we distinguish between reality and the imagination, we are emphasizing the difference between the subjective realm of consciousness and the objective realm of physically observable phenomena, such as Etruscan inscriptions on stone monuments. But that latter realm, the physical realm, must be divided in two: natural phenomena and artifacts of human minds. An ordinary stone belongs to the former category, whereas an engraved tombstone or a diamond solitaire in a ring belongs to the latter category - physical artifacts that manifest intentions of the human mind.\nWe owe this distinction between two states of culture - as objective and subjective ideas - to the philosopher Karl Popper, who proposed three categories, which he called \"three worlds.\" World One is the physical, natural world. World Two is the world of consciousness - of fantasies, emotions, and all other mental processes. World Three consists of the products of the human mind. Popper meant to include in World Three everything observable that the human mind has fashioned, such as tools, institutions, musical performances, books, heart operations, and journals. These productions are different from the minds that create them; they exist objectively and often (but not always) rather permanently, enabling us to compare them, criticize them, argue about them, and develop them further. They may survive the minds - the World Two entities - that created them and they are therefore \"objective ideas.\" Popper explained that\n\"the third world, the world of objective knowledge... is man-made. But it is to be stressed that this world exists to a large extent autonomously; that it generates its own problems, especially those connected with methods of growth; and that its impact on any one of us, even on the most original of creative thinkers, vastly exceeds the impact which any of us can make upon it.\"\nSubjectivity - human consciousness, World Two - mediates between Worlds One and Three. Popper wrote:\n\"The three worlds are so related that the first two can interact, and that the last two can interact. Thus the second world, the world of subjective or personal experiences, interacts with each of the other two worlds. The first world and the third world cannot interact, save through the intervention of the second world, the world of subjective or personal experiences.\"\nAn immense accumulation of culture exists as objective knowledge - concretized artifacts in such places as the Internet, museums, and magazines. This is humanity's cultural storehouse of objective knowledge.\nThere is a constant interplay between Worlds Two and Three - between the subjective world of the imagination and the objective world of expressed ideas. Popper's classification system is itself an example. He thought it up and wrote it down. I read his book and thought about it further. Then I drew upon it in writing a book on a topic that probably would never have interested him. And so it goes.\nIn receiving, using, and passing objective knowledge on, we serve as curators of our World Three heritage. Ideas that have been recorded but are no longer part of any World Two process are dormant. Live culture consists of this ongoing motion of ideas from one mind to another - always as communicated across time and space through the manifestations of World Three.\n"}, {"score": 956.4932, "uuid": "4143a58c-b1ce-5322-94af-78f971640ddd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0106wb-02-22714", "target_hostname": "www.aseaofblue.com", "target_uri": "http://www.aseaofblue.com/2010/4/12/1417607/enes-kanter-is-not-better-than", "page_rank": 1.1767703e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Enes Kanter <em>is</em> Not <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> DeMarcus Cousins - A Sea Of Blue", "snippet": "<em>Do</em> <em>you</em> have any <em>knowledge</em> about said vote?

You wake up tomorrow morning with long hair growing all over your body. What would that do to your life?\u201d\nThe kids and I would play with the idea. Would the Fabulous Furry Freak join the circus, or buy a gross of scissors? Hide his condition, or flaunt it? Could he do without clothes for the rest of his life? Would he ever find a wife? Would his children be hairy or smooth?\nThat\u2019s how the imagination works, I\u2019d explain. The imagination says, \u201cWhat if \u2013 ?\u201d It takes real things, and combines them in new and surprising ways. That\u2019s how stories and paintings and songs begin. That\u2019s what a writer does.\nA writer thinks, What if there were a school for wizards? What would it be like to be a student there? What if the student had some ordinary name, like \u2013 let\u2019s see \u2013 maybe Harry Potter.\nOr maybe the writer thinks, what if a young man fell in love with the daughter of his father\u2019s worst enemy? That\u2019s the seed of Romeo and Juliet. Or, what if the gods told a man his destiny \u2013 and he tried to avoid it? That\u2019s the kernel of MacBeth and Oedipus Rex.\nBut it all starts with \u201cWhat if \u2013 ?\u201d\nOne time, a librarian who had watched me do this classroom routine said to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do that.\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d I said.\n\u201cThink about things that way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I found myself thinking about hair growing where it shouldn\u2019t, or something like that, I\u2019d get worried. I\u2019d think there was something wrong with me. I\u2019d make myself stop thinking about it.\u201d\nOf course you would, I told him. Research shows that well over 90% of pre-school children have vivid creative imaginations. With people of 30, the proportion is 2%. We all start with powerful imaginations \u2013 but they are squashed flat by education and convention. We develop a corps of internal thought police which banish irregular thoughts from our minds.\nWe learn to see \u201ccreative people\u201d like artists and inventors as remarkable. They have such brilliant imaginations. No: they have just have undamaged imaginations. But we did too, once, before the thought police took up their stations.\nThe thought police go off duty at night, however, and our submerged imaginations run rampant as we dream. In dreams we are wildly imaginative, improper, disrespectful of physical and other laws. Lurid images follow rollicking episodes, terrifying and bewildering. We boldly go where no mind has gone before.\nAnd then we wake up. The thought police come back on shift. We remember almost nothing of our adventures.\nNevertheless, our repressed imaginations serve us faithfully every day \u2013 and we rarely notice. \u201cAction begins with fantasy,\u201d wrote the libertarian educator John Holt. \u201cWe are very unlikely to do something new, difficult, and demanding until after we have spent some time imagining or dreaming ourselves doing it.\u201d\nWhat if I married that alluring person? What if I had an MBA? What if I found a better way to market lobsters, or software, or sewing machines? What if the things I dream about were real? Could they be real? Why not?\nThat\u2019s how books and films begin \u2013 but it\u2019s also how families and businesses and careers and gardens begin. What if? Why not?\nThe essential partner of imagination is courage. The unfettered imagination takes unpredictable directions, and it does not lie. It tells us what\u2019s going on in our deepest selves, down where desire and memory dance a hot tango with chemistry and instinct. We fear what it may reveal.\nMy librarian friend was afraid of his own thoughts. That\u2019s pathetic, but it\u2019s absolutely commonplace. We fear that the imagination will tell us things we really don\u2019t want to know about ourselves \u2013 which means that in our hearts, we don\u2019t know or accept ourselves.\nHow can we make the most of ourselves if we don\u2019t even know who we are?\nThe thought police stand guard against unruly flights of fancy. It takes courage to overrule them. But without the freedom to imagine, we can never discover great solutions, moral insights, profitable ideas, innovative strategies.\n\u201cImagination,\u201d said Albert Einstein, \u201cis more important than knowledge.\u201d Your own imagination won\u2019t turn you into Shakespeare or Einstein \u2013 but it can make you a more responsive spouse, a more creative parent, a more effective manager, a more valuable colleague.\nJust listen \u2014 bravely and honestly \u2014 to the impish voice within you.\n\u201cWhat if?\u201d it whispers. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n-30-\n"}], [{"score": 954.24756, "uuid": "dec5c852-c428-5abd-b708-73cb3c6bed18", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-69-24177", "target_hostname": "amberjewelry.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://amberjewelry.typepad.com/andziasamber/2005/12/top_ten_reasons.html?asset_id=6a00d83458202969e200d834c7d4fa69e2", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Better</em> <em>than</em>", "snippet": "-Holly Posted at 01:41 PM in The Jewelry Trade | Permalink Listed below are links to weblogs that reference Top 10 Reasons Amber Jewelry <em>is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> Diamond Jewelry: Top 10 Reasons Amber Jewelry <em>is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> Diamond Jewelry Okay.

I found myself thinking about this after the Powerhouse Museum \u2018s Seb Chan and Luke Dearnley presented on culture + heritage + digital at last week\u2019s Web Directions South conference.\nA few things from their preso have stuck with me, not least because they talked about some approaches to knowledge creation and dissemination that I think academics could put into practice more often. For example, over the past ten years museums have had to learn to give up some of their authority and control, or at least to understand authority and control a bit differently. Describing the current situation, they say:\n\u201cNow it is all about being a data provider, getting our knowledge and collections out into the community where they can be debated and gather feedback and attract interest. The social web and now the mobile web has made this possible at the kind of scale that wasn\u2019t possible in 2001. At the same [time] we now have \u2018contextual authority\u2019 rather than what we previously imagined was \u2018overall authority\u2019.\u201d\nAnd when discussing collections, they raise some interesting points about location and scale:\n\u201cThe other big change is that of scale. A collection like that of the Powerhouse used to feel \u2018large\u2019 but in actual fact it is tiny. Its value in the digital space now is no longer as an island but only in what it can contribute to national and international collections \u2013 a collection of collections. That\u2019s a tough challenge for a State-funded museum whose majority of \u2018visitors\u2019 walking in the door live in Sydney. But at scale new possibilities emerge.\nWhat this boils down to, at least in terms of traditional social and cultural research, is the necessity of being comfortable with the fact that we create only one of many types of knowledge, but also being comfortable with the fact that we already create the kind of contextual knowledge that can be used by others in ways we can only imagine. (I think that empirical researchers with a background in participant observation or action research are already well on board.)\nBut I\u2019m reminded that I never learned about Mass Observation in my anthropology classes and, in retrospect, I think it was because in an era of privileged anthropologists exclusively studying the exotic Other, MO sought to create \u201c an anthropology of ourselves \u201d by recording the everyday lives of ordinary British people. In other words, \u201ctheir\u201d knowledge (both subject and object) wasn\u2019t as good as \u201cour\u201d knowledge\u2013and it didn\u2019t belong in a formal education. But what if all ethnographic data were put together into a \u201ccollection of collections\u201d with which people could do all sorts of things? Yale University\u2019s Human Relations Area Files project has done a brilliant job of compiling a wide diversity of cultural materials, but when I used it to create the re/touch interaction design encyclopaedia , well, let\u2019s just say that its digital format did precious little to help me. My point here is that we also need to work with digital media folks more often.\nWhen I think of data visualisation and cultural heritage, I see extraordinary, but still largely untapped, potential\u2013especially in terms of working with qualitative data that do not easily lend themselves to snappy charts and infographics. Locative media have, I think, fared much better in being able to represent less clear-cut or ephemeral information distributed across space and time, allowing us to see over and under things with extraordinary detail. (As an aside, I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing the upcoming Convergence Special Issue on Locative Media .)\nBut I also remain convinced that data visualisation, either quantitative or qualitative, could be productively complemented by more critical explorations in data materialisation. I\u2019ve written before about how materialisation can be more affective than visualisation , and while Timo Arnall and BERG get a lot of much deserved attention for gorgeous wireless visualisations like Immaterials and Wireless World , my favourite video of theirs has always been Nearness :\n.\nThat single video did more to help me understand how RFID works than dozens of other papers and visualisations put together, and all because it didn\u2019t just make the invisible visible, it made it physical or materialised it. As Jack Schulze explained :\n\u201cRFID is a complex and fairly abstract technology to grasp. We have to be careful in how we communicate with it. There are many leaps of imagination and understanding required to grasp it and hold a useful model of how it works and what is happening, let alone see how it maps usefully and elegantly into the world around us. The familiarity of the chain reaction form, means the audience quickly grasps that the normal kinetic transfer of force in the sequence is replaced by invisible forces that work very closely together. Like invisible digital breaths between objects. Because the form was familiar, our hope was the concept of nearness without touching would be clearly understood.\u201d\nBut back to Seb and Luke\u2019s presentation. They showed a bunch of interesting work, and I was completely taken by the New York Public Library\u2019s historical menus project . Oh, how I wish that radishes would become popular again! But mostly I would love to see these data materialised as cookbooks and servingware.\nThe UK\u2019s National Maritime Museum and Citizen Science Alliance \u2018s Old Weather project is also pretty impressive. As Fiona Romeo and Lucinda Blaser explain:\n\u201cA programme of citizen science allows our museum to link cutting-edge science and issues with our historic purpose and subjects. The Old Weather project also delivers a reusable interface for the distributed transcription of archive materials \u2026 The logbooks, which date from 1914 to 1923, contain previously untapped information about the weather, ships\u2019 movements and daily events onboard. This data is not available anywhere else, and has the potential to advance scientific understanding of climate variability and change. By taking part in Old Weather, members participate in and gain an understanding of how climate science research is undertaken, data are processed and results used, allowing them to contribute towards important climate research activities.\u201d\nOf particular interest to me is how the project treats participants as collaborators in knowledge creation rather than as mere informants or labourers:\n\u201cThe Citizen Science Alliance is guided by a philosophy that all projects must answer a real scientific research question. The projects must never waste the \u2018clicks\u2019, or time, of volunteers, who should be respected as collaborators, including, where appropriate, recognition as co-authors of academic papers.\u201d\nThe transcription tool also allows for the recording of additional data that keeps volunteer participants interested and engaged:\n\u201cWhile there may be an initial pleasure in encountering the poetic language of the weather scale, there was a risk that the task of extracting observations would be considered \u2018dry\u2019 or repetitive after a short time. But our volunteers have been inspired by the real human stories that they discover in the logs and they capture weather data in order to follow the stories of vessels and people through to the end. In doing so, they gain an insight into life at sea during this time period. For example, they come to understand that enemy combat was not as common as they might have imagined, and there is much more in the logs to do with the practicalities of living life at sea.\u201d\nAgain, the richness of this information and the experience of working with it really makes me want to see people making some ship dioramas !\nBut the final lesson from their project, I think, is relevant to all public cultural heritage data visualisation and materialisation projects:\n1) Provide a platform for volunteers to share their data, findings and challenges;\n2) Ensure that professional researchers enter into discussion with the volunteers, both to set specific challenges and provide feedback, but also to respond to the questions and interests that emerge from the community itself;\n3) Release all of the analysed data back to the community, as soon as is practicable for the project.\nAnd now, writing all this down just makes me realise how much I want the Counting Sheep project to be a solid exploration of what socially and culturally focussed design research can contribute to the visualisation and materialisation of cultural heritage\u2026\n"}, {"score": 952.86786, "uuid": "dd220a4c-1046-5216-b557-372ba471cd7e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1106wb-48-09242", "target_hostname": "archive.pressthink.org", "target_uri": "http://archive.pressthink.org/2005/12/17/jb_ldfr.html", "page_rank": 1.8196485e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "PressThink: Two Washington Posts May Be <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> One", "snippet": "The real question <em>is</em>: what <em>do</em> journalists <em>do</em>, how <em>do</em> we know they <em>do</em> it <em>better</em> <em>than</em> non-journalists?

Over the newspaper and reporting beats Len Downie is king. Over the website Jim Brady is sovereign. Over the user\u0092s experience no one has total control. There's tension because there's supposed to be tension.\"\nNew post alert: Froomkin writes in. See Dan Froomkin on Attitude in White House Briefing (Dec. 19).\nFor me the most interesting moment in the Dan Froomkin dust up came during an exchange between bosses in Editor and Publisher. Leonard Downie, big boss at the Washington Post, stated his concerns about Froomkin\u2019s White House Briefing, a Web column. \u201cWe want to make sure people in the Administration know that our news coverage by White House reporters is separate from what appears in Froomkin\u0092s column because it contains opinion,\u0094 Downie told E&P. \u0093And that readers of the Web site understand that, too.\u0094 A change in title would help, he believed.\nNow you would think that if Len Downie wanted it done, people would do it. He is the executive editor of the Washington Post. Except there\u2019s another executive editor: Jim Brady, who oversees washingtonpost.com, a separate but related domain. This situation gave rise to the ombudsman column that started the whole Froomkin tussle this week. Deborah Howell\u2019s original was called The Two Washington Posts . As she explained: \u201cThe Post Web site is owned by the Washington Post Co., but it is not run by the newspaper. It is a separate company called Washington Post-Newsweek Interactive, or WPNI, with offices in Arlington.\u201d\nBrady Says No\nAcross the Potomac, the other boss, Jim Brady, said he had no plans to change the name of Froomkin\u2019s column. He didn\u2019t buy the charge that confused readers thought Froomkin was a White House beat reporter. \u201cThe column has been on the site for two years and that is not something we have heard,\u201d Brady told E & P. White House Briefing is extremely popular with users, he said, \u201cand it is not going anywhere.\u201d\nLen Downie understood. \u201cThey decide what the column ought to be called,\u201d he said. (They being Brady\u2019s crew.) \u201cWe have discussed it and they will decide what to do.\u201d Or as Editor and Publisher put it: \u201c\u2018Wash Post\u2019 Editor and Others Want Froomkin Column Renamed \u2014 But Online Chief Says No.\u201d Political editor John Harris agreed that changing the name is Brady\u2019s call, but: \u201cI think it would be an error not to.\u201d (See my last post , where I interviewed Brady and Harris and tracked the discussion of the episode. Also see Brad DeLong\u2019s follow-up phone call with Harris.)\nBrady told me that he would continue to talk to the Post newsroom about it. But with Dan Froomkin, Columnist, at the top of the page next to his picture, and \u201cSpecial to washingtonost.com\u201d under his name (instead of \u201cWashington Post Staff Writer,\u201d which is what it says for reporters) plus a subdomain called washingtonpost.com> Columns it\u2019s pretty clear that he\u2019s a columnist.\nThe problem comes\u2014if there is any problem\u2014from the words White House and \u201cbriefing.\u201d Do they mislead us by suggesting that Froomkin is actually stationed at the White House? Post White House reporter Peter Baker says so: \u201cI have heard concerns that people might think he is a reporter in the White House briefing room.\u201d\nLeading with the chin\nYeah, but what people? In the E & P article, Downie seemed most worried about Bush supporters and their perceptions of the Post. Listen again: \u201cWe want to make sure people in the Administration know that our news coverage by White House reporters is separate from what appears in Froomkin\u0092s column because it contains opinion.\u201d John Harris told me: \u201cI have heard from Republicans in informal ways making clear they think his work is tendentious and unfair.\u201d Also: \u201cTo the extent that some people believe Dan represents the voice and values of the Washington Post newsroom, that seems to me to be leading with our chin.\u201d\nFrom reading Froomkin\u2019s column \u201cpeople\u201d might get the impression that the Washington Post newsroom is biased against Bush. That is what Harris and company are saying. They want to put as much distance as possible between the Post\u2019s White House reporting, and Froomkin\u2019s White House Briefing. A title change (recommended also by the ombudsman) is supposed to accomplish that.\nBut\u2026 \u201cOnline Chief Says No.\u201d Under the surface this was the Web side of the Post saying \u201cNO\u201d to political pressure from the Republicans, which took the form of griping about an effective Bush critic, Dan Froomkin\u2014\u201chis work is tendentious and unfair\u201d\u2014by sources in, and friends of, the White House. The beat reporters felt they couldn\u2019t ignore it. Brady, I believe, felt they should ignore it. (Though he didn\u2019t say that directly.) And if they wouldn\u2019t, he would.\nDual centers of power\nSome sharp words were exchanged this week, but there\u2019s no sign of any big or chronic conflicts between the two Posts; and that is ultimately the more telling thing. Washingtonpost.com is succeeding journalistically, and the Post newsroom is succeeding on the Web. And responsible for this success are two different centers of power.\nThey\u2019re not equals (780 in one newsroom vs. 65 in the other; fewer than one million subscribers vs. eight million users), but Washington and Arlington have their own spheres. Over the newspaper and reporting beats Len Downie is king. Over the website Jim Brady is sovereign. Over the user\u0092s experience no one has total control. There\u2019s tension because there\u2019s supposed to be tension. It makes for a more dynamic site.\nWhat the brief struggle over White House Briefing showed me is the hidden advantages of a divided house. For if you have two newsrooms, with two bosses, and two staffs, then you can double your pressthink, and expand signficantly the range of ideas considered acceptable at the Washington Post. This is exactly what newspaper journalism needs in the age of the Web. More range. More than one ruling doctine in charge. More than one sensibility in place.\nFor example, among John Harris, Peter Baker, Len Downie and others who think as they do, the strict separation between \u201cnews\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d is clear, compelling, necessary, and wise. Only good can flow from it. Credibility itself rides on it. Common sense coheres in it. There is validity to their system, and over the long run it has served the newspaper well, but it is not universally valid. Nor does it have an answer for everything\u2014 especially in times of platform change and politicized attacks on the press.\nThe big tent\nWhy do people become loyal readers of Dan Froomkin\u2019s White House Briefing? Is it for the news they find in it, or the opinion? After reading the column three of four times you learn it\u2019s both, plus Froomkin\u2019s voice and passion, his facts, his best-of links, his criticism of the White House press. As Jeff Jarvis says : \u201cit all fits in the big tent of journalism, if those who think they own that tent will allow it.\u201d\nA lot of times they won\u2019t allow it. This was one. They tried to put their foot down, but to do that they had to make arguments and engage the ideas of others online. The newspaper\u2019s mental sectioning (news vs. opinion) might help the beat reporters explain to Republican sources that \u201cHey, Froomkin isn\u2019t us,\u201d but it\u2019s not helpful for understanding how his column works (pattern recognition), what it\u2019s really about (matching words to deeds), and why even the suggestion of clipping his wings brought out such passions in users. (Witness 900+ comments at this post.)\nObserve: During the Froomkin flap this week USA Today announced that it would go the opposite route and merge its two newsrooms\u2014newspaper and Web\u2014into one.\nThe New York Times did the same thing earlier this year. The Times said that in the years ahead it would have to \u201cinvent a digital journalism\u201d and devise new services for readers that can earn revenues. \u201cWe have concluded that our best chance of meeting that challenge is to integrate the two newsrooms into one,\u201d wrote Bill Keller, executive editor of the Times, in August.\nDifferent puzzles to solve\nIt is clear that Donald Graham, CEO of the Washington Post Company, has a different idea. And so this is another case\u2014the most famous is Times Select \u2014where the New York Times and Washington Post are choosing different routes as they try to make it across the digital divide. In Graham\u2019s view, Arlington and Washington have different puzzles to solve. \u201cPutting out the newspaper is a demanding, more-than-full-time job,\u201d he told Howell. \u201cThe Web site has an equally demanding challenge, having to make its way against brilliant competitors who are constantly unrolling new products. The Post and WPNI must cooperate but must also find a way to do quite different jobs.\u201d\nOne of Brad DeLong\u2019s readers, Robert Waldman , made a shrewd observation:\nThe problem here which created the need for a public confrontation is that Downie can not rename a column in www.washingtonpost.com. He needs to publicly argue with Brady\u2026\nWhich is true. Another reader said :\nI think Waldmann\u0092s theory is correct. It is the separation of editorial power between the print section of WaPo and the on-line section that made the problem of remaining in the good graces of the WH propaganda machine difficult to manage.\nA shorter to way to say it: Bill Keller could have simply ordered the name change, and White House reporters at the New York Times would not have had to engage in any public wrangling about it (or explain their thinking.) The separation of powers allows Graham\u2019s company to develop a pluralism in its own pressthink and political sense-making. This is way easier than making Webbies of newsroom curmudgeons. There can be a looser and more open environment, and a more traditional \u201cstrict separations\u201d newsroom; talented people will vote with their feet.\nDonald Graham does not have to decide whose ideas shall be the ruling wisdom in the news and commentary world to come. This is good because no one\u2019s that smart. I think John Harris learned as much this week. My advice: Keep the separation of powers, Washington Post. It\u2019s helping you get your act together.\nAfter Matter: Notes, reactions & links.\nNew PressThink, Dec. 19: Dan Froomkin on Attitude in White House Briefing: \u201cThere\u0092s been much speculation over whether my column would take the same approach with a Democrat\u2026\u201d\nAll the details, background and reactions you could want are at my first post, John Harris and Jim Brady Get Into It About \u201cWhite House Briefing.\u201d Dan Froomkin Replies .\nAnecdote about innovation at WPNI: I participated in the comment threads at Joel Achenbach\u2019s blog on the Post site because he wrote about Froomkin ( here and here .) I suggested in a \u201cheads up\u201d way to Brady, Achenbach and WPNI\u2019s Hal Straus that the Froomkin squall showed how vital it was to have permalinks to each comment at Post blogs. (Like this post.) I would have linked to some of the things readers said, and added value to the Post\u2019s site, said I. But I couldn\u2019t because the Post doesn\u2019t have that feature turned on. This was in an e-mail Dec. 14. The next day they added permalinks to comments in Post blogs.\nFor those less Webbie, \u201cadd permalinks\u201d means each comment gets its own address (url) and thus becomes a page on the WWW. Matters because a blogger can now send you to that comment with a link\u2014 like this .\nGreensboro\u2019s John Robinson\u2014what Newspaper Editor 2.0 might be like\u2014reports (at his blog) on a year of tentative progress at the News-Record in crossing the digital divide . \u201cSo we blogged. We solicited citizen journalism. We started podcasts. We added audio. We dipped a toe in video. We did slide shows and multi-media.\u201d The surprise?\nUnlike the presumption that ink-stained wretches rebel at the idea that they \u201chave\u201d to do anything other than write for the print publication, most of our staff understands where the business is headed, and they want to play. During a staff meeting last week, reporters asked for more training with online tools and equipment. We have a waiting list for those who want to blog.\nA waiting list: exactly. Robinson says they\u2019re not stopping. One year ago at PressThink: Action in Greensboro on Open Source Journalism. (Dec. 18, 2004)\nNew at Buzzmachine (Dec. 19). Jeff Jarvis begins a series of \u201chow-to\u201d posts on ways to re-make the newsroom for the Web era. This one argues: \u201cThe first job is to instill fear in the newsroom.\u201d\nThe endlessly provocative Brad DeLong asks: Is the Washington Post Newsroom Insane?\nTim Schmoyer at Sisyphean Musings is curious about what Froomkin means by \u201caccountability journalism\u201d and how it differs from the \u201cwatchdog\u201d variety. He also fact-checks some White House Briefing columns.\nDC Media Girl : \u201cEditors and reporters at the paper have always had a sniffy, \u2018not in our class, dear\u2019 attitude towards their Web counterparts, whom they see as a bunch of ruffians.\u201d\nJeff Jarvis replies to this post and says he disagrees about the divided house: One newsrooms, two newsrooms, or none?\nIf newspapers themselves do not change radically to embrace the future, they will become things of the past. So I have argued that newspapers have a choice: Either totally upend newsroom culture and get people to face the strategic imperative of gathering and sharing news in new ways across all platforms \u0085 or move most of the staff to online \u0097 where the audience is now and revenue growth, if not equivalent revenue, will be \u0097 and leave the dinosaurs behind.\nKeeping the Post separate from the online operation allows the \u201cnewsroom princes\u201d to remain blind, says Jeff.\nThat is why Post political editor John Harris thought he could be so haughty as to publicly scold his online colleagues for not following his rules and for embarrassing him with his White House, even snaring the \u0097 what shall I say, unsuspecting? \u0097 ombudsman in his crusade.\nNo, Harris and company do not need to confront the online people. They need to confront the future. They need to confront the fact that more readers read the online product. They need to confront the fact that the economics of news are changing, whether they approve or not.\nI say the Post is making more progress this way. I also believe that talented young people with Net sensibilities and contributions to make to journalism\u2019s future won\u2019t join the old newsrooms, and they won\u2019t floursh in the \u201cmerged\u201d environments, either. But they might be drawn to an outfit like WPNI. The six-column kings and deadline princes Jeff refers to cannot be forced to learn. No one can drag them into the future\u2014 or even make them dwell in the present. Curmudgeons are proud of their ignorance, and they will retire that way.\nJarvis replies in the comments and I answer him back.

His sketch this week outlines why we should care about improv and fostering those bursts of imagination.\nPost 2: Demand Imagination\nPosted By: Pj Jacokes Posted: 1/29/2010\nI believe that there is a war against imagination.\nBut it wasn't always like that. As a child, imagination is encouraged. It's on the checklists that my son's teachers go over every semester. Imagination is at its strongest when we're children. It's used when there are bad guys at the bottom of the stairs or you have one last chance to win the Super Bowl or when a broom is a guitar or a banana is a gun. But as a child, imagining is as natural as breathing. It's vibrant and unapologetic and weird. Not too long ago during bath time, my 4-year old, Dax, created a musical based on his bath toys \u0096 Basketballs vs. Monsters.\nBut there is a point where some kids are labeled with having \"an overactive imagination\" \u0096 and, somehow, that's a negative thing. Creativity is something to be feared. Then in high school, it's not cool to have an imagination. In college, there's no time for it and in the corporate world there seems to be little patience for it. Or when it is used, it's under the moniker \"ideating\" which is as far from the idea of imagination as you can get.\nAs a result, a lot of folks who come to our improv shows will say, \"Oh, I could never do that.\" Well, the truth is, it's something everyone used to be able to do. In fact, I'd say it's something everyone still does. It may not be as bold, but improv is something we all do. Every one of us. I do it on a stage with the hopes of making an audience laugh. You might do it at work, explaining why you were late or at home, explaining to a child what thunder is, or at a bar, when you get caught looking at another girl. We may not call that using our imaginations (some might call it lying, which in some cases is accurate, but irrelevant in this argument), but it is.\nOn Conan O'Brien's last show, he offered this, \"All I ask of you, especially young people...is one thing. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism -- it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\"\nCynicism isn't hard to come by. It's easy. Any idiot can complain.

This is not the time for negativity.\nI believe Detroit needs overactive imaginations right now.

Admiration. Amazement. Marvel. Delight. The Psalmist, Wordsworth, the child who looks up at the night sky and lisps the nursery rhyme, all speak of that passion of wonder which Aristotle taught is the beginning of philosophy.\nThe immediate, direct apprehension of reality that inspires wonder and awe is called by St. Thomas Aquinas poetica scientia, \u201cpoetic knowledge.\u201d It is the first of the four kinds of knowledge that St. Thomas distinguishes. It is this neglected, even distrusted way of knowing that is the subject of an important book recently published by the State University of New York Press.\nThe author, Dr. James Taylor, explains that poetic knowledge is not merely a knowledge of poetry, \u201cbut rather a poetic experience of reality.\u201d\nPoetic experience indicates an encounter with reality that is nonanalytical, something that is perceived as beautiful, awful (awe-full), spontaneous, mysterious\u2026 Poetic knowledge is a spontaneous act of the external and internal senses with the intellect, integrated and whole, rather than an act associated with the powers of analytic reasoning\u2026 It is, we might say, knowledge from the inside out, radically different from a knowledge about things. In other words, it is the opposite of scientific knowledge.\nPoetic knowledge\nIf this passage seems like heavy going, it must be said straight away that it is. This book is a work of philosophy worthy of a Gilson or a Maritain or a Francis Kovach or one of the other great thinkers of the scholastic revival. The author\u2019s elucidation of the distinction between subjectivism and subjectivity is brilliant (and incidentally of great value, at least to this reviewer, for understanding the philosophical personalism of Pope John Paul). Dr. Taylor has made an exhaustive study both of what poetic knowledge is, using the methods and vocabulary of scholastic philosophy, and of its history from ancient Greece, through the Middle Ages, down to its deformation since the time of Descartes in the seventeenth century.\nAs Dr. Taylor says in defining poetic knowledge, \u201cit is the opposite of scientific knowledge.\u201d The scientific knowledge he speaks of is not science in the ancient and Thomistic sense of metaphysics, but knowledge which is empirical, quantifiable, and dialectical. It is the kind of knowledge demanded by Thomas Gradgrind in Dickens\u2019 Hard Times:\nNow what I want is Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.\nThe technocratic leaders of the modern West (perhaps more than the East), and those \u201cleaders\u201d in modern education especially, are faithful disciples of Gradgrind in believing that \u201cFacts\u201d are the only thing of any importance.\nPoetry and experience\nA chief interest of this book lies in its discussion of the role of poetic knowledge and experience in education. Having laid the philosophical and historical groundwork, the final chapters discuss concrete, practical ways in which a school inspired by the poetic mode of learning will teach and function. They also relate the story of two attempts in the twentieth century to take seriously Aristotle\u2019s dictum that philosophy begins in wonder, and that unless a man\u2019s education awakens his heart to this disposition of wonder, he can never fruitfully study anything.\nOne of these was a boarding school for boys at a village in France called Maslacq, which closed in 1950. Dom Gerard Calvet, Abbot of the French Benedictine monastery of Le Barroux, was a student at Maslacq.\nNearly twenty years later, in the midst of the student unrest of the late 1960s, the second was established at the University of Kansas. It was called Pearson College, or the Integrated Humanities Program (IHP).\nDr Taylor writes:\nThe professors of the IHP clearly recognized the steady falling off of students\u2019 abilities to read, speak, and write on a general level taken for granted only a generation ago. But the goal was never to improve test scores. They would say that the tests themselves and the entire system built up around such Cartesian measurement instruments were an indication of the problem in modern education.\nHearts Full of Wonder\nThe professors in the IHP did more, however, than bemoan the problem. They set out to solve it by stirring up wonder in the hearts of their students.\nHow?\nThe core of the IHP was a four-semester sequence of humanities courses in which the students read and considered the great books of Western civilization: in the first semester, Homer and other Greek writers, in the second, Virgil and the Romans, in the third, the Bible and St. Augustine and other writers of the Middle Ages, and finally Shakespeare and other modern writers. So far the curriculum appears identical to Great Books programs at a score of other colleges. But there the similarity ends.\nThe three professors of the IHP spent classes conversing together about the assigned books. The students were not allowed to take notes, but rather were asked to listen. The aim of these conversations was not to use the books to impart moral instruction, much less to pile up facts about them and their authors and their historical setting. Rather the professors sought to help the students to experience the purpose of all stories and songs and poems: delight.\nIn place of Cliffs Notes and all the suffocating apparatus of modern critical scholarship, the conversations of the professors revealed the beauty of these books and made the hearts of their students leap up in delight. Outside of this core class, the students met in smaller groups to memorize poetry, not by reading it from a book, but by hearing it recited by upperclassmen and then repeating it. The students also learned calligraphy, the art of beautiful writing. An attempt was made early in the program to teach horseback riding, a poetic way of teaching young men chivalry (a word which means a man upon a horse) far more effective than mere didactic instruction.\nIn Dr Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cNight-time outings were organized for star-gazing with the unaided eye where students learned to recognize the constellations and their main stars and the Greek stories that accompanied them.\u201d (How important for wonder is that verb to gaze!) \u201cIn addition to the weekly lectures, the IHP also offered Latin, taught in the beginning entirely by the oral method, that is, without the use of a textbook or formal grammar.\u201d Each semester the students learned several traditional songs, and often the class would begin with the students singing a favorite by Stephen Foster. Each winter the older students in the IHP began teaching the younger ones to waltz, and together they hired an orchestra and organized a formal spring waltz\u2014poetry incarnate.\nThe last chapter of the book, \u201cThe Future of the Poetic Mode of Knowledge in Education,\u201d begins with some other lines from Wordsworth:\nI listened, motionless and still;\nAnd, as I mounted up the hill\nThe music in my heart I bore,\nLong after it was heard no more.\nDr Taylor, both as a student and as a teacher, has harkened to the music and the Muse\u00a0of poetic knowledge. In the final chapter, he makes a passionate call for the restoration of the poetic mode to education. Or if that is too much to ask, then the establishment of at least one school grounded in this way of knowing and the tradition that grew out of it in pagan antiquity and the Christian West. Let his eloquence have the last word:\nTo found a school (of this kind) requires only the listening heart of perhaps just one courageous, poetic soul who has come to see\u2014intuitively and positively in an awful delight of wonder, as well as from the heights of reason and deliberate serious thought \u2014 that our land, our homes, the heavens and the earth, and those dear and those distant from us are important not only in their nature, but have meaning and purpose far beyond the reach of the current means of analysis and measurement\u2026 Science sees knowledge as power; poetic knowledge is admiration\u2014love.\nA version of this review was first published in Oriens: The Journal of the Ecclesia Dei Society of Australia, under the title \u201cPoetry on the range\u201d in the Winter of 1999.\nThe views expressed by the authors and editorial staff are not necessarily the views of\nSophia Institute, Holy Spirit College, or the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts.\nBy Kirk Kramer\nKirk Kramer, a sometime gandy dancer for the Frisco Railroad, writes from Cottage City, Maryland.\nCrisis Magazine relies on the generosity of our donors to keep our apostolate going. Please support our work today!\nMore from Crisis\nKnowledge Is Power\nKirk Kramer\nThose whoe are interested in the subject of this review will want to read these lines\u00a0drawn from the introduction to a 1953 anthology\u00a0of poetry,\u00a0\u201dThe Faber Book of Children\u2019s Verse\u2019 edited by someone called Janet Adam Smith.\u00a0 Goodness what sense she talks about poetry.\nI am assured that nobody objects to being called a child up to the\nage of fourteen: and I have compiled this book with the ages eight\nto fourteen mainly in mind. . . .\nOne reason for having the ages of eight to fourteen in mind is that\nI, and many others, have found that the poetry we most enjoyed\nreading in those years has stuck in our minds, without any\ndeliberate learning, in a way that poetry learnt more recently has\nnot. So it seems reasonable to give children poems to read at this\nage that they will like to find in their heads twenty or thiry years\nlater. When I try unsuccessfully to remember a good poem that I\ncommitted to memory five years ago, I find it intensely irritating\nto remember instead a bad poem that I learnt 35 years ago. It is\nlike going to the attic to look for the comfortable sofa you stored\nthere not so long ago; not only has it vanished, but in the place\nwhere it ought to be are a couple of broken-down cane chairs with\nholes in their seats. So, to the main purpose of this collection,\nwhich is to give you pleasure now, I would add a secondary one: to\nstock up the attics of your mind with enjoyment for the future.\nOne of the greatest pleasures of poetry is the discovery that a poem\nwhich you have always known means far more than you could realise\nwhen you first met it and liked it. This is a process that goes on\nas long as we read poetry at all: nobody can ever re-read The\nAncient Mariner, or see a Shakespeare play again, without finding\nthat his experience has now led him to find new meanings in the\nfamiliar words. So I have inclined towards poems which, though\nthere is some strong reason why children like them now, have these\nreserves of meaning. I shall not be worried if anybody criticises\nme for including poems which children cannot \u2018understand\u2019. The\npoems are here for pleasure: the understanding will grow with the\nreader. \u2018That which can be made Explicit to the Idiot\u2019, said\nWilliam Blake\u2019, \u2018is not written with any care. The wisest of the\nAncients consider\u2019d what is not too Explicit as the fittest for\nInstruction, because it rouses the faculties to act.\u2019 There is,\ntoo, active pleasure in the unknown or half-known, whether it is a\nword or a feeling: in, as Andrew Lang put it, \u2018the sense of a\nmargin beyond, as in a wood full of unknown glades, and birds, and\nflowers unfamiliar.\u2019 . . .\nI have no patience with those who say that love and death are not\nproper subjects for children. Children can often respond to these\nlarge subjects with minds less coarsened and imaginations less\ninfected than their print-sodden elders. It is largely in\nchildhood, and largely through books, that we learn of attitudes to\nadmire, which we can then try out in real life \u2013 the heroic, the\nquixotic, the stoical, the impossibly magnanimous. It is not that\nwe necessarily identify ourselves with every person in the poems or\nstories we read: but that we learn from them a language of feeling\nand enlarge our own vocabularies. And the attitudes which we\nfinally choose will, whether consciously or not, affect our\nbehaviour all our lives. Poems can help us in this choice by\nshowing us something of the variety of possible attitudes and\nmoods. A child who has learnt that death can be looked at in more\nways than one is better able to cope with a loss of his own than one\nwho has only learnt the stereotyped responses of the newspaper or\ncinema. Stereotyped emotion \u2013 which approximates all battles to\nHeroism, all love to Romance, all death to Tragedy, which cannot\nrespond to irony or wit at all \u2013 is always something coarser than\nany individual is capable of feeling.\nFeelings have to be trained: you can learn to feel and to\ndiscriminate between feelings, as you can learn to swim or ride a\nbicycle or play the flute. And if you do not learn what your powers\nof feelings are, and how to live with your feelings and not be\noverwhelmed by them, then you will be easy game for those who wish\nto impose emotions on you for commercial or political ends. We\nshould never despise an emotion just because we share it with a\ngreat number of other people \u2013 at, say, a party, a Coronation, a\nTest Match, a performance of King Lear. But we should be chary if\nsomeone is bullying or cajoling us to feel an emotion for some\npurpose of his own. This training of the feelings is part of what\nBlake called \u2018Instruction\u2019 in the words I quoted earlier:\nthe \u2018rousing of the faculties to act\u2019. And in the same letter of\nBlake\u2019s I find the best words to introduce a book of verse for\nchildren.\n\u2018Neither Youth nor Childhood is Folly or Incapacity. Some Children\nare Fools and so are some Old Men. But there is a vast Majority on\nthe side of Imagination or Spiritual Sensation.\u2019\nKirk Kramer\nJames Taylor\u2019s book is still available in paperback from the SUNY Press.\u00a0 Ordering information can be found here: http://www.sunypress.edu/p-2667-poetic-knowledge.aspx\nJames\nMy grateful thanks to Kirk Kramer and\u00a0 the folks at Crisis for reprinting Kirk\u2019s kind review of my book.\u00a0 My plan is to write a follow up book based on the idea of poetic knowledge but, where only hinted at in the previous book, I will show how poetry and the poetic experience of things is consistent and close to essential to embracing the \u201cpoetry\u201d of Christianity.\u00a0 The mystical theological and spiritual traditions of the Early Fathers and Eastern Christianity will be featured as the eternal, living metaphor of Glory.\nJohn Burger\nDear Docta T,\nYou best be writin that book soon, or I\u2019m gonna find you and pull some Annie Wilkes on your a$$. . .

I wish I could give him badges for all of these things!\nWhat are badges? Think back to when you were a Girl Scout or a Boy Scout. You can get merit badges in just about anything from citizenship to graphic arts to scuba diving. There are a lot of them and they are cute, too. And they all have certain structural features in common.\nFirst, a badge is a recognized visual (physical or virtual) device or ornament or piece of jewelry that typically designates in its design the symbol, insignia, colors or name of the organization conferring it. That's important. That is the very design of the badge acknowledges the issuing body or community that has collectively agreed upon what counts as the minimum requirement for the badge.\nSecond, there is some symbolic representation of the knowledge, skill, goal or feat for which the badge denotes mastery, accomplishment, service or authority (such as when taking an oath to become a firefighter).\nThird, the badge has to be accepted by a larger community as a way to legitimize that which it represents. It stands in as the result of a longer, hidden institutional process.\nFourth, the badge has to not just credential or certify learning, but should also motivate it.\nBy organizing a set of skills and interests into an actual, definable, measurable skill capable of assessment and judgment, badges inspire students to greater mastery. A hobby becomes definable as an intellectual, creative asset, something to be tended, improved, honed, perfected, advanced and innovated. As with a game challenge, attainment becomes the floor, not the end point; it becomes a step on a way towards even greater mastery. The badge inspires a certain form of learning by naming it and honoring it.\nNow let's go back to Tim. If I had established a badge system in \"This Is Your Brain on the Internet,\" I might well have had the class help me design the badge and then might have also worked with them to develop community standards or even a community certification group for deciding who had achieved badges in what area.\nTim might have left the class with a grade for the class; a visual badge on his website that someone could click on and then find out all the various things Tim did to earn that badge in my class; and several lines on his resume.\nBadges are useful for certifying complex processes or skills that are not comprehended in our traditional grading systems.\nThink about what those are: According to most employers, the skills we do not grade are often the ones most important to future success in the work place.\nWhat we do not grade -- interpersonal skills, collaborative skills, imagination, innovative, initiative, independence -- are most of the things employers most want in future employees. At present, education, including higher education, doesn't have a system for measuring or counting those things. That's why a number of us have begun to investigate badging and why the Mozilla Foundation is pioneering an Open Badge Project (http://bit.ly/h3rZJc).\nWhy do badges work better than grades? Obviously they don't in all situations.\nFor over 100 years grades have represented or summarized a teacher at a given institution's estimation of the worth of a student as quantified by a series of tests, often of the item-response variety (invented in 1914). Badges are simply another way, a more flexible way, of certifying a range of skills that our machine-age multiple choice mode of testing doesn't fully comprehend but that are crucial to the ways we live, work and learn.\nDuke University professor Cathy Davidson is a co-founder of HASTAC and the author of \"Now You See It.\" This column originally appeared on her blog .\n"}, {"score": 949.7387, "uuid": "29517c48-7700-58ef-9ce5-b76cf2f5419d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0816wb-60-21539", "target_hostname": "altongansky.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://altongansky.typepad.com/imaginationwork/2007/02/index.html?no_prefetch=1", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Imagination</em>@Work:", "snippet": "I <em>think</em> <em>you</em> have a good start here and that someday, <em>you</em> will make a great speechwriter. <em>You</em> just need to pay attention to the details.

I\u2019ve been fortunate to have great editors over the years and I appreciate their skill and dedication. They\u2019ve also saved me from some serious embarrassment. (\u201cNamui sat on the hot, dusty earth eating rice from a rough wooden bowel.\u201d Shudder.) Editing is an art and requires a certain mindset that is different from creative writing. Creativity wants to bend the rules. In fact, it often denies rules altogether (Ask e.e. cummings who didn\u2019t much care for capital letters.)\nStyles and grammar change. I\u2019m reading a book by sci-fi writer Ben Bova. Bova is a pillar in the science fiction world. In this book, he breaks every rule I\u2019ve been taught and every rule I teach. If I took red pen to his pages the book would look like the floor of a meat rendering plant. So, does that make him a bad writer? No. It means he learned the craft from different teachers. I plan to finish the book and enjoy his style in the process.\nThat being said, I wondered what might happen if a fictional editor took a swipe at Abe Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg address. Those who have studied public speaking know these few words (one of the shortest speeches ever) might comprise the best bit of oratory in history. Still, a strict editor might say something like this:\nFour score and seven years ago (archaic, change to contemporary usages) our fathers (offensive to women; too gender specific) brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, (why are you capitalizing \u201cLiberty\u201d? Consult with style guide.) and dedicated to the proposition that all men (again with the male superiority, Abe) are created (Abe, this spiritual talk will offend the atheist) equal.\n[Editor\u2019s recommendation for opening line: Eighty-seven years ago our grandparents started a new nation with liberty as its goal. They also felt that every person born equal.]\nNow we are engaged in a great (great implies good and war isn\u2019t so good\u2014choose better term) civil (how can a war be civil) war, testing whether that (unclear; which nation?) nation, or any nation so conceived (sexual overtones; could be offensive to some) and so dedicated, can long endure (awkward).\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: This ongoing war between the states is a test of our commitment to the liberty\u2014if we survive.]\nWe are met on a great (again with the \u201cgreat.\u201d You might consider a broadening your vocabulary) battle-field of that war (Redundant. There\u2019s no such thing as a battlefield of peace). We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. (Unnecessary inclusion. Of course, it\u2019s fitting. The reader doesn\u2019t need to be told this.)\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: We are here on this battle field to dedicate it to those who died. It\u2019s the least we can do.]\nBut, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. (Tortured sentence. Get to the point. Used \u201ccannot\u201d three times.) The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: In point of fact, the soldiers who died here have already consecrated this ground. All we can do is recognize that truth.]\nThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here (\u201chere\u201d is unnecessary and used twice in this sentence. Strike it.), but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced (Awkward, stilted\u2014revise).\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: What we do today may soon be forgotten, but what the soldiers did on this battlefield will be remembered forever.]\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God (watch the God-talk, Abe), shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. (Awkward and cumbersome paragraph. Remember, less is more.)\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: What remains for us is to continue working for liberty and freedom.

Early last year, I wrote a book for my primary nonfiction publisher B&H Publishing Group (formally Broadman Holman). The release was delayed for awhile, but now the work has been released to the masses.\n40 DAYS is a labor of love and deals with a area of biblical revelation seldom examined. While countless books have been written about the fact of Christ's resurrection, very little has been written about the resurrection appearances themselves. In 40 DAYS, I try to shed some light on those amazing events. There are twelve recorded appearances of Jesus. Each has a message all its own. In some cases, we have long accounts; in others just a passing references. Jesus' appearances did more than prove He rose from the dead, they also, like living parables, taught life changing truth.\nThe release of this nonfiction work on the heels of my latest novel, CRIME SCENE JERUSALEM, turns out to be an unexpected blessing. In CSJ, I try to show the death and resurrection of Christ through the eyes of a modern criminologist; in 40 DAYS, my goal was to point out details of how and why Jesus appeared the way He did, details we often over look.\nI think you'll find 40 DAYS a fascinating read.\nHere\u2019s the back cover copy:\nWhile many have written about the Resurrection itself, few have delved deeply into the forty days Jesus spent on the Earth after his death-defying exit from the grave. The incomparable magnitude of that miracle tends to overshadow the great days that followed. But, ho, how fascinating are the lessons to be learned beyond that stone!\nWith a passionate believer\u2019s heart and an investigator\u2019s flair for finding rich truths in the often-overlooked details, noted author Alton Gansky examines here every recorded event that happened from the moment Christ left the tomb until his glorious ascension to heaven.\nWhat the reader gains is a fresh excitement for the Resurrection story, a greater knowledge and contextual grasp of Scripture, and, best of all, a closer personal relationship with Jesus.\nTo hear the first chapter, click here: Download 40_days_chapter_1.1 web.wav .\nTo purchase online through Lifeway Christian Stores click here .\nTo purchase through Amazon.com click here .\nChapter Titles:\nPart 1: From the Cross to the Tomb\n1.

I\u2019ve been fortunate to have great editors over the years and I appreciate their skill and dedication. They\u2019ve also saved me from some serious embarrassment. (\u201cNamui sat on the hot, dusty earth eating rice from a rough wooden bowel.\u201d Shudder.) Editing is an art and requires a certain mindset that is different from creative writing. Creativity wants to bend the rules. In fact, it often denies rules altogether (Ask e.e. cummings who didn\u2019t much care for capital letters.)\nStyles and grammar change. I\u2019m reading a book by sci-fi writer Ben Bova. Bova is a pillar in the science fiction world. In this book, he breaks every rule I\u2019ve been taught and every rule I teach. If I took red pen to his pages the book would look like the floor of a meat rendering plant. So, does that make him a bad writer? No. It means he learned the craft from different teachers. I plan to finish the book and enjoy his style in the process.\nThat being said, I wondered what might happen if a fictional editor took a swipe at Abe Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg address. Those who have studied public speaking know these few words (one of the shortest speeches ever) might comprise the best bit of oratory in history. Still, a strict editor might say something like this:\nFour score and seven years ago (archaic, change to contemporary usages) our fathers (offensive to women; too gender specific) brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, (why are you capitalizing \u201cLiberty\u201d? Consult with style guide.) and dedicated to the proposition that all men (again with the male superiority, Abe) are created (Abe, this spiritual talk will offend the atheist) equal.\n[Editor\u2019s recommendation for opening line: Eighty-seven years ago our grandparents started a new nation with liberty as its goal. They also felt that every person born equal.]\nNow we are engaged in a great (great implies good and war isn\u2019t so good\u2014choose better term) civil (how can a war be civil) war, testing whether that (unclear; which nation?) nation, or any nation so conceived (sexual overtones; could be offensive to some) and so dedicated, can long endure (awkward).\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: This ongoing war between the states is a test of our commitment to the liberty\u2014if we survive.]\nWe are met on a great (again with the \u201cgreat.\u201d You might consider a broadening your vocabulary) battle-field of that war (Redundant. There\u2019s no such thing as a battlefield of peace). We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. (Unnecessary inclusion. Of course, it\u2019s fitting. The reader doesn\u2019t need to be told this.)\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: We are here on this battle field to dedicate it to those who died. It\u2019s the least we can do.]\nBut, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. (Tortured sentence. Get to the point. Used \u201ccannot\u201d three times.) The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: In point of fact, the soldiers who died here have already consecrated this ground. All we can do is recognize that truth.]\nThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here (\u201chere\u201d is unnecessary and used twice in this sentence. Strike it.), but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced (Awkward, stilted\u2014revise).\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: What we do today may soon be forgotten, but what the soldiers did on this battlefield will be remembered forever.]\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God (watch the God-talk, Abe), shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. (Awkward and cumbersome paragraph. Remember, less is more.)\n[Editor\u2019s suggestion: What remains for us is to continue working for liberty and freedom. After all, a lot of people died for our cause. Let\u2019s not forget them.]\nOkay, Abe. Those are my notes. I think you have a good start here and that someday, you will make a great speechwriter. You just need to pay attention to the details.\nEighty-seven years ago our grandparents started a new nation with liberty as its goal. They also felt that every person was born equal. \u00a0This ongoing war between the states is a test of our commitment to \u00a0liberty. \u00a0We are here on this battlefield to dedicate it to those who died.

Early last year, I wrote a book for my primary nonfiction publisher B&H Publishing Group (formally Broadman Holman). The release was delayed for awhile, but now the work has been released to the masses.\n40 DAYS is a labor of love and deals with a area of biblical revelation seldom examined. While countless books have been written about the fact of Christ's resurrection, very little has been written about the resurrection appearances themselves. In 40 DAYS, I try to shed some light on those amazing events. There are twelve recorded appearances of Jesus. Each has a message all its own. In some cases, we have long accounts; in others just a passing references. Jesus' appearances did more than prove He rose from the dead, they also, like living parables, taught life changing truth.\nThe release of this nonfiction work on the heels of my latest novel, CRIME SCENE JERUSALEM, turns out to be an unexpected blessing. In CSJ, I try to show the death and resurrection of Christ through the eyes of a modern criminologist; in 40 DAYS, my goal was to point out details of how and why Jesus appeared the way He did, details we often over look.\nI think you'll find 40 DAYS a fascinating read.\nHere\u2019s the back cover copy:\nWhile many have written about the Resurrection itself, few have delved deeply into the forty days Jesus spent on the Earth after his death-defying exit from the grave. The incomparable magnitude of that miracle tends to overshadow the great days that followed. But, ho, how fascinating are the lessons to be learned beyond that stone!\nWith a passionate believer\u2019s heart and an investigator\u2019s flair for finding rich truths in the often-overlooked details, noted author Alton Gansky examines here every recorded event that happened from the moment Christ left the tomb until his glorious ascension to heaven.\nWhat the reader gains is a fresh excitement for the Resurrection story, a greater knowledge and contextual grasp of Scripture, and, best of all, a closer personal relationship with Jesus.\nTo hear the first chapter, click here: Download 40_days_chapter_1.1 web.wav .\nTo purchase online through Lifeway Christian Stores click here .\nTo purchase through Amazon.com click here .\nChapter Titles:\nPart 1: From the Cross to the Tomb\n1.

Pj Jacokes, comedian and producer of the Go Comedy! Improv Theater and Go Improv Academy, makes a career out of showing Metro Detroiters how to be fast on their feet. His sketch this week outlines why we should care about improv and fostering those bursts of imagination.\nPost 2: Demand Imagination\nPosted By: Pj Jacokes Posted: 1/29/2010\nI believe that there is a war against imagination.\nBut it wasn't always like that. As a child, imagination is encouraged. It's on the checklists that my son's teachers go over every semester. Imagination is at its strongest when we're children. It's used when there are bad guys at the bottom of the stairs or you have one last chance to win the Super Bowl or when a broom is a guitar or a banana is a gun. But as a child, imagining is as natural as breathing. It's vibrant and unapologetic and weird. Not too long ago during bath time, my 4-year old, Dax, created a musical based on his bath toys \u0096 Basketballs vs. Monsters.\nBut there is a point where some kids are labeled with having \"an overactive imagination\" \u0096 and, somehow, that's a negative thing. Creativity is something to be feared. Then in high school, it's not cool to have an imagination. In college, there's no time for it and in the corporate world there seems to be little patience for it. Or when it is used, it's under the moniker \"ideating\" which is as far from the idea of imagination as you can get.\nAs a result, a lot of folks who come to our improv shows will say, \"Oh, I could never do that.\" Well, the truth is, it's something everyone used to be able to do. In fact, I'd say it's something everyone still does. It may not be as bold, but improv is something we all do. Every one of us. I do it on a stage with the hopes of making an audience laugh. You might do it at work, explaining why you were late or at home, explaining to a child what thunder is, or at a bar, when you get caught looking at another girl. We may not call that using our imaginations (some might call it lying, which in some cases is accurate, but irrelevant in this argument), but it is.\nOn Conan O'Brien's last show, he offered this, \"All I ask of you, especially young people...is one thing. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism -- it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\"\nCynicism isn't hard to come by. It's easy. Any idiot can complain. Just look at any online forum and you can see scores of negative, cynical comments from anonymous posters that lead nowhere. This is not the time for negativity.\nI believe Detroit needs overactive imaginations right now. It needs us to see things that aren't there; that could be there and it needs us to believe in them against all odds. It needs us to believe in other people's crazy ideas too. We live in a city built on crazy ideas \u0096 so crazy they just might work \u0096 and it's time for another round.\nShare this page\n"}]]}
