Standards based on research with dairy cows are discriminatory to dairy goats in many aspects and must be replaced by suitable goat milk standards. Practices which assure safe and wholesome quality of goat milk are based on dairy cow experiences but must be confirmed for applicability to goat husbandry, not only for microbiological safety, but also for acceptability of taste and odor, which so far has been a widespread major deterrent to public acceptance of goat milk, and therefore impedes its use in human nutrition where medical reasons indicate its value.\nINTRODUCTION\nWhy goat milk? This is a critical question to be asked and answered by all who are trying help establish a dairy goat business and industry. The value of goat milk in human nutrition has so far received very little factual and academic attention (Haenlein, 1984, 1988, 1992; Park, 1991). However, if we can not and do not identify and promote facts of the role, and superiority in certain instances, of goat milk in human nutrition, we will have a hard time justifying growth of the goat business as an industry next to the dairy cattle business. As the milk supply from cows is more plentiful and cheaper, we have the challenge to demonstrate why there are good reasons to produce goat milk; if not, we are strictly only in the pet business.\nDespite a widespread absence of infrastructural organization for goat milk in the USA, more commercial successes with goat milk marketing are becoming known in recent years (Loewenstein et al., 1980; Kapture, 1982; Haenlein, 1985; Pinkerton, 1991; Hankin, 1992; Jackson, 1992). Also, significant new research station efforts in Texas, California, Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, and Pennsylvania have been advancing new knowledge of goat milk production on the farm, and of the physiology, biochemistry and veterinary aspects of the animal in recent years. Besides that, a new scientific journal Small Ruminant Research has become established by the International Goat Association on a monthly basis and with broad international support since 1988. And the volumes of new scientific data presented at four major quintannual international goat conferences have become widely circulated. Thus it is high time to include in these developments the sanitarians for establishing quality standards, and the medical profession for evidence on the medical and nutritional benefits of goat milk.\nMEDICAL RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR GOAT MILK\nPowerful justification for goat milk can come from medical needs, especially for infants afflicted with various ailments, including cow milk protein sensitivities. Swedish studies have shown that cow milk was a major cause of colic, sometimes fatal, in 12 to 30 percent formula-fed, less than 3-month-old infants (Lothe et al., 1982). In breast-fed infants, colic was related to the mother's consumption of cow milk (Baldo, 1984; Cant et al., 1985; Host et al., 1988). In older infants, the incidence of cow milk protein intolerance was approximately 20 percent (Nestle, 1987).\nA popular therapy among pediatricians is the change to vegetable protein soy-based formula; however, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of all infants with cow milk protein intolerance will also react adversely to soy proteins (Lothe et al., 1982). Approximately 40 percent of all patients sensitive to cow milk proteins tolerate goat milk proteins (Brenneman, 1978; Zeman, 1982), possibly because lactalbumin is immunospecific between species (Hill, 1939).\nBIOCHEMICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GOAT MILK AND COW MILK\nGoat milk proteins have many significant differences in their amino acid compositions from the milk of other mammalian species, especially in relative proportions of the various milk proteins and in their genetic polymorphisms (Jenness, 1980; Boulanger et al., 1984; Addeo et al., 1988; Ambrosoli et al., 1988). The major protein in cow milk is alpha-s-1-casein, but goat milk may differ genetically by having either none (\"Null\" type) or much (\"High\" type). Null types have shorter rennet coagulation time, less resistance to heat treatment, curd firmness is weaker, pH is higher, protein and mineral contents in milk are lower, and cheese yields are less than in high types. This in turn indicates and may explain significant differences to cow milk in digestion by infants and patients (Mack, 1953), which traditionally have been explained by the \"homogenized\" nature of goat milk fat.\nActually, the composition of goat milk fat may be much more important than the prevalence of large numbers of small fat globules, because it too differs significantly from the composition of cow milk fat under average feeding conditions (Haenlein, 1992). The various components of milk fat, fatty acids, differ in carbon chain length and saturation, which has nutritional and medical significance. Goat milk fat normally has 35 percent of medium chain fatty acids (C6-C14) compared to cow milk fat 17 percent (Table 1), and three are named after goats: Caproic (C6), caprylic (C8), capric (C10), totaling 15 percent in goat milk fat versus only 5percent in cow milk fat. Besides their unique flavor, which has serious consequences in improper handling of goat milk, these medium chain fatty acids (MCT) have become of considerable interest to the medical profession, because of their unique benefits in many metabolic diseases of humans (Babayan, 1981).\nCapric, caprylic and other MCT have been used for treatment of malabsorption syndromes, intestinal disorders, coronary diseases, pre-mature infant nutrition, cystic fibrosis, gallstone problems, because of their unique metabolic abilities of providing energy and at the same time lowering, inhibiting and dissolving cholesterol deposits (Schwabe et al., 1964; Greenberger and Skillman, 1969; Kalser, 1971; Tantibhedhyangkul and Hashim, 1975, 1978). It seems apparent that in this area is great potential for identifying a unique importance and role for goat milk, specifically goat milk fat and probably goat milk butter, which has not received much attention at all. And all this adds even more importance to the establishment of acceptable practices and standards for quality goat milk production, which so far has been lagging behind those for dairy cows, but which require separate establishment because of the many unique physiological and metabolic characteristics of goats compared to cows (Haenlein, 1980, 1987a, 1991; Hinckley, 1990; Kalogridou-Vassiliadou et al., 1992).\nMONITORS OF QUALITY MILK STANDARDS\nThis discussion is limited to the effects the farm producer can and will have on the quality of milk, which is a most perishable and most fragile product, easily affected negatively by improper feeding of the animals, improper handling of them prior and during milking, improper handling of the milk during and after milking including improper equipment handling, cooling and transportation (Haenlein, 1987b). To safeguard quality milk production, at least 5 major parameters are routinely monitored by various agencies which have jurisdiction over the production of milk through commercial channels:\nNutritional constituents in milk.\nSomatic cell counts as related to mastitis.\nBacteria counts as related to sanitary practices.\nAdulteration and pesticide residue contents.\nFlavor, taste, appearance and temperature.\nThese five parameters need to be at optimum or it will cost the farmer money, directly or indirectly. If milk composition is below minimum market standards, if somatic cell counts and bacteria levels indicate mastitis or unclean and improper handling, if milk is off in appearance, flavor, taste and temperature, if milk contains water or veterinary or sanitary treatment or pesticide residues or traces of toxic molds from feeds, then entire loads of milk shipment or tanks can be unsalable, can be condemned and a big financial loss to the farmer, jeopardizing even future milk sales.\nTechnology has come to the farmers' aid and enabled great progress in sanitary milking and milk house facilities in recent years. It is in the farmers' direct financial interest to take advantage of this technology, which can deliver milk from the mammary gland of goats to the cooling tank and processing plant without ever coming in contact with barn air, with other animals or the workers. This can eliminate a whole host of environmental odors, microbes, contaminations and assure a truly quality milk. However, technology requires its own proper care and sanitary management, otherwise it will lead to oxidation, contamination, bacteria invasion, and loss of the quality of milk it was meant to assure.\nWhat then can the goat milk producer do to assure the best quality and best possible income from the sale of his milk, especially when instead of modern technology the traditional hand-milking is still practiced? Information from dairy cow production and cow milk research can help in advising goat milk producers, while research with goat milk production and handling is just starting in the United States, more found in foreign languages or non-existing. This has led to the unfortunate application of cow milk standards by regulatory sanitary officials to goat milk in commerce, in the absence of established separate goat milk standards, and to the detriment of goat milk producers.\nGOAT MILK FLAVOR\nAcceptable, attractive milk odor and taste is probably the single most important quality standard of goat milk, because of a long history of widespread negative popular perception of goat milk being \"goaty.\" In fact, the national U.S. dairy products judging procedures list \"goaty\" as one of the four odor characteristics of bad versus good milk, cheese, yoghurt, cream and butter. Goaty odor does not need to happen, because well produced and well handled goat milk is indistinguishable in taste and odor from quality cow milk. Although goat milk has a higher content of the strong smelling caproic, caprylic and capric acids in its milk fat, with good milking practices they are enclosed within the fat globule membrane. This membrane is, however, more fragile in goat milkfat than in cow milkfat, is easily broken during improper handling, insufficient cooling and repeated rewarming, and then enzymes are liberated that can produce odors.\nMany sources can be identified for off-flavors in cow milk and the same applies to goat milk: feeds (molasses, citrus pulp), forages (rape, rapeseed meal), weeds (onions, garlic), environmental odors (oil, gasoline, moldy rags, lime, cement, active bucks); normal physiology (early lactation colostrum, late lactation high salt contents, estrus, mastitis, sickness); improper handmilking procedures; improper equipment and handling (oxidation due to risers in milking pipelines, vacuum slips and searches, sun exposure, filthy clogged strainers and pipeline connections, unclean milking equipment, wash water not hot); slow air cooling instead of water cooling or refrigeration; variable temperature during storage, addition of warm milk to cold storage milk, transport in unrefrigerated containers, etc.\nGood procedures exist about how to best achieve acceptable milk flavor and with it production of quality milk:\nClean milking equipment, cans, strainers, pipeline, tank.\nHealthy and clean animals and udders.\nProper feeding, ration balance, meeting nutrient and especially mineral requirements.\nNo feeding of milking animals prior to milking for at least 2 hours, especially not of feeds and forages with odors.\nClean air in separate milking room, and clean hands and cloths when hand-milking.\nDry, clean wiped udders and teats; forestripped teats.\nProper, sufficient and steady vacuum during machinemilking.\nLow \"true\" somatic cell counts (neutrophil leukocytes) in milk.\nLow socalled preincubation and standard plate counts of bacteria in milk; and low cold-resistant bacteria count in milk.\nRapid water cooling or refrigeration after milking.\nConstant low milk storage temperatures, including during transportation.\nEquipment to be washed with very hot water (120 F, or higher, depending on length of exposure) after an initial lukewarm rinse after each milking a.m. and p.m., and final sanitizing solution before each milking; sanitizing rinses between milking of individual animals is of advantage when disease cases occur, but this is only effective when fresh solutions are applied for each new rinse, or if \"backflushing\" is part of the equipment procedure.\nQUALITY TESTING\nTo monitor the concerns for quality milk production, a number of gauges and tests can be routinely used on dairy goat farms. Often it is difficult to overcome seasonal breeding and the then common late stage of lactation in all goats, which means that at some time of the year most members of a goat herd are in late lactation with naturally high levels of salt, solids and somatic cell counts in their milk. CMT (California Mastitis Test) checking of udder halves should be routine and can make a difference in quality control of goat milk.\nThe National Mastitis Council has promoted effective mastitis control programs, the so called 5-point program for reduction in somatic cell counts states:\n1. Use only functionally adequate milking machines, or hand-milking in the correct manner.\n2. Dip teats after each milking with an effective, approved product.\n3. Administer promptly a full series of recommended treatments to all clinical cases of mastitis.\n4. Treat udder halves at drying-off of goats with an approved antibiotic preparation for drying-off.\n5. Cull animals with chronic infections when they do not respond to treatments.\nI add to this list: Don't use milk for sale from udders with very high somatic cell counts or high CMT. Feed that milk to chickens, pigs or a calf.\nAnd I also add: Don't let goats rest on concrete floors during the cold season, provide wooden slatted, false floors or warm clean bedding, or natural pasture, to keep udders from getting cold chills and infections.\nGoat milk must be cooled like it is officially prescribed down to the holding temperature range of 36 to 42o F within a short time after milking. This is not possible by air cooling, only by water cooling, agitated exposure to refrigerated tank walls, and in counter-current heat exchange coolers. Once cool, quality goat milk must be held in the 36 to 42o F range without interruption nor variation to maintain its quality and long shelf-life.\nA quality bonus payment helps efforts in achieving and maintaining high-quality milk. Milk composition and yield changes with mastitis, even subclinical mastitis, which has visibly normal milk but high somatic cell counts. Some components in milk, such as whey proteins, lactose, lipase, sodium, chloride increase with mastitis, while milk fat, solids, casein, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and cheese yield decrease. Thus, taste quality of goat milk is directly affected by the status of udder health.\nINSPECTION AND LAB REPORTS\nDairy lab reports provide several milk quality criteria required by local, state and federal health inspectors:\n1. Standard plate counts (SPC) of bacteria should be less than 10,000 per milliliter.\n2. Pre-incubation count (PIC) of specific bacteria should be less than 20,000.\n3. Direct microscopic somatic cell count (DMSCC) should be less than 300,000.\n4. Direct microscopic count (DMC) should be less than 30,000.\n5. Temperature resistant bacteria count (THC) should be less than 1,000.\n6. Freezing point temperature decrease or cryoscopy (CRY) in degrees C below zero must be between -0.530 and -0.550, which indicates absence of water in milk.\n7. Antibiotics or growth inhibitors (ABI) in milk must be negative.\n8. Holding temperature (TEM) of the milk should be between 34 and 39 degrees F always.\nThese tests monitor trouble due to animals, equipment and people. The California Mastitis Test (CMT), obtainable from any feed or supply dealer is an excellent farm-side monitor, even for goats, and should be used often and regularly on each goat and each udder half. Even better yet is the monthly somatic cell count (SCC) testing of each goat in the herd under the DHIA program, if the somatic cell counting is not by the Coulter counter.\nMILK SECRETION IS DIFFERENT IN GOATS\nThe most obvious difference in anatomy is that there are only two teats on the goat udder vs. four on cow udders. Less obvious is the relatively larger inside volume of the teat and gland cysterns. That is why good goat udders look much more collapsed and empty after milking than cow udders. The smaller, tighter diameter of the teat sphincter and meatus of goat udders makes milking and milking-out somewhat different. Also, the milk let-down effect in goats takes only a few seconds compared to one minute in cows. Goat manure should always be pellets and drier than cow manure, which is much higher in water content or normally sloppy and easily soiling the flanks and udders of cows, while goats stay normally dry and have clean flanks and udders. This difference makes milking preparation procedures for goats potentially much easier to be sanitary. It is not risky to only dry clean goat teats and udders for the milking of low-bacteria-count goat milk. Also, prevalent bacteria and pathogens in goat udders are often of different species than in cow udders.\nSeasonal reproduction, usual in this country, is another important difference in milking goats. Cows are bred in every month of the year, therefore their milk is always a composite of early, middle and late stage lactation. Goats, unless specially treated, breed only in early fall and are fresh only in early spring, normally. Thus, at various times of the year, dairy goats are all in early, or middle, or late stage of lactation, accentuating normal seasonal milk composition changes, that are related to stages of lactation, to estrus and low amounts of milk. For example, fat, protein and somatic cells in milk normally are high in early and late lactation in cows and in goats, while lactose is usually the opposite.\nAll these differences might give already doubts about the validity of using the same standards for evaluating milk of the two species. Not surprisingly, the compositional differences are also part of physiological differences in the secretion process of milk from inside the udder from the alveolar cells. Cow milk secretion has been termed \"merocrine,\" which is defined as \"the act of secretion leaves the cell intact.\" Goat milk secretion, on the other hand, has been termed by researchers \"apocrine,\" which is defined as \"the secretion-filled free end of a gland cell is pinched off, leaving the nucleus and most of the cytoplasm to recover and repeat the process.\"\nSOMATIC CELL COUNTS\nEquipment for monitoring somatic cell count (SCC) levels in cow milk includes the CMT applied in the barn, and electronic automated machines in labs, the so-called Coulter Counter, or the Fossomatic, which use different chemical principals to achieve supposedly the same SCC evaluations.\nThe important question of whether these three worldwide adopted methods and the legal threshold set by Public Health officials of 1 million SCC/ml milk apply to cow and goat milk equally accurately and validly, despite the many mentioned differences in the physiology and composition of milk of the two species has only recently begun to be studied (Haenlein, 1987a, b; Hinckley, 1991; Kalogridou-Vassiliadou et al., 1992). Research has established that the SCC in cow milk is indicative of, although less than equal, the number of leukocytes in milk, which of course indicates subclinical or clinical mastitis. In contrast, goat milk contains from the apocrine secretion process many non-leucocytic cell particles, that do not have DNA or a nucleus as leukocytes do. Thus, only SCC methods which specifically identify DNA, give valid counts of leukocytes in goat milk. Socalled \"total somatic cell count\" is not only unreliable, but useless and wrong for inspectors monitoring legal thresholds of quality of goat milk.\nIt was determined that visibly normal goat milk had less numbers of pathogenic bacteria than cow milk under similar conditions. Relationships between SCC from CMT and Fossomatic were similar for goat or cow milk. However, absolute SCC numbers rose much higher in normal goat milk than expected from cow milk, which suggests that the goat udder responds to pathogens much more actively than cow udders do.\nIt was also concluded that if CMT scores were used for legal thresholds, at CMT-1, a misclassification of 52percent of normal goat milk would occur. A legal threshold of 1 million SCC/ml would misidentify 25percent and 35percent of bacteriologically negative, i.e. normal goat milk by the Coulter Counter and Fossomatic methods, respectively.\nNot included in these studies were additional normal SCC increases due to advancing lactation, since only the first 6 months of lactation were tested. This will then be expected to further increase the absolute levels of SCC in normal goat milk above those reported in the studies so far. Finally, these tests used only fore-milking samples, while it is known that the last strippings are higher in SCC. Thus, absolute levels of SCC in bulk tank goat milk containing all milk portions, fore, middle and last, would be expected to be higher yet than in the studies, regardless of season of year or stage of lactation, influencing the setting of the legal threshold.\nValuable research information on goat milk mastitis and somatic cell counts has been published by Caruolo, Dulin, Hinckley, Lerondelle, Maisi, Nesbakken, Park, Poutrel; and Judy Kapture (Portage, WI), ADGA member on the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments has very actively pursued the problem of somatic cell count legal thresholds. Their conclusions are that:\nThe Coulter Counter is not reliable for goat milk.\nThe only officially acceptable method to confirm high cell counts in goat milk is the DMSCC (direct microscopic somatic cell count) using the special pyronine Y-methyl green stain (Standard Methods/Dairy Products 1985, pp. 229-230), or another appropriate method determining DNA contents.\nThe Fossomatic may be accurate in mid-lactation, but results need to be confirmed with the pyronine Y stain.\nThe CMT can be used as a screening test but high counts must be confirmed with the pyronine Y stain.\nSCC levels of normal goat milk increase from spring to fall well above the cow threshold of 1 million/ml, starting about 4 months after kidding, coinciding with start of estrus and late stage of lactation.\nEasily achievable SCC levels of 100 to 300,000 SCC/ml in cow milk are unusual in even high-quality managed goat herds.\nQUALITY ASSURANCE\nRecently, the National Milk Producers Federation joined forces with the American Veterinary Medical Association to develop a \"quality assurance protocol\" plan and campaign, that should ensure freedom from drug residues in milk such as sulfamethazine, other sulfonamides, antibiotics gentamicin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, other pesticides and even toxic mold residues, etc. The public does not want safe, low-level residues in milk, but demands zero-tolerance, totally residue-free milk. Thus, quality production and handling of milk is a real challenge for the goat farmer as it is for the cow farmer. It can be done and is being done more and more.\nREFERENCES\nAddeo, F., Mauriello, R. and Luccia, A. di, 1988. A gel electrophoretic study of caprine casein. J.

Even in the United States, the <em>goat</em> <em>is</em> gaining popularity.", "explanation": null, "document": "Feeding Infants & Toddlers\nWhat does goat's milk give you that cow's milk doesn't? In many parts of the world, goat's milk is preferred to cow's milk. Even in the United States, the goat is gaining popularity. Goats eat less and occupy less grazing space than cows, and in some families the backyard goat supplies milk for family needs. Goat's milk is believed to be more easily digestible and less allergenic than cow's milk. Does it deserve this reputation? Let's disassemble goat's milk, nutrient-by-nutrient, to see how it compares with cow's milk.\nDifferent fat. Goat's milk contains around ten grams of fat per eight ounces compared to 8 to 9 grams in whole cow's milk, and it's much easier to find lowfat and non-fat varieties of cow's milk than it is to purchase lowfat goat's milk. Unlike cow's milk, goat's milk does not contain agglutinin. As a result, the fat globules in goat's milk do not cluster together, making them easier to digest. Like cow's milk, goat's milk is low in essential fatty acids, because goats also have EFA-destroying bacteria in their ruminant stomachs. Yet, goat milk is reported to contain more of the essential fatty acids linoleic and arachnodonic acids, in addition to a higher proportion of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids. These are easier for intestinal enzymes to digest.\nDifferent protein. Goat milk protein forms a softer curd (the term given to the protein clumps that are formed by the action of your stomach acid on the protein), which makes the protein more easily and rapidly digestible. Theoretically, this more rapid transit through the stomach could be an advantage to infants and children who regurgitate cow's milk easily. Goat's milk may also have advantages when it comes to allergies. Goat's milk contains only trace amounts of an allergenic casein protein, alpha-S1, found in cow's milk. Goat's milk casein is more similar to human milk, yet cow's milk and goat's milk contain similar levels of the other allergenic protein, beta lactoglobulin. Scientific studies have not found a decreased incidence of allergy with goat's milk, but here is another situation where mothers' observations and scientific studies are at odds with one another. Some mothers are certain that their child tolerates goat's milk better than cow's milk, and mothers are more sensitive to children's reactions than scientific studies.\nLess lactose. Goat's milk contains slightly lower levels of lactose (4.1 percent versus 4.7 percent in cow's milk), which may be a small advantage in lactose-intolerant persons.\nDifferent minerals. Although the mineral content of goat's milk and cow's milk is generally similar, goat's milk contains 13 percent more calcium, 25 percent more vitamin B-6, 47 percent more vitamin A, 134 percent more potassium, and three times more niacin. It is also four times higher in copper. Goat's milk also contains 27 percent more of the antioxidant selenium than cow's milk. Cow's milk contains five times as much vitamin B-12 as goat's milk and ten times as much folic acid (12 mcg. in cow's milk versus 1 mcg. for goat's milk per eight ounces with an RDA of 75-100 mcg. for children). The fact that goat's milk contains less than ten percent of the amount of folic acid contained in cow's milk means that it must be supplemented with folic acid in order to be adequate as a formula or milk substitute for infants and toddlers, and popular brands of goat's milk may advertise \"supplemented with folic acid\" on the carton.\nGOAT'S MILK FORMULA VERSUS COMMERCIAL FORMULA FOR ALLERGIC INFANTS\nParents of babies allergic to cow's milk and other commercial formulas often ask if it's safe to use goat's milk as an alternative. In theory, goat's milk is less allergenic and more easily digestible than cow's milk, but it should not be used as a substitute for infant formula. Like cow's milk, it can cause intestinal irritation and anemia. If your baby under one year of age is allergic to cow's milk-based formulas, try either a soy-based formula or a hypoallergenic formula. If your baby can't tolerate either soy or hypoallergenic formulas, in consultation with your doctor and/or a pediatric nutritionist see\u00a0the goat's milk formula recipe below.\nThis formula has stood the test of time. One batch contains 715 calories and nineteen calories per ounce, which is essentially the same as cow's milk formulas. This is sufficient for an infant six to twelve months. A baby on goat's milk formula should also receive a multi-vitamin with iron supplement prescribed by her doctor. In infants over one year of age, goat's milk can be readily used instead of cow's milk. (Be sure to buy goat's milk that is certified free of antiobiotics and bovine growth hormone (BGH).

In practice, however, raw milk is available in stores only in Arizona, California, Connecticut, and Maine...\nSix states allow sales of raw milk for animal consumption only, without requiring the addition of dyes... Two states make all sales of raw milk illegal with the exception of raw goat milk when prescribed in writing by a licensed physician... In two states, Montana and Washington, the situation is murky. Regulations could be interpreted to allow sales of raw milk but state officials do not follow these interpretations... Sixteen additional states and the District of Columbia make all sales of raw milk illegal...\nIn 1986, the federal government banned all interstate shipments of raw milk, cream and butter.\"\n[Editor's Note: ProCon.org received an e-mail from the Weston A.

Before heating [pasteurization], milk is a living food rich in colloidal minerals and enzymes necessary for the absorption and utilization of the sugars, fats, proteins and minerals in milk. Raw cream and butter has 'X Factor' that prevents joint stiffness.\nEight to ten thousand years ago, raw and fermented milk products began to replace animal bones as a major source of minerals in many cultures. These raw dairy products were known to increase strength, fertility and general health. Present-day cultures whose diets are high in cultured raw dairy products tend to be extremely healthy, long-lived people. (The culturing of raw milk breaks down the lactose, and predigests the milk proteins.) Raw milk that is still warm from the animal has traditionally been used through the centuries for various wasting diseases...\nPasteurizing milk kills off all bacteria, including the health-giving lactobacilli. This allows milk to putrefy with bad bacteria over time, rather than sour or ferment from good lactobacilli. Pasteurization also destroys vitamins, especially C, B6 and B12, and denatures fragile milk proteins. It destroys 20% of the iodine, and makes insoluble the major part of the calcium content.\"\nAug. 15, 2011 - Linda Melos, ND\nThe Weston A. Price Foundation's Campaign for Real Milk explains in the article \"What Is Real Milk?,\" available on its website (accessed Aug. 15, 2011):\n\"Pasteurization destroys enzymes, diminishes vitamin content, denatures fragile milk proteins, destroys vitamins C, B12 and B6, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease and cancer...\nPasteurization was instituted in the 1920s to combat TB [tuberculosis], infant diarrhea, undulant fever and other diseases caused by poor animal nutrition and dirty production methods. But times have changed and modern stainless steel tanks, milking machines, refrigerated trucks and inspection methods make pasteurization absolutely unnecessary for public protection.\"\nAug. 15, 2011 - Weston A.

State of California, provided the following testimony on Apr. 25, 2008, in support of raw cow's milk and against CA legislation (AB 1735) which regulated coliform levels in raw milk:\n\"Beneficial bacteria provide benefits in a number of ways\u2026[o]ne of the ways that they provide benefit is by producing specific substances which kill other [harmful] bacteria. Another way that they are beneficial to people is that they inhibit the growth of other [harmful] bacteria indirectly rather than just simply killing them. Additionally, they have been shown -- beneficial bacteria have been shown to block the entrance of [harmful] bacteria into the body, therefore preventing the illness\u2026\nPrebiotic is a substance which when introduced to beneficial bacteria stimulates their growth or stimulates their beneficial activity. A probiotic is defined technically as bacteria, beneficial bacteria, which when added to a product or as a supplement provides those beneficial bacteria to the person that's drinking the milk. My personal take on this is it's obvious from the definitions that fresh market - raw market milk is in fact a prebiotic. It does stimulate beneficial organisms. And although not technically meeting the definition of a probiotic because it's not added, these beneficial bacteria that are present are natively present in [raw] milk.\u201d\nApr. 25, 2008 - Theodore Beals, MD\nThe Organic Consumers Association stated the following in its May 7, 2010 press release \"Cow on Boston Common 5-10-2010 for Raw Milk Drink-In,\" available at www.organicconsumers.org:\n\"Over three million Americans now prefer organic raw milk and raw milk dairy products over pasteurized milk because of its superior nutrition and disease fighting qualities and because it comes from small, local producers who pasture their dairy cows, rather than keeping them confined all day and all year in dairy feedlots on huge, disease-ridden factory farms.\"\nMay 7, 2010 - Organic Consumers Association\nJoseph Mercola, DO, an osteopathic physician, stated in his Apr. 24, 2004 article \"The Real Reasons Why Raw Milk Is Becoming More Popular,\" published on his website:\n\"Raw milk is a highly health-promoting food...

About 80% of the proteins in milk are caseins - reasonably heat stable but easy to digest. The remaining 20% or so fall into the class of whey proteins, many of which have important physiological effects (bioactivity). Also easy to digest, but very heat sensitive, these include key enzymes (specialized proteins) and enzyme inhibitors, immunoglobulins (antibodies), metal-binding proteins, vitamin binding proteins and several growth factors... Studies have shown significant loss of these important disease fighters when milk is heated to normal processing temperatures...\nLactose, or milk sugar, is the primary carbohydrate in cow's milk. Made from one molecule each of the simple sugars glucose and galactose, it's known as a disaccharide. People with lactose intolerance for one reason or another (age, genetics, etc.), no longer make the enzyme lactase and so can't digest milk sugar. This leads to some unsavory symptoms, which, needless to say, the victims find rather unpleasant at best. Raw milk, with its lactose-digesting Lactobacilli bacteria intact, may allow people who traditionally have avoided milk to give it another try.\"\nAug. 15, 2011 - Raw-milk-facts.com\nAdam Helfer, certified nutrition and lifestyle coach, stated the following in his Aug. 6, 2011 article \"Rawesome Foods Raided: A Sad Day for America,\" available at communities.washingtontimes.com:\n\"Raw Grassfed milk and products (which have been produced and consumed safely for thousands of years) have been shown to help combat allergies, gastro intestinal disorders, build the immune system and have helped children with Autism and Asperger syndrome.

This makes raw milk a very popular and crucial part in a mothers' dietary planning for their children and family.\"\nAug. 6, 2011 - Adam Helfer\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated the following in a July 16, 2011 press release, \"Foodborne Outbreak Associated with Raw Milk from Tucker Adkins Dairy of York SC,\" available at www.fda.gov:\n\"The FDA recommends that consumers only drink pasteurized milk. Raw milk is unpasteurized milk from hoofed mammals, such as cows, sheep, or goats. Raw milk may contain a wide variety of harmful bacteria \u2013 including Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, Campylobacter and Brucella - that may cause illness and possibly death...\nSymptoms of illness caused by various bacteria commonly found in raw milk may include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, headache and body ache. Most healthy individuals recover quickly from illness caused by raw milk. However, some people may have more severe illness, and the harmful bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous for pregnant women, the elderly, infants, young children and people with weakened immune systems...\nSince 1987, the FDA has required all milk packaged for human consumption to be pasteurized before being delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. Pasteurization, a process that heats milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time, kills bacteria responsible for diseases, such as listeriosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria and brucellosis...\nProponents of drinking raw milk often claim that raw milk is more nutritious than pasteurized milk and that raw milk is inherently antimicrobial, thus making pasteurization unnecessary. There is no meaningful nutritional difference between pasteurized and raw milk, and raw milk does not contain compounds that will kill harmful bacteria.\u201d\nJuly 16, 2011 - US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office stated the following in its Aug. 3, 2011 press release, \"Three Arrested on Charges of Illegally Producing, Selling Unpasteurized Milk,\" available at da.co.la.ca.us:\n\"Pasteurization kills or slows the growth of pathogens and microbes and it must be accomplished according to state standards under sanitary conditions.

On the contrary, permitting such sales and schemes will inevitably result in an increased incidence of foodborne illness...\nRaw milk is inherently dangerous and should not be consumed. Raw milk continues to be a source of foodborne illness and even a cause of death within the United States. Despite the claims of raw milk advocates, raw milk is not a magical elixir possessing miraculous curative properties.

Indeed, some raw milk advocates blame pasteurized milk for everything from infant colic to osteoporosis, heart disease, and cancer (have they been talking to the anti-aspartame lobby?). None of this is true...\nWhile raw milk may taste somewhat sweeter than the pasteurized variety, this hardly makes up for the fact that it is considerably more likely to carry disease-causing microorganisms. Indeed, as we have noted in the past, there have been well-documented outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 infection in children, an infection that can result in permanent kidney damage, if not death.\nWe can only hope that the public health community exerts itself to counter the spread of the raw milk myth.\"\nAug. 7, 2006 - Ruth Kava, PhD, RD\nThe Washington Dairy Products Commission explained in its article \"What Is Milk?,\" published on its website, (accessed Sep. 25, 2008):\n\"'Raw milk' is milk that has not been pasteurized.

The intention is to produce it on an industrial scale to replace formula milk and breast milk, when normal breast feeding is either not possible or undesirable.\nThe Telegraph newspaper reports that scientists at the State Key Laboratories for AgroBiotechnology at the China Agricultural University have successfully introduced human genes into 300 dairy cows to produce what they call \u201chuman-like\u201d cow milk. It is well known that human breast milk contains key nutrients that can help to boost the immune system of babies and reduce the risk of infections. The scientists wanted to find a way to produce an alternative to human breast milk and formula milk on an industrial scale, with the eventual aim of getting this GM \u201chuman-like\u201d cow\u2019s milk on supermarket shelves.\nThe researchers used both cloning and GM technology to introduce human genes into the DNA of Holstein dairy cows before the GM embryos were implanted into surrogate cows. Professor Ning Li, the scientist who led the research, claims that the GM milk would be as safe to drink as milk from ordinary dairy cows and that the cloned GM animals are physically identical to ordinary cows.\nYet we also know from the original research paper that only 24 of the original 37 GM calves that were produced during the experiment survived for more than six months. Seven of these calves died within hours of birth (most with gastrointestinal disease) and six died within six months of birth. The cause? Cloning technology used in such GM research \u201ccan affect the development and survival of cloned animals, although the exact reason why is not well understood,\u201d says the Telegraph article. Fills you with real confidence about the safety of the process \u2013 and the end product \u2013 doesn\u2019t it?\nWe already know that cloning has a far lower success rate when compared to natural breeding or other managed breeding techniques. But as this research shows, cloning also has serious implications for animal welfare. Most cloned animals die during pregnancy and a significant proportion of those who do survive die during or shortly after birth from cardiovascular failure, respiratory problems, liver or kidney failure, immune deficiencies, or musculoskeletal abnormalities. While the scientists admit that the reasons are \u201cnot well understood,\u201d we know that these problems appear in all species that have been cloned.\nPerhaps more troubling is that some abnormalities from cloning may not even show up until later in life. A recent World Organization for Animal Health report states that the development of musculoskeletal problems such as chronic lameness \u201cemphasizes the point that any underlying frailties in cloned animals may not be fully revealed until the animals are stressed in some manner.\u201d The European Commission has recently proposed a five-year moratorium on animal cloning on welfare and ethical grounds. EU advisors concluded that, \u201cconsidering the current level of suffering and health problems of surrogate dams and animal clones,\u201d there is no justification for cloning animals for food production purposes.\nAnd where are the extensive clinical trials to back up Professor Li\u2019s assurances that this GM \u201chuman-like\u201d cow milk is as safe to drink as milk from ordinary cows? The Telegraph article states that \u201cScientists insist genetically modified foods are unlikely to pose a threat to food safety and in the United States consumers have been eating genetically modified foods for more [sic] decades.\u201d Yet no clinical trials have ever been undertaken to prove the safety of this GM milk. In fact, no long term independent clinical food safety trials have been undertaken for any GM product. The GM company patents make sure of that.\nSo the fact that the U.S. population has been unwittingly used as guinea pigs for a GM food experiment over the last two decades is now being used to nullify any food safety concerns people might have about GM products. Is it just me or does this make your blood boil?\nThe long term health effects of GM foods could take decades to surface, just as it took decades for people to accept the damaging effects of smoking or trans-fats. While people might not be dropping dead from eating GM products, we don\u2019t know about the potential long term health impacts of GM food, such as emerging allergies or other nutritional problems, because no one is carrying out any monitoring.\nWhenever I hear claims about the inherent \u201csafety\u201d of GM foods I am always reminded of a statement made by Phil Angell in 1998, who was Monsanto\u2019s director of communications at that time. Angell said: \u201cMonsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food. Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is the FDA\u2019s job.\u201d Yet the reality is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) decision to approve GM crops is based entirely on safety research conducted by the very company which created it \u2013 and which stands to profit from its sale.\nEven more troubling is the fact that the biotech industry actively uses intellectual property rights laws to prevent truly independent scientific testing of its GM products. In February 2009, more than 25 leading scientists \u2013 all working at public research institutions located in 16 corn producing states \u2013 issued a public statement to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, claiming that: \u201cAs a result of restricted access, no truly independent research can be legally conducted on many critical questions regarding the technology.\u201d\nNow here\u2019s some food for thought: In 2008, the FDA approved the consumption of meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring. The FDA\u2019s report stated that cloned animals (and their milk) are \u201cas safe to eat as food from conventionally bred animals.\u201d Subsequently, there is no actual legal requirement for the meat and milk from cloned animals (or their offspring) to be labeled as such.\nWe also already know that U.S. food producers are not required to label any food as containing GM products.\nSo putting aside any animal welfare or food safety concerns that we might have with the production of this \u201chuman-like\u201d milk \u2013 or the ethical concerns about the use of human DNA to create commercial \u201cpharm animals,\u201d under current U.S. government regulations, this product could end up on the infant formula shelves unidentified as either GM or from cloned animals. This sort of deceptive marketing\u2013brought to you from the laboratories of Big Ag to your baby\u2019s delicate stomach\u2013could quite possibly have serious unintended consequences. I know my grandchildren won\u2019t have any of it.\n"}, {"score": 2158.2866, "uuid": "c2d8537e-d9b8-5c24-a53a-549c473b354b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600tw-20-19224", "target_hostname": "www.inhabitots.com", "target_uri": "http://www.inhabitots.com/argentine-scientists-clone-cow-to-produce-nutrient-rich-human-breast-milk/", "page_rank": 1.235987e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "&quot; <em>Cow</em> <em>Milk</em> |", "snippet": "If the synthesized <em>milk</em> does gain popular acceptance, the scientists could engineer different varietals for specific needs, like added insulin <em>or</em> other enhancers. * Study: <em>Cow</em>, <em>Goat</em> and Human Breast <em>Milk</em> Can Contain up to 20 Chemicals TweetEmail They say <em>milk</em> does a body good, but did you know a glass", "explanation": null, "document": "Only if I was unable to breastfeed.\n14 Votes\nView Results\nLoading ...\n[/caption]The cloned embryo, which was carried to term by a surrogate cow, was synthesized by a team of scientists from several institutions \u2013 the Institute for Biotechnology Research, the National Institute for Agricultural Biotechnology and the National University of San Martin.

Avoiding milk is a health benefit, not a hazard, so long as you have a modest amount of calcium from a good quality supplement.\"\nSep. 17, 2007 - Margaret Moss, MA\nNeal Barnard, MD, President of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, offerd the following in his article \"Dr. Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes: Frequently Asked Questions About Nutrition,\" available on the website of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (accessed May 31, 2007):\n\"Milk contains fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and diets high in fat and saturated fat can increase the risk of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease...\nOrganic milk may not contain the pesticides and antibiotics that non-organic milk contains, but still can be loaded with fat and cholesterol. Even organic cow\u2019s milk, which does not contain artificial hormones, does contain naturally occurring hormones. The combination of nutrients found in both organic and non-organic cow\u2019s milk increases our own production of some types of hormones. These hormones have been shown to increase the risk of some forms of cancer. Soymilk and other non-dairy beverages, such as rice and nut milks, are healthy alternatives to cow\u2019s milk.\"\nMay. 31, 2007 - Neal Barnard, MD\nWhat do you think?

As with anything else, if it is consumed in excessive amounts then it could create some problems, but milk is a wonderful source of calcium. If someone is worried about possible fats in the milk, they should drink skim milk. Children need the healthy fats in milk to develop their brains, especially at a young age, and the proteins provided in milk are not as easily found elsewhere. Also, if the concern is that a child will become overweight due to drinking too much milk, it is almost certainly because of other poor choices of diet, not because of the milk itself. It has been tested and confirmed that children who drink soda in place of milk are at a much higher risk of becoming obese, but that those who drink milk have higher calcium and stronger bones. Another point to observe is that milk provides about 13% of the daily value of Vitamin B12, which is an essential vitamin that carries oxygen to the muscles. This is especially important to remember when considering exercising and physical labor. Whether doing aerobic workouts (such as biking and running) or pushing a wheelbarrow of cement for a construction job, oxygen and strong muscles are needed, and milk can provide the necessary nutrients.\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+3 +4 -1 lanty jones Mar. 8, 2012\n\"i think milk is good for us bc i have never broke a bone in my whole life and i love milk i have 4 people at home and we drink 4 things of milk!! milk is goin to make u strong!!! dont stop drinking milk\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+3 +4 -1 Curtis Feb. 16, 2012\n\"Milk is benificial, it gives me the calcium I need.

Cow's milk has been shown to contain large amounts of both Saturated and Regular Fat. This can be very dangerous to obese people or a person of ANY size.\n2.) Milk is harvested very badly. They inject hormones into the cows so that they produce milk all the time. This leads to a large quantity of the chemical Lactose. This chemical can prove to make people bloat, break out on hives, itch, Have pains in their stomach and sometimes throw up.

If a cow makes more milk, she does make a greater quantity of lactose. However, this is diluted back to the 4.7% found in milk because it draws water out with it. Therefore, whether you are drinking milk from a cow that makes 20 lbs or 200 lbs, you are consuming the same amount of lactose because the percent never changes (unless you plan on drinking all of the 200 lb cows milk in one sitting). Anything in excess can be harmful, including the excessive estrogens found in plants. If people are lactose intolerant, they should avoid the sugar. In addition, rbST has been injected directly into humans bloodstream back in the 50's with no adverse results. Thats why rbST has a 'b' in it because it is biologically active in cows and not humans. There have been thousands of studies performed on rbST, and there is no negative results associated with the hormone (which is naturally found in a cows circulation).

I am concerned that the milk americans drink has two major issues that promote breast cancer, the first is bovine leukemia virus, a virus cows get from there moms, when the calf drinks there mothers milk, they catch it. Bovine leukemia virus causes breast cancer in the utters of the cow, it is quite common, and it is also causing breast cancer in women in the U.S. who consume this infected milk. Ask an old dairy farmer or vet what bovine leukemia virus is. It causes breast (utter) cancer in cows and it does in human females. The 2nd concern is that cow milk products may have higher levels of rBGH, which increases milk production in the cow by 30 percent when she is injected with this synthetic milk producing hormone. This cuases the cow to be physically stressed, she gets sick more often and has to be on antibiotics more often, with the likelyhood of antibiotics and pus in milk, now you have a growth hormone that will increase the breast cancer tumor growth that was caused by the bovine leukemia virus contracted by drinking milk-\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n-18 +19 -37 lexi swizdor May. 19, 2011\n\"Milk, we really dont need, doctors and others have conclude that even a TACO can have as much calcium, and minerals to the average glass of milk, because of the cheese, there are many others, and we are also wasting plastic because of milk jugs.....\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n-19 +8 -27 Mike Aug. 2, 2011\n\"My good people, take a minute and think.

As with anything else, if it is consumed in excessive amounts then it could create some problems, but milk is a wonderful source of calcium. If someone is worried about possible fats in the milk, they should drink skim milk. Children need the healthy fats in milk to develop their brains, especially at a young age, and the proteins provided in milk are not as easily found elsewhere. Also, if the concern is that a child will become overweight due to drinking too much milk, it is almost certainly because of other poor choices of diet, not because of the milk itself. It has been tested and confirmed that children who drink soda in place of milk are at a much higher risk of becoming obese, but that those who drink milk have higher calcium and stronger bones. Another point to observe is that milk provides about 13% of the daily value of Vitamin B12, which is an essential vitamin that carries oxygen to the muscles. This is especially important to remember when considering exercising and physical labor. Whether doing aerobic workouts (such as biking and running) or pushing a wheelbarrow of cement for a construction job, oxygen and strong muscles are needed, and milk can provide the necessary nutrients.\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+3 +4 -1 lanty jones Mar. 8, 2012\n\"i think milk is good for us bc i have never broke a bone in my whole life and i love milk i have 4 people at home and we drink 4 things of milk!! milk is goin to make u strong!!! dont stop drinking milk\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+3 +4 -1 Curtis Feb. 16, 2012\n\"Milk is benificial, it gives me the calcium I need.

Cow's milk has been shown to contain large amounts of both Saturated and Regular Fat. This can be very dangerous to obese people or a person of ANY size.\n2.) Milk is harvested very badly. They inject hormones into the cows so that they produce milk all the time. This leads to a large quantity of the chemical Lactose. This chemical can prove to make people bloat, break out on hives, itch, Have pains in their stomach and sometimes throw up. Studies have also shown that the RBSt hormones can cause strange thing sto happen in young adults. The hormones cause girls to have periods earlier( 7- 9) and to cause puberty a lot earlier\n3.) Milk has been shown to have great potential to carry salmonella in it. Although milk may be pasteurized, it has a short shelf life even when refrigerated causing it to rot a lot faster and make us more prone to catching the bacteria outside the utters of the cow itself.\nSo, before you grab another milk carton, be sure to now how they make the product you're about to consume\n:-)\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+1 +1 0 A DVM Student Apr. 22, 2012\n\"Lactose is constant in milk, approximately 4.7% of milk and is the osmotic regulator in milk production (milk is 87% water after all). If a cow makes more milk, she does make a greater quantity of lactose. However, this is diluted back to the 4.7% found in milk because it draws water out with it. Therefore, whether you are drinking milk from a cow that makes 20 lbs or 200 lbs, you are consuming the same amount of lactose because the percent never changes (unless you plan on drinking all of the 200 lb cows milk in one sitting). Anything in excess can be harmful, including the excessive estrogens found in plants. If people are lactose intolerant, they should avoid the sugar. In addition, rbST has been injected directly into humans bloodstream back in the 50's with no adverse results. Thats why rbST has a 'b' in it because it is biologically active in cows and not humans. There have been thousands of studies performed on rbST, and there is no negative results associated with the hormone (which is naturally found in a cows circulation). Early puberty is a function of the increased plane of nutrition America is at, since puberty onset is a function of fatness and energy reserves.

There was a time when it was considered very desirable, but research has forced us to rethink this recommendation... Dairy products contribute to a surprising number of health problems. They can impair a child's ability to absorb iron and in very small children can even cause subtle blood loss from the digestive tract. Combined with the fact that milk has virtually no iron of its own, the result is an increased risk of iron deficiency...\nCow's milk proteins are a common cause of colic, and now the American Academy of Pediatrics has concluded that there is evidence that cow's milk may well contribute to childhood-onset diabetes.

Even organic cow\u2019s milk, which does not contain artificial hormones, does contain naturally occurring hormones. The combination of nutrients found in both organic and non-organic cow\u2019s milk increases our own production of some types of hormones. These hormones have been shown to increase the risk of some forms of cancer.

As with anything else, if it is consumed in excessive amounts then it could create some problems, but milk is a wonderful source of calcium. If someone is worried about possible fats in the milk, they should drink skim milk. Children need the healthy fats in milk to develop their brains, especially at a young age, and the proteins provided in milk are not as easily found elsewhere. Also, if the concern is that a child will become overweight due to drinking too much milk, it is almost certainly because of other poor choices of diet, not because of the milk itself. It has been tested and confirmed that children who drink soda in place of milk are at a much higher risk of becoming obese, but that those who drink milk have higher calcium and stronger bones. Another point to observe is that milk provides about 13% of the daily value of Vitamin B12, which is an essential vitamin that carries oxygen to the muscles. This is especially important to remember when considering exercising and physical labor. Whether doing aerobic workouts (such as biking and running) or pushing a wheelbarrow of cement for a construction job, oxygen and strong muscles are needed, and milk can provide the necessary nutrients.\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+3 +4 -1 lanty jones Mar. 8, 2012\n\"i think milk is good for us bc i have never broke a bone in my whole life and i love milk i have 4 people at home and we drink 4 things of milk!! milk is goin to make u strong!!! dont stop drinking milk\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+3 +4 -1 Curtis Feb. 16, 2012\n\"Milk is benificial, it gives me the calcium I need.

Cow's milk has been shown to contain large amounts of both Saturated and Regular Fat. This can be very dangerous to obese people or a person of ANY size.\n2.) Milk is harvested very badly. They inject hormones into the cows so that they produce milk all the time. This leads to a large quantity of the chemical Lactose. This chemical can prove to make people bloat, break out on hives, itch, Have pains in their stomach and sometimes throw up. Studies have also shown that the RBSt hormones can cause strange thing sto happen in young adults. The hormones cause girls to have periods earlier( 7- 9) and to cause puberty a lot earlier\n3.) Milk has been shown to have great potential to carry salmonella in it. Although milk may be pasteurized, it has a short shelf life even when refrigerated causing it to rot a lot faster and make us more prone to catching the bacteria outside the utters of the cow itself.\nSo, before you grab another milk carton, be sure to now how they make the product you're about to consume\n:-)\"\nType your reply comment here - max. 1,250 characters (about 200 words)\n1250 characters left\nOne or more fields are incomplete or incorrect.\nSubmit Reply\n+1 +1 0 A DVM Student Apr. 22, 2012\n\"Lactose is constant in milk, approximately 4.7% of milk and is the osmotic regulator in milk production (milk is 87% water after all). If a cow makes more milk, she does make a greater quantity of lactose. However, this is diluted back to the 4.7% found in milk because it draws water out with it. Therefore, whether you are drinking milk from a cow that makes 20 lbs or 200 lbs, you are consuming the same amount of lactose because the percent never changes (unless you plan on drinking all of the 200 lb cows milk in one sitting). Anything in excess can be harmful, including the excessive estrogens found in plants. If people are lactose intolerant, they should avoid the sugar. In addition, rbST has been injected directly into humans bloodstream back in the 50's with no adverse results. Thats why rbST has a 'b' in it because it is biologically active in cows and not humans. There have been thousands of studies performed on rbST, and there is no negative results associated with the hormone (which is naturally found in a cows circulation). Early puberty is a function of the increased plane of nutrition America is at, since puberty onset is a function of fatness and energy reserves.

Ask an old dairy farmer or vet what bovine leukemia virus is. It causes breast (utter) cancer in cows and it does in human females. The 2nd concern is that cow milk products may have higher levels of rBGH, which increases milk production in the cow by 30 percent when she is injected with this synthetic milk producing hormone.

The <em>milk</em> of Malawi <em>goats</em> <em>is</em> of very high quality for human nutrition.", "explanation": null, "document": "Increased Milk Production in Native Goats\nImproving human welfare\nfrom milk from Malawi native goats\nBackground\nMalnutrition in parts of Malawi (and in many other tropical areas) affects as many as 70 per cent of children. The children mainly affected are those who have been breast fed and then transferred to a diet that consists almost entirely of maize meal. Continuing to provide milk - with its high quality protein, mineral and energy contents - to young children would make significant contributions to reducing the incidence of malnutrition.\nGoat milk is extracted for human consumption in many parts of the world. This is not, however, a common practice in Sub-Saharan Africa especially in communities that are mainly agricultural or practice a mixed crop/livestock system of production.\nRelated Tools\nWho?\nTargeted at ...\nThe technology is aimed primarily at smallholder mixed farmers with young children as part of the household. Secondarily the technology is directed to agricultural, livestock and veterinary extension and other advisory personnel (public and private sectors including NGOs). Primary health care workers in human health could also be targeted and encouraged to promote the technology to mothers during ante and post natal discussions and treatments. .\nWhen?\nThe tool can be used at all times of the year (as goats are largely non-seasonal breeders and produce young throughout the year) by families with young children.\nWhere?\nAreas of the tropics with semiarid to (mainly) subhumid climates where mixed crop/livestock farming is practised and where there are no local inhibitions or taboos on the use of goat milk for human consumption are most likely to see widespread and successful uptake of the recommended technology.\nMethods\nThese ideas are aimed at increasing milk production in native goats whilst taking care that there are no or only minor adverse effects on other aspects of production by the goat itself. These aspects include:\nNo reduced reproductive performance (from delayed onset of oestrus after parturition or reduced kidding rates from a smaller proportion of multiple births),\nNo increased mortality of kids (which in most cases is probably already high) or breeding goats, and\nNo adverse effects on kid growth rates.\nHigher milk yields are achieved through providing maize bran as a supplement to the natural feed resources. In the trial that was the basis of this tool maize bran was offered at an amount of approximately 250 g (or about one double handful) per breeding female per day during the course of her lactation.\nResources Required\nThe tool should be used at least initially only by families who already own and are familiar with goats and goat production. An assured supply (preferably from within the household) of maize and/or maize bran is needed for supplementary feeding of the goats.\nSupport\nSome support will normally be required from public and private advisory services in order to ensure the technology is correctly transferred and properly used. The extension personnel themselves will need to be trained in the technology. If primary health care workers are also to be included in creating awareness of the use and benefits of the technology they will also need to be included in a training programme.\nCosts\nAdditional financial costs are likely to be small. There may be a need for housing that is somewhat better than the traditional system. In the trial that formed the basis for the development of this tool special and probably rather expensive and perhaps overelaborate sheds were constructed of gum (Eucalyptus) poles, corrugated iron sheeting and chain link fencing. It should certainly be possible to find and use lower cost local alternatives for the corrugated iron and chain link (such as thatch for the roof and woven grass mats for the sides). The main costs are almost certainly going to be non financial and might involve improved or adapted management including separation of kids from dams (best done overnight) to allow milk to accumulate in the udder. More time will also need to be spent with animals in preparation and provision of supplementary feed and in the actual milking of the animal. As farmers do place an intrinsic value on their time it is important to ensure that the perceived benefits assume dominance over the perceived inconveniences.\nBenefits\nThe basal benefits are a daily milk \"yield\" (that is milk offtake for human consumption) that is higher for supplemented than for unsupplemented animals as well as a longer lactation (in the Malawi trial lactation length increased from 117 days for animals not receiving supplementation to 147 days for those that did receive maize bran as a supplement). None of the performance traits of dams and kids already enumerated in the \"Methods\" section were adversely affected as a result of taking milk from the dams. These benefits are immediate and obvious and there is no reason they should not be sustainable.\nThe benefits to child health and welfare were not studied in the Malawi trial. There is, however, more than sufficient evidence from multiple sources that a better diet that includes milk and milk products has beneficial effects on the physical and mental health of young children. The milk of Malawi goats is of very high quality for human nutrition. An amount of 200 ml provides 10 g protein, 13 g fat and 250 mg calcium. Fed to young children this would go a long way towards providing their daily requirements of these important elements of the diet.\nRisks\nThere appear to be few risks associated with the use of the technology. It should be noted, however, that the mineral composition of goat milk is not suitable for very young babies of less than one year old although as most are still suckling their mothers up to this age the risk is reduced.\nAlternatives\nThere are few or no low cost alternatives. Most smallholder do not keep cattle and the cost of purchase of milk or of milk substitutes or replacements is likely to be too high for most families in the target group.\nImpacts\nPositive and negative impacts have been covered in the preceding sections.\nPolicy Implications\nImproved nutrition of goats as an intermediate step in the improved nutrition and welfare of young children should form part of the policy of national, regional and district administrations.\nResearch Findings\nIf the milk taken from indigenous does is to be useful then daily production needs to be in excess of 150ml. The compositional quality of this milk has been shown to be high with 53g protein/kg. Two hundred millilitres can thus provide a child with over 109 high quality protein (50% of RDA) as well as valuable amounts of Calcium and Vitamin A. In these trials supplemented animals sustained these production levels for an average of 20 weeks in 1993-94 and 12 weeks in 1994. The lower production of unsupplemented animals would still make a contribution to the diets of small children but would be unlikely to justify the effort involved.\nHowever, any such production will only be acceptable if it does not prejudice other outputs and outcomes. Where does were milked but not supplemented kidding was 130%. This figure is not high, in view of the perception of the goat as a fecund animal, but it is better than the 109% reported by Reynolds (1979) and the 107% of Karua (1988). It is clear that supplementation in the period leading up to service improved ovulation rate and hence litter size, as would be expected. Kid mortality is clearly a potential problem, though variations between years have been shown to be considerable. Of the 5 years covered, four have not produced any treatment effects. Over that period overall kid mortality has averaged 38%. The 60% mortality experienced in kids from milked does in 1993 was thus both distressing and unexpected and the outbreak of bacterial scour aside, not easily explained. In terms of growth the 9.18+/-1:1.64 kg at 18 weeks attained by those surviving to that age was higher than those attained in the earlier trials and in line with those reported by Renolds (1979), for kids from unmilked does, which averaged 8.2+/-2.0kg at 12 wks and 11.9+/-2.7kg at 24 weeks. Malnutrition does not therefore appear to have been a problem, in surviving kids at least!\nIt is normally expected that lactating females lose weight in early lactation and this weight loss may be associated with delays in re-establishment of oestrus and/or poor conception rates, especially if it exceeds 5% of bodyweight. All three trial groups lost weight, as expected, but losses were within the acceptable range and did not affect subsequent reproductive performance. It is therefore suggested that the hand-milking of does is a practice which may be undertaken without detriment to the doe or to her production. It is clear, however that kid mortality may be substantial and that the benefits of having milk available will need to be weighed against these potential losses. Nonetheless, it is accepted that, despite attempts to mirror subsistence farming conditions, it is possible that in a genuine village situation the impact of the strategy might be greater. It is considered desirable that an evaluation of the technique be carried out under village conditions. Further, given that the routine, daily milking of does with very small teats might be considered tedious, such an evaluation would allow evaluation of the acceptability of the technique and the likelihood of its uptake. In view of the intention to make any milk produced available to the younger children in a family, it is desirable that the woman of the house be the main participant in any such trial.\nReferences and Further Reading\nReynolds L. 1979.

State dairy regulators, also concerned about the health risks, enforce strict rules on raw-milk producers and sellers and are cracking down on illegal practices.\nadvertisement\nStill, consumer demand is brisk. Nationally and in Arizona, people are breaking the law to get their hands on raw organic milk, claiming it is superior in health and taste to the pasteurized, homogenized milk found on the supermarket shelf. They swear it tastes like melted vanilla ice cream.\n\"It's like heroin right now,\" said Tony Spaltro, a night manager at Gentle Strength Co-Op in Tempe, one of the few places Arizona consumers can purchase raw milk.\nState raises barriers\nIt's legal to sell raw milk or raw organic milk in Arizona with a state permit, according to Dart Easterday, an administrator who oversees dairy licensing for the Arizona Department of Agriculture.\nThe milk must be certified Grade A raw milk, and it is required to meet the same health standards as pasteurized milk. But to be sold in Arizona legally, raw milk must be produced and bottled in the state. The vast majority of Arizona's dairy farmers are members of the United Dairymen of Arizona, which oversees its members' milk sales and does not allow the sale of raw milk to consumers.\nArizona currently only has one legal raw-milk producer, Meadowayne, which is in Colorado City on Arizona's northwestern line with Utah. It is not a member of the Dairymen.\nMeadowayne raw milk, which is not organic, is sold at Tempe's Gentle Strength Co-Op for $9.49 a gallon. There is no organic raw milk now legally available in Arizona for sale for human consumption.\nWith both raw and raw organic milk, there is nothing done to the milk between the time it leaves the cow and the time it is sealed into a bottle. However, with raw organic milk, the cows are not given hormones and they get a special organic feed, which supporters say makes for healthier milk.\nHoping for health cure\nDiehards passionate about organic raw milk's health benefits are willing to break the law and pay up to $15 a gallon for it. Some ship it in, others fill their cars with coolers and head to California to stock up at Organic Pastures, the only retail-approved raw organic dairy in the United States.\nInjy Tawa, 43, of Scottsdale, is a black-market buyer. She orders Organic Pastures milk through an underground group of devotees in hopes that a raw diet will help rid her body of breast cancer.\nAfter being diagnosed with a malignant tumor, Tawa skipped the traditional route of chemotherapy and radiation in favor of an all-raw diet. And she said she feels great.\n\"They wanted to pump me full of poison and cut my breast off,\" Tawa said. \"I've got cancer, but I'm not going to die for it. There are people out there who have cured their own cancer this way.\"\nMark McAfee owns Organic Pastures. It's a $4 million company, he said, complete with its own landing strip for parched milk hunters on the move.\n\"It's a reality that people have had their taste of raw milk and they want it,\" McAfee said.\nOrganic Pastures began making illegal weekly deliveries to black-market buyers clubs in Arizona after the United Dairymen of Arizona shut down Cr\u00e8me de la Moo, the state's only raw organic dairy, in March for selling raw milk to consumers. \"The dairy industry doesn't really have us on their radar screen right now,\" McAfee said.\nRisky choice to sip\nSpaltro, Gentle Strength's night manager, tried raw milk after his customers recommended it. He researched its heralded health benefits and was sold.\n\"A lot of the good enzymes are destroyed in pasteurization,\" he said. \"And I like the way it tastes. It tastes better.\"\nRaw-milk fans credit the beverage as the cure for everything from allergies and asthma to eczema and cancer. However, Mesa physician Gary Knighton doesn't think raw milk is a good idea.\n\"If you don't go through pasteurization, it really puts you at risk for disease,\" Knighton said. \"If somebody wanted to go organic, that's great, but you can't put yourself at risk. People are trying to make (raw milk) this year's snake oil.\"\nNot 'worth the risk'\nKeith Murfield, chief executive of the United Dairymen of Arizona, said individuals have the right to choose to drink raw milk, but his organization has the right not to sell it.\n\"I just don't see that it's worth the risk to sell raw milk,\" Murfield said.\nDairy products can be guaranteed to be safe only if they are pasteurized, he said.\nAccording to the FDA, 300 people got sick from eating or drinking raw-milk products in the United States in 2001, and 200 became ill in 2002.\nCr\u00e8me de la Moo, owned by Judi Dawn von Schleifer, bottled raw organic milk in Queen Creek and distributed it to stores like Sprouts for about three weeks before being shut down. Farmer Phil Roberts, a then-member of the United Dairymen of Arizona, provided the milk to Cr\u00e8me de la Moo.\nRoberts, 42, said he thinks the old-school mentality among Dairymen board members has spread unwarranted fear of health risks. He said he thinks old-timers may have been jealous that he could sell his milk for $10 a gallon.\n\"A lot of them really didn't like the fact that I did it, because they thought organic milk made their milk look bad,\" Roberts said.\nDealers denied\nThe challenges of getting raw milk to consumers legally have soured Sprouts on carrying it at all.\n\"We've given up on raw milk,\" said Steve Fernandes, director of dairy, deli and bakery for the Valley's 10 Sprouts locations. \"It seems like there's always some kind of problem.\"\nIf it isn't distributing issues or labeling problems, it's the cost. Suppliers are here one day and gone the next, making the industry too unstable in invest in, Fernandes said.\nGentle Strength Co-op orders at least 20 gallons and 12 half-gallons of raw milk a week from Colorado City's Meadowayne. When it runs out, it's the most requested item in the store, said Noah Johnson-Greenough, a buyer for the store.\nGentle Strength would like to sell raw organic milk, but the Department of Agriculture would allow it to sell Organic Pastures milk only if it dyed it blue and labeled it, \"For pet consumption only.\"\nShoppers snatched up shelves of Cr\u00e8me de la Moo's organic raw milk products before the Dairymen shut them down, Johnson-Greenough said.\n\"It's really unfortunate that the Dairymen were being (so stubborn),\" he said.\nMurfield says the Dairymen never agreed to allow any of its members, including Phil Roberts, to sell raw milk as a consumer product. It happened for a few weeks because of confusion about the rules, he said.\n\"We just don't want the liability,\" he said.\nBut he admitted that he was surprised by the strong reactions of raw-milk drinkers after the Dairymen shut down Cr\u00e8me de la Moo. There were lots of nasty letters and name calling, he said.\n\"We didn't mean to make this a big turmoil,\" he said. \"If people want to do it, they should buy their own cow.\"\nUdderly illegal\nBut in some cases, that's not legal, either.\nTucson farmer Shelby Brawley had profits in mind when she started a cow-share program.\nBrawley and a group of Tucson residents who wanted raw milk set it up, each chipping in $50 bucks to buy one $1,000 cow, and taking home as much raw milk as they wanted.\nShe had read about cow-share programs in other states and thought it was legal in Arizona.\nBut it isn't.\n\"The state will tell you it is legal to sell raw in Arizona, provided you are a Grade A, state-certified dairy,\" she said.\n\"But then it is almost impossible, especially for a small farmer with a couple of cows or goats, to comply and jump through enough hoops to actually do it.\"\nEasterday said the Department of Agriculture has shut down three cow-share programs throughout the state in the past 10 months.\n'Changed their life'\nDespite the strict regulations, Arizona organic raw milk lovers could soon be relieved of resorting to sneaky milk meetings and stealthy distribution. Local organic raw milk is expected to be back in action soon.\nNo longer dairy farming, Roberts said he plans to restart his organic operation once his no-compete member agreement with the Dairymen expires in early 2008.\n\"There's a whole group of people out there who really believe raw milk has changed their life,\" he said.\nCr\u00e8me de la Moo has plans to get going again in the near future.\nBut owner Judi Dawn von Schleifer did not want to publicize details given what happened with the Dairymen last time.\n'Huge response'\nDespite the \"huge response\" her milk received during its brief shelf life, von Schleifer fears that the Dairymen will put a stop to her plans if too much attention is brought to them.\n\"It's only going to stir up trouble magnifying the problem, making us a target and preventing us from getting an organic raw-dairy operation up and going again,\" she said in an e-mail.\nJack Kurtz/The Arizona Republic\nThis is Barbie the cow, at the home of former organic dairy farmer Phil Roberts south of Gilbert.\nlisten in\n"}, {"score": 2061.5151, "uuid": "7e803643-c7dd-5e69-a53a-e1549223f315", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-43-32981", "target_hostname": "candleandsoap.about.com", "target_uri": "http://candleandsoap.about.com/od/bookproductreviews/gr/milkbasedsoaps.htm", "page_rank": 1.2722349e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Milk</em> Based Soaps by Casey Makela - <em>Goat</em> <em>Cow</em> Coconut Buttermilk Soaps", "snippet": ". * <em>Milk</em> Soap with Heavy Whipping Cream - How to Make Soap with Cream <em>Milk</em> <em>Milk</em> Based Soaps by Casey Makela - <em>Goat</em> <em>Cow</em> Coconut Buttermilk Soaps", "explanation": null, "document": "Free Candle & Soap Making Newsletter!\nSign Up\nMilk-Based Soaps by Casey\u00a0Makela\nAbout.com Rating 3.5 Star Rating\nBy David Fisher ,\u00a0About.com Guide\nFiled In:\nMilk-Based Soaps by Casey Makela\nStorey Publishing\nThe Bottom Line\nIf you want to learn more about making soaps with milks - and why soaps with milks are beneficial for your skin, this is a great book.

W. Haenlein Cooperative Extension Dairy Specialist University of Delaware\nSUMMARY\nThe composition of ewe and goat milks varies over a wide range because of genetic differences between species, between breeds within species and within breeds. These genetic differences have considerable influences on the cheese-making process and on human digestion of these milks. Furthermore, the stage of lactation, daily variation, season, parity, type of diet, physiological status, health of the udder and processing procedures change the contents and levels of major and minor constituents in the milks and its products. This provides, therefore, considerable potential to tailor-make ewe and goat milks according to the needs and preferences of consumers, and to provide an alternative to cow's milk, where this is economically or medically advantageous. But more research documentation is needed in this area.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this paper is to focus on properties and attributes of the milk and dairy products from ewes and goats as they contribute to human nutrition.\nThe composition of the milk of ewes and goats and factors affecting it has been reviewed comprehensively (Parkash & Jenness, 1968; Jenness, 1980; Anifantakis, 1986; Juarez & Ramos, 1986). Further important contributions have been published by Anifantakis et al. (1980), Merin et al. (1988), Casoli et al. (1989), Voutsinas et al. (1990), Espie & Mullan (1990), Simos et. al. (1991), Haenlein (1992), Peeters, et al. (1992), Park (1992; 1994), Sakul & Boylan (1992), Agnihotri & Prasad (1993), Bindal & Wadhwa (1993), Quiles et al. (1994), O'Connor (1994), Kalantzopoulos (1994) among others. However, only a few deal with the relation to human nutritional needs, which has been pointed out by Charlet (1981) \"...the variation of composition of milk has not received the attention it deserves, except by a few workers\". This is still largely true today and a 1st World Congress of Dairy Products in Human Health and Nutrition gave ewe and goat milk no recognition and deserved coverage, when it was held in Spain in 1993 (Serrano Rios et al., 1994).\nInterest in the original properties of milk, as it comes from the farm, should be high, when it is consumed as fluid whole milk, partly skimmed or as yogurt. Dairy products, mainly cheeses (except those made from whey) contain only the casein and fat fractions of milk, but no whey proteins, nor lactose and soluble minerals, so interest may be limited here to the original composition of casein and fat only, and changes during cheese fermentation. Ewe milk, depending on region and economic conditions, is mostly processed into cheeses and yogurt. Goat milk on the other hand, in some countries, is consumed as fluid milk, even on a commercial basis, besides being processed into dairy products. Therefore, the characteristics of all components of goat milk are of considerable market interest.\nInterest in the nutritive value of ewe milk is concerned mostly with the yield and evaluation of its cheeses and yogurt. Interest in the nutritive value of goat milk includes all fractions and how they may differ from those in the milk of other species. In order to sell goat and ewe milks and their products for human consumption, their needs and tastes, it is of considerable market advantage to know the factors that cause milk composition to vary and to what extend. This will be even more important in the future, when it becomes better known how to change original farm milk composition by manipulating e.g. the feeding of goats and ewes in order to tailor-make milk to the needs of diet conscious and disease afflicted consumers and their children, and to satisfy consumers with higher incomes, who have developed a sophisticated connoisseur taste for goat and ewe milk products.\nEwe and goat milk has considerable economic importance in some countries. The Mediterranean region produces 66 percent of the world's ewe milk ( Table 1 ) and 18 percent of the world's goats milk ( Table 2 ) (FAO, 1994). Of all milk produced by cows, buffaloes, ewes and goats combined, ewe milk makes up 1.5 percent and goat milk 2.0 percent of the world total, but in the Mediterranean region it is 11.7 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively. In at least 7 countries, including Greece, ewe milk or goat milk is more than 20 percent of all milk produced; and in at least 10 countries the combined production of ewe and goat milk is more than 20 percent of all milk in that country ( Table 3 and 4) (FAO, 1994). Some countries, including Greece, have more than 1 ewe and goat combined per person ( Table 3 ) and at least half of the countries with leading ewe and goat populations have more than 1 ewe and goat combined per hectare permanent pasture land, again Greece included.\nThe significance of ewe and goat milk for human nutrition in these countries varies widely ( Table 4 ) from less than 5 kg all milk per person per year to more than 450 kg, assuming that the FAO statistics, which are very difficult to obtain in some countries, approximate the real conditions. The food supply for protein or calcium from all animal sources, including milk and dairy products, also varies greatly between these countries ( Table 4 ), and averages in many countries far below the minimum daily requirements of 65 g protein and 800 mg calcium (NRC, 1968). This gives much support to the contention that improved ewe and goat milk production is one of the best strategies to relieve human starvation, undernutrition and malnutrition and therefore has great market growth potential, incentive and justification, especially in areas where pasture conditions, climate, mountainous terrain and economic conditions favor small ruminants.\nThe market of ewe and goat milks and their products has essentially three aspects:\nhome consumption and self-sufficiency,\ngourmet menus and natural foods preference,\nmedical needs.\nKnowledge of the nutritive values of ewe and goat milks, what causes them to be different or to change, and comparison with cow's and human milks will help each of these markets. Some evidence from recent research with ewes and goats comprises this review.\nFACTORS AFFECTING MILK COMPOSITION\nGENETICS\nAverage genetic composition differences between species, ewe versus goat versus cow, and compared to human milk are considerable (Posati & Orr, 1976) in absolute and relative terms (Table 5 , 6 ). Ewe milk is generally much higher in solids contents than goat, cow's or human milks, but composition categories and contents of individual minerals, fatty acids and amino acids vary in different directions between the species, and without relation to higher or lower solids contents. The high solids content of ewe milk makes it generally superior to goat or cow milk for processing into cheese and yogurt, because of higher yield and firmer processing quality without additives. However, this must be balanced in economic terms against lactation milk yield and lactation length of milking ewes, which is much less and shorter than for goats or cows. Nevertheless, published average data of milk of different species have to be used with caution, because within each species there are great genetic differences due to breeds and selected families, which can be used to market advantage.\nGenetic differences in milk composition within species have a wide range for ewe milk fat from 4.6 percent to 12.6 percent (Casoli et al., 1989) and an average of 7.1 percent (Anifantakis, 1986); for ewe milk protein from 4.8 to 7.2 percent and an average of 5.7 percent, depending on breed. Other components follow these ranges. It must be emphasized that cow's milks, when ewe or goat milks are compared with them, also have a wide composition range due to breeds, e.g. average Holstein milk fat at 3.4 percent versus average Jersey milk fat at 5.1 percent, and milk protein from 3.3 percent to 3.9 percent (Anifantakis, 1986), besides other breeds. Goat milk composition likewise can have great differences, depending on breed, e.g. for milk fat from 2.3 percent to 6.9 percent (Juarez, 1986) and an average of 3.3 percent; for goat milk protein from 2.2 percent to 5.1 percent and an average of 3.4 percent. A major portion of this variation includes negative correlations between milk yield and composition, i.e. low yields have higher contents and vice versa.\nWithin species within breed one can identify through selective breeding considerable differences in milk composition. This includes genetic polymorphisms of milk proteins, which have commercial importance in cheese making, because they influence rennetability, cheese yield and flavor (Remeuf & Lenoir, 1986; Martin, 1993; Chianese et al., 1993; Heil & Dumont, 1993; Kalantzopoulos, 1994), and which have potential but yet poorly understood values in human nutrition (Haenlein, 1991). Genetic polymorphisms of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-s-1-, beta- and kappa-casein affect firmness and viscosity of yogurt, rennet coagulation time, curd syneresis, heat stability, contents of casein, total solids, phosphorus and pH. Amino acid substitutions have been identified for the DNA sequences of caprine, ovine and bovine milk protein genes (Martin, 1993; Folch et al., 1994) and have been related to the different behavior of milk proteins in processing.\nSome goat milk has low casein contents and unsatisfactory rennet coagulation ability, which affects cheese yield (Remeuf & Lenoir, 1986; Ambrosoli et al., 1988). Goat milk casein has the same four proteins, alpha-s-1, alpha-s-2, beta and kappa, as cow's milk casein, but genetic differences by breeds and individuals in alpha-s-1 casein range quantitatively from zero or \"null type\" ( O ) to \"low types\" ( F, D ) and \"very high types\" ( A, B, C ), with intermediate classes ( E ). Some goat and sheep breeds differ significantly in the frequencies of the polymorphic loci of milk protein types (Jordana et al., 1995) (Table 7), with considerable processing and nutritional consequences. Low alpha-s-1 casein types of goat milk have shorter coagulation time and weaker resistance to heat treatment than high types. Curd firmness at 30 minutes of high type milk is greater than that of low type milk. Contents of total solids, total proteins, casein and phosphorus are higher in high type milk and pH is lower. Longer coagulation time of high type goat milk is due to alpha-s-1-casein delaying curd formation by trapping calcium ions and withdrawing them from the proteolysis of kappa casein. High type has higher cheese yield, better curd firmness, which is associated with lower pH. Despite longer coagulation time, goat milk of the high alpha-s-1 casein type is more suitable for cheese making because of firmer curd, higher casein content, less intense goat flavor and smoother cheese texture, yet it may be that low type has the advantage in human digestion. Beta-casein types also affect cheese making properties of goat milk (Chianese et al., 1993) and alpha-s-1- and beta-casein loci need to be considered together in selection. Sheep's milk also has polymorphisms in its milk proteins, but this research is just beginning.\nAmino acid substitutions in milk proteins can also be responsible for flavor and its intensity (Rystad et al., 1990). The amino acid threonine is considered the most important precursor of acetaldehyde, which is the main volatile aroma compound in yogurt. The higher level of glycine in goat milk compared to other species milks may reduce acetaldehyde production from threonine by inhibiting the enzyme threonine aldolase. Ultrafiltration removal of glycine increased acetaldehyde production in goat milk. Addition of threonine resulted in increased acetaldehyde production in goat or cow's milk, but goat milk had less. Goat milk with added threonine had less production of lactic, more pyruvic, acetic and less orotic acids; and there are other amino acid differences between goat and cow's milk (Rystad et al., 1990).\nSTAGE OF LACTATION\nWithin species within breed it is the stage of lactation, regardless of species or breed that has the greatest influence on milk composition. Days in milk during lactation regressed on ewe milk component contents had coefficients up to 0.71 (Casoli et al., 1989). Many components in ewe or goat milk as in cow's milk, especially fat and protein, are high in colostrum in early lactation, much lower thereafter until they rise again markedly at the end of lactation, when yields are low (Anifantakis & Kandarakis, 1980). Fat contents in goat milk changed from 2.7 percent in mid-lactation to 4.6 percent during the last week 42 of lactation, protein contents from 3.0 percent to 4.2 percent (Voutsinas et al., 1990). Mineral contents also increased with stage of lactation, Ca from 135 to 150 mg/100 g; P from 99 to 122; Na from 50 to 56; Mg 13 to 15; except K decreased from 170 to 144; and citrate from 145 to 81 mg/100 g.\nDAILY VARIATION\nBetween morning and evening milkings on the same day the gross composition of milk may also change (Simos et al., 1991), which again may be confounded with milk yield levels, when the milking interval between evening and morning milking has more or less hours than between morning and evening milking. Fat contents of evening goat milk averaged 5.1 percent after 14 hours of milking interval, morning milk 5.3 percent after 10 hours, total protein contents were 3.54 percent versus 3.58 percent, and total solids were 13.94 percent versus 14.30 percent, respectively. In studies with milking intervals of 8 and 16 hours the differences were 0.39 percent fat and 0.05 percent protein, respectively (Merin et al., 1988).\nSEASON\nThere are also clear seasonal differences in milk composition of the major and minor components (Renner, 1982), but they are confounded with climate and diet effects. Winter climate can affect milk yields and composition, and both are negatively correlated. Winter feeding is providing usually different proportions and qualities of grazing, hays, silage and supplements, which influence milk composition considerably. Milk C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, C18:3 fatty acids have been found to increase in summer, while C4 to C16 fatty acids were reduced significantly. The seasonally limited production of ewe and goat milk has stimulated interest in overcoming this handicap by various means, including hormonal induction of lactation (Alifakiotis et al., 1980). Normal milk contents of fat, lactose, chloride, total solids, acidity and pH have been obtained.\nPARITY\nDifferences due to parity, number of lactation or age of animal can be significant in gross milk composition, but this is also confounded with milk yield levels (Casoli et al., 1989). Average fat contents of ewe milk changed linearly from 1st to 6th parity from 6.8 percent to 7.4 percent and total protein contents from 5.8 percent to 6.2 percent for the Massese breed in Italy. Parity seems to have little effect on contents of amino acids, fatty acids or minerals (Casoli et al., 1989).\nTYPE OF DIET AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS\nRegardless of genetics, the composition of the daily diet and its amount in relation to production requirements can cause significant changes in milk composition (Moran-Fehr, 1981; Haenlein, 1995). In general terms, 3 percent of bodyweight is a minimum requirement of daily dry matter intake for most goats, but high producers will need at least 5 percent. In order to cover nutrient needs of high production, the energy and protein density of the daily feed intake must increase, because of the limitation of the rumen in volume capacity. Roughages like grass, hay or silages are mostly low in energy and protein density because of high fiber and/or water contents. Starchy supplements like cereal grains or fats and fatty seeds from sunflowers or roasted soybeans increase the energy density of the daily diet, and oil meals increase the protein density. Goats and ewe like other ruminants require a daily minimum of long fiber in the diet to prevent acidotic rumen conditions, which lead to fatal parakeratosis and enterotoxemia, or at least to laminitis, significantly depressed milk fat contents, but also possibly increased milk protein contents (Merin et al., 1988).\nA more intensive feeding system can be appropriately devised with a complete diet of hay, silage and concentrates mixed together loose (TMR, Total Mixed Ration) or in a pelleted or cubed form (Cavani et al., 1991). This causes usually higher milk yields, changes in milk fat and protein contents and also different cheese making properties.\nEnergy shortage in the diet can change the fatty acid composition of milk fat towards more medium-chain fatty acids, while daily milk yield may decrease and fat content increase (Moran-Fehr, 1981). When grain concentrate supplementation makes up more than 50 percent of the daily dry matter intake by goats, decreased chewing, less rumination and a shortage of salivation of rumen contents occurs (Kawas et al., 1991). To prevent a decreased rumen pH, the feeding of buffers like sodium bicarbonate and magnesium oxide is beneficial. This has been shown in several studies, where yields were even increased while restoring milk fat contents to normal levels (Hadjipanayiotou, 1988). Increasing energy density by adding fat within narrow limits to the diet, can increase yield of milk, fat, total protein and casein contents (Moran-Fehr, 1981). Also the type of protein in the diet and its rumen degradability can affect milk yield, contents of fat, protein, and processing properties (Andrighetto & Bailoni, 1994).\nNutritional physiology and endocrine status of the animal affects milk yield and composition over short or longer time periods. This has been demonstrated for the effect of estrogens during estrus (Haenlein & Krauss, 1974). Somatotropin also will increase milk yield, milk fat content, short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids significantly, while decreasing milk protein percentage, long-chain fatty acids and net energy balance (Disenhaus et al., 1995).\nUDDER HEALTH\nA widely accepted rapid monitor of udder health is the somatic cell count in milk. However, milk secretion in goats is apocrine, while in cows it is merocrine, which explains why goat milk may have very high counts of somatic cells, especially in late lactation milk or in the last strippings of milk, without any relationship to mastitis (Park & Humphrey, 1986; Haenlein, 1993). In cow's milk it has been demonstrated that the relative and absolute casein content is related negatively to somatic cell counts (Haenlein, 1974). Generally, subclinical or clinical mastitic infections cause the milk contents of casein, lactose and cheese yields to decrease, milk serum albumin, immunoglobulins and salt (NaCl) contents to increase.\nPROCESSING\nEven before cheese precipitation from milk and the effects of fermenting of cheese, the various methods of processing, heating and freezing can have profound influences on milk composition. Heating is applied during pasteurization, UHT processing, condensing and powder production, which will denature milk proteins to varying degrees and affect flavors (O'Connor, 1994). Freezing is of economic interest because of the seasonal nature of goat and ewe milk production, and because these milks have greater economic importance than cow's milk in some countries (Kalantzopoulos, 1994) (Table 1 , 2 , 4 ). During frozen storage, oxidation of ewe milk occurred and free fatty acid contents increased because milk lipase was not completely inactivated (Anifantakis et al., 1980). Proteins and bacterial counts may remain stable, and taste and flavor scores do not change. In freezing of cheeses the pH and proteolysis may change (Fontecha et al., 1994). Fermentation during yogurt processing and cheese ripening also causes significant changes in the composition of the products due to proteolysis, lipolysis, glycolysis, development of flavor compounds and liberation of non-protein N-compounds, free amino acids, free fatty acids and ammonia as extensively documented by Anifantakis (1991) ( Table 8 ).\nCOMPARATIVE NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY\nWhen milk is consumed as it becomes available from the animal or if its composition is changed in production and processing, a principal question in the pediatric and popular literature is how adequate is that milk for infant or general human needs (Schrander et al., 1993; Andersson & Draussin, 1993; O'Connor, 1994). It must be understood that in general:\n(1) milk is the main and hard-to-replace source of dietary Ca in human nutrition regardless of whether it is from ewes, goats or cows;\n(2) milk was never meant to be an adequate source of some minerals like Fe or vitamins like C, B12, or folate, which are routinely and cheaply supplemented to daily infant diets from other sources anyway.\nWith that understanding, milk from ewes or goats can meet at least as well or better significant portions of the daily nutrient requirements of humans (Mack, 1953; Desjeux, 1993) ( Table 9 ). A typical serving size of milk is 1 cup with 245 ml content, which is used as a standard in the USA for comparison of nutrient intake (Gebhardt & Matthews, 1991; NRC, 1968). The minimum daily requirements of 800 mg calcium, not considering the higher needs of pregnant and lactating women or adolescents, are barely met by 3 cups of cow's milk, while goat milk covers this amply and of ewe milk only 2 cups would be required. The same is true for meeting the needs of essential amino acids, except for methionine, phenylalanine, magnesium, thiamine and niacin, as far as requirements are known. Of course, equivalent amounts of yogurt or cheese can be substituted for meeting nutrient needs with milk.\nUNIQUE NUTRITIONAL VALUES\nBeyond meeting daily nutrient requirements, it is of special interest that goat and ewe milks have unique properties, which distinguish them from cow's milk and make them a valuable alternative not just for infants but also for adults and especially nursing mothers (Baldo, 1984; Host et al., 1988; Razafindrakoto et al., 1993) (Figure 1). Growing interest in goat milk has produced some publications, which document unique nutritional values of goat milk compared to cow's milk (Mack, 1953; Kosikowski, 1985; Haenlein, 1992). Similar research about ewe milk properties is still needed (Steinkamp, 1995). The high solids content of ewe milk enables production of superior yogurt compared to cow's and most goat milks. In order to produce acceptable yogurt viscosity from cow's milk, firming agents or as much as 5 percent skim milk powder are usually added, which however can increase greatly the lactose content of yogurt to undesirable levels in view of today's' consumers' concern with lactose intolerance (Kosikowski, 1985).\nThe incidence of cow's milk allergy has been found to be about 8 percent or even more in 1-year old infants (Host et al., 1988), but goat milk can be a successful treatment in most cases of direct or indirect cow milk allergy (Walker, 1964; Brenneman, 1978; Grezesiak, 1989). Goat milk fed to undernourished infants or children with digestive malnutrition has been found to be at least equal or even a superior substitute to cow's milk (Hachelaf et al., 1993; Razafindrakoto et al., 1993) (Figure 1).\nA well-known difference for goat milk is the predominantly smaller size fat globule compared to cow's milk, which has been credited with easier digestion (Fevrier et al., 1993). Less well appreciated is the qualitative and quantitative difference in milk proteins of cow's versus goat milk, especially alpha-s-1-casein in goat milk with its softer curd formation compared to cow's milk (Ambrosoli et al., 1988). This may be the reason, why the popular literature is full of reports of benefits derived from better digestion of goat milk compared to cow's milk.\nAn especially interesting difference of ewe and goat milks compared to cow's milk is in their basic milk fat composition (Posati & Orr, 1976; Babayan, 1981) ( Table 5 ). Goat and ewe milk exceed cow's milk significantly in most short, medium chain, mono-unsaturated, poly-unsaturated and essential fatty acids (Table 5 and 6 ), which are valuable to today's health conscious consumer. Medium chain fatty acids (MCT) (C6 to C14), in particular have different human metabolic properties than long chain fatty acids. MCT, especially caprylic (C8:0) and capric (C10:0) have become accepted treatment for patients with malabsorption symptoms, a variety of metabolic disorders, cholesterol problems and infant malnutrition, because of their unique roles of providing energy to the human metabolism instead of lipids to adipose tissues, and because of their ability to limit and dissolve serum cholesterol (Kalser, 1971; Tantibhedhyangkul & Hashim, 1978). The contents of essential fatty acids also differ in ewe and goat milks compared to human milk, which could be of significance to nursing infants (Wright & Bolton, 1989; Jackson & Gibson, 1989) (Table 5 , 6 , 9 ). It has been found that mothers of infants with atopic eczema had an abnormal composition in their milk fatty acid profiles, especially concerning linolenic acid (C18:3). Also it has been found that commercial milk formulae do not contain sufficient amounts of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to cover the requirements of nursing infants. It can be predicted that the commercial natural foods and food supplements industry is soon focusing its efforts on the role of different fatty acids in human nutrition, and the goat and ewe milk industry may be well advised to join this market opportunity.\nCONCLUSION\nThe composition of ewe and goat milk in relation to human needs and in comparison to cow's milk needs much more research in order to document their unique values, to justify their existence and the higher cost of producing these milks compared to cow's milk (Kosikowski, 1985; Steinkamp, 1995). Besides the differences in milk proteins, which have commercial importance in cheese making and medical significance in digestion and allergies, the considerable differences in milk lipid composition have not been studied much in relation to human nutrition. Therefore, goat or ewe butter, ghee and related products, with their enriched concentration of MCT and other fatty acids, have considerable market potential (Hachelaf et al., 1993), and their unique roles in nutrition and medicine should be a thankful area for researchers to explore (Haenlein, 1992). To further establish the uniqueness of ewe and goat milks will go far in strengthening the small yet ancient dairy sheep and dairy goat industry not only in the Mediterranean countries but around the world.\nREFERENCES\nAgnihotri, M.K. & Prasad, V.S.S. 1993.

This will give you access to raw milk, which is absolutely the best way to get the best milk nutrition possible.\nMilk Nutrition and Cancer Link?\nIs there a possible link between milk nutrition and cancer?\nYes. Recent research is supporting the theory that consumption of milk is one of the possible answers to what causes cancer . It must be said though, that the milk used in these studies was not raw, unpasteurized milk from organic farms. Nor was coconut, almond or other alternative types of milk used in these studies.\nThere have been a few studies that show consuming milk is correlated to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. It is also a possible link or cause of prostate cancer. It is thought that prostate cancer risks are increased through calcium-related pathways.\nA conclusion reached in the October 2001 paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (\"Dairy Products, Calcium and Prostate Cancer Risk in the Physicians' Health Study\") was that the calcium in milk is associated with a greater risk of prostate cancer.\nHowever, another study in November 2006 done by scientists at the Harvard School of Public Health showed that there was only a modest elevation in the risk of ovarian cancer when consuming 3 servings of milk per day.\nHowever, these studies were NOT done on people who drank raw milk. That is important to understand.\nTo be fair, let's see what the FDA says about the dangers of using raw milk nutrition.\nDangers of Raw Milk?\nThis is what the FDA has to say about the dangers of raw milk:\n\"Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep or goats that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria\u2026which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses\u2026unpasteurized milk and products made from unpasteurized milk are sold and may be harmful to your health.\"\n~www.fda.gov\nYes, there are dangers in everything.\nBut it seems preposterous to me to believe that the FDA can do better than mother nature.\nJust look at the recent outbreaks of food borne illnesses from food that is FDA approved! The raw milk nutrition story is not fully disclosed behind their warnings.\nThis page is a must read to learn about how the FDA got involved with the pasteurization of milk: Milk History\nWe all choose our own path for becoming more cancer aware and choosing what becomes part of our daily diets. For me, the benefits of raw milk nutrition outweigh the purported benefits of pasteurized milk.\nIf you are interested in drinking raw milk, you will need to check with local farmers and purchase a \"herd share.\" In some states, it is still not legal to purchase raw milk so you need to do some research on it.\n...or click a button and go to:\nAlways consult your doctor regarding treatment options.\nThis site is for informational purposes only.\nCopyright 2010-2012 Cancer-Aware.com, Dipple WorldWide,LLC\nAll Rights Reserved\n"}, {"score": 2001.1605, "uuid": "1bb18094-ce02-5f5e-b8e4-a35de6976779", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0714wb-63-12171", "target_hostname": "www.thepmc.org", "target_uri": "http://www.thepmc.org/2011/04/got-milk/", "page_rank": 1.1846852e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Got <em>Milk</em>?", "snippet": "Although, Israel may have been referred to as the land of <em>milk</em> and honey, it may have been human <em>milk</em> and not necessarily <em>cow</em> <em>or</em> <em>goat</em> <em>milk</em>.

Certainly, human breast milk should be consumed by human babies and ideally up to about age of 2. There are very few women who do this, but it is the best that can be done for the child protecting him/her from overweight, allergies, etc, etc. However, when one reviews the history of the human race, there are very few cultures that have consumed cow dairy products. Although, Israel may have been referred to as the land of milk and honey, it may have been human milk and not necessarily cow or goat milk. There are several problems with cow milk.\nThe first is lactose and the vast majority of the world\u2019s population is lactose intolerant. I consumed milk for many years and seemed just fine until I found out my cholesterol was 280! Milk fat is better than meat fat for raising blood cholesterol, as proven in the Seven Country study many years ago. Now that I am off dairy products, I have become lactose intolerant which probably is a normal for most people. Acquired milk tolerance is probably the beginning of multiple disease states. In addition, dairy intake correlates with cancer of the ovaries, and most alternative practitioners believe that dairy products are the cause of ear, nose, throat, lung congestion such as ear infections, bronchitis, recurrent colds and sinusitis, and asthma. I cannot tell you how many of my patients cleared up those problems simply by discontinuing (not reducing!) dairy products.\nBy Eastern medicine, bunions are due to dairy intake and represent a problem with the uterus. I cannot tell you how many of my women patients with menstrual cramps, fibroids, inter- or heavy menstrual bleeding, ovarian cysts, chocolate cysts, endometriosis, etc. have cleared up or relieved their problem(s) or discomfort by discontinuing all dairy. By Eastern medicine, ice cream is a major cause of cancer of the prostate. Since breast and prostate are comparable organs, cancer of the breast may very well be a milk problem. Cataracts correlate with dairy intake. When people develop irritable bowel disease, relief commonly occurs with discontinuing all wheat, dairy, and soy.

He decided to add the cows to his growing menagerie of grass-fed animals anyway on his Five T Farms, in Franklin Furnace, Ohio.\nThankfully, the growing quintet \u2013 his sons Trenton, Trever, Travis, Traye, and Troy, for whom the farm is named \u2013 took to the milk, as has the general public.\n\u201cThey like it way better than store-bought milk now,\u201d said Otworth, who runs the farm with the help of his wife Jonda and the boys. \u201cWe go through about a gallon a day at our house.\u201d\nThe rest \u2013 about six gallons a day from two or three milking cows \u2013 the farmer sells through \u201cherd-shares.\u201d For an ownership portion of a cow, people who enjoy the taste and healthful benefits of rich, fresh milk from grass-fed, pastured dairy cattle can stop by the farm once a week to pick up a gallon of unpasteurized milk. That\u2019s because Ohio law forbids the sale of raw milk by state dairy farmers except to people who have an ownership stake in the herd.\nIn other words, to sample Otworth\u2019s cows\u2019 unprocessed milk, you agree to shoulder part of the cows\u2019 monthly boarding costs, which entitles you to a percentage of the cows\u2019 milk production for that month.\nNational trends play out in the Tri-State\nAcross the country, Americans are searching for direct-from-the-farm produce, meat and poultry, eggs and cheese, and other dairy products. Throughout the Tri-State, people like Cheryl Spriggs seek farm products that recall the superior taste and nutritional quality of the more natural foods they ate as children.\n\u201cI have been searching for raw milk in this area for years,\u201d said Spriggs, an Ashland resident who grew up with raw milk on the table every day. \u201cI wanted to experience it again and was pleasantly surprised to find the Otworths\u2019 herd-share program right in my own backyard.\u201d\nSpriggs is deeply committed to community gardening, community-supported agriculture, and other direct-from-the-farm initiatives that are cropping up (pardon the pun) in this area.\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthier to eat closer to the earth,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up that way, and I think it\u2019s a terrific way to support local farmers, such as the Otworths.\u201d\nSpriggs is not alone in her natural-food passion, but even most farmers don\u2019t want to take on the job of keeping a dairy cow, which requires milking twice a day.\nFor Jim and Cindy Yancy, who raise grass-fed livestock in Scioto County, it is simply easier to support the Otworths through herd-shares than it would be to keep and milk a cow of their own.\n\u201cWe stop by the farm twice a week for milk, which is probably the healthiest thing we eat,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cWe simply drop off the empty glass milk jug and pick up another.\u201d\nCindy also makes yogurt from the two gallons a week she brings home, and she freezes whatever is left over.\n\u201cSome people complain that raw milk from the farm is more expensive, but we feel fuller and more satisfied, so we snack less,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cI think, overall, I\u2019m saving at the grocery store, thanks to the milk.\u201d\nHusband Jim believes his joint pain has been significantly reduced since the couple began drinking the Otworths\u2019 raw milk about three months ago \u2013 and other aficionados make similar restorative claims for milk and other grass-fed farm products.\nIf you want to sample raw milk \u201cstraight from the farm,\u201d the ease of buying raw milk straight from the farm depends on the relevant agriculture regulations in your state.\nIn Ohio, consumers today must buy a share of the dairy herd to drink raw milk, which can cost as much as $12 a gallon according to the Wall Street Journal. Surrounding states offer other options. West Virginia currently outlaws the sale of raw milk to consumers, whereas Kentucky dairy farmers are not required to use a herd-share system to sell their raw milk directly to consumers.\nFamily photo: Dwight and Jonda Otworth bought Five T Farms in 1987. It\u2019s is named for the couple\u2019s five sons: Trenton, 19; Trever, 18; Travis, 13; Traye, 11; and Troy, 10.\nIn the wake of a multi-year legislative battle to keep raw milk available in Ohio, Dwight Otworth joined the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, which protects the rights of Ohio farmers to sell their products directly to consumers. After a 2006 ruling that established the legality of herd-shares, Otworth stepped into the dairy business to expand his back-to-organic efforts on several hundred acres of farmland along the Ohio River in Scioto County.\n\u201cMy farm isn\u2019t really a dairy farm per se,\u201d said Otworth, who still works in the construction industry to support the enterprise. \u201cWe also raise grass-fed hogs and beef cattle and sell eggs from pastured chickens because I want to raise and sell healthy products grown without chemicals.\u201d\nAfter purchasing his land in 1987, Otworth worked tirelessly to take the farm back to organic grain crops and livestock. By 2006, his 25-acre farm was certified organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a process that takes a minimum of three years. He also had his father\u2019s land, a farm of 113 acres adjacent to his own, certified organic, and he refrains from using chemicals on tillable acres he rents along Goose Creek.\n\u201cDirt is a living organism, or it should be,\u201d Otworth said. \u201cThe longer you go without chemicals, the better your milk and all of your other farm products will become.\u201d\nOtworth was moved to limit, then eliminate, chemical use when he saw his young sons playing out in the fields he and his father had just sprayed with insecticides and fertilizers.\nLiving on an organic farm is not an easy life, however. Controlling weeds is a challenge on chemical-free acres, and yields are lower until the soil recovers sufficiently \u2013 which is why organic products generally cost more than those grown on conventional farms. With limited output, Otworth sells primarily right at the farm and not at area farmers markets.\n\u201cThe water our poultry and livestock drink is clean and uncontaminated, and the dirt is finally returning to a good yield,\u201d he said. \u201cOur products are getting better and better.\u201d\nIn addition to raw milk, visitors to the farm can purchase eggs, whole-hog sausage, and grass-fed pork and beef. Any milk not sold is fed to the livestock, so nothing goes to waste. As the soil at Five T Farms continues to improve and consumer demand grows, Otworth will add grass-fed chickens and organic vegetables along with more dairy cows.\nIs a herd-share right for you?\n\u201cThey\u2019re not pets.\u201d Cows at the Five T Farms aren\u2019t named.\nIf you are interested in the healthful benefits of raw milk (see sidebar), you will pay a one-time share fee and monthly \u201cboarding\u201d fees for the right to buy and drink unprocessed milk.\nAt Five T Farms, members pay $50 for a full share or $25 for a half-share, a one-time fee with rights to the milk from a specific animal. Every month, a boarding fee of $26 entitles members to about four gallons of milk. Members who come to the farm from a distance usually take turns, as do those who split a share.\nAround the country, share fees range from $40 to $50, and boarding fees range from $20 to $30. Some herd-share programs involve the share members in semiannual \u201cshareholders meetings\u201d at the farm, and most require milk pick-up at the farm. Goat herd-shares are also available for those in search of raw goat\u2019s milk. In some regions of the country where demand outstrips supply, consumers may be placed on a waiting list for a herd-share.\nAt Five T Farms, milking is still a family affair accomplished by hand, and you can\u2019t get much more small-scale or \u201cnatural\u201d about your milk than that.\nAlthough there\u2019s a social benefit to knowing the farmer from whom you buy your milk, taste (which has been described as \u201clike melted French vanilla ice cream\u201d) and nutrition are the primary reasons people seek out direct-from-the-udder raw milk.\nAs Otworth sums it up, in his opinion, \u201cOrganic raw milk is the best way to go!\u201d\nWhat you should know\nIs raw milk healthful? Yes! People have been drinking raw milk since sheep and goats were domesticated in the Ancient Near East approximately 9,000 years ago, largely without harm. But pasteurization \u2013 a commercial practice since the late 19th century \u2013 is now the norm.\nRaw milk is a nutrition-rich food full of healthful fats and proteins. But, if not handled properly, it can spoil quickly and harbor disease-causing pathogens such as E. coli, salmonella, and listeria.\nUnfortunately for today\u2019s milk consumer, rather than legislating more careful treatment of raw milk, agriculture regulators responded to health concerns by requiring pasteurization, a process invented by Louis Pasteur in the 1860s that involves heating the milk quickly, then rapidly cooling it. Pasteurized milk can be shipped more conveniently from the farm to supermarkets and stored for a longer period of time than untreated milk can, making it a commercially profitable product.\nIn the opinion of those who favor raw milk, pasteurization destroys a perfectly healthful and safe natural product. Raw milk enthusiasts believe that heat-treating destroys beneficial bacteria along with harmful ones, degrades the protein, and eliminates healthful enzymes useful for digestion. For example, patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes periodic cramping, fever, fatigue and watery diarrhea, find that drinking unpasteurized milk can improve symptoms.\nThere is no national law against drinking milk obtained directly from a cow or goat, but the Food and Drug Administration banned the interstate sale of raw milk in the 1980s. About half of all states prohibit the sale of raw milk for human consumption, as West Virginia does. Consumers in Kentucky and Ohio have more options.\nWhen looking for raw milk sources, inquire about grass-fed dairy cows whose milk has fewer pathogens naturally than does milk from cows fed on grains, soybeans, or cottonseed meal. In general, experts agree that well-fed, pastured, healthy cows will produce healthy milk \u2013 which people can consume without risk and with major benefits.\nBarbara E.

Particularly, their bodies have challenges digesting the protein casein.\u00a0 Even when milk is raw and contains A2 beta-casein (not A1), experience shows that most children do not tolerate it.\nSo, imagine my delight (and skepticism) when parents approached me and shared personal stories about the healing properties of camel milk, and how its fundamentally different than any other milk on the planet.\nAs I began to research it for myself, I heard from autism parents who told me that camel milk has helped their children tremendously, with not adverse reactions to this \u201cdairy.\u201d (Thank you Randi, Jessica and Nicole \u2013 I learn so much from you parents on the front lines.)\nCamel milk may seem obscure, but the more I research and read personal anecdotes from parents and clinicians the world over, the more amazing I think it may actually be at helping recover kids with autism \u2013 and many others with gut issues, immune system challenges, nutrient deficiencies, and more!\nIf you\u2019re following the GAPS Diet, gluten-free casein-free, or any healing food strategy intended to improve the body\u2019s chemistry and functioning, you should be curious about camel milk.\nCamel Milk\u2019s Healing Power\nResearch and experience from an increasing number of people around the world demonstrate that camel milk facilitates healing in our bodies. Camel milk has many unique and amazing properties.\nHere\u2019s some quick research:\nCamel milk has been shown to heal food allergies (1) and gut problems. The antibodies and immune properties of camel\u2019s milk contribute to its wonderful viral and bacterial fighting abilities.\nIt is particularly helpful in addressing immune system dysregulation in various forms.\u00a0 Camel milk can support and help people with autoimmune conditions, including autism, heal.\nA research study by Dr. Reuven Yagil (2005) shows camel milk has positive results in children with autism. (2)\nCamel milk contains insulin and is effective in diabetes (3), including gestational diabetes (4).\nSince children with autism routinely have immune system challenges: inability to fight bacterial, viral and other infections, and states of chronic inflammation, allergy, and autoimmunity, camel milk has promising health and healing benefits.\nCamel herders and indigenous cultures have known about the power of camel milk for a long time.\u00a0 To this day, Bedouin parents send their children to drink camel milk for a couple weeks in their childhood, as they know that it sets up a strong immune system for life.\u00a0 Dr. Weston A. Price observed their dental health (and therefore physical health) was excellent stating, \u201cThe Arabs in several districts use camels\u2019 milk extensively.\u00a0 It is nutritious, and in much of the desert country constitutes the mainstay of the nomads for months at a time.\u201d (5)\nCamels are built differently than any other animal. Camels are not ruminants but are Tylopodes and have three stomachs, but they do ruminate.\u00a0 They can survive in incredibly harsh climates, and are able to live without water for 30 days at a time (even with little food), while still producing high quality milk. \u00a0Imagine that! \u00a0A large part of camel milk\u2019s healing power stems from the unique and hardy immune system of camels, it\u2019s unlike any other mammal.\nCamel Milk: Highly Nutritious with Unique Casein\nCamel milk is highly nutritious. The milk contains only 2% fat (I\u2019m not a fan of a low-fat, but these are the facts).\u00a0 The fat molecules are joined to protein, so there is no stress on the liver to process it.\u00a0 Higher is some nutrients and lower in others\u2014camel milk is rich in vitamin C (5x that of cow\u2019s milk), iron (10x) and calcium. The fat profile of camel milk varies in a \u201crich diet\u201d (domesticated camels) versus the diet camels eat in the desert \u2013 but generally it\u2019s high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, with a higher ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 compared with cow\u2019s milk.\nCamel milk is considered a complete food and can be consumed exclusively while meeting all nutritional requirements.\u00a0 Camel milk is most frequently consumed raw and unpasteurized, because the raw milk contains the most nutritional and immune properties.\u00a0 Only when the quality and safety of the milk is in question would someone pasteurize it.\nCamel\u2019s milk contains no beta-lactoglobulin and a \u201cnew\u201d beta-casein (6). Therefore it is not reactive to children with autism and even non-allergenic to those with even the most sensitive allergy to milk and casein. One study found Camel\u2019s milk was also not recognized from circulating IgEs from a child specifically allergic to ewe\u2019s milk.(7) Children with severe food allergies react well to the milk, and astonishingly, fully recover from their allergies including to other foods (1).\nCasein molecules are actually micelles and camel micelles have been found to be larger in size (15 nm) than those of cow milk or human milk. (8).\u00a0 Camel milk has a lower pH than other milk, so that upon entering the stomach the casein micelles do not breakdown into casein and whey and therefore do not break into casomorphins.\u00a0 Casomorphin creation from cow milk consumption is a common problem in autism that increases autistic symptoms.\nCamel Milk: Immune Benefits\nCamel milk has an amazing immune profile.\nThe immunoglobulins (Igs) and protective proteins in camel milk contribute to camel milk\u2019s incredible infection fighting and eradication capacity.\u00a0 Camel Igs (which exist in the milk) are able to penetrate into tissues and cells that human Igs were unable to.\u00a0 Therefore, they are able to get into the kidney or inside a cell, where they are also able to completely neutralize the enzyme activity of an infectious agent such as a bacteria or virus.\nCamel Immunoglobulins\nCamel milk also contains immunoglobulins (Igs) that are special in camels, including unique subclasses IgG2 and IgG3.\u00a0\u00a0 The Igs are the same structure as human immunoglobulins but only one-tenth the size.\u00a0 Being so small, they can penetrate into tissues and organs to fight infection and aid repair, where human antibodies cannot.\nCamel antibodies have superior antibacterial and antiviral properties.\u00a0 As stated in Dr. Reuven Yagil\u2019s autoimmune paper, \u201cconventional antibodies rarely show a complete neutralizing activity against enzyme antigens, but camel IgG has a full neutralizing activity against tetanus toxin as it enters the enzymes structure.\u201d (9).\u00a0 Viruses can also be neutralized by knocking out their enzyme activity, and studies show the camel antibody is an effective inhibitor against hepatitis C enzyme system (10).\nIn a study on camel milk for autism, the author compares camel milk to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy that acts as a natural immunoglobulin therapy, whose effects continue after the therapy is stopped, because of the immune rehabilitating action.\nCamel Immune Protective Proteins\nCamel milk contains the following immune proteins (often in higher qualities than other milk):\nPeptidoglycan Recognition Protein, PGRP is very high in camel milk. It stimulates the host\u2019s immune response and has antimicrobial activity.\u00a0 It even appears to have an effect on breast cancer in studies.\nLactoferrin is also in higher concentrations in camel milk, more than cows and goats.\u00a0 Lactoferrin prevents microbial overgrowth and invading pathogens.\u00a0 Lactoperoxidase, has bactericidal activity on gram-negative bacterial like Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and, Pseudomonas, and has antitumor activity.\nLysozyme is an enzyme that is part of the innate immune system that targets gram-positive bacteria.\u00a0 N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (NAGase) found in similar quantities in human milk has antibacterial activity.\nAutoimmunity\nOne theory about autoimmune disease is that the body attacks itself because it\u2019s trying (in vain) to get at the bacteria buried in the intestinal tissue.\u00a0 Camel milk\u2019s antibacterial activities and the special immune response allow for their penetration into the intestinal tissues when the \u201cquiet\u201d bacteria turn pathogenic.\u00a0 Because the antibodies are able to get into the affected tissue to attack the infectious agent (for example the saprophyte bacteria found in Crohn\u2019s disease), camel milk can help someone heal in ways not seen through any other intervention \u2013 dietary or otherwise.\nCamel Milk and Autism (and Beyond)\nDr. Yagil says that \u201ccamel milk does not contain the two caseins that lead to the autism symptoms when drinking cow milk.\u00a0 Therefore camel milk can safely be drunk by autistic children.\u201d The results published in a paper on camel milk for autism were very positive, especially for younger children that \u201cshowed an apparent complete recovery from autism after strict removal of cow\u2019s milk\u201d. (2) Regarding the results seen with autism, Dr. Yagil explains, \u201cit is NOT only a case of repressing the clinical signs but a rehabilitation of the immune system.\u00a0 Therefore the kids completely recover.\u00a0\u201c\nSince camel milk is nourishing and easy to digest, it does not trigger allergenic or opiate responses, and helps heal the gut and infections, protecting and enhancing the immune system.\nConsidering the vast qualities of camel milk, there\u2019s seems no limit to the range of maladies that it many help address. \u00a0The positive reports from parents are exciting \u2013 camel milk holds great promise, and future study and clinical experience will be valuable. From parents to professionals like Dr. Yagil, I am intrigued and enthused about the value and healing properties of camel milk for people with a wide variety health conditions.\nCamel milk would be a wonderful addition to people on special diets such as GAPS. I\u2019m drinking it, and so is my baby.\nRemain connected to my blog to learn of my clinical (and personal) experience with camel milk!\n_____________________________________________________________________\nReferences\n1.

So you can probably see why cleanliness <em>is</em> priority one. There three areas where cleanliness <em>is</em> of the utmost importance\u2014in the <em>goat</em> yard, with the <em>milk</em>, and with the udder.", "explanation": null, "document": "Keeping it Clean\nShare this with your friends\nGoat milk is a main reason why some people decide to get goats. If that sounds like you, good for you! You\u2019re going to have quite an adventure. Once you get the hang of milking your goat, you\u2019ll be drinking nature\u2019s perfect food. In this guide, you\u2019ll learn the mechanics of getting milk from the goat and into the pail.\nThe Mechanics of Milking\nMilking is a simple skill, but you\u2019ll need to practice. Practice is great if the goat is a patient one and you have plenty of time. Remember, a goat fills her udder twice a day, and with a full udder there is some urgency to empty it. If at all possible, practice on someone else\u2019s goats\u2014preferably someone who will both teach you and take over for you when you get tired.\nThe activity of milking uses muscles in your hands and forearms. These muscles don\u2019t get much use in your daily activities, so your hands will get tired. To build up strength for milking, you can squeeze a small ball or a hand exerciser.\nThink of the goat\u2019s udder system generally as a balloon with valves that open under pressure. The openings are called the orifices, and one is found at the end of each teat. The average udder has two teats with one orifice each.\nHow to Milk\nMilking is actually pretty easy. Here\u2019s how you do it:\nClose off the top of the teat between your straight thumb and the lowest knuckle of your index finger, where it connects to the body of the udder.\nUse a pinching action to close off the milk in the teat and keep it from returning to the reservoir of the udder.\nOnce you\u2019ve closed the milk in the teat, apply pressure with your other four fingers, squeezing the body of the teat, to squeeze the milk out of the orifice.\nRelease the pinching finger so more milk flows down into the teat and repeat.\nThere\u2019s a lot of variation in the size of both the teats and the orifices. Longer teats are easier to get a grip on, and larger orifices take less pressure to squeeze the milk from. The position of the teats on the udder floor also makes a difference. Teats that point straight down instead of outward make hitting a bucket easier.\nThese are all things to consider when choosing milk goats. If you\u2019re a well-practiced milker, these things may not be an issue. But for beginners, less-than-ideal teat placement and small orifices will slow you down and might make it more difficult for you to learn.\nYou can practice the basic move ahead of time on a partially inflated balloon or rubber glove. Obviously, there are some differences, but you can get your hands used to the basic mechanical movement.\nKeeping It Clean\nMilk is the most perfect medium for bacterial growth. Bacteria love milk. Bacteria ruin milk quality. And some bacteria can make you or even your goats sick. So you can probably see why cleanliness is priority one.\nThere three areas where cleanliness is of the utmost importance\u2014in the goat yard, with the milk, and with the udder. Both you and your goats will have a better milking experience if cleanliness is one of your priorities in all these areas.\nCleanliness in the Goat Yard\nThe most open part of the goat\u2019s milk-producing system is on the underneath side of her, and that area comes in contact with the goat yard surface every time she lies down. The cleaner everything is, the less chance for problems.\nThe process of milking a goat causes a bit more stress on the orifice than when kids nurse. Studies in the cow dairy industry indicate that the orifice stretches and remains somewhat open for up to an hour after milking. If she goes directly into the goat yard and lies down after milking, that open orifice can allow bacteria to get inside.\nThe risk can be lowered by making sure her bedding is dry and as clean as you can keep it. Avoid wet, soggy, high-fecal-content bedding. Some goat owners optimize the time after milking by feeding hay then so the goats are standing to eat for about an hour. Or if your goats go out to browse or graze after milking, you\u2019ll get a similar effect.\nCleanliness with the Milk\nBacteria in the milk will grow and multiply. They change the taste, making it \u201cgoaty,\u201d a taste I can\u2019t begin to describe, but one you\u2019d recognize if you tasted it. Bacteria cause milk to sour. Very clean milk will keep for 10 days or longer in the refrigerator and still be great for drinking. Anything you can do to keep bacterial counts low gives you better milk.\nYou\u2019ll have better luck keeping your milking area clean if it\u2019s separate from where the goats normally live. Enclosing your milk room also helps with cleanliness. It keeps insects and weather out and dust down.\nYour climate may determine some of the details of your milk room. I\u2019ve had many types of milk rooms and can tell you that there\u2019s no one correct kind. Some milk rooms are within barns; others are stand-alone. Some are stainless and tile; others are rough lumber with odds and ends. Only you know what works best for you.\nCleanliness of the Udder\nThink about the position of the goat\u2019s udder relative to the milk bucket. It\u2019s directly above it, right? Obeying the law of gravity, any debris on the udder or its immediate surroundings may fall and land in your bucket. Debris is covered with bacteria, which then can get into the milk. That\u2019s counterproductive to getting good-quality milk. Brushing the hair and udder to remove debris before milking helps keep everything clean.\nNot only for clean milk, but also to reduce risk of udder problems, prior to milking you should wash the udder. Wash with a damp (not dripping!) paper towel or single-use cloth using warm water and a mild detergent such as liquid dish soap. Washing solutions are also commercially available.\nBe sure the towel or cloth is damp only, not dripping! Bacteria-laden water running down to the ends of the teats just puts more bacteria at the most vulnerable point of the udder.\nYou should also use a strip cup. A strip cup is a small container with a screen attached that filters the first squirt of milk. If there are any lumps, clots, or anomalies, they\u2019ll be visible on the screen. The first squirt of milk contains more bacteria and doesn\u2019t help milk quality, so it shouldn\u2019t be put in with the rest of the milk in the bucket. And if there are any preliminary changes in the milk, the strip cup can show them before you get a whole bucketful.\nIt\u2019s helpful to use a teat dip after milking, too. A teat dip is an antibacterial liquid dipped or sprayed onto teat ends that helps keep bacteria out of the orifice for that hour or so after milking when it\u2019s most vulnerable. Teat dips are available commercially in a variety of antibiotic or disinfecting chemicals, preparations, and applicators. Various studies show mixed results for teat dips made with iodine, so you\u2019ll have to figure out what works best for you.\nIf you follow these guidelines, you\u2019ll be milking like a pro and you and your goat will both be happy campers. Good luck, and happy milking!\n"}, {"score": 1960.4863, "uuid": "26c87f53-4367-5f7f-8e2b-e12c09ab5440", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-73-09171", "target_hostname": "www.fitnessrepublic.com", "target_uri": "http://www.fitnessrepublic.com/nutrition/general-nutrition/what-make-milk.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>What</em> to Make of <em>Milk</em> | Fitness Republic", "snippet": "<em>Goat</em> and sheep\u2019s <em>milk</em> are often handled quite well by those suffering from lactose intolerance due to its lower lactose levels, especially when it\u2019s in the form of <em>goat</em> <em>or</em> sheep\u2019s <em>milk</em> yogurt.", "explanation": null, "document": "Fitness Republic \u00bb Nutrition \u00bb General Nutrition \u00bb What to Make of Milk\nWhat to Make of Milk\nWhen you go for your annual physical exam, one of the first questions your physician may ask you is, \u201cHow much milk are you drinking?\u201d They\u2019re not just asking to see what you\u2019re putting on your breakfast cereal. They want to know about your calcium intake, which is especially important for women under 30 years of age.\nBut what if you don\u2019t (or can\u2019t) drink milk? Can you still get all of its beneficial nutrients? Of course you can! But you have to do it right, so here are the straight facts on milk and milk alternatives:\nOne cup of 1% milk contains approximately 300mg of calcium, 27mg of magnesium, 8g of protein and just over 100 calories. This breakdown looks great, but a lot more goes into a carton of milk than what\u2019s shown on the label.\nConventional milk is taken from Holstein cows. These cows are often fed hormones that are meant to keep them in a constant state of lactation, and the milk itself contains an amino acid profile (protein components) that\u2019s been shown to contribute to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. If it\u2019s the science you\u2019re after, it\u2019s the 67th amino acid histidine that makes the difference.\nThis protein has been tested against the protein found in Jersey cows and Guernsey cows, which are often used in organic milk, which doesn\u2019t have the same detrimental effects on our health.\nThen there\u2019s the feed. Cows historically grazed on green pastures of plentiful grass and basked in the sun. This isn\u2019t the case on conventional farms. Cows are fed genetically modified grains that are grown on land where pesticides have been sprayed. These pesticides have proven to be fat-soluble endocrine disruptors. This means that when the cows (and ultimately we) consume the pesticides, they hide in our fat stores with the ability to block hormone receptors and interfere with normal metabolic functions.\nThere\u2019s also the question about the bioavailability of the nutrients found in dairy. We\u2019ve been taught by the dairy industry that milk is the best source of calcium and you have to consume it to have healthy bones. But there\u2019s a lot of conflicting data on the ability of our body to absorb calcium derived from milk.\nMany studies site milk as being highly absorbed, but then why does the western world have the highest rates of osteoporosis when we consume the most dairy products? It may be because calcium and magnesium are buffers, and the Standard American Diet is highly acidic, so many of the beneficial minerals are used to neutralize these acids, and therefore aren\u2019t utilized in the bone tissue.\nIt may also be because the milk that comes out of a cow on a local farm is a very different product than what reaches our cereal bowl, given the processing procedures of conventional farming. Remember, milk has sugar in it (lactose) \u2013 which is highly acidic \u2013 so many minerals may be lost before they even reach your stomach. Review\nTrimming the fat\nOpting for a low-fat version of cow\u2019s milk seems like a great idea. After all, the fat in milk is meant to fatten up a baby calf to a 300lb cow within a year! However, it turns out that the low fat choices may cause a higher rate of milk allergies than their higher fat counterparts. Click here\nSo what are the alternatives?\nOrganic Cow\u2019s Milk\nIf you choose to get your calcium from milk, consider going organic. Organic cows are pastured outdoors and are fed pesticide free, non-genetically modified feed. They\u2019re also able to lactate on their own cycle, so the milk isn\u2019t laden with hormones.\nGoat/Sheep Milk\nSheep and goat milks are not as widely commercially produced as cow\u2019s milk, so the herds are usually smaller with less exposure to hormones, pesticides and other hazards of conventional farming. Nutritionally speaking, these are higher protein, higher fat and in turn, a higher calorie alternative to milk. Whole goat\u2019s milk contains about 168 calories per cup with 9g of protein and 10g of fat. Goat\u2019s milk contains more calcium, vitamin A and potassium per cup than cow\u2019s milk and contains a very different protein structure too, making it much less allergenic. Goat and sheep\u2019s milk are often handled quite well by those suffering from lactose intolerance due to its lower lactose levels, especially when it\u2019s in the form of goat or sheep\u2019s milk yogurt.\u00a0( Nutritiondata.self.com ) & Askdrsears.com\nSoy Milk\nThe breakdown of most commercial soy milk has a similar nutrient content to cow milk because it\u2019s often fortified. Soy milk is derived from soy beans, which can be allergenic for many, so make sure you can handle soy first. Soy beans are one of the most commonly produced genetically modified foods, so make sure you choose organic for soy milk, too. Be careful! Soy is a hidden ingredient in many of our pre-packaged food and it\u2019s easy to get too much. Soy contains phytoestrogens, which mimic estrogen on a very low level. This is safe in small quantities, but be careful about the amount of soy milk you add into a diet already rich in hidden sources of soy! Also, watch out for some forms of fortification, as calcium carbonate is often used, which isn\u2019t as highly bio-available as other forms of calcium such as citrate. It\u2019s also what blackboard chalk is made of. Medscape.com\nAlmond Milk\nAlmond milk is a great low-calorie alternative to milk at about 40-60 calories per serving (depending on the brand) and over 400mg of calcium. Almonds are a great source of vitamin A and vitamin E as well. Almond milk also has low natural sugar content \u2013 5-7g of sugar per cup, compared to cow\u2019s milk at 13g per cup. Plus it lasts longer in the fridge than cow\u2019s milk and you can even make it from your blender at home! Nutritiondata.self.com\nRice Milk\nRice milk is often fortified with calcium to bring its content up to 300mg of calcium per cup. It\u2019s a bit higher in calories than almond milk, but it\u2019s lower in fat than many alternatives. Rice milk also has simpler carbohydrates that increase blood sugar faster, so it\u2019s great to drink if you need a nutritious boost \u2013but beware of being caught in a blood sugar roller coaster. Each cup of rice milk has about 24g of carbohydrates in the unsweetened version \u2013 whereas sweetened versions can have up to another 10g of added sugar \u2013 so watch out for hidden sugar sources.\nHemp Milk\nThis milk is pressed from hemp seeds, but don\u2019t worry \u2013there\u2019s no THC here. Hemp milk is lower in calcium, but it\u2019s high in omega 3 fats, which are great for brain function, cellular health, hormonal control and immunity. The nutrient breakdown doesn\u2019t make for a good calcium substitute, but it\u2019s a great alternative to put on cereal and smoothies to get your healthy fats \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t eat fish, as well a significant amount of protein at 5g per cup. Nutritiondata.self.com\nCoconut Milk\nMade from the juice squeezed from the meat of the coconut, this is a fairly new milk-substitute on the market. The calcium content of coconut milk is quite low, but it also has so many other great benefits. Coconut milk contains healthy mono-unsaturated omega 6 fatty acids that are easily utilized by the body cells as energy, and it has actually been shown to speed up metabolism.\nCoconut milk also contains lauric acid, which is an antibacterial agent soothing and healing to the digestive system. Even though coconut milk is lower in calcium, it\u2019s high in magnesium, which is also used to create healthy bones. The milk of this new-wave nut can also be a great non-dairy substitute for making creamy hot chocolate with a light coconutty taste!\nThe nutritional content of these milk alternatives are approximate values only. They may change depending on brand, processing procedures, added flavors, fat skimming, fortification and dilution.\nRemember, it\u2019s always better to move as close to the bottom of the food chain as possible for the best sources of nutrients. Many of the same nutrients found in milk such as calcium and magnesium are also found in leafy green vegetables and seaweed, which are great alternatives if you\u2019re vegetarian or lactose intolerant. But if you\u2019re searching for milk alternatives, make sure to choose those that are organic or the least processed.\nWhether you\u2019re carnivore, herbivore or omnivore, eating a plant-based pesticide free diet that has a lot of variety is the best way to prevent any disease. And you don\u2019t always have to drink the milk to get its benefits, either. Try making homemade yogurt from any of these sources and provide your gut with the healthy bacteria it needs. Or give all of these a try and decide for yourself. After all, variety is the spice of life \u2013and milk!\nAbout Margaret Reffell\nMargaret Reffell has been an active member of the Fitness and Health Industry for the last 10 years.

This wonderful food, so essential to a balanced diet as a source of calcium, is blamed from time to time for asthma, wind, colds, boils, the runs, tantrums, skin rashes and many other illnesses and behavioural patters.\nExperts agree that cows' milk was seen as a convenient culprit. Here is what they said about the bogeys of milk allergy, milk or lactose intolerance and milk as a cause of mucus.\nMilk Allergy : Allergies are caused by the body's defense mechanism reacting to a particular protein.\nAbout five to ten percent of children under about four years of age can be allergic to milk protein. But after about age four, most people develop tolerance and the allergy becomes rare. About half of the people, who remain allergic to cows milk, also will be allergic to goats milk and probably egg or soy drink. After about four months of age, cows milk can be used in normal baby food and on cereal. The mid six months have the potential for milk and other allergies. You can only develop an allergy as a reaction to protein and the allergy can be induced or tested by trying various proteins. Generally, baby should not be given cows milk as a drink until about age twelve months.\nMilk / Lactose Intolerance : This is not to be confused with milk allergy. Milk allergy is reaction to milk protein and is rare after about age three.\nLactose intolerance leads to a rumble stomach and sometimes abdominal pain, wind and sometimes diarrhoea. It is uncommon amongst aborigines, Asians and southern European races. It is still important for lactose-intolerant people to have three serves of dairy food a day to maintain their calcium intake in a balanced diet. Dairy foods such as yogurt and cheese are likely to be better tolerated, and there are lactose-reduced milks.\nMilk and Mucus : Many studies have been undertaken, but no study has been able to prove that milk causes mucus. The \"gluggy\" feeling that some people have in the back of their throat after drinking milk is probably milk fat. Even if this was mucus, it would be ingested into the stomach and could not find its way into the lungs or sinus.\n"}, {"score": 1950.8186, "uuid": "074cde59-3e4a-5404-8b2d-eb2e37a8c131", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0807wb-22-04260", "target_hostname": "www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au", "target_uri": "http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Milk_the_facts_and_fallacies?open", "page_rank": 1.216769e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Milk</em> - facts and fallacies | <em>Better</em> Health Channel", "snippet": "Foods that contain lactose are <em>better</em> tolerated if eaten with other foods <em>or</em> spread out over the day, rather than being eaten in large amounts at once.

However, dairy foods (particularly low-fat products) are not a threat to good health if consumed in moderation as part of a well-balanced nutritious diet.\nSome research findings include:\nOsteoporosis \u2013 if milk and milk products are removed from the diet, it can lead to an inadequate intake of calcium. This is of particular concern for women and the elderly, who have high calcium needs. Calcium deficiency may lead to disorders like osteoporosis (a disease characterised by bone loss).\nColon cancer \u2013 some studies have found that people who regularly eat dairy products have a reduced risk of developing colon cancer.\nBlood pressure \u2013 research in the US found that a high intake of fruits and vegetables, combined with low-fat dairy foods, will lower blood pressure more than fruits and vegetables alone.\nType 2 diabetes \u2013 a 10-year study of 3,000 overweight adults found that consuming milk and other milk products instead of refined sugars and carbohydrates may protect overweight young adults from developing type 2 diabetes.\nFlavoured milk\nA recent US study reported that children who avoid milk tend to be fatter than children who drink milk. This may be because milk is being replaced by high energy drinks such as fruit juice or soft drinks.\nAs children move into adolescence, the time when they need the most calcium, they tend to drink less milk and more sugary soft drinks. As milk is a healthier choice, it is worth encouraging children over two years of age to drink reduced fat flavoured milk rather than soft drinks.\nMilk and tooth decay\nMilk and milk products are thought to protect against tooth decay. Eating cheese and other dairy products:\nReduces oral acidity (which causes decay)\nStimulates saliva flow\nDecreases the incidence of dental caries (tooth decay).\nModified milks explained\nThere are many types of milks on the market, including:\nFull cream \u2013 full cream milk contains around four per cent fat and is a source of vitamins A and D. For children up to the age of two years, full cream milk is recommended.\nReduced fat \u2013 expect around half as much fat in reduced fat milk as full cream. Children over the age of two years can drink reduced fat milk.\nSkim milk \u2013 contains less than one per cent fat. Children older than five years can safely consume skim milk. Both reduced fat and skim milk have vitamin A and D added to replace the naturally occurring vitamins that are reduced when the fat is removed.\nCalcium enriched \u2013 generally milks that are enriched with extra calcium are also fat reduced. A 250 ml glass of milk contains 408\u2013500 mg of calcium.\nFlavoured \u2013 these milks can either be full cream or reduced fat. However, most varieties contain a lot of sugar.\nUHT (ultra-high temperature-treated) milk \u2013 is treated with very high heat to allow milk to be stored for long periods.\nUnpasteurised milk\nMost milk on the market is pasteurised (heat treated then cooled). Milk that hasn\u2019t been through this process should be avoided. While pasteurisation reduces the amount of some vitamins, such as vitamin C, it also kills bacteria. Unpasteurised milk is a health hazard because of the dangers of bacterial diseases.\nMilk and mucous\nMany people in Australia believe that nasal stuffiness is related, in part, to how much milk you drink. However, there is no scientific basis to this theory. Milk doesn\u2019t encourage extra mucous production.\nCows milk versus goats milk\nSome people switch to goat\u2019s milk because of perceived sensitivities to cow\u2019s milk. If a person has an allergic sensitivity, it is usually due to one or more of the proteins in milk. The proteins in goat\u2019s milk are closely related to those in cow\u2019s milk so replacing one type of milk with the other usually doesn\u2019t make any difference. Milk allergies are more common in very young children and most tend to grow out of them or build up a tolerance to milk.\nLactose intolerance\nLactose is a type of carbohydrate or sugar that naturally occurs in milk from any mammal, including humans. Normally, an enzyme in the small intestine called lactase breaks down lactose so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Some people don\u2019t produce enough lactase \u2013 undigested lactose is broken up by the bacteria in their large intestine causing gas, bloating, pain and diarrhoea. This condition is called \u2018lactose intolerance\u2019.\nYou can be born lactose intolerant or develop it later in life. If you think you may be lactose intolerant, see your doctor.\nMost people can have small amounts of dairy products\nMilk and milk products are highly nutritious, so people who suffer from lactose intolerance should not give them up entirely. You can still consume milk in moderate quantities. You can also buy lactose-free milk.\nMost people can tolerate the amount of lactose in:\nHalf a cup of milk\nThree quarters of a cup of ice cream\nThree quarters of a cup of yoghurt\nHalf a cup of white sauce\nThree quarters of a cup of unripened cheeses like cottage or ricotta.\nSome dairy foods contain less lactose\nSome dairy foods contain less lactose than others and may be better for people who suffer from lactose intolerance. For example:\nFermented milk products, including some yoghurts, mature cheeses (like cheddar cheese, fetta and mozzarella) and butter, generally pose no tolerance problems. (However, butter is high in saturated fat and is not recommended for good heart health.)\nHeated milk products, such as evaporated milk, seem to be better tolerated than unheated foods because the heating process breaks down some of the lactose.\nFoods that contain lactose are better tolerated if eaten with other foods or spread out over the day, rather than being eaten in large amounts at once.\nSoy as an alternative\nSoy foods are lactose free and a good substitute for milk or milk products if fortified with calcium. Soy milk, custard, yoghurt and cheese are now widely available in Australia, but check that they are calcium fortified.\nOther sources of calcium\nAlthough milk is an excellent source of calcium, it isn\u2019t the only one. Other good sources include:\nCheese, especially hard cheeses\n"}, {"score": 1946.6348, "uuid": "11bceaa0-396b-55d9-a30c-e36d5825a6f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0807wb-22-04259", "target_hostname": "www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au", "target_uri": "http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Milk_the_facts_and_fallacies", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Milk</em> - facts and fallacies | <em>Better</em> Health Channel", "snippet": "Foods that contain lactose are <em>better</em> tolerated if eaten with other foods <em>or</em> spread out over the day, rather than being eaten in large amounts at once.

The process is named for the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered in the 1860s that undesired fermentation could be prevented in wine and beer by heating it to 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C) for a few minutes. Milk is pasteurized by heating it to about 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) for 30 min or by the \"flash method\" of heating to 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) for 15 sec, followed by rapid cooling to below 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C), at which temperature it is stored. In milk, after pasteurization, the harmless lactic acid bacteria survives, but if the milk is not kept cold, they multiply rapidly and cause it to turn sour. (1)\nWhy is Raw milk better?\nPasteurization destroys enzymes, diminishes vitamin content, denatures fragile milk proteins, alters vitamin B12, and vitamin B6, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease and cancer. (2)\nHeat alters milk\u0092s amino acids lysine and tyrosine, making the whole complex of proteins less available; it promotes rancidity of unsaturated fatty acids and destruction of vitamins. Vitamin C loss in pasteurization usually exceeds 50%; loss of other water-soluble vitamins can run as high as 80%; the Wulzen or anti-stiffness factor is totally destroyed. Pasteurization alters milk\u0092s mineral components such as calcium, chlorine, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and sulfur as well as many trace minerals, making them less available. There is some evidence that pasteurization alters lactose, making it more readily absorbable. This, and the fact that pasteurized milk puts an unnecessary strain on the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes, may explain why milk consumption in societies that drink pasteurized milk has been linked with diabetes. (3)\nPasteurization destroys all the enzymes in milk -- in fact, the test for successful pasteurization is absence of enzymes. These enzymes help the body assimilate all bodybuilding factors, including calcium. That is why those who drink pasteurized milk may suffer, nevertheless, from osteoporosis. Lipase in raw milk helps the body digest and utilize butterfat. (3)\nButterfat has a cortisone-like factor which is heat sensitive (destroyed by heat) that prevents stiffness in the joints. Raw Milk contains beneficial bacteria as well as lactic acids that allow these beneficial bacteria to implant in the intestines. Once heated, milk becomes rotten, with precipitated minerals that can\u0092t be absorbed (hence osteoporosis), with sugars that can\u0092t be digested (hence allergies), and with fats that are toxic. (4)\nRaw milk has been used as a therapy in folk medicine. It has been used in the pre-insulin days to treat diabetes, as well as eczema, intestinal worms, allergies, and arthritis, all for reasons which can be understood when we realize just what is in milk -- such as the cortisone - like factor for allergies and eczema.(4)\nMy personal opinion is raw milk produces much better cheese... cheese with body and character. Pasteurized milk cheese can be flat.\nI believe the American public these days are way to obsessed with \"antibacterial\". It's gotten to the point of being dangerous because some bacteria is good and necessary. People are turning themselves into \"bubble boys\" never being exposed to anything, hence, when they are exposed to a bad bacteria, they get very sick. People who are exposed the good and bad all the time in there lives build a resistance, and when exposed to a bad bacteria, their bodies have developed the antibodies to fight it off.\nI'm not saying raw milk has bad bacteria, actually it's the opposite. The milk has good bacteria which can fight off any dangerous or bad bacteria present in the milk or that may fall into the milk. If you pasteurize the milk, thus killing the good bacteria, then any bad bacteria that may manage to get into the milk will multiply and grow quickly, because pasteurized milk is the prefect medium for bacteria to grow and there is no longer any good bacteria present to fight the bad bacteria off. This is why milk from the store goes bad, turns lumpy and horrible, where raw milk (if it's around long enough) just naturally turns pleasantly sours and becomes like buttermilk.\nI use nothing but raw milk. I figure, why bother going to all the trouble of raising my own goats for milk and then ruining it by killing off all the good live things it contains and destroying the nutrients? If your goats are healthy and you follow sanitary procedure, there is nothing better for you than raw milk. If using raw milk, it must be handled correctly, everything must be sanitary and the animals that the milk comes from should all be healthy and happy.\nWhat is Homogenization?\nHomogenization is a mechanical process that breaks down butterfat globules so they do not rise to the top. Mechanically homogenized milk has been linked to heart disease. (2)\nInfo about goat milk:\nNormal goat milk fat has a much higher concentration of so called medium chain fatty acids (MCT), caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic (33%) verses cow milk fat (17%), and lower in stearic and oleic (27%) lower than cow milk fat (45%) . Much documentation exists showing the uniquely beneficial effects of those MCT, medium chain fatty acids in various medical problems, disorders and diseases, such as those suffering from malabsorption syndromes chluria, steatorrhe, hyperlipoproteinemia intestinal resection, coronary bypass, premature infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, angcontributeto general thriftiness of children. (5)\nGoat milk provides 13% more calcium, 25% more Vit B-6, 47% more Vit A, 134% more potassium and 350% more niacin than cow milk. Goat milk is higher in chloride, copper and manganese and none of the controversial bovine growth hormone (BGH) (5)\nAlso see:\nMilk:\u00a0Comparing Human, Cow, Goat & Infant Formula\nLactose intolerance, allergies and goat milk:\nGoat milk, like cows milk and human milk, contain lactose, but many people (but not all) with lactose intolerance and cow milk allergies can drink goats milk. Why? It is because of goat milks superior digestibility. Goat milk is more completely and easily absorbed than cows milk leaving less residue behind in the colon where it can literally ferment and cause problems. The digestibility of goat milk can be attributed to it's casin curd, which is both softer and smaller, thus easy to digest. Another big difference between cow and goat milk is found that the average goat milk fat globule is about 1 1/2 to two microns compared to cow at 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 microns another factor in ease of digestion. Goat milk contains more essential fatty acids (linoleic & archidoic acids) and higher proportion of short chain and medium chainfatty acids than cows milk. The fat can be more readily digested and absorbed because lipases attack ester linkages of these fatty acids more readily than those of longer chains (cow) And unlike cows milk, goat milk does not contain agglutinin; as a result the fat globules in goat milk do not cluster, again allowing the ease of digestion and absorption. (6)\nWhat about fat content?\nNot all fat is bad; there are \"good fats\" and \"bad fats\". You need some fat in your diet, but you need to keep in mind that too much of anything (including a good thing) can be bad for you.\nButterfat contains vitamins A and D needed for the assimilation of calcium and protein in the water fraction of the milk. Without them, protein and calcium are more difficult to utilize and possibly toxic. Butterfat is rich in short and medium chain fatty acids which protect against disease and stimulate the immune system. It contains glycospingolipids which prevent intestinal distress, and conjugated linoleic acid which has strong anticancer properties.(2)\nreferences:\n1) The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001.\n2) Campaign for Real Milk Web Site a project of The Weston A.

She has given me a brief primer on the judging her goats will have to endure.\u00a0 And I commend her on persevering with this lesson despite my teasing, bad puns and laughter. So for those of you who need to know how to judge a female goat (and don\u2019t we all?), here it is:\nThe female goat (doe) is judged on 16 \u2013 22 points extending from its head to its rear legs. These are listed under 4 categories referred to as \u201cGDBM\u201d.\nG = General Appearance (not mangy, I presume, since \u201chandsome old goat\u201d (or is it \u2018horny\u2019?) is reserved for the bucks)\nD = the all-important \u201cDairy\u201d (like \u201cobscenity,\u201d you know it when you see it)\nB = Body capacity (a big rib cage with backward \u2013slanting strong, widely-spaced ribs)\nM = Mammary (of course). 35 out of 100 points is reserved for this category, to be further explicated.\nMammary includes a raft of attributes that determines how much milk the doe can give (or allow to be taken?) twice each day; and how much she can carry and still walk.\u00a0 One of Rica\u2019s little goats, Amber, 150 pounds, gives more than 2 gallons per day. Wow!\nTHE UDDER:\u00a0 A doe has only one udder with two teats (which is interesting because she bears several kids at a time while a cow, with 4 teats, bears only one \u2013 oops!). \u00a0\u00a0The udder is divided into 2 parts by a membrane called the \u201cmedial suspensory ligament\u201d which can lift and separate the 2 halves of the udder. It ranges from .5\u201d to 1.5\u201d wide. Suffice it to say that the old Maidenform bra goal of \u201clift and separate\u201d rules.\nThus the 2-part udder is divided into the fore and rear udder. The fore udder should be long and smooth; the rear udder should be high and wide.\u00a0 Each half of the udder should have a teat about the size of a thumb, a rather variable measurement the peculiarity of which the judges take into account.\u00a0 In fact, they prefer lengths from 1.5 to 3 inches and a diameter of \u00be inch. And the teats must have \u201cgood placement\u201d. (Can you imagine these rules applied to the Miss America competition?)\nIn the end, these young ladies really are judged on their capacity \u2013 how much milk they give.\u00a0 So we can wish the 2-gallon capacity Amber much luck this year.\u00a0 And much luck to our terrific survivor and universal Mommy, Rica, and, of course, to her co-parent Richard.\nThey assure me that I\u2019ve only scratched the surface of this topic and there is MORE TO COME!!\u00a0 (Also, I\u2019ve probably made mistakes which they will no doubt correct.)\nNancy\n"}, {"score": 1895.9441, "uuid":

Category\nPosted by patrick on Dec 01 2010 | masala chai ingredients , milk\nAccording to the ancient wisdom of Ayurveda, pure cow\u2019s milk is nectar.\u00a0 It is complete to nourish and strengthen the body and is considered sattvic, promoting peace in the mind.\u00a0 It helps induce sound sleep, fortifies the nervous system, provides strength and mass, and is a rich source of protein and essential minerals and vitamins.\u00a0 It is no wonder that Hindus consider the cow the most sacred of animals.\nGoshala (cow sanctuary) at NKB Ashram in Vrindavan\nIn India, one\u2019s relationship with the cow is quite different.\u00a0 The cow, kind of like the dog in the West, is considered part of the family.\u00a0 In semi-urban areas in India where outdoor space is limited, we met cows that had their own room as part of the house.\u00a0 The cows are milked each day, and for those without a cow, fresh milk is delivered, usually by bicycle.\u00a0 The milk is then boiled before use to purify it and make it more digestible.\u00a0 To further enhance digestibility, it is often watered down with warming spices added, thus masala chai.\nMilk delivery man cycling through Durbur Square in Bhaktapur, Nepal\nNeighbors in Bhaktapur who provided our milk\nCow caretaker in Chitrakoot, India\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing which kind of milk to use in your chai.\u00a0 When possible, it is preferable to buy milk that is certified organic or from a small dairy farm.\u00a0 The certification guarantees that it is free of added hormones, antibiotics and chemicals, and smaller farms are more likely to provide more humane living conditions and better diet, compared to factory-farmed cows.\nMost store-bought milk is put through two processes that can compromise its quality, taste and digestibility \u2013 pasteurization and homogenization.\u00a0 Pasteurized milk is heated at a controlled temperature over a specific period of time to slow the growth of harmful microorganisms, thus extending its shelf life.\u00a0 Some research suggests that low heat pasteurization alters the protein molecules in such a way that it makes it difficult for digestive enzymes to do their work.\u00a0 This is different from boiling milk, which can break down the proteins completely, thus aiding digestion.\u00a0 Homogenization then reduces the milk fat into smaller, more uniform sizes, so that the oily cream does not separate and float on top over the watery portion of milk.\u00a0 Some researchers believe that these smaller fat molecules regroup into a sort of capsule, rendering them indigestible by the body.\nOur neighbors\u2019 cows in New Mexico, USA\nWe feel ourselves fortunate to have access to pure, raw, fresh cows\u2019 milk, just like we drank in India and Nepal.\u00a0 It is our liquid, white gold.\u00a0 It is milked the same day we pick it up, and has the seal of freshness, a layer of thick cream, floating on top.\u00a0 Unfortunately however, in our country, pure milk rarely exists any more.\u00a0 In fact, in many states it is not even legal to sell.\u00a0 There is an ongoing controversy of whether raw, un-pasteurized milk is safe to consume because of the possibility of bacterial and viral contaminants.\u00a0 On the other side, are raw milk advocates, who question whether the legal, pasteurized, hormone and antibiotic laden, homogenized milk (that doesn\u2019t even taste like milk) is truly safe for human consumption.\nUltimately, like anything else, all we can do is to educate ourselves and choose what we feel is best for our family.\u00a0 We choose to drink the pure contraband milk, homogenize it by using the low-tech method of shaking the bottle before use, and bring it to a momentary boil while preparing masala chai.\nGoat\u2019s milk is not just an alternative to cows milk, but stands alone as a tasty and nutritious choice for chai.\u00a0 The first few years that I made masala chai, I used nothing else.\u00a0 It contains comparable levels of calcium and protein compared to cows milk, and many people who have sensitivity to cows milk find goats milk easier to digest.\u00a0 Goats milk is naturally homogenized, meaning that separation of fat does not occur like cows milk.\nBenares goat\nWater Buffalo milk is extremely difficult to obtain in North America, but is quite common in India, and is ideal for making masala chai.\u00a0 One of our best-loved chais was the rich, creamy buffalo milk chai served in a clay cup in Benares.\u00a0 Buffalo milk provides more calcium and other minerals, and more protein, while having less cholesterol compared to cow\u2019s milk.\nWater Buffalo on the banks of the Ganga in Benares\nSoy, Rice, Almond, Hemp and other nut, seed, grain and legume milks offer an alternative for those who cannot, or choose not to, consume mammal milk.\u00a0 The nutritional content varies with the plant used, and many are fortified with vitamins and minerals.\u00a0 Often other ingredients like thickeners, sweeteners and flavorings are added, so if you are not making your own, it is a good idea to read the label to know exactly what you are drinking.\u00a0 When making masala chai, know that most plant-based milks are thinner than full-fat animal milks, so when using a recipe, it is not an equal substitution.\u00a0 Again, choosing organically grown foods is healthier for your body and the planet.\nAlmond Milk Recipe\nSoak 1cup of raw almonds in a bowl overnight with enough water to cover almonds.\u00a0 Cover bowl.\nDrain and rinse almonds in the morning.\nAdd 3 cups of water and blend together in blender.\nStrain almond \u2018milk\u2019 into a glass mason-type jar by pouring through a nut milk bag (can also be found at

For cheese makers, the most desirable raw milk comes from grass-fed animals. For many reasons, including the health of the animals and the effects on the environment, we recommend grass feeding.\nThere is a great deal of information on the web about the pros and cons of raw milk. \" The Raw Milk Revolution \" tells the story of the current controversy.\nOne website with good information is, www.raw-milk-facts.com .\n1. Can I use raw milk to make my cheese?\nYes. However, you need to be 110% sure of the milk quality. The milk needs to come from tested animals and it needs to have been kept scrupulously clean. If you are not absolutely sure about it, and you decide to pasteurize it, follow our directions in the next section. (Pasteurized/Homogenized Milk)\nAll of our recipes may be made with raw milk. Follow the directions, as given. Once you have experience with your recipe and you want to make adjustments, you may be able to use 10-20% less rennet and you may be able to lower the temperatures 3-5 degrees.\nWhen making cheese with raw milk, it is important to top-stir it for several extra seconds when adding rennet. This mixes any butterfat that has risen to the surface back into the body of the milk. To top-stir, simply stir the top inch of milk with the bottom of a slotted spoon or skimmer.\n2. Can I sell my raw milk cheese legally?\nRaw milk cheeses sold in the US must be aged over 60 days and above 34F. You will need to check with your local and state agencies to determine what you need to do to be able to sell your raw milk cheeses.\n3. How soon after I milk can I use it for making cheese?\nAfter milking, hold the milk for 2-3 hours before making cheese. After that, sooner is better. It is best to use milk within at least 36-48 hours of milking. Traditionally, it was milked and held overnight to allow natural cultures to develop. It was then mixed with the fresh morning's milk, which was still warm.\n4. How do I skim raw milk?\nWith cow's milk, we suggest letting the cream float to the top overnight and then removing it for partially skimmed milk. Goat's milk is naturally homogenized, so using a separator is generally necessary.\n5. Can I freeze my raw milk?\nWe do not recommend freezing cow's milk. The components of the milk break apart when the milk is thawed. However, if necessary, goat's and sheep's milk may be frozen for up to 30 days before cheese making. Note: Always thaw frozen milk in the refrigerator.\n6. If my cow or goat has taken antibiotics, how long must I wait before using its milk for cheese making?\nWe recommend waiting 3 full days after antibiotics or any other medicine has been administered because they will impede the activity of the culture.\n7. Do I need to add calcium chloride to raw milk?\nNo. It is usually not necessary because the calcium molecules have not been affected by pasteurization and homogenization. However, many cheese makers use calcium chloride to compensate for seasonal variations in the composition of their milk.\nWe recommend trying it if your recipe calls for it specifically or if you have problems with weak curds. If you decide to add calcium chloride, use 1/4 teaspoon per gallon of milk. Dilute it in 1 cup of cool, non-chlorinated water and add it when you begin heating your milk. Then, after adding your rennet, allow the milk to set 3-5 minutes longer than usual before cutting your curd. (We do not recommend adding calcium chloride to your milk when making Mozzarella. It may prevent your curds from stretching in the final step.)\nPasteurized/Homogenized Milk\nPasteurization consists of heating your milk to a specified temperature and then cooling it rapidly. We recommend that you heat it to 145F and hold it there for 30 minutes. If you are using it right away to make cheese, cool your milk as quickly as possible to your cheese making temperature. If you are not using it right away for cheese making, cool it as quickly as possible to 40F and refrigerate.\nHomogenization breaks up the butterfat into small globules so they will always stay integrated with the rest of the milk, instead of rising to the top. It slightly damages the milk, but the difference is negligible.\u00a0 For more info at our blog about homogenization- click here .\n1. Can I make cheese from pasteurized/homogenized milk?\nAll of our recipes work with most store bought milks. (It has always been our mission to make cheese making accessible to everyone.) You may use whole, skim or any percent of milk in our recipes. Whole milk gives a higher yield and tastes best because of the butterfat it contains, whereas skim milk gives you a drier cheese and a lower yield.\n2. What should I look for when buying my milk?\nWhenever possible, look for a local brand. This is because long, cold storage and transportation is problematic for milk. The closer the milk is to the source (cows, goats, etc.) the better for cheese making.\nAnother factor is the heat at which the milk has been pasteurized. If the milk clearly states that it is ultra-pasteurized (UP), do not purchase it. It has basically been stripped of friendly bacteria. More importantly, the alteration of the proteins is so severe that the milk will not form a proper curd. (See the General Questions section above and the Ultra-Pasteurized section below.)\nUnfortunately, even if your milk is not labeled UP, it may have been heated to just short of ultra-pasteurization. When milk has been pasteurized at a high temperature (anything over 172F), it is problematic for cheese making. The only way to know how high a processor has heated their milk is to call them. We encourage you to do this because we believe it will let the large processing plants know where we stand. Hopefully, you will find a good brand of milk at our list of good milks .\n3. Can I use skim milk to make cheese?\nYes, skim milk may be used in all our recipes. Follow the recipe, as given. However, your cheese will be drier, your yield will be lower and there will be less flavor. (Butterfat is an important flavor and texture component of cheese. In whole milk, the butterfat (cream) is usually 3.5-4%.)\nIf you have to use milk with little or no butterfat, you can usually add herbs or spices to your cheese to make it taste better. Also, there are some cheeses, like Parmesan, that are traditionally made with partially skimmed milk.\n4. Do I need to add calcium chloride to my pasteurized/homogenized milk?\nPasteurizing and homogenizing milk disturbs the calcium balance in it. The result may be a slightly softer curd than you want when making cheese. If your curd is fine, you may choose not to add calcium chloride. Otherwise, it is probably a good idea.\nUse the same amount of calcium chloride as the rennet that is needed in your recipe or 1/4 tsp. per gallon of milk. Dilute it in 1/4 cup of cool, non-chlorinated water and add it when you begin heating your milk. Then, after adding your rennet, allow the milk to set 3-5 minutes longer than usual before cutting your curd.\u00a0 (We do not recommend adding calcium chloride to your milk when making 30 Minute Mozzarella. It may prevent your curds from stretching in the final step.)\nUltra-Pasteurized Milk\nUltra-pasteurized (UP) is milk that has been heated to temperature range of 191-212F, for varying times.\nThis temperature and time combination is lethal to bacteria, killing virtually all that would be beneficial in cheese making.\nMilk processors are required by law to state on the label that the milk is ultra-pasteurized.\nFor more information about the UP process, see the General Questions section above. We are keeping a list of good milks that our readers have submitted from their own experiences.\n1. Why is milk ultra-pasteurized?\nProfit. We believe that the main reason milk is ultra-pasteurized is to increase the shelf life (from 18 days at normal pasteurization to 60 days). This allows the dairies to transport it across the country and to keep it on the shelves longer.\nThe dairies claim that heating milk to high temperatures protects us from bacteria. This is not true. Studies have shown that when there is bad bacteria in the milk, much of it is not eliminated by high temperatures. To the extent that it does work, however, it is cheaper to overheat the milk, destroying both good and bad bacteria, than it would be to cull the herds.\n2. What kind of cheese can I make if all I have is UP milk?\nWith some brands, you will be able to make the soft cheeses, including Fromage Blanc, Mascarpone, Fromagina, Cr\u00e8me Fraiche, Ricotta, buttermilk and yogurt. However, there will be no way to tell in advance if your brand of UP milk will work.\n3. My milk is not labeled UP, but it seems to be. Why?\nMany dairies are heating their milk beyond the normal 161F to just short of the UP limit. If you are experiencing a weak curd or other signs of high heat treatment, renew your efforts to find a good, local milk. Note: Anything over 172F can be problematic for making Mozzarella.\n4. What about ultra-pasteurized cream?\nMany of our recipes call for adding cream in small quantities. Because cream is mostly butterfat, when ultra-pasteurized (UP) cream is added to enhance the milk, it usually works. When adding cream to milk, it is best to first raise the temperature of the cream to 100F.\nGoat's Milk & Sheep's Milk\nIn some states, it is hard to find fresh milk because regulations prohibit farm sales. The best place to begin searching is at your local farmer's market. Or, you might try putting a notice at a health food market or co-op that you are looking for fresh goat's or sheep's milk.\u00a0 Of course, we are always expanding our list of good milks .\n1. Can I use goat's or sheep's milk in all your recipes?\nYes. After you milk, chill it immediately and use your milk within 3 days. The first time you try a recipe, we recommend following the directions as is. The taste will be different from cheese made with cow's milk.\nAfter you have some experience with the cheese, you may find that you need 10-20% less rennet and that you may lower the ripening temperature in the recipe by 3-5 degrees.\nWith raw sheep's milk, you will need to make accommodations for the high butterfat content. Top-stir\u00a0(stir the top 1/2\" of the milk with the bottom of your skimmer for a few extra seconds) when you add your rennet.\nAlso, when cutting the curds, make larger cubes to avoid losing butterfat; use half the amount of salt called for and exert only light pressure when pressing.\u00a0 For more info at our blog about using sheep's milk - click here .\n2. Can I freeze my goat's milk and sheep's milk?\nYes, but it will not work as well as fresh milk for cheese making. You will find that the curd will be much more fragile. Be sure to thaw it at refrigerator temperature. You will have much better luck with frozen sheep's milk than with frozen goat's or cow's milk.\n3. Is ultra-pasteurized goat's milk as bad as UP cow's milk?\nYes. It is just as damaged as any other ultra-pasteurized milk.\n4. Do I need to add calcium chloride?\nWe recommend adding calcium chloride to your goat's and sheep's milk only if you are experiencing weak curd formation. If it is raw, we suggest adding 1/4 tsp. per gallon. If it is pasteurized, we suggest adding 1/2 tsp. per gallon. Dilute it in 1/4 cup of cool, non-chlorinated water and add it when you begin heating your milk. Then, after adding your rennet, allow the milk to set 3-5 minutes longer than usual before cutting your curd. (We do not recommend adding calcium chloride to your milk when making 30 Minute Mozzarella. It may prevent your curds from stretching in the final step.)\nDry Powdered Milk\nThere are two kinds of powdered milk \u2013 nonfat and whole. Both may be used in cheese making. However, we recommend using the whole dry milk only in yogurt and the soft cheeses. (If you use it for aged cheese, it may taste rancid.)\nWhole dry milk has a shelf life of 6 months. Once opened, nonfat dry milk has a shelf life of one year at room temperature.\nYou may extend this shelf life by keeping your dry milk in the refrigerator or freezer.\n1. Do I have to reconstitute my dry milk before making cheese?\nYes. To reconstitute your milk, follow the directions on the package. If it says to leave it overnight, be sure to do it or your milk may not be completely dissolved in the water.\n2. Do I have to add cream to my nonfat dry milk?\nNonfat dry milk works best in cheese making when cream is added. Depending on your taste, it would be in the ratio of 8-16 oz cream to 2 gallons of milk. It does not matter whether you add half & half, light, heavy or whipping cream to your powdered milk. (When adding cream to milk, it is best to first raise the temperature of the cream to 90-100F.)\n3. Can I use the \"low heat, spray-processed\" dry milk I get at my local health food store\nYes. It needs to be dissolved in hot water and beaten with a whisk or an electric beater to get the lumps out. Blend 4 cups of powder with 15 cups of chlorine-free water. Let set for at least 6 hours. Add 1 cup heavy cream. (Avoid the 'high heat processed powder' used by some bakers.)\n4. Can I use powdered goat's milk or sheep's milk?\nYes. Many of our customers report that they are using powdered goat's milk successfully. However, be careful when buying it, because we have found that most of it is ultra-pasteurized. We do not know of a source for powdered sheep's milk. If you find one, please let us know and tell us about your experience with it.\n5. Should I use calcium chloride with my dry milk?\nYes. We recommend using calcium chloride because powdered milk has been pasteurized and homogenized. We recommend using 1/2 tsp. per gallon of milk.\nDilute it in 1/4 cup of cool, non-chlorinated water and add it when you begin heating your milk. Then, after adding your rennet, allow the milk to set 3-5 minutes longer than usual before cutting your curd. (We do not recommend adding calcium chloride to your milk when making 30 Minute Mozzarella. It can prevent your curds from stretching in the final step.)\nOther Variations\nORGANIC MILK\nWe entirely support the concept of organic milk. Unfortunately, our experience has been that organic milks at the supermarkets are usually ultra-pasteurized\u00a0 (see blog article - Organic Milk Often Comes From Big Dairy ). This includes many national name brands.\nIf you are lucky enough to have a local source for organic milk, by all means, use it. If not, we are currently maintaining a list of good milks .\n1. Where can I find organic milk that is not ultra-pasteurized?\nThere are many sources of organic milk online, some of which are not ultra-pasteurized. Before you spend a lot of money, however, you should know that the definition of 'organic milk,' is unclear. The New York Times recently noted that 'organic milk' essentially means \"it comes from a cow whose milk production was not prompted by an artificial growth hormone, whose feed was not grown with pesticides and which had 'access to pasture,' a term so vague it could mean that a cow might spend most of its milk-producing life confined to a feed lot eating grain and not grass.\"\nConsumer groups have expressed concern that the cows spend most of their time confined in cramped feed lots, with just enough \"access to pastureland\" to meet the letter of the law. The groups charge that many dairies fail to meet the law's intent. Pressure is growing on the USDA to more clearly spell out exactly how much access dairy cows should have to pasture grazing before their milk can be legally labeled as 'organic.'\nMost of the 'organic' milks we have tried are pasteurized at temperatures of 172F and above.\u00a0 For more info about organic milk- click here .\nLACTOSE-FREE MILK\nUnfortunately, we have yet to find a brand of lactose-free milk that is not ultra-pasteurized. If you have found one, please let us know and we will add it to our list of good milks .\n1. If I have lactose-free milk that is not UP, can I make cheese?\nWith a lactose-free milk, that is not ultra-pasteurized, you will be able to make our 30 Minute Mozzarella and Ricotta .\u00a0 However, you will not be able to make other cheeses. The process of cheese making is based on the bacterial cultures converting the lactose in milk to lactic acid. This process drives the conversion of liquid milk to curds, which eventually becomes cheese. This conversion also causes the moisture (whey) to be released. Without lactose in milk there is no food to support the bacterial cultures.\n2. How much lactose is there in cheese?\nThe good news for the lactose-intolerant is that there is much less lactose in cheese than in milk. A cup of cow's milk contains about 10-12 grams of lactose. An ounce of Swiss or Cheddar cheese contains less than one gram of lactose. Most of the lactose found in cheese is removed with the whey during the cheese making process. The rest is consumed by the culture in the first few weeks of aging.\n3. Is there less lactose in cheese I make myself?\nYes. Soft cheeses and yogurt have more lactose in them than the aged cheeses, but when you make your own, there is less lactose than in store-bought. When you make cheese yourself, you use real cultures. These cultures consume a lot of the lactose. Also, there are no additional milk solids added to your own soft cheeses and yogurt, as there are in most commercial brands.\nCANNED MILK\nWe have yet to find a brand of canned milk that has not been high heat treated.\nSOUR MILK\nWe do not recommend ever using sour milk for making cheese. You don't know what bacteria, other than the healthy ones, may have taken over. We prefer to control the bacterial count by using cultures .\nNON-DAIRY, SOY, NUT & RICE MILKS\nIt is possible to make gluten free, casein free yogurt and cheese using our cultures.\u00a0 In fact, we have a blog article with directions for making soy yogurt and soy cheese.\u00a0 We are always interested in posting your recipes for non-dairy \"cheese,\" so if you have one, send it to Moosletter@cheesemaking.com .\u00a0 (Pictures are welcome, as well.)\nFor more questions and answers about milk- click here .\nFeatured Items\n"}, {"score": 1864.995, "uuid": "64169529-0f2b-5bbb-9464-055007531bf7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300wb-33-21750", "target_hostname": "www.fieldandrurallife.com", "target_uri": "http://www.fieldandrurallife.com/magazine/2011/may-11/1790-unique-cow-pillow-improves-productivity-of-milk-production.html", "page_rank": 1.3480084e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Unique <em>Cow</em> Pillow Improves Productivity of <em>Milk</em> Production", "snippet": "\u201cResearch shows that a comfortable <em>cow</em> produces higher levels and <em>better</em> quality of <em>milk</em>.

I googled \u201cmilk+delivery+Boise\u201d and found Boise Milk \u2013 a company that home delivers milk, bread, eggs and a few other products including produce and coffee beans.\nLast Wednesday I got my first consignment.\n- 2 half gallons 1% hormone-free milk from Reed\u2019s Dairy , ($5.06)\n(the bottles are returned and reused)\n- 1 loaf whole wheat, preservative-free bread from Classic Harvest (from a neighbouring town), ($3.28)\n- 1 dozen cage-free, vegetarian-fed, hormone-free eggs from Naturally Nested (based in Washington and Oregon states). ($2.96)\nDelivery Charge \u2013 $1.75\nTotal \u2013 $13.05\nThe prices are reasonable, the flavour and quality are up to expectations. So far, so good.\nWhen I was a kid in India (Mumbai), each morning the milkman came from door to door with fresh raw milk. Or we could go to the tabela (cattle-shed) and watch the buffaloes and cows being milked before we made our purchase. There were more buffaloes than cows, actually. 70% of the milk consumed in India still comes from water buffaloes . Buffalo milk is fattier than cow\u2019s milk and yields creamier yogurt.\nWater Buffalo ( Wikimedia Commons )\nToday, it sounds idyllic and impossible. The cattle-shed is now a huge apartment complex. But, really, how do we know what the cows were fed or injected with other than the bales of hay strewn about? And where did that hay come from? What chemicals and processes were used to grow it?\nNow we buy milk in bottles or cartons and have to read and rely on labels and what the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration tell us. I don\u2019t trust these agencies as far as I can throw them, but I have little choice but to educate myself on what my options are.\nI had to make a choice between:\n1. Horizon brand organic milk from Winco and Kirkland from Costco \u2013 both labelled as organic, \u201chormone-free\u201d and \u201cantibiotic-free\u201d.\nand\n2. \u201cHormone-free\u201d milk supplied by Reed\u2019s Diary that comes from a town 3 hours from where I live.\nThere are dairy farms located closer to my city, but this is the only home delivery option.\nWhy buy milk at all?\nA bit of background here. A zillion years ago, I got very ill with jaundice. It took me three months to recover, and then I had a relapse \u2013 for another three months. I was asked to stay off dairy the entire time. I didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve never liked the taste of milk and homemade yogurt was about the only dairy product I missed. This was in India and soy substitutes weren\u2019t abundant back then. I\u2019m not a great soy fan either, so in terms of flavour and variety, I didn\u2019t mind the dairy-free diet at all.\nWhen I did recover, I realised a few things. I had lived most of my life before jaundice with colds and coughs. They disappeared. I used to have very sensitive skin, breaking into rashes for no identifiable reason. The rashes disappeared as well. Being dairy-free made me much healthier. For the next ten years, I was a strict vegan. I never had a single cold, no respiratory or skin infections. I was very fit and active in some high-intensity sports.\nThen I met the dude. He would coax me to share a cup of milky tea with him, a spoon of ice cream here, a cup of yogurt there. A very corrupting influence. I would have a bit of dairy, mainly homemade yogurt, but had soymilk with my cereal and calcium supplements. Two years ago, I had bloodwork done. My doctor saw the results and was very very unhappy with my calcium levels. \u201cDouble your calcium supplements.\u201d\nShe also recommended increasing my protein intake. I\u2019d reached a stage where I began to dislike soymilk almost as much as I disliked milk. So I switched. I started having 1% milk with my morning cereal and tea with milk twice a day in lieu of black. I was quite neglectful in taking my supplements, though. For the past year in fact, I haven\u2019t taken any.\nMy latest blood results show normal calcium levels. I\u2019ve also realised that I don\u2019t react as badly to milk as I used to. I get suggestions from vegans telling me how a vegan diet is nutritionally superior. They also point to valid ethical reasons to avoid consuming dairy (and eggs). Being vegan worked for me for 10 years. Not so much now.\nIt\u2019s a personal choice and everyone should find what works within their ethical and physical constraints. It\u2019s not an either-or solution. It is possible to find milk produced and marketed more humanely than they do in the corporate dairy sector. It\u2019s also a matter of deciding whether you want your calcium from tablets or from naturally produced milk. I prefer the latter, \u2018cos it also meets my protein requirements.\nIf you are vegan and can sustain your lifestyle, more power to you.\nWhat kind of milk?\nOrganic Milk\n\u201cCertified organic\u201d means agricultural products have been grown and processed according to United State Department of Agriculture\u2019s national organic standards, which for milk prohibits synthetic pesticide use in crop production and require outdoor access for animals in livestock production.\nThat is, the cows were fed \u201ccertified organic feed\u201d which is at least 95% \u201cpesticide-free\u201d and are allowed to roam and feed freely. It refers to \u201chow\u201d the milk is produced.\nAntibiotic-Free\nAntibiotics are not really an issue when it comes to milk. In both conventional and organic milk production, milk from cows that receive antibiotics is not used until tests show it is antibiotic-free. All milk in the U.S. is routinely tested to ensure no antibiotic content.\nHormone-Free\nThat, actually, is a misnomer. All animals and their products have natural hormones. What \u201chormone-free\u201d refers to is artificial growth hormones.\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture,\nA genetically engineered form of naturally occurring growth hormones, recombinant bovine somatotropin, or rBST, is given to a cow to increase milk production by as much as 20 percent.\nThe FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the use of rBST/BGH in 1993 for use in dairy cows after concluding there is no significant difference between milk from treated and untreated cows.\nMonsanto, which produces Posilac, which is one of the most widely used of these artificial hormones, has been suing small producers from Maine to Florida for stating that their milk is free of artificial growth hormones. They are objecting to the implication that rBST/BGH is unsafe. Well, the use of artificial hormones are banned in dairy production in the European Union and Canada.\nSamuel Epstein, professor emeritus of environmental medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, in his new book \u201c What\u2019s in Your Milk \u201d charges that rBGH milk can increase the risk of breast, colon and prostate cancer.\nDairy producers who do not use artificial growth hormones ( like Tillamook ) have been doing so without making it public so as not to be sued and intimidated by Monsanto with the government\u2019s collusion. They\u2019ve been working hard to take away our right to information as consumers.\nUnder pressure from Monsanto, the Pennsylvania agriculture secretary banned dairy producers who do not use artificial growth hormones from using the \u201chormone-free\u201d label. After a public uproar, the governor reversed that decision . Now, Monsanto has created a group called American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology (Afact) to campaign for removing \u201chormone-free\u201d labels in New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Utah, Missouri and Vermont.\nWhat about melamine?\nThe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s latest initiative against public health is its attempt to conceal where melamine-tainted infant formula came from .\nIs milk from cows fed with fish meal melamine tainted? we may never know.\nThere still are no reports of FDA inspection of domestic fresh milk for melamine, a noteworthy oversight given that dairy cows are sometimes fed fish meal, a product previously found to have melamine contamination. Or, maybe the FDA did inspect fresh milk and simply withheld the evidence as it did with its tests of infant formula. ( Source )\nWhile most of the melamine in the food chain in news reports has been linked to China , the entire food chain in the U.S. is melamine-tainted \u2013 in wheat gluten fed to cattle, and in a lot of the waste stream recycled into fertilisers. Melamine has a lot of adverse effects, mainly kidney failure.\nLocal and \u201chormone-free\u201d OR Organic from the supermaket?\nLocal milk that is labelled \u201chormone-free\u201d but not \u201corganic\u201d is a sort of compromise. You support local producers who are often more humane in their treatment of their animals and ensure that your dairy supply has a smaller carbon footprint as it comes from closer to home.\nIt\u2019s more expensive than regular milk, but cheaper than \u201corganic milk\u201d as the dairy producers don\u2019t have to pass the more stringent certification standards organic farms are subjected to.\nOrganic milk is ultimately is the \u201cgreenest\u201d, \u2018cos water, air and the soil and least tainted in the process of producing it. However, it does involve transportation from distant locations. However, in terms of health and safety, a whole slew of chemicals do get into our food chain anyway. Plus, organic milk is not necessarily healthier .\nAbout 60 percent of the milk produced in the U.S. goes into dairy products like ice cream and cheese, so while we can control where the milk in our home comes from, we do not really know where the cream in the Starbucks cup of coffee was sourced.\nSee our earlier post \u2013 Milk: Is It Overrated?\nIvy at Kopiaste has conferred upon us the Angel Award.

All milk and dairy products sold in Australia are potentially affected by the research, including Fon-terra's top-selling brands Mainland, Peters, Tip Top and Bega. A secret internal Fonterra memo, dated October 2000, reveals the New Zealand-based co-operative was warned by its own scientist of research suggesting autism, schizophrenia, diabetes and heart disease could be triggered by proteins found in all of its milk products and infant formulas. The memo, tendered in the High Court case, says there is \"growing evidence, but yet unproven, that peptides released from milk may be related to occurrence of some mental disorders\".\n\"If the media were ever able to assemble the information shown in this paper they could put an alarmist spin on the whole area of milk consumption,\" the internal briefing paper to directors of Fonterra, then known as the New Zealand Dairy Board, says. The research relates to a protein in A1 milk, which is the most commonly pro duced milk in Australia. The protein beta casein A1 is also allegedly a risk factor for childhood diabetes and coronary heart disease. The Australian and New Zealand Food Standards Authority says all milk sold in Australia is A1 type.\nIts spokeswoman said it had not warned the public because of ongoing legal action. The accusations are made by A2 Corporation, a New Zealand biotechnology company formed by dairy scientist Corran McLachlan in 2000. Dr McLachlan alleges Fonterra has secretly applied for patent applications on research linking A1 milk with autism. But Fonterra accuses Dr McLachlan of publicity-seeking for A2 Corporation's own milk, which does not contain the protein. Dr McLachlan plans to launch A2 milk in the New Zealand market as early as Christmas. \"This is a public interest matter,\" Dr McLachlan told The Australian. \"We believe this information is being suppressed and that is why we are risking so much money on a High Court case.\"\nDr McLachlan said he would be wary of feeding A1 milk to children. \"I would not encourage my kids to drink lots of milk,\" he said. \"Fonterra chief executive Craig Norgate denies any cover-up.\"There is nothing in the research that gives us concern. We would be the first to take a responsible public stand if we felt it was warranted.\" A2 Corporation wants the court to force Fonterra to reveal all research it has linking A1 milk to autism, and to put health warnings on its A1 milk. The Fonterra memo says University of Florida scientist Robert Cade reported in 1999 that children with autism and schizophrenia had extremely high levels of BCM-7, a compound produced by the digestion of A1 milk. The potential for A1 milk to trigger childhood (type 1) diabetes was first reported by Auckland diabetes specialist Bob Elliott in 1994 and later supported by further research in 1999.\nSecond from the Australian Newspaper\nThu, 14 Nov 2002 10:32:43 -0000\nCut out Dairy for Autistic Children\nBy Claire Harvey, New Zealand correspondent and Clara Pirani, Health Editor November 14, 2002\nParents should try cutting milk from the diets of autistic children, as dairy products might aggravate or even cause the condition, an autism expert has suggested. The advice came as dairy giant Fonterra fights accusations in the New Zealand High Court it is covering up research linking autism and other mental disorders to milk consumption by patenting the damning study.\nPaul Shattock, from the University of Sunderland's autism research unit in Britain in Australia for an international conference said about half of autism patients who tried a\nmilk-free diet had success. \"We suggest people consider excluding dairy products from their diet for three weeks to see if there's an improvement in their health,\" he said.\nUnder the Fonterra study, autistic children were fed A1-type milk, suspected of causing mental disorders, according to a patent application obtained by The Australian. The study found the consumption of A1-type milk, which is the majority of milk sold in Australia, \"may induce or aggravate neurological and mental disorders\", including autism and the learning disability\nAsperger's syndrome.\nBut New Zealand-based Fonterra says the evidence is not conclusive and insists its milk is safe to drink. The study involved New Zealand children being given either A1 milk or another strain of milk, known as A2. The children who drank the A1 milk showed \"a marked increase (up to 10-fold)\" of the peptide beta-casomorphin 6, which may aggravate or cause neurological and mental disorders, the study says. The problem did not occur with A2 milk.\nFonterra sought the worldwide patent because it wanted to investigate developing a milk which did not cause these problems. A2 Corporation is suing Fonterra, accusing it of suppressing evidence of a link between A1 milk and autism. Although the medical community remains cautious, Sydney mother Debbie Paulo says the autism of her four-year-old son Bailey improved dramatically on a diet free of milk, gluten and wheat.\nSome Articles on the A1 and A2 Milk\nIn summary, 'casein' has two molecular forms or configurations (very typical in chemistry or biology). They call one A1 and the other A2. What the folks in New Zealand have found is that one breed of dairy cows produce milk containing more of one type of A than another. So they have been breeding the cows so that the milk produced is nearly purely either A1 or A2. Most all commercial milk is a mixture of both types. Milk from Guernsey cows, goats, sheep, and humans produce milk that do not have the problematic casein peptides when digested.\nWhat this says to me is that if you could find just pure A2 milk, goat milk, etc, then, theoretically, IF there is the opiate problem (which there very well may not be in most people), you would not need enzymes with these types of milks because they don't produce the problem. However, you would need something containing DPPIV and other enzymes for casein and gluten if you drank the A1 type of milk. Good links come up if you search under 'beta-casein.'\n"}, {"score": 1858.0272, "uuid": "5eb92035-8a18-5749-a1d4-21613d110cef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-78-20995", "target_hostname": "jugalbandi.info", "target_uri": "http://jugalbandi.info/2008/12/milk-101/", "page_rank": 1.2067968e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Milk</em> 101 | jugalbandi", "snippet": "Back in Cochin, you can still have fresh <em>milk</em> delivered to your doorstep but who knows <em>what</em> the <em>cow</em> has been fed, how much water has diluted the <em>milk</em> <em>or</em> even how clean the <em>cow</em> <em>is</em>!

I googled \u201cmilk+delivery+Boise\u201d and found Boise Milk \u2013 a company that home delivers milk, bread, eggs and a few other products including produce and coffee beans.\nLast Wednesday I got my first consignment.\n- 2 half gallons 1% hormone-free milk from Reed\u2019s Dairy , ($5.06)\n(the bottles are returned and reused)\n- 1 loaf whole wheat, preservative-free bread from Classic Harvest (from a neighbouring town), ($3.28)\n- 1 dozen cage-free, vegetarian-fed, hormone-free eggs from Naturally Nested (based in Washington and Oregon states). ($2.96)\nDelivery Charge \u2013 $1.75\nTotal \u2013 $13.05\nThe prices are reasonable, the flavour and quality are up to expectations. So far, so good.\nWhen I was a kid in India (Mumbai), each morning the milkman came from door to door with fresh raw milk. Or we could go to the tabela (cattle-shed) and watch the buffaloes and cows being milked before we made our purchase. There were more buffaloes than cows, actually. 70% of the milk consumed in India still comes from water buffaloes . Buffalo milk is fattier than cow\u2019s milk and yields creamier yogurt.\nWater Buffalo ( Wikimedia Commons )\nToday, it sounds idyllic and impossible. The cattle-shed is now a huge apartment complex. But, really, how do we know what the cows were fed or injected with other than the bales of hay strewn about? And where did that hay come from? What chemicals and processes were used to grow it?\nNow we buy milk in bottles or cartons and have to read and rely on labels and what the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration tell us. I don\u2019t trust these agencies as far as I can throw them, but I have little choice but to educate myself on what my options are.\nI had to make a choice between:\n1. Horizon brand organic milk from Winco and Kirkland from Costco \u2013 both labelled as organic, \u201chormone-free\u201d and \u201cantibiotic-free\u201d.\nand\n2. \u201cHormone-free\u201d milk supplied by Reed\u2019s Diary that comes from a town 3 hours from where I live.\nThere are dairy farms located closer to my city, but this is the only home delivery option.\nWhy buy milk at all?\nA bit of background here. A zillion years ago, I got very ill with jaundice. It took me three months to recover, and then I had a relapse \u2013 for another three months. I was asked to stay off dairy the entire time. I didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve never liked the taste of milk and homemade yogurt was about the only dairy product I missed. This was in India and soy substitutes weren\u2019t abundant back then. I\u2019m not a great soy fan either, so in terms of flavour and variety, I didn\u2019t mind the dairy-free diet at all.\nWhen I did recover, I realised a few things. I had lived most of my life before jaundice with colds and coughs. They disappeared. I used to have very sensitive skin, breaking into rashes for no identifiable reason. The rashes disappeared as well. Being dairy-free made me much healthier. For the next ten years, I was a strict vegan. I never had a single cold, no respiratory or skin infections. I was very fit and active in some high-intensity sports.\nThen I met the dude. He would coax me to share a cup of milky tea with him, a spoon of ice cream here, a cup of yogurt there. A very corrupting influence. I would have a bit of dairy, mainly homemade yogurt, but had soymilk with my cereal and calcium supplements. Two years ago, I had bloodwork done. My doctor saw the results and was very very unhappy with my calcium levels. \u201cDouble your calcium supplements.\u201d\nShe also recommended increasing my protein intake. I\u2019d reached a stage where I began to dislike soymilk almost as much as I disliked milk. So I switched. I started having 1% milk with my morning cereal and tea with milk twice a day in lieu of black. I was quite neglectful in taking my supplements, though. For the past year in fact, I haven\u2019t taken any.\nMy latest blood results show normal calcium levels. I\u2019ve also realised that I don\u2019t react as badly to milk as I used to. I get suggestions from vegans telling me how a vegan diet is nutritionally superior. They also point to valid ethical reasons to avoid consuming dairy (and eggs). Being vegan worked for me for 10 years. Not so much now.\nIt\u2019s a personal choice and everyone should find what works within their ethical and physical constraints. It\u2019s not an either-or solution. It is possible to find milk produced and marketed more humanely than they do in the corporate dairy sector. It\u2019s also a matter of deciding whether you want your calcium from tablets or from naturally produced milk. I prefer the latter, \u2018cos it also meets my protein requirements.\nIf you are vegan and can sustain your lifestyle, more power to you.\nWhat kind of milk?\nOrganic Milk\n\u201cCertified organic\u201d means agricultural products have been grown and processed according to United State Department of Agriculture\u2019s national organic standards, which for milk prohibits synthetic pesticide use in crop production and require outdoor access for animals in livestock production.\nThat is, the cows were fed \u201ccertified organic feed\u201d which is at least 95% \u201cpesticide-free\u201d and are allowed to roam and feed freely. It refers to \u201chow\u201d the milk is produced.\nAntibiotic-Free\nAntibiotics are not really an issue when it comes to milk. In both conventional and organic milk production, milk from cows that receive antibiotics is not used until tests show it is antibiotic-free. All milk in the U.S. is routinely tested to ensure no antibiotic content.\nHormone-Free\nThat, actually, is a misnomer. All animals and their products have natural hormones. What \u201chormone-free\u201d refers to is artificial growth hormones.\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture,\nA genetically engineered form of naturally occurring growth hormones, recombinant bovine somatotropin, or rBST, is given to a cow to increase milk production by as much as 20 percent.\nThe FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved the use of rBST/BGH in 1993 for use in dairy cows after concluding there is no significant difference between milk from treated and untreated cows.\nMonsanto, which produces Posilac, which is one of the most widely used of these artificial hormones, has been suing small producers from Maine to Florida for stating that their milk is free of artificial growth hormones. They are objecting to the implication that rBST/BGH is unsafe. Well, the use of artificial hormones are banned in dairy production in the European Union and Canada.\nSamuel Epstein, professor emeritus of environmental medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, in his new book \u201c What\u2019s in Your Milk \u201d charges that rBGH milk can increase the risk of breast, colon and prostate cancer.\nDairy producers who do not use artificial growth hormones ( like Tillamook ) have been doing so without making it public so as not to be sued and intimidated by Monsanto with the government\u2019s collusion. They\u2019ve been working hard to take away our right to information as consumers.\nUnder pressure from Monsanto, the Pennsylvania agriculture secretary banned dairy producers who do not use artificial growth hormones from using the \u201chormone-free\u201d label. After a public uproar, the governor reversed that decision . Now, Monsanto has created a group called American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology (Afact) to campaign for removing \u201chormone-free\u201d labels in New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Utah, Missouri and Vermont.\nWhat about melamine?\nThe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s latest initiative against public health is its attempt to conceal where melamine-tainted infant formula came from .\nIs milk from cows fed with fish meal melamine tainted? we may never know.\nThere still are no reports of FDA inspection of domestic fresh milk for melamine, a noteworthy oversight given that dairy cows are sometimes fed fish meal, a product previously found to have melamine contamination. Or, maybe the FDA did inspect fresh milk and simply withheld the evidence as it did with its tests of infant formula. ( Source )\nWhile most of the melamine in the food chain in news reports has been linked to China , the entire food chain in the U.S. is melamine-tainted \u2013 in wheat gluten fed to cattle, and in a lot of the waste stream recycled into fertilisers. Melamine has a lot of adverse effects, mainly kidney failure.\nLocal and \u201chormone-free\u201d OR Organic from the supermaket?\nLocal milk that is labelled \u201chormone-free\u201d but not \u201corganic\u201d is a sort of compromise. You support local producers who are often more humane in their treatment of their animals and ensure that your dairy supply has a smaller carbon footprint as it comes from closer to home.\nIt\u2019s more expensive than regular milk, but cheaper than \u201corganic milk\u201d as the dairy producers don\u2019t have to pass the more stringent certification standards organic farms are subjected to.\nOrganic milk is ultimately is the \u201cgreenest\u201d, \u2018cos water, air and the soil and least tainted in the process of producing it. However, it does involve transportation from distant locations. However, in terms of health and safety, a whole slew of chemicals do get into our food chain anyway. Plus, organic milk is not necessarily healthier .\nAbout 60 percent of the milk produced in the U.S. goes into dairy products like ice cream and cheese, so while we can control where the milk in our home comes from, we do not really know where the cream in the Starbucks cup of coffee was sourced.\nSee our earlier post \u2013 Milk: Is It Overrated?\nIvy at Kopiaste has conferred upon us the Angel Award. While we aren\u2019t really enthused by awards ( read my bitchfest ), they make sense when they honour specific initiatives. This, therefore, is something we would like to pass on. Thank you, dear Ivy.\n1. The rules of this award are not to be taken lightly\u2013which means you can\u2019t give it to someone just because they did something really sweet for you.\n2. This award is to be given to bloggers that have shown they are angels by doing something humanitarian and heavenly to help others.\n3. You don\u2019t have to receive the award in order to give it. Feel free to copy it and bestow it on someone who is worthy of it. If you think they\u2019re an angel, they probably are.\n4. The award must be linked to a post about an organization or good cause you would like more people to be aware of.\n5. The rules for this award are to be shown when giving the award.\nWhen we think of \u201chumanitarian and heavenly efforts to help others\u201d, we\u2019re thinking of initiatives rather than people. I like the idea of pointing to specific posts by fellow bloggers who have enlightened me and helped me expand my horizons. They do not believe in grand gestures. They simply transform their worlds by practising what they believe in and sharing glimpses of it through their blogs. They believe in responsible consumption and pause to think of the impact of their lifestyles and choices on those around them.\nHere are some blogging initiatives that inspired me:\nHuman rights in Africa\nJeanne @ CookSister is passionate about a variety of causes, most notably in the developing world. Her latest effort is to raise money by blogging daily for a month for the UN Food Programme.\nFood photography tutorials\nA lot of bloggers take fantastic pictures. Some share their insights in ways that actually enlighten those aspiring to improve their own skills. The Food Photo 101 series from Nika @ Nikas Culinaria is a great example.\nFood politics and policy\nI have received a lot of my education on current food issues from Barbara Fisher\u2019s blog, Tigers and Strawberries , especially the segment titled Food in the News .\nEating local and tracing where your food comes from\nAnother blogger who I really enjoy reading is Deb of Austin Agrodolce . She epitomises local, conscious consumption. A pre-packed frozen dinner and her take on it. Priceless.

Between 1998 and 2005, there were over 10,000 documented outbreaks that contributed to 199,263 documented cases of foodborne illness. Raw milk was associated with 0.4 % of these cases. Again, there is no way to quantify whether any one of these foods is safer than another from this data, but it is clear that there is no basis for singling out raw milk as \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d or that investigating it was more costly.\nThe \u2018reputation\u2019 of American food has been far more damaged by its extreme industrial practices. There are increasing outbreaks of E.Coli 0157:H7 in minced beef, water, lettuce and spinach.(l) A study by researchers in Kansas State University in 2008 found higher levels of E.Coli 0157:H7 in the faeces of cattle fed a diet that included distillers grain, a by-product of ethanol, that is cheaper than corn. Confinement dairy operations are now routinely placed near ethanol production plants so the cows can be fed chemically polluted ethanol swill.\nAmerica\u2019s food reputation is not helped by the inclusion of growth hormones, GM ingredients, high levels of denatured vegetable oils, salts and sugars. There is an epidemic of obesity, diabetes and heart failure amongst the poorer section of their society that eats predominately cheap processed foods.\nThe USFDA is very opposed to raw milk production and constantly campaigns against it. Raw milk producers are often raided and consumers are warned against the \u2018dangers\u2019 of drinking raw milk. However, the consumption of raw milk continues to surge. This year the states of Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washington and Wyoming have introduced legislation to legalise the sales of raw milk. Similar Bills are being introduced in Iowa, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. Sales of raw milk are already allowed in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, South Carolina and Washington and most of the other states allow it to be sold on the farm.\nMuch of the research demonstrating the health benefits of raw milk was conducted prior to the 1960s and is therefore not indexed in databases such as PubMed. Modern experimental methods, tools of biochemical analysis, and methods of pasteurisation are needed to reevaluate the question to the satisfaction of academic scientists and policy experts \u2013 but there is a large gulf between something that is \u201cas yet largely unsubstantiated\u201d and something that has been refuted. The former implies that the claims have been partially substantiated and may be fully substantiated in the future.\nMany people who consume raw milk rely on anecdotal evidence of its superiority, including but not limited to their own experiences. Although anecdotal evidence is not sufficient to confirm a hypothesis, it is a valid means for generating one. Whether it is sufficient means for acting on one is a personal decision that every individual should have a right to make.\nThe fact is that there exists an overwhelming set of observations recorded in the scientific literature justifying interest in the benefits of raw milk.\nProtective components of unprocessed milk; Raw milk contains numerous components that assist in:\no Killing pathogens in the milk (lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, antibodies, medium chain fatty acids, lysozyme, B12 binding protein, bifidus factor, beneficial bacteria);1\no Preventing pathogens from being absorbed across the intestinal wall (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, mucins, fibronectin, glycomacropeptides, bifidus factor, beneficial bacteria);2 and\no Strengthening and modulating the immune system (lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, antibodies, hormones and growth factors).3\no Note that breast milk is raw. The safety and health benefits of breast milk have been well documented.4\nLoss of protective components due to pasteurisation; Many of these anti-microbial and immune-enhancing components are greatly reduced in effectiveness by pasteurisation.5\nLoss of nutrients due to pasteurisation; 6\nVitamin A\nBeta-lactoglobulin, a heat-sensitive protein in milk, increases intestinal absorption of vitamin A. Heat degrades vitamin A.7\nB Vitamins (incl. folate)\nSignificant percentages of Vitamins B6, B12, thiamin and folate are destroyed by heat treatment, although the specific percentages found vary from study to study.8 In addition, the folacin-binding protein in raw milk is rendered ineffective during pasteurization and processing.9\nVitamin C\nHeating leads to a loss of Vitamin C in pasteurized milk.10 \u201cWithout doubt, the explosive increase in infantile scurvy during the latter part of the 19th century coincided with the advent of use of heated milks and proprietary foods. \u2026 Hess [a pediatrician] was able to effect a cure for scurvy by providing raw milk or orange juice or potatoes.\u201d11\nVitamin D\nVitamin D is present in milk in protein-bound form, which may be lost during pasteurization.12\nHealth benefits of raw milk; Raw milk is the only food that has built-in safety mechanisms and numerous components to create a healthy immune system. The FSA 00/05/04 review acknowledges that long-term consumers of raw milk may be immunologically privileged as a result of this consumption.\nIn early studies involving humans, raw milk was shown to be superior to pasteurised in protecting against infection, rickets, and TB; and children receiving raw milk had better growth than those receiving pasteurized milk.13\nSeveral recent studies in Europe have found that drinking \u201cfarm\u201d (raw) milk protects against asthma and allergies.15\nInfants and premature babies on pasteurised human milk did not gain weight as quickly as those fed raw human milk; problems were attributed to pasteurisation\u2019s destruction of lipase.16 In another study, neonates given raw human milk had a markedly lower incidence of infection than those who received pasteurised human milk and formula.17\nThe study published in The Lancet (Riedler et al, 2001) indicates that children who drink \u2018farm milk\u2019 \u2013 independent of other types of exposure to farming environments \u2013 had a 52 percent lower risk of asthma, 57 per cent lower risk of having at least 1 wheeze attack in the past year, a 76 per cent lower risk of hay fever and an 85 per cent lower risk of allergies to cows, dust mites, cat dander and pollen. The authors noted that \u2018farm milk\u2019 is \u2018usually raw\u2019 and contains more bacteria than pasteurised milk. They suggested that \u2018the ingestion of non-infectious microbial components\u2019 in the raw milk or the milk\u2019s effects on intestinal flora might protect against the development of allergies.\nThere are many more anecdotal reports of potential benefits of raw milk that the scientific establishment has not yet addressed. Consumers, however, should not be at the mercy of funding institutions that control which of these issues are researched; they should have the right to put into their bodies the milk of their own choosing.\nThere is clearly no basis on which to claim raw milk is more dangerous than other foods commonly consumed. Producers and consumers of raw milk have a fundamental right to be treated fairly under the law that they are clearly being denied.\nOur government should be helping farmers to produce raw milk safely, and the FSAI should be providing us with a sober and balanced report on the safety and merits of raw milk rather than dismissing it without proper consideration. Making raw milk into a contraband product encourages illegal trade with all the consequent problems.\nClearly, the demand for raw milk \u2013 because of its superior taste and health value \u2013 is not going away. It fact it is a growing phenomenon.\u00a0 The government cannot do anything to ensure the safety of raw milk if it is illegal. Only an open system of private or governmental oversight and certification will ensure that consumers have access to safely produced, healthy raw milk.\nRegulations should be appropriate to the risk. We feel there are many more important threats to the public e.g. pesticides, added chemicals, high levels of sugar, salts, saturated and trans fats in processed foods. Trans fats are banned in Denmark. I understand that they are still legal here.\nWe suggest the establishment of a register of licensed producers who undertake an agreed, greater than normal surveillance of herd health and milk quality.\u00a0Best practice in other jurisdictions can be used as a model for such a protocol which with mandatory labelling e.g. \u201cmay contain pathogens\u201d.\nDirect sales are important economic routes to market for primary producers that should not be 'given away' without a very good reason. The future of food production in Ireland requires primary producers to receive as large a share as possible of the consumer\u2019s price.\nThe open and legal sale of raw milk produced according to high standards is the safest solution to the public demand for nature\u2019s perfect food.\nYours sincerely,\nSlow Food Ireland\nReferences\na.

We were astonished by the turnout \u2013 standing room only \u2013 approx 90 people some of whom had travelled from Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and West Cork. Catherine gave a balanced and informative account of her research and then she fielded a spirited Q & A session from the audience. The subject evoked strong feelings and the frustration of some members of the audience was evident. There was a strong feeling that there should be freedom of choice for those who feel strongly that unpasteurised milk from a clean herd can have health benefits for themselves and their children. Slow Food is requesting the FSAI and DAF draw up a protocol for best practice for dairy farmers who wish to produce raw milk for human consumption.\nDarina Allen\nLetter from Slow Food Ireland to the Minister for Agriculture on consumption of Raw Milk\nTuesday, 9th November 2010\nMinister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\nAgriculture House\nDublin 2\nDear Minister Smith\nShould the Government be considering changing the regulations on the production and sale of raw milk in Ireland we would like to emphasize that a significant lobby wish that the FSAI would ask the Department of Agriculture to draw up a protocol for best practice for the production and sale of unpasteurised milk to the 100,000 and Irish people who currently avail of it.\nI understand the corporate memory of Tuberculosis and Brucellosis in the 1950\u2019s but today standards are very different and people deserve a choice.\u00a0 Other EU countries have found a solution to this dilemma and it would seem grossly unfair if Irish people were to be deprived of the opportunity to choose.\u00a0 In the US, the sale of raw milk is permitted in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Washington. There is a growing body of science which support the value of drinking raw milk for health and to help to immunise against asthma and eczema. * see references\nI\u2019d appreciate your attention to this matter.\nYours sincerely,\n"}, {"score": 1829.6897, "uuid": "9f685563-44a7-5ef3-828d-b6a5588a547b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-69-33720", "target_hostname": "fiascofarm.com", "target_uri": "http://fiascofarm.com/goats/how_to_milk_a_goat.htm", "page_rank": 1.2084201e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Fias Co Farm- How to <em>milk</em> a <em>goat</em>", "snippet": "Udder Side <em>or</em> Half: The udder <em>is</em> separated into compartments.

Milking a goat is fairly simple; people of all experience levels and ages have been doing it since the dawn of history.\u00a0 If they can do it, so can you.\nFirst, what not to do:\nDo not pull down on the teat.\u00a0People hand milking cows sometimes pull down on the teat.\u00a0 If you do this with goats, you can damage their udder.\u00a0 Just manipulate the milk out of the teat without pulling down.\nDo not yank on the teat, for the same reasons stated above.\nDo not squeeze the udder, just squeeze the teats.\nTry not to get frustrated.\u00a0 When you are first staring out, this can be hard, but remember, the goat will pick up on your \"vibes\" and she may get impatient if you are upset.\u00a0 Be calm and this will help keep her calm.\nGetting to know the udder:\nYou should learn the proper terms for the parts of the udder so that you can better understand the instructions that follow.\nThe Udder: The whole organ is called the UDDER.\u00a0 This is singular.\u00a0 A goat has ONE udder, they do not have not \"udders\".\nUdder Side or Half: The udder is separated into compartments.\u00a0 A goat's udder has two compartments known as Sides or Halves. (A cow has four compartments and these are referred to as \"Quarters\".)\nAttachments: This is the term for the ligaments and such that hold the udder onto the goat. There are \"rear attachments\" and \"fore attachments\". \u00a0 These are important because \"good attachments\" hold the udder up high to the body (desirable) as opposed to \"poor\" or \"bad\" attachments that let the udder hang down low (not desirable).\u00a0 Low hanging udders are in danger of getting caught on objects and getting damaged and injured (I have seen udders with bad attachment get tore open).\u00a0 Udders with poor attachments also do not hold up to long term heavy milking as well as udders with better attachments.\u00a0 I'll put some photos of good udder attachment up on this site very soon.\nTeat: That's the appendage protruding from each side of the Udder that you squeeze to get the milk to come out.\u00a0 Teats can be all shapes and sizes.\u00a0 They can be long, short, thin or fat.\u00a0 There can be a definite distinction of where the udder stops and the teat begins (this is more desirable in choosing and breeding), or the teat and udder can almost seam to be one and the same (not really good in terms of choosing and breeding, but still milkable). The size of the teat will effect how easy it is and how long it will take to milk a goat.\nOrifice: This is the hole at the end of the teat that the milk comes out of.\u00a0 The orifice can vary in size. \u00a0The size of the orifice will effect how easy and how long it takes to milk the goat.\u00a0 Usually it is a good size and milk comes out in a reasonable manner.\u00a0 Occasionally you get a doe with small orifices and she will take longer to milk.\u00a0 There is really nothing that can be done about does with tiny orifices, you just have to face the fact they take longer to milk. If you are buying a goat to milk, you may want to milk her before buying her to check the size of her orifices \u00a0 I usually don't even bother milking does with tiny holes 'cause my hands ache by the time I get through milking them, but since I have a lot of does, I have the luxury that I can pick and choose which does I want to milk.\nTo Start:\nFirst, read the information here: Milking Procedure and Sanitation\nNow, think about what you are doing and trying to do. \u00a0 You are trying to move the milk out of the teat by manipulating it down through the teat and out the orifice (and hopefully into your bucket).\nTo do this you must:\nClose of the top of the teat.\nSqueeze the teat starting at the top and move the squeezing motion down the teat, thus moving the milk down the teat and out.\nTake your time and don't get frustrated.\u00a0 Speed and aim will come with practice.\nStop thinking and worrying and just milk the goat.\nThis is really important... don't over think..., as Larry so bluntly put it when he was learning, \"Just milk the damn goat.\"\u00a0 He was over thinking and getting frustrated and finally realized, just stop thinking and milk the goat.\u00a0 After that is when he started to really get it.\nThe Glove Lesson:\nSome goats are more patient than others and so I developed a way to learn and practice milking a goat without the goat.\u00a0 This will give you the basic feel of what to do and give you an opportunity to practice your technique.\nThere is not real right or wrong way to milk as long as you are getting the milk out of the goat without injuring them.\u00a0 I tend to milk with just three fingers, holding my pinky back.\u00a0 This is because I have really big hands and my pinky would get milk all over it.\u00a0 When I am milking a goat with really small teats, I may milk with just two fingers.\u00a0 You should milk however you are comfortable and what works for you.\nFill a strong disposable glove with water and tie it off.\nNow you have a practice udder with different sized teats to learn on.\u00a0 By squeezing the glove, you can make the \"teat\" bigger.\nPlease note that in the following photos I am manipulating the glove with one hand while taking the photo with the other hand.\u00a0 I have to lay the glove down on the desk so I can take the photos.\u00a0 When you practice, you will hold the glove in one hand and manipulate with the other.\nHold the glove in one hand.\nPlace your hand up against the udder.\nRight where the teat meets the udder, place your thumb and index finger, and use them to close off the teat from the udder.\nWhen you squeeze the teat, you wan the milk to go toward the orifice of the teat and not back into the udder.\nFirst tighten your index finger and as that tightens, start tightening your middle finger.\nYou are moving the milk down the teat. With the real teat that has an orifice, the milk will start coming out.\u00a0 In the case on the glove udder, the water is moving into the tip of the \"teat\" and causing pressure.\u00a0 Since you are holding the glove with your other hand, you will be able to feel if the water is \"back washing\" into the glove.\u00a0 If you can feel water \"back washing\"... moving back into the glove... you are not closing the top of the teat off enough.\nSee now I have tightened all the fingers that I use when milking and am holding my pinky off to the side.\u00a0 Remember I have huge hands so you may be able to use all your fingers.\u00a0 There is not right or wrong here.\nYou can see the tip to the \"teat\" enlarging as the pressure increasing.\u00a0 If I were milking a real goat, I would be getting a nice strong stream of milk.\nOne final good squeeze and I can see that all the milk has been moved to the tip of the teat.\u00a0 If I were milking a real goat, the teat would now be empty of milk.\u00a0 I have completed one squeeze\nNow, release all your fingers, including the index and thumb and allow more milk to move into the teat. (In this case with this glove, the milk in the tip moves back into the \"teat\" and in a real goat,who's teat is now empty, the milk will fill from the udder into the teat.\nRepeat, repeat, repeat....\nIn the case of a real goat, keep going until the udder is pretty much empty\nWhere to sit:\nYou can milk standing up or sitting down.\u00a0 You can use a stand or not, but I'll tell you, it is much easier and much more comfortable to milk with the aid of a milk stand. A stand will hold the does head in the headgate, keeping her steady and in one place and brings the udder to a comfortable level for you to sit and milk. Click here for plans on how to build a milkstand.\nYou can sit on either side of the doe, reaching under her belly to milk, or even sit behind the doe and milk from between her legs if you wanted to.\u00a0 There is no set rule but is it most common to milk from the right side.\nI milk from the goat's right side.\u00a0 I place my chair next to the milkstand on the right side of the doe near her shoulder area\u00a0and sit facing toward the doe's udder/rear area.\u00a0 I will reach under the doe's belly with my right hand to milk her left side and milk her right side with my left hand.\nPreparing to milk\nPlease read this page: Milking Procedure, Sanitation & Equipment\nGetting Rhythm\nThere is no set rule on how you must milk.\nNormally milking is done with both hands in an alternating right, left, right, left sort of pattern.\u00a0 The nice thing about doing it this way is while you squeeze the left teat, the right is filling and then when you squeeze the the right teat the left is filling.\u00a0 Using this rhythm gives you a built in \"teat filling period\".\u00a0 With this pattern, you get the classic \"squirt squirt squirt\" rhythm that comes to mind when you think of someone hand milking.\nThough.... you could milk both teats at the same time squeezing at the same time if you wanted to, but then you have to pause to let the teats fill.\nNo one says you must milk with both hands and milk both teats at the same time.\u00a0 You could milk out one side completely, by squeezing, letting fill, squeezing, etc, until the side is empty, and then switch to the other side.\u00a0 Of course milking this way will take twice as much time.\nI milk with both hands in the classic pattern of left, right,t left, right.\u00a0 Because my right hand is stronger than my left, I usually finish milking the left side before the right is done.\u00a0 When this happens I usually finish milking the right side with my right hand.\u00a0 By the time the right is done the left has accumulated some more milk, so I'll do a few more squeezes of the left side, and then a few more on the right.\nFinishing off\nOnce I get to the point that the doe feels pretty much out of milk, I do like a kid and \"bump her bag\".\u00a0 Bag bumping is how the kids tells their mom to let down her milk,\u00a0 She may be holding back on you and so you can gently bump her bag in a manner similar to a kid to naturally tell her to give up some more milk, if she has anymore.\u00a0 Kids can be kind of ruff in their demands for milk.\u00a0 Watch them nursing sometimes and see how they bump at their mother's udder.\u00a0 I never bump as hard as a kid and the doe still lets her milk down for me.\nThe way I \"bump\" the bag is in a sort of pushing, massaging way.\u00a0 I cup the udder in my full hand with the heal of my hand resting on the udder right below where it attaches to the belly and in front of the teats.\u00a0 This puts the heal of my hand in the same spot the kid's forehead hits when they bump their mom. I then massage the udder a little with my full hand and then push up a few times, with the heal of my hand, in a bag bumping motion on her udder.\u00a0 I then return to milking.\u00a0 I then \"bump her bag\" again and milk out what is left.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes you can really feel the milk being let down.\u00a0 Sometimes the doe may have let all her milk down while you were milking.\u00a0 Every doe is different.\nWhen the sides are pretty much all milked out you are done.\u00a0 I just stop, dip the teats ( see teat dip ).\u00a0 I never worry about getting every last drop out because the doe is constantly making milk and the moment I am done milking, she is already making more.\nWhat about \"Stripping the Teat\" to finish off milking?\nYou sometimes hear about \"stripping\" the last milk out of the teat.\u00a0I NEVER do this because it involves pulling the teats and I feel it is unnecessary and could possibly damage the udder.\u00a0I have never had a case of mastitis caused by not stripping out the last of the milk and I have been milking goats since 1995.\u00a0 I milk until I pretty much cannot get any more milk out, and then I just stop and dip the teats ( see teat dip ).\nIf you find this site useful, please donate to help support it.\nThis web site contains over 300 pages of information\nSearch this site:\n"}, {"score": 1828.3171, "uuid": "784a2c72-98f9-544e-a93d-743527d30fee", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0901wb-18-03461", "target_hostname": "www.passionatehomemaking.com", "target_uri": "http://www.passionatehomemaking.com/2009/04/a-new-non-dairy-milk-alternative-hemp-milk.html", "page_rank": 1.1970851e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "A New Non-Dairy <em>Milk</em> Alternative: Hemp <em>Milk</em> | Passionate Homemaking", "snippet": "Many say raw <em>cows</em> <em>milk</em> <em>is</em> too dangerous.

Apr 21, 2009 at 8:58 am #\nOn the Weston Price website you should read about hemp. According the them it should NEVER be consumed by us.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt by Sally Fallon:\nHemp: Not For Human Consumption\nA number of companies are now selling hemp oil, toasted and shelled hemp seeds and granola bars containing hemp seeds. This is not a good use for hemp. Hemp may be appropriate for domestic animals and birds, but it should not be used for human food. In China, where cultivation of hemp originated, hemp oil was used occasionally, but there are no references in the Chinese literature to the use of hemp seeds as food for human beings. (Simoons, Food in China, 1991)\nHemp oil has been promoted in recent years as a \u201cheart healthy\u201d oil that is rich in essential fatty acids and low in saturated fat. Hemp oil is indeed highly unsaturated, and this is exactly why it should be avoided. Hemp oil is over 75 percent polyunsaturated, containing about 55 percent omega-6 fatty acids and about 20% omega-3 fatty acids. It contains only about 10 percent saturated fatty acids and 10 percent monounsaturated fatty acids. It is, therefore, highly unstable and prone to oxidation; and the high content of linoleic acid makes it particularly unsuitable for human consumption. Diets containing an excess of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-6 fatty acids, have been linked not only to heart disease but also to cancer and autoimmune disease.\nAn additional problem derives from the fact that hemp oil may contain traces of cannabinoids and these substances can then turn up in the urine of those who consume it. In one research project, seven adult volunteers purchased hemp oil from a health food store and ingested 15 milliliters each. Urine samples taken at 8, 24 and 48 hours after ingestion were positive for THC. (Journal of Analytical Toxicology October 1997 21(6):482-485.) If these volunteers had been obliged to give a urine sample to their employers, they would have failed their drug test.\nBecause hemp oil is highly unsaturated, it makes an excellent base for paints and varnishes. In fact, there is no need to consider hemp for human consumption except in small quantities for medicinal purposes. There are many good fats and oils that humans can use and there are many good industrial uses for all the by-products of the hemp plant. Let\u2019s not make the same mistake with hemp that we have made with soy, by promoting its inappropriate use as a human food.\nReply\nAnna Apr 21, 2009 at 1:05 pm #\nI love Sally\u2019s book, \u201cNourishing Traditions\u201d but I have to completely disagree with her statement about Hemp Products. Scientists have found traces of the uses of Hemp both as industrial and consumption amongst the earliest of man. There are minimal traces of THC if anything in Hemp. I believe it to be propaganda when people want to make these claims.\nHowever, I respect your opinion and will do more research into your claims. I think it\u2019s important to be knowledgeable of both sides.\nReply\nLindsay Apr 21, 2009 at 3:22 pm #\nI agree. There does not seem to be any foundation to her statements against hemp\u2026plus she is mainly addressing hemp oil. Hempmilk is made from the seeds.\nReply\nAnna Apr 21, 2009 at 7:47 am #\nI\u2019m so glad you decided to look into this non-dairy option. My husband and I used to buy it in bulk from New Seasons when they would have it on sale (2 for $6). In the last couple of months we have been making it at home. We love to share it with our family members who are vegan and I am looking into experimenting with making chocolate hemp milk! I\u2019ll let you know how it turns out!\nIt\u2019s is also my favorite milk to use for oatmeal, it gives it a great sweet nutty flavor without having to add any brown sugar.\nReply\nKristin Apr 21, 2009 at 7:44 am #\nI definitely prefer soy milk to cow\u2019s milk, but this is an interesting alternative that I\u2019ll have to try out!\nI used to have horrible allergies all year long that I was on two prescription medications twice a day to treat. My husband(who will officially be a doctor in a couple of weeks)told me that consuming dairy, even just milk byproducts such as casein in crackers, can increase a person\u2019s sensitivity to common allergens (including our two dogs). I switched from cow\u2019s milk to soy, cut out all dairy byproducts in my other foods, and was able to stop taking BOTH medications within a month!!! Every once in a while I\u2019ll let myself eat a serving of dairy cheese(once a week or so) but most of the time I eat completely vegan.\nIf anyone reading has allergies, I would encourage you to give hemp milk, soy milk, almond milk, or rice milk a shot and to cut dairy out of your diet.

I wanted to reduce his intake of plant estrogens. Hemp milk is pretty tasty to me, but he didn\u2019t like it \u201cfull-strength\u201d, so I mix 1/2 soy milk with 1/2 hemp milk and now he loves it. It\u2019s relatively expensive, so we buy it by the case to get a discount.\nReply\nBeth C Apr 21, 2009 at 7:14 am #\nAll my kids are really allergic to milk. I didn\u2019t want to pump them full of soy because of the estrogens. We primarily drink almond milk, but recently I bought a container of hemp milk and was pleasantly surprised. It is much nicer to use in baking because it is a lot thicker than almond or rice milk. I don\u2019t think any of us preferred drinking it over the other kinds, but the baked goods I made with it were superior to using the other milks. I made a batch of pancakes for the kiddos using the hemp milk and they came out so fluffy and soft!\nlizzykristine @ Uplifted Eyes Apr 21, 2009 at 6:32 am #\nWe can\u2019t have dairy at the moment, so hemp milk has been a little lifesaver for us.

I have tried a couple different brands of hemp milk, and Living Harvest is by far the best-tasting one. The other brand I have tried is called Hemp Bliss, and in my opinion, it tasted very bad. Something about it I just could not stomach. I ended up letting in sit in the fridge for many weeks, and having to throw it away! So, while I found Living Harvest very yummy, I advise all of you to be careful with other store-bought hemp milks. So, I think you are very smart to make your own hemp milk, Lindsay. Milk alternatives (almond, soy, rice, oat, etc) can be awfully expensive, especially the ones with the purest ingredients. uyyyyyyyyy\u2014my cat just stepped on the keyboard and typed that.

Rather, I will discuss flavor, process and the law regarding cheeses made from raw milk and cheeses made from pasteurized milk.\nFirst, we will review pasteurization. This process was developed in the 1860s by Louis Pasteur, a French microbiologist, and became widespread by the end of the 19th century as milk production and processing shifted from small farms to a bigger, more industrial scale.\nThere are two common methods of pasteurization: the first is heating the milk to 144F and holding it there for 30 minutes. The other, and unfortunately more common method is to heat the milk to 160F and hold it there for 15 seconds. The latter method is faster and cheaper, but does tend to diminish the flavor of the fresh milk. The first method alters the flavor less and is thus more favorable from a flavor perspective.\nIn the United States, each state has its own rules regarding the production and sale of raw milk and raw milk products, but imported cheeses must all conform to the same federal regulations, which is simply that they have to be aged for 60 days at a temperature of no more than 35F in order to be imported. This means that many types of cheeses, like French Brie de Meaux are not old enough to be imported into the United States. Fortunately, there are plenty of raw cheeses that are. Some of which, like Parmigiano-Regianno have always been raw. There are no pasteurized versions of this cheese, although the process for making it does include cooking the curd and adding confusion. Many cheeses from Switzerland are also always raw, but they are also often partially-skimmed, cooked-curd cheeses and the labeling can be vague.\nFlavor is really what we are after when it comes to cheese though. Raw milk cheeses are more flavorful, just like raw milk is more flavorful. This is because it has not been altered by heat, but also because most raw milk is of very high quality. It has to be. There is no process to salvage lesser quality product. But milk quality matters with pasteurization too. High quality milk pasteurized by the longer method will be richer and tastier than lower quality, homogenized, ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk also maintains its microbial content, which keeps the milk from spoiling and can help it better become cheese. Cheese is made by encouraging certain microbial activity and inhibiting others. Raw milk already has favorable microbial activity for cheese-making. That good bacteria is what can be beneficial for us too. The probiotic content of commercial yogurt products is simply a replacement of what was in the milk naturally in the first place. But flavor cannot replaced. Raw milk cheeses and very high-quality pasteurized cheeses taste full and grassy, an indication of what the animals had been eating.\nAnd this is what gets at the heart of raw milk cheese. The milk is flavorful because of the beta carotene in the plants that the cows, goats and sheep eat. Raw dairies can generally keep a very close eye on quality because they are almost always smaller and the animals almost always pastured. A raw dairy is not something that can be done successfully on a large scale because storage and handling are too difficult and pasture is relatively more scarce. This brings us to safety. It should be noted first of all that most milk-borne illnesses arising today are caused by post-production contamination like listeria, not bacteria originally present in the milk. Pasteurization cannot protect against this. Good cheeses possess a unique bacterial makeup as a result of the production process, beginning with the milk. Cheese is not an inherently dangerous product raw or pasteurized, it is just prone to occasional contamination, just like most foods. This is human error, don't blame the cheese.\nThere is a lot of disagreement over the potential risks of eating raw milk cheese, but much of it is due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of cheese and the bacterial life that makes it possible, raw or pasteurized. The contamination that occurs in any type of dairy is usually caused by carelessness. Most of the systems we have today keep milk pretty safe, raw or otherwise. These are serious public health considerations that must be made to regulate and keep safe any type of milk and milk product and this is where politics enters the scene.

The female off-springs are then cross-bred to get a better milk yielding breed that the farmers keep. The male off-springs are often sold to raise money for the group members.\nThe project which started in 2001 is being implemented in Matheniko, Bokora and Pian counties.\nMrs. Regina Nacuge, the chairperson of Nabokat goat group said that milk had helped her feed her grand children left behind after he son was shot dead by a stray bullet during a cordon and search operation.\nShe said that the project had also given the women a sense of livestock property ownership in a society where all four-legged sellable livestock is the property of the man.\n\u201cAs members, we have developed a sense of ownership for the goats since no one can claim for them. It is not like the traditional cows, goats and sheep which by culture is owned by the men,\u201d Nacuge said.\nShe said that each of the goats she owned produced half a litre of milk in the morning and another half in the evening.\n\u201cI milk them very early in the morning, take them for grazing and later milk them late in the evening,\u201d Nacuge said.\nShe said that the offspring also grew faster, fattened over a short period of time and fetched better prices in the market.\n\u201cA six months old improved goat fetches between sh50,000 to sh100,000 while local goats of the same age cannot even fetch sh20,000,\u201d Nacuge observed.\nShe said that the project subjected them to a six months training during which they learnt group dynamics, fund raising skills, book keeping, drug administration, disease diagnosis and how to access markets for their products.\nMrs. Paska Nakong and Paula Pedo, both members of the group said that they also used the milk to feed their children and grand children.\nThey said that milk often became rare in the villages during rain season when the herds were taken to far away grazing areas to avoid away them eating the crops grown close to the homesteads.\nThe beneficiaries said that persistent livestock theft posed a great threat to the project, whose goats were delicate to keep.\n\u201cWe are even forced to share our rooms with the goats at a time when we suspect that livestock thieves are hovering around,\u201d Nacuge said.\nKADP project manager, Mr. Michael Kuskus said that the projects was started under a food security scheme that included cereal banking, improved goat keeping and community based animal health care management.\nHe said that the objective was to reduce reliance on firewood as the alternative source of income to the families and also help fight malnutrition which was rampant in families.\n\u201cIt was also to enable the women to be independent and be able to plan, take their own decisions and own property,\u201d Kuskus said.\nHe said that loans were extended to cereal banking groups that enabled them to purchase produce during harvest season.\n\u201cThey later sell the produce during the period of scarcity. This has not only helped the communities to maintain food security. It has also helped to reduce the prices of foodstuff during the period of scarcity,\u201d Kuskus said.\nHe observed that none of the members of the cereal banking groups ever collected firewood for sale during the intensity of the drought.\n\u201cThey relied on their stocks and even made profits that they shared amongst themselves,\u201d Kuskus said.\nHe said that his organisation was a transition from the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) which first came to Uganda in 1979 to help Church of Uganda to provide relief and rehabilitation programmes in Karamoja during the unprecedented famine..\nHe said that the organisation planned to acquire goats for 30 more women groups of ten members each under the European Union Humanitarian Organisation (ECHO) project and another 100 goats under the DanChurchAid second phase programme.\nHe said that the objective of the project was to cover a large area in the two districts so as to fight food insecurity.\n\u201cWe work directly with the veterinary departments in the two districts. The staff assists the women whenever the goats fall sick,\u201d Kuskus said.\nHe however said that the community based animal healthcare workers trained by KADP also provided first aid services to the pastoralists in the villages.\nDanChurchaid and the Humanitarian Aid Department of the European Commission are funding a drought preparedness program in the districts of Moroto and Nakapiripirit, which is helping the Karimojongs in developing their traditional way of living as agro-pastoralists. DanChurchAid has invited two journalists from the leading Ugandan newspapers, The Daily Monitor and The New Vision, to see the work of the local partner KADP.\nDanChurchAid has a Framework Partnership Agreement with ECHO enabling DanChurchAid to implement ECHO funded projects worldwide in a broad range of sectors including water and sanitation, food aid, shelter, non-food item to humanitarian mine action.

Kefir is a probiotic beverage made with either Kefir Grains or a powdered Kefir Starter\u00a0Culture.\u00a0 There are two types of grains, Milk Kefir Grains and Water Kefir Grains.\u00a0 Milk (dairy) Kefir Grains can be used with cow milk, goat milk or coconut milk.\u00a0 Water Kefir Grains can be used with sugar water, juice or coconut water.\u00a0 Kefir Grains consist of bacteria and yeast existing in a symbiotic relationship.\u00a0 The term Kefir Grains describes the look of the culture only.\u00a0 Kefir Grains contain no actual \"grains\" such as wheat, rye, etc.\u00a0 Our kefir grains are grown in filtered water and organic sugar.\nQ.\u00a0 What ingredients go into creating milk kefir grains?\nA. Our milk kefir grains are grown using only organic milk.\nQ.\u00a0 Does milk have the same benefits as water kefir?\nA. Generally speaking water kefir is slightly less concentrated than milk kefir and therefore some individuals find they must consume more water kefir than they would milk kefir.\u00a0 However, due to water kefir's water (rather than dairy) base and great taste when flavored, it is easy to consume larger amounts of water kefir.\nQ.\u00a0 What strains of yeast and bacteria does kefir contain?\nA. How many strains are present in the kefir depends on a number of factors including the type of culture used.\u00a0 For example, milk kefir made with a powdered kefir starter culture generally will contain 7-9 strains of active yeast and bacteria (see the individual product descriptions for the yeast and bacteria make up of the different brands of kefir starter).\u00a0 Milk kefir grains generally contain a larger number of both live bacteria and yeast (more than 50 strains).\u00a0 Click here for more information on the numerous strains of yeast and bacteria that are generally known to comprise kefir made with milk kefir grains .\nQ.\u00a0 I want to consume kefir but I'm allergic to dairy.\u00a0 What can I\u00a0do?\nA. You might try water kefir.\u00a0 Water kefir contains no dairy and are grown in filtered water and organic sugar (please note: water kefir grains are processed in a facility where dairy products are processed).\nQ.\u00a0 Does milk kefir contain gluten?\nA. No, milk kefir grains are grown in organic milk (please note: milk kefir grains are processed in a facility where gluten based products are processed).\nQ.\u00a0 Are milk kefir grains reusable?\u00a0 Is the powdered Kefir Starter Culture reusable?\nA. Yes, milk kefir grains are reusable.\u00a0 Once a batch of milk kefir has finished culturing, simply remove the kefir grains and place them in fresh milk.\u00a0 The powdered kefir starter culture is also reusable several times.\u00a0 Simply reserve a small portion (see instructions on packet) of your batch of kefir and add it to fresh milk to culture the next batch.\nQ.\u00a0 How long do dairy kefir grains last?\u00a0 How long does the powdered Kefir Starter Culture last?\nA. If cared for properly, milk kefir grains have an unlimited life span and can be used repeatedly to make kefir.\u00a0 Powdered kefir starter culture can be used a number of times but the exact number is dependent on several factors including personal hygiene, cleanliness of the container and utensils (soap is detrimental to kefir culture), etc.\nQ.\u00a0 What is the process to make milk kefir?\nA. The kefir grains or powdered starter culture are placed in milk and allowed to culture for a period of time on the counter (preferably at room temperature).\u00a0 Once the milk has turned to kefir, remove the kefir grains and place them in fresh milk.\u00a0 In the case of powdered starter culture, you will retain a small amount of the kefir to use as a starter culture for the next batch.\nQ.\u00a0 How long does it take to make kefir?\nA. Kefir generally takes 12-48 hours to form.\u00a0 The exact amount of time will vary depending on environmental factors the most important of which is temperature.\u00a0 Cold retards the fermentation process so kefir will form more slowly in a cold area (and can be all but stopped by placing the grains in milk in the refrigerator).\u00a0 Heat speeds the process so kefir will form more quickly in a warm area and will be more likely to over-culture.\u00a0 We recommend standard room temperature whenever possible.\u00a0 Allowing the kefir grains to remain in milk longer than 48 hours risks starving the kefir grains and potentially damaging them.\nQ. If my house is colder than 68 degrees, will it take longer for the milk to kefir?\nA. Yes, cold retards the fermentation process so it will take longer to make kefir.\u00a0 Alternatively, if your home is warmer than standard room temperature, the process will take less time.\nQ. Do I\u00a0need to stir the kefir during the culturing process?\nA. You can stir the kefir while it's culturing but it's not necessary.\nQ.\u00a0 How will I\u00a0know if I've successfully made kefir?\u00a0 How do I\u00a0know if I shouldn't drink it?\nA. When milk turns to kefir it thickens.\u00a0 We always recommend that you refrain from consuming anything that looks, smells or tastes unpleasant.\nQ.\u00a0 What does kefir taste like?\nA. The taste of finished kefir varies greatly based on the type of milk used (cow versus goat for example) and the length of time it is allowed to culture.\u00a0 Generally speaking, milk kefir has a sour taste and an effervescent texture.\u00a0 If you have not tried kefir before, we would recommend purchasing kefir at the grocery store to try (generally located next to the milk and yogurt)\u00a0before purchasing a starter culture.\nQ. How long can I store the kefir in the refrigerator?\nA. This is dependent on a number of factors including how cold your refrigerator is and whether you use raw or pasteurized milk (raw milk will last longer).\u00a0 We always recommend that you do not consume anything that looks, tastes or smells unpleasant.\nQ. Do I need to rinse the grains off between batches?\nA. No. There is no need to rinse the grains unless they stop making kefir effectively (which can sometimes be attributed to a build up of yeast on the grains).\u00a0 If it becomes necessary to rinse the grains, use filtered water if possible to avoid chemical exposure.\nQ. Do I\u00a0need to make a full quart of kefir each time or can I\u00a0make smaller batches?\nA. Making a full quart is not required.\u00a0 Many of our customers find that making one pint batches better meets their needs.\nQ. Do I\u00a0need to wash the jar/container between batches of kefir?\nA. We recommend using a clean container for each batch of kefir.\nQ.\u00a0 Why should I\u00a0make my own milk kefir?\nA. In the case of milk kefir grains, homemade kefir will contain a larger number of probiotics than will commercial kefir (which is made with a powdered starter culture).\u00a0 Regardless of whether you use kefir grains or a powdered starter culture, making your own kefir costs significantly less than commercial kefir and you have complete control over the milk you use (e.g. organic, non-homogenized, raw, etc.).\nQ.\u00a0 How can I\u00a0flavor my kefir?\nA. Kefir can be blended with fresh or frozen fruit after the culturing process is complete.\u00a0 Be sure to remove the kefir grains or a portion of the kefir (if using a powdered starter culture) prior to adding fruit.\nQ.\u00a0 How can I\u00a0use my kefir.\nA. Milk kefir can be used in a variety of ways.\u00a0 In can be consumed as a beverage (either plain or flavored with fruit).\u00a0 It can be added to smoothies.\u00a0 It can even be drained (using cheese cloth or a yogurt cheese maker) to make kefir cheese.\u00a0 Just mix with some herbs and spread on crackers, bread, etc.\u00a0 Delicious!\nQ.\u00a0 What is the difference between Kefir Grains and Powdered Kefir Starter Culture?\nA. There are three primary differences between Milk Kefir Grains and Powdered\u00a0Milk Kefir Starter:\nKefir grains have a larger number of probiotics (about 30) than the powdered starter culture (about 6).\nWith proper care, kefir grains can be used for many years to make kefir.\u00a0 Powdered starter culture can be reused for a number of batches (a small amount of each batch is used to culture the next batch). Exactly how many batches is dependent on a number of factors (e.g. personal hygiene, cross contamination, container and utensil cleanliness, etc.).\nPowdered kefir starter culture has a smaller initial investment cost than do kefir grains.\nQ.\u00a0 Can the milk kefir grains (aka dairy kefir grains) be cultured in goat milk or coconut milk?\nA. We have many customers who have reported excellent results using our milk kefir grains to make goat milk kefir and coconut kefir.\nQ.\u00a0 Can I use UHT\u00a0(ultra-high temperature aka ultra-pasteurized) milk to make kefir?\nA. We do not recommend using UHT\u00a0milk with any of our starter cultures (including yogurt, buttermilk, kefir and cheese starters).\u00a0 The process by which UHT\u00a0milk is pasteurized leaves the milk essentially dead for purposes of culturing and therefore you are likely to have less than satisfactory results when using it to make cultured foods.\nQ.\u00a0 Can I\u00a0use non-homogenized milk to make kefir?\nA. Yes.\u00a0 Non-homogenized milk makes wonderful kefir.\u00a0 The only difference you will see when making kefir with non-homogenized milk is that the cream will rise to the top of the kefir just like it does with the milk so the top layer of the kefir will be more yellow in color.\nQ.\u00a0 Can milk kefir grains be used with raw milk?\nA. Yes, milk kefir grains can be used with raw milk.\u00a0 The method/instructions are the same regardless of whether your milk is pasteurized or raw.\nQ.\u00a0 How much alcohol does milk kefir contain?\nA. As with all cultured and fermented foods, a small amount of naturally occurring alcohol is typically present in the finished product.\u00a0 Although the amount will vary from batch to batch, for the typical brewing period, the amount should be quite small (usually less than 1%).\u00a0 Of course if you suspect your milk kefir contains higher levels of alcohol and you do not want to consume higher levels of alcohol, don't drink it!\u00a0 We always recommend you never consume any product that looks, smells or tastes unpleasant.\nQ.\u00a0 Will kefir grains multiply?\nA. Milk kefir grains are known to multiply, but at times they are reluctant to do so and therefore we do not guarantee kefir grains will multiply. Even if they do not multiply, with proper care, kefir grains can be used repeatedly to brew milk kefir.\u00a0 Generally kefir grains take 6-8 weeks following rehydration to being multiplying.\nQ.\u00a0 What supplies do I\u00a0need to make milk kefir?\nA. List of Milk Kefir Supplies:\nMilk Kefir Grains or Powdered Milk Kefir Starter Culture\nMilk:\u00a0We recommend using organic milk\nA container: We recommend using a glass container such as a canning jar\nA covering for the jar while the kefir is culturing: We recommend a cloth or coffee filter secured with a tight rubber band (to keep the bugs out!)\nA non-metal spoon to stir the kefir\nA lid for the jar once the kefir is finished culturing\nA way to remove the kefir grains once the kefir is finished culturing: Click here for ideas on how to remove the kefir grains from the finished kefir\nQ. Will kefir culture in a dark cupboard or in a window (exposed to light)?\nA. Kefir doesn't require light to culture properly.\u00a0 Be sure to never expose the culturing kefir to direct sun.\nQ.\u00a0 How do I\u00a0take a break from making milk kefir?\nA. To take a break from making milk kefir simply place the kefir grains in the fresh milk, place a tight lid on the container and place it in the refrigerator.\u00a0 The cold will greatly retard the culturing process and they can keep this way for up to several weeks.\u00a0 If at the end of that period you require more time, simply repeat the process with fresh milk.\u00a0 If you desire a longer break period, you can also dehydrated your milk kefir grains by placing them on unbleached parchment paper in a safe location (room temperature) for several days until they are completely dry.\u00a0 Then place the dehydrated kefir grains in a secure container (a zip-style plastic bag, glass or plastic jar, etc.) and in a cool dry place.\u00a0 They should keep this way for at least 6 months.\nQ. If I\u2019m making other cultured foods (yogurt, sourdough, kombucha, etc.), how far apart do I need to keep the kefir culture?\nA. When items are being actively cultured (and don\u2019t have lids), we suggest keeping a distance of at least several feet (and preferably more) between items.\u00a0 When your cultured items are being stored in the refrigerator with tight fitting lids, there is no need to keep distance between them.\nQ.\u00a0 Where can I\u00a0view the instructions for making milk kefir from kefir grains?\nA. Click here to view our milk kefir instructions.\nQ.\u00a0 I\u00a0just received my kefir grains and they don't appear to be working?\nA. Upon arrival, milk kefir grains generally take a few cycles to properly kefir milk.\u00a0 Regional differences in milk mean the kefir grains must adapt to the new milk before they can create kefir.\u00a0 We recommend using small amounts of milk during this time period to reduce waste.\u00a0 Simply place the kefir grains in about a cup of milk and allow it to sit for up to 48 hours.\u00a0 If the milk has not turned to kefir, discard the milk and place the grains in fresh milk.\u00a0 Repeat this process until the milk kefirs reliably within 12-48 hours (the time will vary depending on the temperature).\nQ.\u00a0 My kefir seems to have separated into curds and whey.\u00a0 Why did this happen?\nA. Kefir will separate if it over-cultures a bit.\u00a0 To prevent this from happening in the future, simply reduce the amount of time you allow the kefir to culture or reduce the temperature at which it is culturing (i.e. move it to a cooler area of the house).\nQ.\u00a0 I've been making kefir for awhile but the taste of my kefir seems to have changed?\u00a0 Why?\nA. The taste and texture of kefir depends on several factors including time the kefir cultures, the temperature of your home and the ratio of kefir grains to milk.\u00a0 If the temperature of your home has changed (e.g. changing of the seasons), you may need to adjust the amount of time you allow the kefir to culture.\u00a0 If your kefir grains have multiplied, then you may find the taste and texture of the kefir change.\u00a0 To remedy this problem, simply remove a portion of the kefir grains and either start a second batch of kefir or find them a good home.\nFREE eBOOK!\nGet a free copy of our Kefir Recipe eBook when you subscribe to our newsletter. 60+ Recipes for using Kefir to make breads, dips, smoothies, dressings, desserts and more!\nRelated Articles & Recipes:\n"}], [{"score": 1816.2845, "uuid": "3a5138ef-c125-5e19-aa61-5216d949d7b8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1616wb-48-29293", "target_hostname": "www.bigjohnspfiseattle.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bigjohnspfiseattle.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=162:raw-milk-cheeses&catid=22:newsletter-articles&Itemid=262", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Raw <em>Milk</em> Cheeses", "snippet": "Raw <em>milk</em> cheeses and very high-quality pasteurized cheeses taste full and grassy, an indication of <em>what</em> the animals had been eating.

The <em>milk</em> <em>is</em> flavorful because of the beta carotene in the plants that the <em>cows</em>, <em>goats</em> and sheep eat.", "explanation": null, "document": "01 March 2010\nDan Klempner\nCheeses made from raw milk are more available now than they were in years past, which raises the question about the differences between cheese made from raw milk and cheese made from pasteurized milk. There is a lot of politics involved, and I will not get into that here. Rather, I will discuss flavor, process and the law regarding cheeses made from raw milk and cheeses made from pasteurized milk.\nFirst, we will review pasteurization. This process was developed in the 1860s by Louis Pasteur, a French microbiologist, and became widespread by the end of the 19th century as milk production and processing shifted from small farms to a bigger, more industrial scale.\nThere are two common methods of pasteurization: the first is heating the milk to 144F and holding it there for 30 minutes. The other, and unfortunately more common method is to heat the milk to 160F and hold it there for 15 seconds. The latter method is faster and cheaper, but does tend to diminish the flavor of the fresh milk. The first method alters the flavor less and is thus more favorable from a flavor perspective.\nIn the United States, each state has its own rules regarding the production and sale of raw milk and raw milk products, but imported cheeses must all conform to the same federal regulations, which is simply that they have to be aged for 60 days at a temperature of no more than 35F in order to be imported. This means that many types of cheeses, like French Brie de Meaux are not old enough to be imported into the United States. Fortunately, there are plenty of raw cheeses that are. Some of which, like Parmigiano-Regianno have always been raw. There are no pasteurized versions of this cheese, although the process for making it does include cooking the curd and adding confusion. Many cheeses from Switzerland are also always raw, but they are also often partially-skimmed, cooked-curd cheeses and the labeling can be vague.\nFlavor is really what we are after when it comes to cheese though. Raw milk cheeses are more flavorful, just like raw milk is more flavorful. This is because it has not been altered by heat, but also because most raw milk is of very high quality. It has to be. There is no process to salvage lesser quality product. But milk quality matters with pasteurization too. High quality milk pasteurized by the longer method will be richer and tastier than lower quality, homogenized, ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk also maintains its microbial content, which keeps the milk from spoiling and can help it better become cheese. Cheese is made by encouraging certain microbial activity and inhibiting others. Raw milk already has favorable microbial activity for cheese-making. That good bacteria is what can be beneficial for us too. The probiotic content of commercial yogurt products is simply a replacement of what was in the milk naturally in the first place. But flavor cannot replaced. Raw milk cheeses and very high-quality pasteurized cheeses taste full and grassy, an indication of what the animals had been eating.\nAnd this is what gets at the heart of raw milk cheese. The milk is flavorful because of the beta carotene in the plants that the cows, goats and sheep eat. Raw dairies can generally keep a very close eye on quality because they are almost always smaller and the animals almost always pastured. A raw dairy is not something that can be done successfully on a large scale because storage and handling are too difficult and pasture is relatively more scarce. This brings us to safety. It should be noted first of all that most milk-borne illnesses arising today are caused by post-production contamination like listeria, not bacteria originally present in the milk. Pasteurization cannot protect against this. Good cheeses possess a unique bacterial makeup as a result of the production process, beginning with the milk. Cheese is not an inherently dangerous product raw or pasteurized, it is just prone to occasional contamination, just like most foods. This is human error, don't blame the cheese.\nThere is a lot of disagreement over the potential risks of eating raw milk cheese, but much of it is due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of cheese and the bacterial life that makes it possible, raw or pasteurized. The contamination that occurs in any type of dairy is usually caused by carelessness. Most of the systems we have today keep milk pretty safe, raw or otherwise. These are serious public health considerations that must be made to regulate and keep safe any type of milk and milk product and this is where politics enters the scene. The dairy industry's main lobbying group is big and powerful and they represent the interests of very large-scale production. Much of the debate ends up in this policy arena where lobbying groups vie to exert maximum influence. Fortunately, despite all of this, we are still lucky to be able to enjoy some of Europe's fine cheeses the way they have been made for centuries and get to know the complexities and potential that top-class milk can achieve.\nYou can find which of our cheeses are made from raw milk on our website .\u00a0 Look at the column on the far right of the Cheeses at a Glance table for the milk type listed for your favorite cheeses.\nContact Us\n"}, {"score": 1813.02, "uuid": "9685ddae-2417-5e60-8d0a-abe26ab7e742", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0401tw-10-12814", "target_hostname": "www.kitchenstewardship.com", "target_uri": "http://www.kitchenstewardship.com/2010/06/23/the-real-story-of-homogenized-milk-powdered-milk-skim-milk-and-oxidized-cholesterol/", "page_rank": 1.2014356e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "The Real Story of Homogenized <em>Milk</em>, Powdered <em>Milk</em>, Skim <em>Milk</em> and Oxidized", "snippet": "While I agree that eating and drinking <em>what</em> <em>is</em> closest to <em>what</em> God made <em>is</em> ideal, I live in a state where it <em>is</em> illegal to purchase raw <em>milk</em>, <em>milk</em> sold for pet consumption has charcoal dye added, AND <em>cow</em> shares are prohibited by the language of our law.", "explanation": null, "document": "June 23rd, 2010 \u00b7 71 Comments \u00b7 Science of Nutrition\nWelcome!

First it was subjected to pasteurization, then homogenization, then oxidation. Will the -ations ever end?\nThe question for us milk drinkers is of course: when does a change cause a nutritional problem?\nSome say that pasteurization already kills too many healthy enzymes; see more on the different kinds of milk pasteurization in yesterday\u2019s post.\nIs Homogenized Milk Dangerous?\nI joined the crowd warning of the health dangers of homogenized milk when I talked dairy fats in the fall. This post is an important update to that one!\nThere\u2019s a theory out there, propagated by Kurt Oster, that says that the process of breaking the fat globules into such small pieces that they remain suspended in the milk, homogenization, is a leading cause of arteriosclerosis and heart disease. I\u2019ve even seen it listed as one of the top three causes of heart disease, along with trans fats and chlorinated water. 1\nHowever, even Mary Enig, co-author of Nourishing Traditions and author of Eat Fat, Lose Fat disagrees with Oster\u2019s findings. She says :\nIn essence, Oster\u2019s theory replaces cholesterol as the cause of heart disease with another mechanism, summarized as follows:\nHomogenization causes a supposedly \u201cnoxious\u201d enzyme called xanthine oxidase to be encapsulated in a liposome that can be absorbed intact.\nXO is released by enzymatic action and ends up in heart and arterial tissue where it causes the destruction of a specialized protective membrane lipid called plasmalogen, causing lesions in the arteries and resulting in the development of plaque.\nTranslation: the fats damaged by homogenization can be passed through the walls of the digestive system directly into the circulatory system, where they \u201cscratch\u201d the artery walls, making a problem area to which cholesterol flocks (cholesterol is like the ambulance or mechanic in your circulatory system, repairing issues in the arteries). This forms plaque and causes heart disease, and it\u2019s all because the fat globules got too small.\nBut.\nHe was wrong.\nMary Enig says so here , and I also spoke with a professor in the department of Food Science & Human Nutrition and Department of Animal Science at my favorite agricultural college, Michigan State University. Dr. John Partridge is a Dairy Food Extension Specialist, and he had this to say about concerns about oxidation of homogenized milk:\nHomogenization is done by forcing milk through a small geometry valve at very high pressures (1500-2500 psi).\u00a0 The effect of this treatment is to break the natural fat globule (average size ~10 micrometers) into\u00a0 much smaller fat globules (average size <2 micrometers).\u00a0 In doing this the fat globule membrane is broken and the surface area of the new fat globules is much larger than the native globules.\nWithin the first 10-20 seconds after homogenization, proteins and segments of the original membrane form a new membrane on the surface of the smaller fat globules.\u00a0 The addition of the protein to the surface of the fat globules and the reduction in the size of the globules results in the reduction in the ability of the globules to float to the top of the milk.\u00a0 During this process, the milkfat is not exposed to air as the process is done in an air tight system containing only milk.\u00a0 Milkfat is made up of 98% triglycerides, which are extremely stable to changes during processing.\u00a0 The only way that milk will spoil faster after homogenization is if the homogenizing system is not properly cleaned and sanitized.\nAnother factor that may be thrown out is the xanthine oxidase.\u00a0 Dr. K. Oster proposed a theory in 1971 that xanthine oxidase released from the milk fat globule membrane during homogenization was a contributor to atherosclerosis.\u00a0 To this end, I would have you read the following review article .\nThere is not much if any support for this theory but a lot of people are still using it to scare customers into paying higher prices for cream-line milk.\nDr. Partridge drinks homogenized store milk himself, although he said he has to take the jugs from the back to avoid the \u201clight oxidized flavor that is prevalent in milk stored under direct fluorescent lighting.\u201d This is not a man who drinks milk without consciousness.\nDr. Mary Enig finishes with this, although I\u2019d like to see more foundation for her claims:\nThe fact that Oster\u2019s theory has been disproven does not mean that the homogenization process is benign. During homogenization there is a tremendous increase in surface area on the fat globules. The original fat globule membrane is lost and a new one is formed that incorporates a much greater portion of casein and whey proteins. This may account for the increased allergenicity of modern processed milk.\nWith all that under my belt, I\u2019m much less afraid of homogenized milk than I used to be. I have some distrust in it, because it is quite a man-made process, so when I can stick to the natural, I will. I won\u2019t, however, pay double price for unhomogenized milk unless there are other upgraded benefits from the store milk! (See this milk descriptions post for what all the terms on the jugs mean.)\nDoes Skim Milk Contain Powdered Dry Milk?\nThe Weston A. Price Foundation says, \u201cAll reduced-fat milks have dried skim milk added to give them body, although this ingredient is not usually on the labels.\u201d I\u2019ve seen this claim in multiple other places as well, but it\u2019s incredibly outdated and plain wrong.\nI\u2019m the type of person who calls companies to ask questions (in case you haven\u2019t already noticed that). When I realized that the claim of \u201cindustry standard\u201d might be incorrect, I decided to call a few brands that sell milk to see what I could find out.\nFrom Meijer:\nI had not heard of that being an industry standard, and I can tell you that none of Meijer\u2019s dairy suppliers add anything to the milk.\nFrom Bareman\u2019s, a local Michigan dairy:\nNon-fat dried milk (skim milk powder)\u00a0 is not currently added to our, or any of our direct competitors lowfat or fat free milks (skim milk) and, any direct addition of a dried milk powder would require it to be included on the label to meet current United States labeling requirements. In the 1950\u2032s and 60\u2032s many states required nonfat dried milk to be added to lowfat (<1% butterfat) and fat free milks (skim) under the guise of making it a nutritionally superior product to the unfortified product but, in reality its real purpose was to help support a higher demand for non-fat milk powder and ultimately a higher total milk price for the producer.\u00a0 Eventually, pressure from industry, regulators and nutritionists prevailed and all states who had \u201csolids fortification\u201d requirements in their dairy laws repealed them.\nI would like to see the WAPF update their position on this issue, as their information clearly was correct decades ago but is sorely outdated.\nDoes Powdered Dry Milk Contain Oxidized Cholesterol?\nThe reason for the scare about powdered milk being added to skim and lowfat milk is this :\nA note on the production of skim milk powder: liquid milk is forced through a tiny hole at high pressure, and then blown out into the air. This causes a lot of nitrates to form and the cholesterol in the milk is oxidized\u2026\u00a0 Oxidized cholesterol contributes to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, to atherosclerosis. So when you drink reduced-fat milk thinking that it will help you avoid heart disease, you are actually consuming oxidized cholesterol, which initiates the process of heart disease.\nHere\u2019s the hole in that argument: nonfat dry milk has little to no cholesterol to begin with, so consuming any \u201coxidized\u201d cholesterol that may or may not be present there is probably no more hazardous to your health than eating an apple that is starting to brown (that process is oxidation, too).\nHere is a a conversation with an animal science trained former farm gal on oxidized cholesterol with her convincing arguments.\nI had been making my yogurt with store whole milk since coming around to the idea of full fat dairy. Once I decided there was no inherent problem drinking skim milk, other than the fact that it\u2019s missing the fat, I began making my yogurt with skim milk and added cream from our grassfed raw milk. I figured that even if homogenization isn\u2019t as bad as it\u2019s being made out to be, I can still get the fat to be organic, which helps my family avoid most of the potential toxins and hormones, which tend to collect in the fat.\nI\u2019d love to see more of you!\u00a0 Sign up for a free email subscription or grab my reader feed .

Otherwise, a common metabolic disorder, best known as milk fever, even at the subclinical level, could keep your cows from reaching optimum milk production.\nThe most critical period of the year for a dairy cow is the transition from late gestation to early lactation. In these five to six weeks, many changes trigger substantial hormonal changes. At the same time, the cow's metabolism diverts nutrients toward milk production. To further complicate the early transition period, her feed intake is at its lowest around calving time, and will not reach its maximum until several weeks after she freshens.\nCausing milk fever, or hypocalcemia as it is known clinically, is the cow's inability to meet calcium demand for colostrum and milk production. Even if you don't see a clinical case of milk fever in your herd, you could still have issues that impact a cow's overall health status, milk production and your bottom line. Lack of appetite, poor dry matter intake in early lactation or a flat lactation curve may indicate a subclinical case resulting in lost milk production.\nWhen the condition is severe, clinical milk fever can even be fatal. Surviving animals, as well as those with subclinical milk fever, have increased risk of retained placentas, displaced abomasums and mastitis. In all cases, affected cows will produce less milk.\nNumerous studies have confirmed that changing a cow's diet before she calves reduces the risk for clinical and subclinical milk fever. This involves lowering what is known as the dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD). A calculation is required to determine the DCAD value of a diet. Formulas are used to calculate DCAD, and results are often expressed in milliequivalents per kilogram of dietary dry matter (mEq/kg). Lowered DCAD generates a mild metabolic acidosis. This acidosis can be confirmed by testing urinary pH. A lower urine pH, which is more acidic, indicates whether the pre-calving ration is doing what it should be doing.\nMany studies have researched the impact of lowering DCAD in the precalving diet. Recently, a group of researchers performed a meta-analysis using 22 published studies covering 75 treatment groups of cows.\nA meta-analysis is a mathematical procedure combining results from a series of independent studies dealing with the same subject. This analysis allows more precise findings since the number of cases used to generate conclusions is greater. It lets researchers refine findings and generate clearer conclusions.\nAmong the objectives of this metaanalysis were comparing various DCAD equations for their impact on clinical milk fever and urinary pH, and evaluating the impact of lowering DCAD on clinical milk fever and urinary pH.\nResults confirm the effectiveness of lowering DCAD to decrease urinary pH and clinical milk fever, and suggest a slight modification to the usual DCAD equation.\nAs well, lowering DCAD increases calcium available to cows before and at calving, the meta-analysis confirmed. This reduces the clinical milk fever risk. By measuring urinary pH of close-up dry cows, you can monitor the effectiveness of the ration at preventing milk fever.\nA dairy cow's normal urine pH is around 8.0. When she is fed a low-DCAD diet, previous recommendations called for urinary pH in the 6.0 to 7.0 range. However, this meta-analysis concludes a urinary pH of about 7.0 would be a reasonable goal.\nReaching a urinary pH of 6.2 would require a very low DCAD and would only slightly further reduce clinical milk fever incidence, the analysis reveals. This excessive acidification would provide just a modest benefit in milk fever prevention compared with reducing urinary pH to about 7.0.\nAnother key aspect of acidification urinary pH below 7.0 is its effect on dry matter intake. As the DCAD value of the pre-calving ration decreases, so does dry matter intake. You have to weigh the benefits of milk fever prevention from lowering DCAD against problems that could arise from reduced dry matter intake before calving.\nIf low DCAD pre-calving rations are part of your herd's close-up dry cow program, using a pH meter or pH paper strips to monitor your cow's response can be invaluable.\nThe way a cow handles the transition period will define the success of her next lactation. The origin of several metabolic disorders, including milk fever, can be traced back to this period. Implementing sound management practices and understanding the challenges specific to a transition cow will help reduce the effect of these disorders.\nFormulas for calculating DCAD in dairy feed\nThe usual formula to calculate DCAD is (K + + Na +) - (Cl- + S2-). Other equations are sometimes used. The meta-analysis showed a slight modification to the usual DCAD equation should better reflect the lesser acidifying ability of sulphur. The meta-analysis identified the equation [(Na + K) - (Cl + 0.6 S)] as the most highly correlated to clinical milk fever incidence and urinary pH. When this equation is used to calculate the DCAD value of a pre-calving ration, the usual target of -100 mEq/kg needs to become 0 mEq/kg instead.\nReferences:\nE. Charbonneau, D. Pellerin, and G. R.

The goats mangled her white tiger nectarine tree, gnawed her redwood fence posts, gorged on her grapevines, swallowed her Victorian tea roses like candy and tore off the waterproofing mat under the siding on her house.\nShe lives a half-mile from Interstate 280 in the Excelsior district of San Francisco, up the street from Taqueria La Iguana Azul and Geneva Pizza, on a block of pastel Marina-style houses that stand shoulder to shoulder. Reluctant to attract stares from her neighbors, she regularly loads the animals into her car and drives them to John McLaren Park, nearly a mile away, to exercise them.\nAnd in September, one of the goats spent several weeks covering Ms. Kooy with bruises and scratches whenever she approached its udder, an experience that she described on her blog as \u201cpure milking hell.\u201d\nMs. Kooy, an ebullient 41-year-old general contractor, is undeterred. \u201cI think we need to relax our cultural walls that relegate agriculture to the country, and that includes small livestock,\u201d she said on a recent Friday morning, clomping in rubber boots through her 1,000-square-foot yard, where she also tends an organic vegetable garden, six fruit trees and four egg-laying hens. \u201cIt\u2019s part of re-envisioning food production in the urban landscape. You just have to keep things clean.\u201d\nDairy goats are becoming the next frontier for some urbanites eager to produce their own food. Although the animals are illegal in many cities, including New York, Ms. Kooy unearthed a San Francisco health department clause that allows two goats per household, and aspiring goat-keepers in Portland, Ore., and Berkeley, Calif., have been thrilled to discover similar goat-friendly ordinances. In other cities, enthusiasts are lobbying for more-lenient regulations.\nBut despite the best efforts of their boosters, goats seem unlikely to enjoy the popularity achieved in recent years by backyard chickens and rooftop bees. Even in cities and towns where those creatures are permitted, the idea of braying ruminants as neighbors crosses a line for many residents and civic officials, who consider them dirty, noisy, smelly or simply unsightly.\nBrooke Salvaggio and her husband, Dan Heryer, both 28, had been farming in the backyard of Ms. Salvaggio\u2019s grandfather\u2019s house in a residential section of Kansas City, Mo., for two years before they introduced three miniature goats to the two-and-a-half-acre property in 2009. It was only a matter of months before the city\u2019s animal control department showed up and they were fined $300.\nThe couple requested a variance, which led to a heated hearing at City Hall, where, Ms. Salvaggio recalled, \u201call these neighbors we\u2019d never talked to appeared out of the woodwork and were giving these god-awful testimonies.\u201d\nOne of them, Kathleen Oades-Kelly, a therapist whose backyard abutted the makeshift farm, said that she was alarmed by the animals\u2019 bothersome noise and odor, as well as the chance that there might be as many as nine kids living there each spring after the goats were bred.\nJohn Kelly, her husband, fretted that the goats might bring parasites to the neighborhood, and bemoaned that he could see them from his screened-in porch while he was drinking coffee and reading the newspaper during the warmer months.\nOther neighbors worried that the goats might affect their property values. The city voted against allowing Ms. Salvaggio and Mr. Heryer to keep them.\n\u201cThe goats were making a lot of noise and annoying people,\u201d said Bonnaye Mims, a member of the Kansas City Property Maintenance Appeals Board, which considered the case. \u201cIf it had been a farm area \u2014 and we do have areas like that here, with horses and cows \u2014 I would have said it\u2019s O.K. But they just didn\u2019t have enough space to do this.\u201d\nThe goats were exiled to a small farm in rural Kansas. Ms. Salvaggio and Mr. Heryer, meanwhile, bought a 13-acre parcel next to a trucking plant elsewhere in Kansas City and successfully petitioned the city to have it rezoned from residential to agricultural use. They moved their farm and took their goats there legally in October.\nThe exact number of cities where it\u2019s lawful to keep goats is unknown, although officials at national goat organizations and registries estimate that it\u2019s small, compared with the dozens of cities and towns where chickens and bees are now legal.\n\u201cI would say a trickle of cities have or are trying to get goat laws passed,\u201d said Donna Geiser, president of the Nigerian Dwarf Goat Association in Wilhoit, Ariz., a group that promotes a dairy-goat breed favored by those with modest yards. \u201cThe stigma about goats is that they\u2019re smelly and eat tin cans. People are thinking about them, but they certainly haven\u2019t caught up to the chickens yet.\u201d\nSome city dwellers are aiming to change that. Three years ago, Jennie Grant, 46, a gardener from Seattle, established the Goat Justice League (motto: \u201cI\u2019m Pro-Goat and I Vote\u201d) to lobby for the legalization of goats there.\nShe succeeded in persuading the City Council to change the rules, and since then, 37 goats have been licensed in Seattle. They include Ms. Grant\u2019s own Oberhasli runt and miniature LaMancha, which scamper around a 400-square-foot pen in her yard facing Lake Washington, where they look across the water at Bill Gates \u2019s estate (\u201cI wonder if Bill Gates ever looks at my goats\u201d) and fill her Mason jars with two gallons of high butterfat milk a day during their production peak, much of which she makes into ch\u00e8vre.\n\u201cSuddenly, you have a quart of goat cheese every three days,\u201d Ms. Grant said, chronicling some recent creations from her dairy bounty: pizza with caramelized onions and goat cheese, rosemary goat cheese souffl\u00e9, goat cheesecake with a hazelnut crust. \u201cIt really changes your cooking.\u201d\nInspired by Seattle\u2019s victory, a chapter of the Goat Justice League sprung up in Charlottesville, Va., and prevailed in its goat legalization effort in September. Goat fanciers in Minneapolis; Eugene, Ore.; Northampton, Mass.; and Long Beach, Calif., are pursuing similar campaigns, and residents of Detroit, Washington, D.C., and more than a dozen other places have sought Ms. Grant\u2019s counsel on overturning local goat prohibitions.\nBut many would-be goatherds never maneuver such mazes because they abandon the idea of keeping goats as soon as they learn what it entails. In Portland, around 200 people have enrolled in a class called Goats in the City through Tierra Soul, an urban self-sufficiency institute. In Berkeley, a one-day workshop called Urban Goats 101 has filled up since BioFuel Oasis, a farm supply store and biodiesel station, began offering it last year. Novella Carpenter, who teaches the class, said it \u201cis about managing expectations and really kind of scaring people.\u201d\nAmong dairy goats\u2019 needs are access to a livestock veterinarian, a consistent supply of high-nutrient hay and a stud service for breeding \u2014 none too easy to come by in a city, said Ms. Carpenter, who has raised goats at her Oakland, Calif., home for three years. (She wrote about her experiences in the book \u201cFarm City: The Education of an Urban Farmer.\u201d ) The animals\u2019 hooves and horns must be trimmed, and Ms. Carpenter recommends a secure pen with walls about five feet high to prevent them from bounding away and \u201cdestroying the things you love.\u201d\nMost pressing is that they typically need to be milked twice a day, every day.\n\u201cI\u2019m not just saying \u2018Goats are great, go get some,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Carpenter said \u201cIt\u2019s so much work to have goats. At the end of my class, people say, \u2018Oh, my God, I had no idea it was so complicated.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nBut some city farmers remain undaunted. Jules Dervaes, an urban homesteader in Pasadena, Calif., lives on a fifth of an acre with his three adult children, eight ducks, eight chickens, three beehives, two cats, composting worms and a tank of tilapia. In 2006, he added two goats to the menagerie, and he quickly came to appreciate their cat-like intelligence, dog-like personalities and general adorableness, despite the management they require.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a citrus tree, a mango tree, wood off the house, five or six brooms,\u201d said Mr. Dervaes, 63. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to protect our investment more than we ever did with chickens or ducks. In a city, where there\u2019s not much forage and your place is compact, man, they can go through the trees and bushes like nothing.\u201d\nMaking the best of it, he tacked chicken wire around his tree trunks and against the wooden garage where the goats live, to deter their chewing. In the absence of nearby medical services, his daughter Jordanne, 27, stocked up on veterinary books and learned how to do basic care like deworming, which involves examining feces and administering parasite-killing medicine and herbs. For alfalfa hay, Mr. Dervaes drives 25 miles round trip to equestrian stables in Los Angeles.\nHe also recently created Barnyards and Backyards , a social networking site for urbanites raising livestock to connect with their more knowledgeable rural counterparts for advice. Still, he sometimes wonders if his metropolitan goats might be better suited elsewhere.\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d Mr. Dervaes said with a note of resignation, \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll have to move to the country.\u201d\nA version of this article appeared in print on February 23, 2011, on page D5 of the New York edition.\n"}, {"score": 1779.7966, "uuid": "15f072cd-802a-5beb-830c-93ee967aac05", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1514wb-70-24869", "target_hostname": "blog.garymoller.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.garymoller.com/2009/03/raw-cows-milk-update-is-it-really.html", "page_rank": 1.1758475e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": ": Raw <em>cows</em> <em>milk</em> update - <em>is</em> it really", "snippet": "Share to TwitterShare to Facebook I&quot;ve seen unpasteurised <em>goats</em> <em>milk</em> in organics shops as well, <em>better</em> tolerated by <em>cows</em> <em>milk</em> intolerant people.

If you're thinking about drinking raw milk because you believe it has health benefits, consider other options.\nTrying to decide about raw milk?\nDeveloping a healthy lifestyle is a process with many decisions and steps. One step you might be thinking about is adding raw milk to your diet. Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful germs. Germs include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It's important to understand the risks of drinking raw milk, especially because you may be hearing claims about the supposed \"benefits\" of raw milk.\nRaw milk contains bacteria, and some of them can be harmful. So, if you're thinking about consuming raw milk because you believe that it is a good source of beneficial bacteria, you need to know that it isn't and you may instead get sick from the harmful bacteria. If you think that certain types of bacteria may be beneficial to your health, consider getting them from foods that don't involve such a high risk. For example, so-called probiotic bacteria are sometimes added to pasteurized fermented foods, such as yogurt and kefir.\nMilk and products made from milk need minimal processing, called pasteurization, which can be done by heating the milk briefly (for example, heating it to 161\u00b0F for about 20 seconds). When milk is pasteurized, some bacteria remain in it, but the disease-causing ones are killed. Harmful germs usually don't change the look, taste, or smell of milk, so only when milk has been pasteurized can you be confident that these germs are not present. To ensure that milk is safe, processors rapidly cool it after pasteurization, practice sanitary handling, and store milk in clean, closed containers at 45\u00b0F or below.\nRemember, you can't look at, smell, or taste a bottle of raw milk and tell if it's safe to drink. Make the best decision for the health of your family. If you want to keep milk in your family's diet, protect them by not giving them raw milk. Even healthy adults can get sick from drinking raw milk. If you're thinking about drinking raw milk because you believe it has health benefits, consider other options.\nWho is at greatest risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk?\nThe risk of getting sick from drinking raw milk is greater for infants and young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV/AIDS, than it is for healthy school-aged children and adults. But, it is important to remember that healthy people of any age can get very sick or even die if they drink raw milk contaminated with harmful germs.\nWhat are the risks associated with drinking raw milk?\nRaw milk can carry harmful bacteria and other germs that can make you very sick or kill you. While it is possible to get foodborne illnesses from many different foods, raw milk is one of the riskiest of all.\nGetting sick from raw milk can mean many days of diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. Less commonly, it can mean kidney failure, paralysis, chronic disorders, and even death.\nMany people who chose raw milk thinking they would improve their health instead found themselves (or their loved ones) sick in a hospital for several weeks fighting for their lives from infections caused by germs in raw milk. For example, a person can develop severe or even life-threatening diseases, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, which can cause paralysis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure and stroke.\nAren't raw or natural foods better than processed foods?\nMany people believe that foods with no or minimal processing are better for their health. Many people also believe that small, local farms are better sources of healthy food. However, some types of processing are needed to protect health. For example, consumers process raw meat, poultry, and fish for safety by cooking. Similarly, when milk is pasteurized, it is heated just long enough to kill disease-causing germs. Most nutrients remain after milk is pasteurized. There are many local, small farms that offer pasteurized organic milk and cheese products.\nI've heard that many organic and raw milk producers are creating sanitary and humane conditions for raising animals and producing \"safe\" raw milk and raw milk products (like cheeses and yogurts). Does this help reduce milk contamination?\nAdherence to good hygienic practices during milking can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of milk contamination. The dairy farm environment is a reservoir for illness-causing germs. No matter what precautions farmers take, and even if their raw milk tests come back negative, they cannot guarantee that their milk, or the products made from their milk, are free of harmful germs.\nGerms such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Salmonella can contaminate milk during the process of milking dairy animals, including cows, sheep, and goats. Animals that carry these germs usually appear healthy.\nHow does milk get contaminated?\nMilk contamination may occur from:\nCow feces coming into direct contact with the milk\nInfection of the cow's udder (mastitis)\nCow diseases (e.g., bovine tuberculosis)\nBacteria that live on the skin of cows\nEnvironment (e.g., feces, dirt, processing equipment)\nInsects, rodents, and other animal vectors\nHumans, for example, by cross-contamination from soiled clothing and boots\nPasteurization is the only way to kill many of the bacteria in milk that can make people very sick.\nInformation about raw milk-related outbreaks\nStates that allow the legal sale of raw milk for human consumption have more raw milk-related outbreaks of illness than states that do not allow raw milk to be sold legally.\nAmong dairy product-associated outbreaks reported to CDC between 1973 and 2009 in which the investigators reported whether the product was pasteurized or raw, 82% were due to raw milk or cheese. From 1998 through 2009, 93 outbreaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products were reported to CDC. These resulted in 1,837 illnesses, 195 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths. Most of these illnesses were caused by Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, or Salmonella. It is important to note that a substantial proportion of the raw milk-associated disease burden falls on children; among the 93 raw dairy product outbreaks from 1998 to 2009, 79% involved at least one person younger than 20 years old.\nA study released by CDC in February 2012 examined the number of dairy outbreaks in the United States during a 13\u00e2\u0080\u0090year period. Between 1993 and 2006, 60% (73/121) of dairy-related outbreaks reported to CDC were linked to raw milk products. Three\u00e2\u0080\u0090quarters of these outbreaks occurred in states where the sale of raw milk was legal at the time. Experts also found that those sickened in raw milk outbreaks were 13 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who got ill from pasteurized milk during an outbreak.\nAs a consumer, you can take steps when grocery shopping and at home with all of your dairy products to minimize the risk of getting sick:\nOnly consume pasteurized milk and milk products. Look for the word \"pasteurized\" on the dairy labels. If in doubt, don't buy it!\nKeep pasteurized dairy products refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below at home and dispose of any expired products to reduce the risk of illness.\nIf you consume soft, fresh, un-aged cheeses like queso fresco, make sure they are made from pasteurized milk. Aged cheeses made from raw milk are generally okay to eat because germs usually die off during the aging process. However, outbreaks associated with these cheeses have been identified.\nReported outbreaks represent the tip of the iceberg. For every outbreak and every illness reported, many others occur, and most illnesses are not part of recognized outbreaks. Protect yourself and your loved ones. Avoid raw milk, it's just not worth the risk.\nMore Information\n"}, {"score": 1760.8167, "uuid": "d45ba125-e49f-548a-909e-491d176d695e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1713wb-05-20631", "target_hostname": "wwwtest.cdc.gov", "target_uri": "http://wwwtest.cdc.gov/Features/Rawmilk/", "page_rank": 1.1927865e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "CDC Features - Raw (Unpasteurized) <em>Milk</em>", "snippet": "of milking dairy animals, including <em>cows</em>, sheep, and <em>goats</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Features by Date\nRaw (Unpasteurized) Milk\nRaw milk can carry harmful germs that can make you very sick or kill you.

Half-pints of whole milk are served in school lunchrooms across the country, but in many school districts it\u2019s being partially or completely replaced by low-fat and nonfat milk options. In 2006, the nation\u2019s largest school district, New York City, completely phased out whole milk in an effort to combat childhood obesity. So what\u2019s the best milk for your child, and for you? There are so many milk options on the market, from whole to nonfat cow\u2019s milk, organic milk, goat milk, sheep milk, and even plant milks from soy, almond, rice, and oats. Let\u2019s look at some common questions and answers about this daily dietary staple.\nWhat is milk exactly?\nMilk is an emulsified white liquid secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals to feed their offspring. Mammalian babies rely on their mothers\u2019 milk for all of their nutrition for a time, but humans are the only animals that drink milk from other species long after they themselves have been weaned. Humans have used animal milk as a source of nutrition for thousands of years, and with good reason. This substance is designed to turn calves into cows, lambs into sheep and kids into adult goats, all within a relatively short period of time. Although the nutritional breakdown varies from species to species, all milk contains fat, protein, sugars, vitamins, and minerals necessary for growth and development.\nWhat\u2019s in whole milk?\nAn eight-ounce serving of whole milk contains 150 calories, eight grams of fat and about three grams of protein. It also contains essential nutritional building blocks like calcium, phosphorous, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and other vitamins and minerals.\nMilk is, in many ways, a nutritional powerhouse \u2013 it packs a big punch in a small volume, especially when used as part of an overall balanced diet. Overconsumption of full-fat milk and milk products, as with anything not consumed in moderation, can result in health problems like obesity. Moderate low-fat and nonfat milk intake in adults can help prevent osteoporosis because of milk\u2019s high calcium content. Milk\u2019s calcium can also lead to better oral health \u2013 stronger teeth, less tooth decay. Milk and cheese actually reduce acidity in the mouth while you\u2019re eating, and acidity is a major cause of dental decay. Studies have also shown that moderate dairy intake can reduce colon cancer, type II diabetes and high blood pressure risks.\nShould I drink organic whole milk?\nOrganic milk, whether whole, low-fat or nonfat, is an excellent source of the same nutrition as conventionally-produced milk. The difference is that organic milk is produced without the use of synthetic hormones (used to increase milk output) and antibiotics. The cows are also fed grass and grain grown without pesticides. On the whole, organic farmers tend to have more humane dairy operations, and their cows are more likely to be put out to pasture to graze.\nThe more grass cows eat, the healthier they are \u2013 it\u2019s what they\u2019re systems are designed to process. Pastured cows produce milk with higher concentrations of conjugated linoleic acids, which are beneficial fats linked to lower rates of diabetes and heart disease.\nHow do I introduce whole milk to my baby?\nMost pediatricians and dieticians agree that babies are ready to drink cow\u2019s milk when they\u2019re about a year old. Until the age of 12 months, breast milk or formula should be the mainstay of your baby\u2019s diet. Some babies are resistant to the change, as they\u2019ve gotten accustomed to the taste of formula or breast milk. Start by mixing a small amount of milk into her regular bottle, gradually increasing the amount until it is all milk and no formula.\nWhen should I start feeding my child low-fat milk or nonfat milk?\nHere\u2019s a good rule of thumb for switching from whole milk to low-fat or nonfat milk: By two years of age, most children are ready to stop drinking whole milk as a daily beverage. The rest of the family should be drinking two-percent, one-percent or skim milk, and by the time he or she is two years old, a child should be ready to join them.\nRobert Murray, M.D., of\nOhio\n\u2019s Columbus Children\u2019s Hospital advocates making the switch more gradually. He says that children should drink whole milk between the ages of one and three, and two-percent milk until they\u2019re five or six. By then, they can move on to nonfat milk.\nSays Murray, \u201cIt\u2019s best to start children on whole milk\u2026because their energy needs are very high and they need that fat in the whole milk for energy. They need a little extra fat in the first few years, but by the time children enter school, they have a broader diet with other sources of fat.\u201d\nHow much milk does my child need every day?\nA toddler between the ages of one and three should have two or three servings of milk every day, unless he or she is getting a lot of calcium and protein from other sources. For example, a serving of yogurt can be substituted for one serving of whole milk.\nTwo or three servings a day of low-fat dairy products are recommended for most adults as well. While the occasional indulgence in full-fat cream cheese will do no lasting harm in most people, the bulk of your dairy consumption should be low-fat or nonfat.\nDo people need to drink milk at all?\nMany people eat dairy-free diets without suffering ill health effects. Asian cuisines are often completely devoid of milk and milk products, and people in these cultures have some of the lowest rates of heart disease, diabetes and cancer in the world. If you cannot drink milk because of an allergy, or if you choose not to because you eat a vegan diet, that\u2019s ok! Dark, leafy greens and legumes can provide some of the same high-quality nutrition that milk does. Overall balance is key if you cannot drink milk.\nAre there better milk options out there?\nSure! For toddlers with milk allergies, ask your doctor about trying goat milk. Many parents find that their children tolerate it much better than cow\u2019s milk. Soy-based toddler formula is another alternative. The bonus here? These preparations are fortified with iron.\nSoy milk, rice milk, almond milk, and oat milk are some additional options for adults and older children. They\u2019re low in fat, high in protein and nutrient-fortified.\nWhat about lactose intolerance?\nLactose intolerance occurs when we cannot process lactose, the sugar found in animal milk. An enzyme called lactase is responsible for breaking down the lactose in the small intestine, and when we don\u2019t produce enough lactase (or any at all) we end up with gas, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Some people are born with lactose intolerance, but it can develop over time. Ask your doctor if you think you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of lactose intolerance.\nWhen it comes to deciding what\u2019s best for your diet and your kids\u2019 diets, your best ally is information. But the amount of readily available information and opinions about whole milk (and low-fat and nonfat milk) can be overwhelming and confusing, and it can be hard to figure out the truth. Do your research and listen to your body. Ask your doctor about any concerns you may have, and do the same with your children\u2019s pediatrician.\nHow Much Do You Know About Food?\nYou know that brownies taste better when they're just out of the oven and that cranberry sauce will taste bitter if you don't add enough sugar.

Check out our special offers here .\nPage: 1\nDon't Drink Your Milk!\nProcessing Is the Problem\nThe path that transforms healthy milk products into allergens and carcinogens begins with modern feeding methods that substitute high-protein, soy-based feeds for fresh green grass and breeding methods to produce cows with abnormally large pituitary glands so that they produce three times more milk than the old fashioned scrub cow. These cows need antibiotics to keep them well.\nTheir milk is then pasteurized so that all valuable enzymes are destroyed (lactase for the assimilation of lactose; galactase for the assimilation of galactose; phosphatase for the assimilation of calcium).\nLiterally dozens of other precious enzymes are destroyed in the pasteurization process. Without them, milk is very difficult to digest. The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to diabetes and other diseases.\nThe butterfat of commercial milk is homogenized, subjecting it to rancidity. Even worse, butterfat may be removed altogether. Skim milk is sold as a health food, but the truth is that butter-fat is in milk for a reason.\nWithout it the body cannot absorb and utilize the vitamins and minerals in the water fraction of the milk. Along with valuable trace minerals and short chain fatty acids, butterfat is America's best source of preformed vitamin A.\nSynthetic vitamin D, known to be toxic to the liver, is added to replace the natural vitamin D complex in butterfat. Butterfat also contains re-arranged acids which have strong anti-carcinogenic properties.\nNon-fat dried milk is added to 1% and 2% milk. Unlike the cholesterol in fresh milk, which plays a variety of health promoting roles, the cholesterol in non-fat dried milk is oxidized and it is this rancid cholesterol that promotes heart disease.\nLike all spray dried products, non-fat dried milk has a high nitrite content. Non-fat dried milk and sweetened condensed milk are the principle dairy products in third world countries; use of ultra high temperature pasteurized milk is widespread in Europe.\nOther Factors Regarding Milk\nMilk and refined sugar make two of the largest contributions to food induced ill health in our country. That may seem like an overly harsh statement, but when one examines the evidence, this is a reasonable conclusion.\nThe recent approval by the FDA of the use of BGH (Bovine Growth Hormone) by dairy farmers to increase their milk production only worsens the already sad picture.\nBGH causes an increase in an insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) in the milk of treated cows. IGF-1 survives milk pasteurization and human intestinal digestion. It can be directly absorbed into the human bloodstream, particularly in infants.\nIt is highly likely that IGF-1 promotes the transformation of human breast cells to cancerous forms. IGF-1 is also a growth factor for already cancerous breast and colon cancer cells, promoting their progression and invasiveness.\nIt is also possible for us to absorb the BGH directly from the milk. This will cause further IGF-1 production by our own cells.\nBGH will also decrease the body fat of cows. Unfortunately, the body fat of cows is already contaminated with a wide range of carcinogens, pesticides, dioxin, and antibiotic residues. When the cows have less body fat, these toxic substances are then transported into the cows' milk.\nBGH also causes the cows to have an increase in breast infections for which they must receive additional antibiotics.\nPrior to BGH, 38%of milk sampled nationally was already contaminated by illegal residues of antibiotics and animal drugs. This will only increase with the use of BGH. One can only wonder what the long term complications will be for drinking milk that has a 50% chance it is contaminated with antibiotics.\nThere is also a problem with a protein enzyme called xanthine oxidase which is in cow's milk. Normally, proteins are broken down once you digest them.\nHowever, when milk is homogenized, small fat globules surround the xanthine oxidase and it is absorbed intact into your blood stream. There is some very compelling research demonstrating clear associations with this absorbed enzyme and increased risks of heart disease.\nEar specialists frequently insert tubes into the ear drums of infants to treat recurrent ear infections. It has replaced the previously popular tonsillectomy to become the number one surgery in the country.\nUnfortunately, most of these specialists don't realize that over 50% of these children will improve and have no further ear infections if they just stop drinking their milk.\nThis is a real tragedy. Not only is the $3,000 spent on the surgery wasted, but there are some recent articles supporting the likelihood that most children who have this procedure will have long term hearing losses.\nIt is my strong recommendation that you discontinue your milk products. If you find this difficult, I would start for several weeks only, and reevaluate how you feel at that time.\nThis would include ALL dairy, including skim milk and Lact-Aid milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. If you feel better after several weeks you can attempt to rotate small amounts of one form of milk every four days.\nYou probably are wondering what will happen to your bones and teeth if you stop milk. The majority of the world's population takes in less than half the calcium we are told we need and yet they have strong bones and healthy teeth.\nCows' milk is rich in phosphorous which can combine with calcium -- and can prevent you from absorbing the calcium in milk. The milk protein also accelerates calcium excretion from the blood through the kidneys.\nThis is also true when you eat large amount of meat and poultry products. Vegetarians will need about 50% less calcium than meat eaters because they lose much less calcium in their urine.\nIt is possible to obtain all your calcium from dark green vegetables (where do you think the cow gets their's from?). The darker the better. Cooked collard greens and kale are especially good. If you or your child is unable to take in large amounts of green vegetables, you might want to supplement with calcium.\nIf you can swallow pills, we have an excellent, inexpensive source called Calcium Citrate, which has a number of other minerals which your body requires to build up maximally healthy bone.\nIt is much better than a simple calcium tablet. You can take about 1,000 mg a day. For those who already suffer from osteoporosis, the best calcium supplement is microcrystalline hydroxyapatite.\nIt is also important that you take vitamin D in the winter months from November to March. Normally your skin converts sunshine to vitamin D, but the sunshine levels in the winter are very low unless you visit Florida or Mexico type areas.\nMost people obtain their vitamin D from milk in the winter; so if you stop it, please make sure you are taking calcium with vitamin D or a multi vitamin with vitamin D to prevent bone thinning.\nMost people are not aware that the milk of most mammals varies considerably in its composition. For example, the milk of goats, elephants, cows, camels, wolves, and walruses show marked differences, in their content of fats, protein, sugar, and minerals. Each was designed to provide optimum nutrition to the young of the respective species. Each is different from human milk.\nIn general, most animals are exclusively breast-fed until they have tripled their birth weight, which in human infants occurs around the age of one year. In no mammalian species, except for the human (and domestic cat) is milk consumption continued after the weaning period. Calves thrive on cow milk. Cow's milk is designed for calves.\nCow's milk is the number one allergic food in this country. It has been well documented as a cause in diarrhea, cramps, bloating, gas, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, skin rashes, atherosclerosis, and acne.\nIt is the primary cause of recurrent ear infections in children. It has also been linked to insulin dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, infertility, and leukemia.\nHopefully, you will reconsider your position on using milk as a form of nourishment. Small amounts of milk or milk products taken infrequently, will likely cause little or no problems for most people.\nHowever, the American Dairy Board has done a very effective job of marketing this product. Most people believe they need to consume large, daily quantities of milk to achieve good health. NOTHING could be further from the truth.\nPublic health officials and the National Dairy Council have worked together in this country to make it very difficult to obtain wholesome, fresh, raw dairy products. Nevertheless, they can be found with a little effort. In some states, you can buy raw milk directly from farmers.\nWhole, pasteurized, non-homogenized milk from cows raised on organic feed is now available in many gourmet shops and health food stores. It can be cultured to restore enzyme content, at least partially. Cultured buttermilk is often more easily digested than regular milk; it is an excellent product to use in baking.\nMany shops now carry whole cream that is merely pasteurized (not ultra pasteurized like most commercial cream); diluted with water, it is delicious on cereal and a good substitute for those allergic to milk.\nTraditionally made creme fraiche (European style sour cream), it also has a high enzyme content.\n"}, {"score": 1746.9873, "uuid": "69a29980-0b77-5815-b991-55611e7d5e48", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1217wb-55-13821", "target_hostname": "www.100daysofrealfood.com", "target_uri": "http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2010/08/12/milk-%e2%80%93-good-or-bad/comment-page-1/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>Milk</em> \u2013 good <em>or</em> bad? \u00ab 100 Days of Real Food", "snippet": "But, the point <em>is</em> that I really didn\u2019t know <em>what</em> the <em>cows</em> were eating when I would pick up a jug from the supermarket.", "explanation": null, "document": "Milk \u2013 good or bad?\nBy 100 Days of Real Food, on August 12th, 2010\nWe are all very big milk drinkers in our house (4 \u2013 5 gallons a week)\u2026and to be honest I don\u2019t think we could live without it! The good news is after switching to a more optimal milk source and type of milk we certainly do not have to give it up. I used to buy the standard store-brand skim (for the adults) and 2% (for the kids) from our local supermarket. I even switched to the organic variety earlier this year. Organic is certainly better than conventional, but I felt there were still some additional factors that continued to be overlooked.\nMy biggest concern about the milk we were drinking was if it came from cows that were being fed grass. I did a post awhile back entitled \u201c You are what you eat eats too ,\u201d and this couldn\u2019t be more true when it comes to milk. Cows are actually designed by evolution to eat grass, and a large majority of factory-farmed cows are instead taught to survive on corn (a super cheap grain). In some instances the corn makes the animals sick, which is part of the reason why they have to be administered so many antibiotics.\nNow if you are buying organic milk you obviously know that the cows have not been given any antibiotics, but being organic doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they have been fed grass (or anything green for that matter). For all I know they\u2019ve just been fed organic corn. But, the point is that I really didn\u2019t know what the cows were eating when I would pick up a jug from the supermarket. Even as I proofread this article now I have to admit it sounds a little over the top to care so much about what the cows eat before I would even drink their milk, but it really is important. The health of the cow greatly affects the health of their milk (as well as their meat products), and I am obviously on a mission to provide the absolute best for my family.\nSo going back to a time when I didn\u2019t know where our milk came from brings me to why I stopped buying our milk from the grocery store all together. I recently switched to a delivery service ( http://www.lakeviewfarmshomedelivery.com/ ) that provides milk from cows that are located not too far away in South Carolina. Not only can I call and ask them questions anytime (and you know I do!), but I could even go visit the farm myself if I thought it was necessary to do so. There is certainly a slight up-charge compared to a half-gallon of organic milk from the supermarket ($3.84 vs. $3.49), but they say their milk is two days from the cow. And it tastes so fresh I absolutely believe it. I think my children even noticed the difference because once we switched to the new milk I was having trouble keeping up with their consumption\u2026it was like a broken record around here \u201cmore milk please!\u201d\nOne other thing I learned more recently is that skim milk may not be the best choice for my husband and me (our girls drink 2%). This came as quite a shock, because I drink a lot of milk myself and have chosen skim for as long as I can remember. According to our milk delivery service, skim milk is everything leftover after the cream has been removed in a separator. And apparently the cream is what contains enzymes and fat-soluble vitamins . So just like the process that white flour goes through ( since removing the bran and germ also removes all the good stuff from the flour ) the milk is fortified with vitamins in an attempt to add back what has been lost. So once again I think the better choice is to just consume the good stuff the way nature has provided it to us and not opt for something that just emulates the good stuff.\nWe are joining our daughters and have switched to 2% in order to give us a good balance between the healthy cream and fat consumption. Michael Pollan even goes as far to say\nTo make dairy products low fat, it\u2019s not enough to remove the fat. You then have to go to great lengths to preserve the body or creamy texture by working in all kinds of food additives. In the case of low-fat or skim milk, that usually means adding powdered milk. But powdered milk contains oxidized cholesterol, which scientists believe is much worse for your arteries than ordinary cholesterol, so food makers sometimes compensate by adding antioxidants, further complicating what had been a simple one-ingredient whole food.\nThis once again reminds me how happy I am to be buying our milk from a reliable and knowledgeable source, which allows me to continue our theme here of knowing exactly where our food comes from!\n"}, {"score": 1746.2084, "uuid": "480da6e2-0ed2-5d3b-aa35-7dc7dd3b5910", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0705wb-74-12910",

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to our immune systems.\nIf you are testing dairy-free living via an elimination diet, you may be doing yourself a huge injustice if you consume goat milk during the cow milk elimination.\u00a0 Personally, I would remove all dairy, including goat.\u00a0 Then, if and when symptoms subside, I might challenge with goat milk to see if it is tolerated. I\u2019ve personally never consumed goat milk products or \u201cchallenged\u201d with them, since I know I am allergic.\u00a0 Also, I must disclaim that you shouldn\u2019t undergo any change in diet without the supervision of a physician.\u00a0 Are we all clear on that?\u00a0 Good.\nMoving on\u2026there some other factors to keep in mind regarding goat milk products\u2026\nFirst, unlike casein, which can vary in composition from mammal to mammal, lactose is typically lactose.\u00a0 Someone who is lactose intolerant may even be intolerant to the lactose in human milk.\u00a0 The amount of lactose from milk product to milk product can vary slightly; for example it has been calculated at 4.1% in goat milk and 4.7% in cow milk.\u00a0 There are some other factors in goat milk that make it easier to digest for some people (see Go Dairy Free: The Guide and Cookbook for details), but if you are quite lactose intolerant, chugging back glasses of goat milk probably wouldn\u2019t be a nice thing to do to your stomach.\nSecond, as mentioned, mammal milks do have slightly different make-ups, and the differences don\u2019t necessarily end with casein.\u00a0 Goat milk is significantly lower in folic acid and vitamin B-12 than cow milk, so make sure you eating plenty of leafy greens and foods such as meat and chicken, or supplement if relying on goat milk for nutrition.\nThis is just the tip of the dairy iceberg, but hopefully helps to answer a few of your questions and concerns about goat milk.\u00a0 I go into more detail on goat milk, sheep milk, raw milk, A2 milk , camel milk (yes, I said camel milk), the different milk alternatives and more in my book, Go Dairy Free .

It is bordered by Rhode Island and Connecticut to the south, New York to the west, and Vermont and New Hampshire to the north; at its east lies the Atlantic Ocean . As of the 2010 Census , the population of Massachusetts was 6,547,629. The state features two separate metropolitan areas \u2014 the eastern Boston metropolitan area and the western Springfield metropolitan area . Approximately two thirds of the state's population lives in Greater Boston, most of which is either urban or suburban. Western Massachusetts features one urban area \u2014 the Knowledge Corridor along the Connecticut River \u2014 and a mix of college towns and rural areas. Massachusetts is the most populous of the six New England states, the third most densely populated state in the United States, and also has the US's sixth highest GDP per capita.\nMassachusetts played a significant historical, cultural, and commercial role in American history . Plymouth was the second permanent English settlement in North America, and Puritan s settling Massachusetts in the 1630s dominated New England for many years. Harvard University , founded in 1636, is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. In 1692, the towns surrounding Salem experienced one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem Witch Trials . In the eighteenth century, the Protestant First Great Awakening , which swept the Atlantic world, originated from the pulpit of Northampton, Massachusetts preacher Jonathan Edwards . In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the \"Cradle of Liberty\" for the agitation there that led to the American Revolution and the independence of the United States from Great Britain . In 1777, General Henry Knox founded the Springfield Armory , which during the Industrial Revolution catalyzed numerous important technological advances, including interchangeable parts . In 1786, Shays' Rebellion , a populist revolt by Western Massachusetts farmers, led directly to the United States Constitutional Convention . Before the American Civil War , Massachusetts was a center for the temperance , transcendentalist , and abolitionist movements. In 1837, Mount Holyoke College , the United States' first college for women, was opened in the Connecticut River Valley town of South Hadley . In the late nineteenth century, the (now) Olympic sports of basketball and volleyball were invented in the Western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke , respectively. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legally recognize same-sex marriage . The state has contributed many prominent politicians to national service, including members of the Adams family and of the Kennedy family .\nOriginally dependent on fishing, agriculture, and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, the state's economy shifted from manufacturing to services. In the 21st century, Massachusetts is a leader in higher education , health care technology, high technology , financial services , cannabis law reform , universal healthcare , and same-sex marriage .\nName\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony was named after the indigenous population, the Massachusett , whose name can be segmented as mass-adchu-s-et, where mass- is \"large\", -adchu- is \"hill\", -s- is a diminutive suffix meaning \"small\", and -et is a locative suffix, identifying a place. It has been translated as \"near the great hill\", \"by the blue hills\", \"at the little big hill\", or \"at the range of hills\", referring to the Blue Hills , or in particular, Great Blue Hill , located on the boundary of Milton and Canton . Alternatively, Massachusett has been represented as Moswetuset, from the name of the Moswetuset Hummock (meaning \"hill shaped like an arrowhead\") in Quincy where Plymouth Colony commander Miles Standish and Squanto , a Native American , met Chief Chickatawbut in 1621.\nThe official name of the state is the \" Commonwealth of Massachusetts\". Colloquially, it is often referred to simply as \"the Commonwealth\". While this designation is part of the state's official name, it has no practical implications. Massachusetts has the same position and powers within the United States as other states.\nGeography\nMassachusetts is the 7th smallest state in the United States . It is located in the New England region of the northeastern United States, and has an area of . Several large bays distinctly shape its coast. Boston is the largest city, at the inmost point of Massachusetts Bay , the mouth of the Charles River , the longest river entirely within Massachusetts. The state extends from the mountains of the Appalachian system in the west to the sandy beaches and rocky shorelines of the Atlantic coast.\nThe National Park Service administers a number of natural and historical sites in Massachusetts . Along with twelve national historic sites, areas, and corridors, the National Park Service also manages the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area . In addition, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation maintains a number of parks, trails, and beaches throughout the commonwealth.\nEcology\nThe primary biome of inland Massachusetts is temperate deciduous forest . Although much of the state had been cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old growth forest in isolated pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned. Currently, forests cover around 62% of Massachusetts. The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area in the east, the smaller Springfield metropolitan area in the west, and the largely agricultural Pioneer Valley. Animals that have become locally extinct over the past few centuries include gray wolves , elk , wolverines , and mountain lions .\nA number of species are doing well, despite, and in some cases because of the increased urbanization of the commonwealth. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes , whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer , raccoons , wild turkey s and eastern gray squirrel s are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas in the western part of the state, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.\nMassachusetts is located along the Atlantic Flyway , a major route for migratory waterfowl along the Atlantic coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for the common loon , while a significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket . Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate tern s and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover . Protected areas such as the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of gray seals .\nFreshwater fish species in the commonwealth include bass , carp , catfish , and trout , while saltwater species such as Atlantic cod , haddock and American lobster populate offshore waters. Other marine species include Harbor seals , the endangered North Atlantic right whale s, as well as humpback whales , fin whale s, minke whales and Atlantic white-sided dolphins .\nHistory\nEarly\nMassachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family such as the Wampanoag , Narragansett , Nipmuc , Pocomtuc , Mahican , and Massachusett . While cultivation of crops like squash and corn supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing for most of their food supply. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as long house s, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachem s.\nColonial period\nThe first English settlers in Massachusetts, the Pilgrims , established their settlement at Plymouth in 1620, and developed friendly relations with the native Wampanoag . This was the second successful permanent English colony in North America, after the Jamestown Colony . The Pilgrims were soon followed by Puritan s who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony at present-day Boston in 1630. The Puritans, who believed the Church of England was too hierarchical (among other disagreements) came to Massachusetts for religious freedom., although, like the Plymouth colony, the bay colony was founded under a royal charter. Both religious dissention and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. Dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams were banished due to religious disagreements; (Hutchinson held meetings in her home discussing flaws in the Puritan beliefs, while Williams believed that the Puritan beliefs were wrong, and the Indians must be respected.) In 1636, Williams founded the colony of Rhode Island and Hutchinson joined him there several years later.\nIn the early 1600s, large numbers of the indigenous people in the northeast of what is now the United States were killed by virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox , measles , influenza , and perhaps leptospirosis . In 1617\u20131619, smallpox reportedly killed 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans .\nIn 1691, Massachusetts became a single colony, combining Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony (along with present-day Maine). In part due to a delay in establishing a new unified political system, the Salem witch trials , in which a number of women were hanged, occurred during this time.\nThe most destructive earthquake yet known in New England occurred in 1755, causing considerable damage across the commonwealth.\nMassachusetts was a center of the movement for independence from Great Britain ; colonists here had long had uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s. The Boston Tea Party is an example of the protest spirit in the early 1770s, while the Boston Massacre escalated the conflict. Anti-British activity by men like Sam Adams and John Hancock , followed by reprisals by the British government, were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution . The Battles of Lexington and Concord initiated the American Revolutionary War and were fought in the Massachusetts towns of Concord and Lexington . Future President George Washington took over what would become the Continental Army after the battle. His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 1775-6, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city. The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County as Evacuation Day .\nFederal period\nBostonian John Adams , known as the \"Atlas of Independence\", was an important figure in both the struggle for independence as well as the formation of the new United States. Adams was highly involved in the push for separation from Britain and the writing of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 (which, in the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker cases, effectively made Massachusetts the first state to have a constitution that declared universal rights and, as interpreted by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice William Cushing , abolished slavery). Later, Adams was active in early American foreign affairs and succeeded Washington as US President. His son, John Quincy Adams , would go on to become the sixth US President.\nAfter independence and during the formative years of independent American government, Shays' Rebellion was an armed uprising in the western half of the state from 1786 to 1787. The rebels were mostly small farmers angered by crushing war debt and taxes. The rebellion was one of the major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation . On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution .\n19th century\nIn 1820, Maine separated from Massachusetts, of which it had been first a contiguous and then a non-contiguous part, and entered the Union as the 23rd state as a result of the ratification of the Missouri Compromise .\nDuring the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national leader in the American Industrial Revolution , with factories around Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing precision manufacturing tools and paper. The economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of waterpower and later the steam engine to power factories, and canals and later railroads for transporting goods and materials. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankee s on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.\nIn the years leading up to the Civil War , Massachusetts was a center of social progressivism , Transcendentalism , and abolitionist activity. Horace Mann made the state system of schools the national model. Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American thought. Members of the Transcendentalism movement, they emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity. Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837, opposition to slavery gradually increased in the next few decades. The works of abolitionists contributed to subsequent actions of the state during the Civil War. Massachusetts was the first state to recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry . The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston Common contains a relief depicting the 54th regiment.\n20th century\nThe industrial economy began a decline in the early 20th century with the exodus of many manufacturing companies. By the 1920s competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression , led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and mechanized transportation. This decline would continue into the latter half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Bay Staters involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. This spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century. In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II , the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service and high-tech based economy. Government contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. Suburbanization flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high-technology companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.\nThe Kennedy family was prominent in Massachusetts politics in the 20th century. Children of businessman and ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. included John F. Kennedy , who was a senator and US president before his assassination in 1963, Robert F. Kennedy , who was a senator, US attorney general and presidential candidate before his assassination in 1968, Ted Kennedy , a senator from 1962 until his death in 2009, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver , a co-founder of the Special Olympics . The famous Kennedy Compound is located at Hyannisport on Cape Cod .\nRecent history\nIn 1987, the state received federal funding for the Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Known as \"the Big Dig \", it was at the time the biggest federal highway project ever approved. The project included making the Central Artery a tunnel under downtown Boston, in addition to the re-routing of several other major highways. Often controversial, with numerous claims of graft and mismanagement, and with its initial price tag of $2.5 billion increasing to a final tally of over $15 billion, the Big Dig has nonetheless changed the face of Downtown Boston . It has connected areas that were once divided by elevated highway, (much of the raised old Central Artery was replaced with the Rose Kennedy Greenway ) and improved traffic conditions along a number of routes.\nDemographics\nMassachusetts had an estimated 2009 population of 6,593,587. As of 2000, Massachusetts was estimated to be the third most densely populated U.S. state , with 809.8 per square mile, behind New Jersey and Rhode Island . Massachusetts in 2004 included 919,771\u00a0foreign-born residents. Most Bay Staters live within the Boston Metropolitan Area, also known as Greater Boston . The state's only other metropolitan area is the Springfield Metropolitan Area, also known as Greater Springfield . Centered in the Connecticut River Valley , Greater Springfield includes the revitalizing city of Springfield , and an eclectic array of college towns , (e.g. Amherst and Northampton ,) and rural areas to the north and west. Geographically, the center of population of Massachusetts is located in Middlesex County , in the town of Natick .\nLike the rest of the northeastern United States, the population of Massachusetts has continued to grow in the past few decades, although at a slower pace than states in the South or West . The latest census estimates show that the commonwealth's population grew by 3.9% since 2000, compared with nearly 10% nationwide. In their decisions to leave Massachusetts, most former residents cited high housing costs and a high cost of living. Another factor has been the transformation from a manufacturing economy into one based on high technology, leaving limited employment options for lower-skilled workers, particularly males. Foreign immigration is more than making up for these losses, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower). 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent. Many areas of the commonwealth showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010. Exurb an Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County on Cape Cod were the only counties to lose population as of the 2010 Census . Both of these counties feature many \"second homes,\" and constitute major centers of Massachusetts tourism.\nIn 2005, 79% of the state population spoke English, 7% spoke Spanish, 3.5% spoke Portuguese, and 1% spoke either French or Chinese.\nRace and ancestry\n"}, {"score": 1708.3323, "uuid": "33134e8b-0384-5b09-9ab7-0f81924d4e19", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-35-00073", "target_hostname": "www.homegrocer.com", "target_uri": "http://www.homegrocer.com/Meyenberg-Evaporated-Goat-Milk-12Ounce-Cans/A/B000EY5COG.htm", "page_rank": 1.2198541e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Meyenberg Evaporated <em>Goat</em> <em>Milk</em>, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) | HomeGrocer", "snippet": "Thanks to <em>goat</em> <em>milk</em> my son doesn&#x27;t have asthma.

Two months ago he was having problems sleeping and eating. He would drink cow milk and in a half hour he would start to have what doctors call dry cough syndrome. He would cough nightly, have mucus in his nose,will cough out a heavy clear saliva when he coughs it out. First they stated he had allergies. he was prescribed with singular for his allergies. My wife and I went to a specialist and he came out negative. He was then prescribe with pulmicort to inhale. Even 911 ambulance declare he was asthmatic when we explain to them his syndrome. Then one night my wife went on-line to do research about cow milk, and behold a pale horse the site stated the allergies systems is similar to asthma. So parents if your child is acting totally different when he drinks cow milk. Don't jump to conclusion that your joy in life is asthmatic just because the doctor says so .Doctor's are not always 100% right. Do your research and they will be a answer waiting for you not a \"I think he has\" answer. Your judgement can be just as important. THANK YOU goats for being just as delicious and helping my son to be correctly diagnose by doing research. 1 point for parents zero points for the medical field.\n9 of 9 found the following review helpful:\nPowdered milk versus evaporatedOct 24, 2008\nBy Sergio Valladares\nMy wife and I have relied on Meyenberg for goat milk for many years, and though we normally buy it refrigerated, when in the US, we also purchase it in powdered form when traveling abroad, usually for several months out of the year. I was recently unable to purchase it in its powdered form from the Meyenberg supplier on Amazon, as it was out of stock, so I opted for the evaporated milk cans. It's still very good, though for easy transportation powdered milk is hard to beat, as I find the evaporated milk a bit bulky and thus more expensive to ship abroad. On the other hand, the drawback with powdered milk is, once it is opened, the milk powder becomes harder to dissolve the longer it is kept . . . that's the compromise. Still, my wife and I are happy to have the option.\n8 of 8 found the following review helpful:\nAwesome substitute for milk for my son!Aug 27, 2009\nBy S.

When we moved down here to North Eastern TN from Chicago to become back-to-the-land homesteaders there were many things I had never done before, like milk a cow, or any animal for that matter. I wanted to make my own cheese, so, of course, we got a milk cow... Milk = Cow (or so I thought).\n\"Jersey\", the Jersey cow was beautiful and would come when I called her. She gave me a lot of milk. But, she also didn't really care to be milked and would swat me in the face with her tail. As the thick cloud of flies buzzed around, she would eat as I milked, and without notice, arch her back and pee. Sometimes she would poop as I was milking her and I quickly pulled the bucket away so it would not get contaminated. Her poops were classic cow pies, wet and big... yuck. She was big at 800 pounds (not really that big for a cow), and we had no special equipment to hold her if we needed to \"work\" her. We couldn't afford this holding equipment either, so Jersey never got shots or her temperature taken. Luckily she never needed any medical treatments because I do not know how we would have treated her. I made cheese and butter and we drank her milk, which was very good.\nThe only goat milk I had ever has was from the store.. yuck. Then one day we tasted fresh goat milk for the first time. After only a little taste we decided to sell Jersey and look for milk goats. We owned three pet, brush clearing goats, at the time and knew that they were much easier to handle then a cow... even the mean goat <smile>. WHen Jersey rode away in the back of a truck, the cloud of flies went with her, never to return.\nGoats are so much easier for the small homesteader to handle and they produce, I believe, more milk then a cow for what you put into them (grain, hay & water). Goats are cheaper to keep. You can build an inexpensive milkstand from left over wood that will hold the goat for milking and medical care. One person can hold a goat without a stand if needed. Goats are much cleaner than cows; I have never, in my many year of goat keeping, had a goat poop or pee while I was milking her. You can sweep up goat poops with a broom; you can not sweep up a cow pie. I can haul 4-5 goats in the back of my covered mid sized pickup truck; I wouldn't be able to transport on cow in the same truck.\nWhile my cow's milk was delicious, I find properly handled goat milk even better. Goat milk is just plain ol' better for you than cow milk health wise. I have heard many stories of human babies not being able to handle cow milk, where I know for a fact, that not only can these babies handle goat milk, but they thrive on it. I know that goat milk has saved human infants lives. I have never heard this about cow milk.\nAs far as being \"cost effective\". As I said before, I believe goats are cheaper to keep. You say, there is no market for goat's milk. I write this referring to how goats are a better choice for a family milker, not as a money maker. I personally believe that goats are a better choice for a family milker. If you want to make money, don't think goats will make it for you, but then, unless you can afford a lot of cows, they aren't going to make you money for you either (due to the high initial cost of keeping cows).\nButter from goat milk:\nYou may think that you can't make butter from a goat's milk because goat cream doesn't rise like cow cream does; but this isn't necessarily the case. To get goat cream, I recommend doing one of two things. You could either 1) get a cream separator or 2) collect the smaller amount of cream that does rise. I do not own a cream separator myself because they are rather expensive (but this investment would still be cheaper then keeping a cow). Though cream does not rise as easily in goat milk, some cream does indeed rise; you just need to be patient. I used to make my own goat butter all the time (I don't anymore becasue I just don't find it worth the time and effort; I use olive oil instead of butter in most cases). I would save the milk I got each day in gallon jars and let it sit in the back of the fridge for a couple of days. Some of the cream would rise and was easily skimmed off (just like you do with cow milk). I put the skimmed off cream in a 2 quart plastic container and placed it in the freezer. Every time I had goat milk to skim, I pull out the cream container and add to it. When it is full, I removde the frozen cream from the freezer and let it thaw on the counter. I then added a little culture to the cream as it is thawing to sour it, because I like to make butter from sour cream. Using this method I got enough cream to make butter to supply Larry and I with all the butter we needed. Also, because not all of the cream rises in goat milk, the milk that has been skimmed of it's cream still tastes just as good as whole milk and can be used for drinking or to make cheese.\nGoats and cows eat different things. Cows are graizers; goats are browser/graizers. Goats can be kept on steeper, rougher, land that has trees and brush (they will eat the trees and brush). A cow can be kept on steep land, but because of their weight and size, they will tear the land up, where a goat does not cause much damage to the land itself. However, goats will kill trees, where cows won't.\nGoats are safer to be around. A full grown goat weighs about 150 pounds, where a full grown cow weighs 800+ pounds. I would never let a small child be around a cow, where a small child could safely be around some goats. Also, bucks (male goats) are much safer than bulls (male cows). Where a buck can be cantankerous, a bull can be downright deadly.\nAnd finally, on the relationship side, goats are just plain smarter than cows and also more loving. You can have a close, loving, pet relationship with a goat; you cannot, in my experience, have this kind of relationship with a cow.\nAlso see:\nGoat Milk Nutritional breakdown and Comparison to Human and Cow milk\nIf you find this site useful, please donate to help support it.\nThis web site contains over 300 pages of information\nSearch this site:\n"}, {"score": 1699.6273, "uuid": "38af6991-f03a-5053-8b86-13e2570c6a90", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0905wb-26-04628", "target_hostname": "www.passionatehomemaking.com", "target_uri": "http://www.passionatehomemaking.com/2008/11/organic-milk-is-it-worth-it.html", "page_rank": 1.1881461e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Organic <em>Milk</em>: <em>Is</em> it worth it? | Passionate Homemaking", "snippet": "Although I do want to support the organic farming industry, I think there are currently far <em>better</em> options\u2026 Finding a local source to purchase raw <em>milk</em> straight from the <em>cow</em> <em>or</em> <em>goat</em> are the best alternatives.

Though I can get raw cow\u2019s milk for $5 a gallon, it\u2019s pretty far away- at least 30 miles if not more one way to pick it up. When gas was high, I stopped buying it and bought the best I could, which is organic pasteurized and homogenized milk.But, now that gas is less, I want to start back on the raw milk.\nHowever, my kefir grains did not like the raw milk. It took a month before I got drinkable kefir, after putting them back in storebought milk. Kefir is so important to us that I hate to mess with it. I ended up buying milk at the store too, so it seemed kind of pointless. We did enjoy the fresh butter though. Creme fraiche didn\u2019t work out either. How do you successfully separate the cream from the milk when it\u2019s in a gallon jug?\nReply\nLindsay Nov 14, 2008 at 10:22 pm #\nThe raw cream naturally rises to the top as it sits in the fridge, but mine comes in a gallon size glass jar. I simply use a measuring cup to skim it out. If you have a different container from which you can\u2019t skim as I mentioned, I would try transferring it to a gallon jar and then allow it to sit for awhile in the fridge and then skim as described.\nStephanie @ Keeper of the Home Nov 14, 2008 at 8:14 am #\nThanks for this, Lindsay! A great topic that needs to be talked about more!\nI understand the difficulty of not being able to get raw milk. I also live in Canada, where it cannot be bought or sold. We have gotten around this by being a part of a cow share, where we are part owners and are paying the farmer a maintenance fee to care for and milk the cow on our behalf. We feel good about this decision, and that we are well within the boundaries of obeying our authorities and yet still doing the best we can for our family. There are no laws to prohibit what one does with their own cow and it\u2019s milk (nor should there ever be!).\nAs for organic, I do still feel that if raw milk is unavailable or very unaffordable, it\u2019s a better choice than conventional milk to be used for making yogurt, kefir, etc. Though I don\u2019t feel that organic regulations are nearly stringent enough (they are so vague, aren\u2019t they?), they are still better than conventional in most cases. We never drink this milk straight, but only use it for cultured products, and I still feel good about spending a little extra on the organic for even small benefits.\nOne way to keep organic milk cheaper, though, is to buy it on clearance if you plan to culture it anyways. It will last well in your freezer or fridge. I also do this with clearance raw milk whenever I\u2019m down in Washington!\nReply\nDeAnna Nov 13, 2008 at 7:45 pm #\nI have been thinking about raw milk and wanting to try it out, but I didn\u2019t know where to get it near us. I was sure there had to be a farm somewhere, but didn\u2019t know where. Then the other day I passed by our Whole Foods and they had a big sign saying they carried raw milk now. I haven\u2019t checked out the price, but I\u2019m hoping I can try it out. As for organic milk, that\u2019s pretty important to me, if raw milk would be too expensive, I will continue to at least buy the organic. If for no other reason than I don\u2019t want my daughters getting the hormones that they keep injecting into these cows (as well as other things.) I just read an article about this in a Vegan Life magazine and WOW is it all disturbing. But I\u2019m really hoping the raw milk will be affordable because I do believe it is much healthier. I too would be interested in knowing about the taste. I\u2019m not a milk drinker at all, my girls and husband like it and I use it on oatmeal, but that\u2019s pretty much it for me. I\u2019m just wondering if they would still like it. If nothing else, I guess if they don\u2019t like it, it will cut them back on wanting it.\nReply\nBecky Nov 13, 2008 at 4:34 pm #\nThis really is a great topic to bring up. Prior to my son being born I bought milk from a local dairy that never used growth hormones. This milk was significantly cheaper than organic milk so it was a good option.\nWhen my son was two weeks old I noticed a lot of digestive problems and through elimination discovered he had a sensitivity to cow\u2019s milk and soy. That meant I had to cut those things from my diet because he was receiving those allergens thorough my breast milk. I have done plenty of research and found a lot of great information about the benefits of raw milk (as well as the dangers of soy). There is a local organic farm that sells raw milk that I have purchased. He hasn\u2019t had any issues with raw milk but it is expensive so I don\u2019t by it frequently. When it isn\u2019t in the budget I make my own \u201cmilk\u201d from rice, oats, or coconut. I have almonds so I think I will give that a try too.

I have a few questions about the Cows Milk though.\nMy son drinks Organic Soy Milk with DHA in it because I have always been a research hound and I found that many people say that Cows Milk in general is not very good for humans. What I read was that the proteins can not be absorbed into our system and many of the nutrients are lost making cows milk just another beverage. They stress that Cows Milk is for Cows. Are the health benefits greater for humans when the milk in unprocessed?\nMy other concern (although kind of silly) is that I am super picky about the taste of mu milk. Sometimes I get a gallon of Cows Milk from the store (Which My husband and I drink) and I let it go to waste merely because the taste is not good. I understand that much of the taste comes from the Cows diet but does unprocessed milk taste much different than processed?\nThank you for your post, I have never given Raw Milk and thought.\nNikki\nReply\nLindsay Nov 14, 2008 at 12:07 am #\nA lot of the disadvantages you mentioned of cow\u2019s milk are due to the pasteurization and homogenization process. Raw is definitely a different story. Goat\u2019s milk is supposed to be the best as far as nutrition and better for you than cow\u2019s milk but the flavor is very different and many do not like it. You may be interested in reading a few articles published by Weston Price Foundation (authors of the book Nourishing Traditions) and their discussion on the health concerns of soy. Read more here . Here is one quote:\nHigh levels of phytic acid in soy reduce assimilation of calcium, magnesium, copper, iron and zinc. Phytic acid in soy is not neutralized by ordinary preparation methods such as soaking, sprouting and long, slow cooking. High phytate diets have caused growth problems in children.\nAs to the taste of raw milk, it is simply delicious! It takes so much more rich, creamy and flavorful than store bought. It is a totally different experience. I would drink it all the time if I could!\nMelissa Nov 13, 2008 at 11:53 am #\nLindsay,\nHave you actually made the almond milk from your link above? I am curious about your almonds. I\u2019ve found alot of articles talking about required pasteurization and that almonds are being sold as \u201craw\u201d but have been flash pasteurized. Do you buy raw that are actually still viable, and do you know any specific brands which are genuinely raw or falsely raw for that matter, so I can sort out good and bad possibilities. I love almonds. They are one of my primary snack foods, and my oldest daughter loves them. Thanks!\nReply\nLindsay Nov 15, 2008 at 8:30 pm #\nI have not made the almond milk myself, but rather have friends that recommended the recipe to me. Yes, I have read about the confusion over \u201craw\u201d almonds. All retail almonds are now treated, either with heat or more commonly chemicals, but they can still be labeled as raw \u2013 craziness!\nLuckily you can get around this by buying direct from growers.

It results in a very creamy \u201cmilk.\u201d I follow the recipes at Spunky Coconut and/or Elana\u2019s Pantry, both great blogs. Unlike almond milk, you don\u2019t need to strain it.\nFor store-bought milk, I also wanted to recommend So Delicious\u2019 new coconut milk, which is coconut milk that is intended to be consumed as a dairy sub like soy milk (it\u2019s found near the refrigerated soy milk). But it\u2019s soy and dairy free\u2026and really delicious (though pricey)!\ngojigirl Nov 13, 2008 at 10:38 am #\nWe have been buying raw milk from a certified organic dairy farmer 15miles away.\nIt is wonderful, as I can\u2019t digest pasteurized milk properly. Even better is talking to the owner, realizing that his heart is providing healthy milk from healthy cows that are grass fed & pastured as much as Wisconsin weather permits. He feels the current organic standards are set way too low, and I agree. He is planning on establishing the legal protection of a cow-share program this winter, which I happily anticipate, although not the increase in pricing due to his legal expenses.\nWhen life is really hectic, and I can\u2019t make it to the farm during the window of time to buy milk, we do purchase regular milk from the store. This has only happened 2 or 3 times now. We just choose to use minimal milk until we can get to the farm, and never buy organic milk at the store. Why? Where I live I can only get organic milk if it is ultra-pasteurized, which is truly not worth the exorbitant price charged. (Double what we pay at the farm)\nReply\nAlison Nov 13, 2008 at 8:53 am #\nI envy you living in an area where it is legal for farmers to distribute raw milk. Here in Georgia, our benevolent government has taken it upon itself to decided that the freedom of choosing what your family eats and drinks should not be given to the people since we are obviously too stupid to take care of ourselves. Argh!!!!!!!\nMy family had been looking in to buying a cow for a while now, and the one thing that is really holding us back is that we would apparently have to throw away a lot of milk since we could never consume as much milk in a week as a cow produces in a day and it is illegal to sell it.\nActually, there are ways around this law. We could label it as being for pet consumption, or we could have all our friends who are interested in buying raw milk actually buy the cow. They would pay weekly or monthly to be part owner of the cow and, naturally as owner, get some of the milk. The question is, just how long is it until the make the above methods illegal, too?\nReply\nSarahMichelle Nov 13, 2008 at 10:49 am #\nHere in Canada it is illegal to sell or distribute raw milk because it is \u201cdangerous\u201d, though of course cigarettes are apparently safe because you can buy them. There is a farmer in Ontario who sold \u201cshares\u201d in his cow and then distributed the milk to the \u201cowners\u201d but he is currently being prosecuted for his actions, so they are ensuring that there is no way to get around the law.\nIt is a struggle for us because we firmly believe that not only is raw milk better, but that conventional milk is actually harmful. We are not in a position to have our own cow so that is not an option. We have friends who have a cow and they are willing to let us have raw milk, however I question whether, as a Christian, it would be right to take it.\nFirst of all I hesitate to put our friends at risk in that way \u2013 there could be significant consequences for them if they get caught. Secondly, Scripture commands us to obey our civil authorities, except of course where the laws contradict God\u2019s Word. Does my desire to protect my families health give me the right to break the law?\nI have been fortunate to find a little health food store about two minutes from my house that carries organic whole milk that is low-heat pasteurized and is not homogenized, so for now that is what we are buying.\nReply\nLindsay Nov 13, 2008 at 11:03 am #\nI am so sorry to hear of your difficulties in getting raw milk. That would be very difficult and frustrating at the same time. It sounds as if your friend is willing to just give it to you? I was under the impression that the problem might arise for them if they actually sold the milk to you. Just a thought. The option of low-heat and non-homogenized milk is a great alternative. This is very hard to find around here.\nReply\nIvonne Nov 14, 2008 at 9:58 am #\nHi SarahMichelle, I also live in Canada and was wondering what brand is that you get that is low heat pasteurized. I try to buy organic milk for my daugthers and I\u2019m always looking for better options healthwise.\nThanks\nKim Aug 19, 2009 at 5:48 am #\nHi Sarahmichelle,\nWhy dont you offer to buy a share of the cow. That way you could own say 1% of the cow and since you own part of it, you could enjoy the milk legally. Just an thought.\nReply\nShannon Nov 13, 2008 at 6:25 am #\nFor those of us who live an hour or more from a raw milk source, can you freeze this milk? Do you know if freezing would ruin the milk or the nutrients? It would be more efficient for me to buy raw milk in bulk, since I would have to travel about 90 miles to purchase raw milk.\nI\u2019ve been wanting to do this for a while, but the distance from a source has prohibited me from looking into it much. I wish I could just start a milk farm for people in our area!!\nReply\nLindsay Nov 13, 2008 at 8:29 am #\nYes, it is perfectly save to freeze raw milk. It may affect the texture somewhat but it will not ruin any of the nutrients. Weston Price addresses the question here as follows:\nQ. Is it okay to freeze raw milk? Is it okay to freeze it in glass?\nA. Yes it is fine to freeze milk\u2013even the enzymes are preserved. You can freeze it in glass if the container is open and not completely full, although plastic is safer from a breakage standpoint.\nReply\nGretchen Nov 13, 2008 at 10:48 am #\nMy family also lives some distance from where we get our raw milk. We have cut expenses by rotating picking up our milk along with other family members and friends. We only drive to get our milk (and theirs)one time a month and have our milk delivered to us the other weeks. This is just another suggestion.\nWe have also froze our milk and cream (to save for the winter months when the cows are not producing) and have had no problems with it.\nReply\nLindsay Nov 13, 2008 at 11:00 am #\nThat is exactly what we have done. We have a group of 6 families that take turns on the route. It works great if the milk is a bit of a distance.\nShannon Nov 13, 2008 at 11:34 am #\nThanks, ladies; this is encouraging. I really hope to make the switch soon.\nDonielle @ Raising Peanuts Nov 13, 2008 at 5:37 am #\nWe went raw almost a year ago and have never looked back! I love the fact that I know exactly where my milk comes from and that the cows are out on pasture to their hearts content every day.\nSuzy Nov 13, 2008 at 4:51 am #\nI have just found your blog and have really enjoyed reading your thoughful posts!\nOur family tends to buy organic/ free-range products mainly because they are better for the environment and the the animal\u2019s have a happier life.\nIt can be more expensive but I\u2019d rather go without in other areas and know that I\u2019m helping farmers who care about being good stewards to our beautiful earth and it\u2019s animals.\nSuzy ~\nReply\nRebecca Nov 13, 2008 at 4:06 am #\nWhile I applaud your efforts to learn more about the food you feed to your family, I cannot agree with you on the benefits of raw milk. Unless you have your own cow and know for yourself about the hygenic methods used to milk it and store it you cannot be certain it will not harm you and your children. Preganant and nursing women especially should avoid this as well as young children. You cannot trust anyone other than yourself (if you have your own cow) to milk that cow and store that mild hygenically every time. That farmer may have good intentions but you cannot be absolutely sure. I hope this does not come across as anything other than concern. Sometimes I don\u2019t communicate too well.\nIn Christ,\nReply\nLindsay Nov 13, 2008 at 8:27 am #\nThanks for your concern. I believe this is just a personal decision we each must make and research. I personally know and trust my milk farmer. He is a Christian man and making his best effort to serve my family along with others. Unfortunately, it is impossible to grow all of own food if I were to only trust myself as you suggest, sometimes it does take a step of faith, but we have never had issues with our milk, and I have been drinking it through two pregnancies. Evidence shows that store-bought milk is actually more harmful than raw. At least with buying locally and knowing my farmers (not only with milk but with our produce), I can be assured of their right practices far better than any store bought and mass produced item.\n"}], [{"score": 1676.4464, "uuid": "012ca972-64aa-5062-8f52-04d77799db61", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1118wb-11-14038", "target_hostname": "kosherscene.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://kosherscene.wordpress.com/category/milk/", "page_rank": 1.2623299e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>milk</em> \u00ab The Kosher Scene", "snippet": ", <em>Goat</em> and Sheep (ewe), but there are also cheeses made with a mix of <em>milk</em> from different animals, and even cheeses from Buffalo, Moose, Camel <em>or</em> Yak\u2019s <em>milk</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Categories: American cheese , Artificial rinds , Brie , Camembert , Ch\u00e8vre , Cheddar , cheese , Cheese making , Cheese rind , Cheez Whiz , CIA , cooked cheese , Cottage cheese , Cream Cheese , Culinary Institute of America , edam , Emmental , Eran Elhalal , Feta cheese , Fleur de Maquis , fresh cheese , Gouda , Grayson , Idiazabal , Iraty , kashkaval , kosher cheese , Kraft Cheese singles , Majorero Pimenton , Manchego , milchig , milk , Mimolette , Morbier , Mozzarella , Mozzarella cheese , Natural dry rind , Organic rind , Ossau , Paneer , Parmigiano Reggiano , Pasta Filata cheese , Pecorino , Piave , Pont I\u2019Eveque , pressed and ripened cheese , pressed and ripened cheeses , pressed cheese , processed cheese , provolone , Ricotta , ripened cheese , Robiola , Robiola Bosina , Robiola Pineta , St. Maure , Stilton cheese , Taleggio , upressed and ripened cheese , Urda , Valdeon , Washed rind and White mold rind\n[My good friend, Eran Elhalal, gives us the third and last part of his Intro to Cheese.\nEran Elhalal is a chef/Entrepreneur working in Manhattan. An Honors Graduate of the Culinary Institute of America,\u00a0 Eran was Executive Chef of two Manhattan restaurants in the past few years and consulted several others. He began educating customers about food and wine pairing and cheese in 2007 while working as the Chef at UES\u2019s BarVespa.\nThese days, Eran talks about food and wine pairing as the chef for the panel of Meetup, a wine club, dedicated to introduce and educate the American public about Israeli wines. Photos: courtesy of Eran Elhalal.\nNot every type of cheese described below is, so far, made for the kosher consumer. That situation, however is changing fast as various distributors ( here and here ) and manufacturers are constantly introducing new and delicious cheeses into the kosher market. CS]\n\u201cHow can you be expected to govern a country that has 246 kinds of cheese?\u201d\nCharles de Gaulle\nTrying to Categorize Cheeses\nThere is no one set of rules by which to categorize the world\u2019s cheeses. After thousands of years of cheese-making , we still are unable to agree on one set of rules, and here is why:\nSome factors are very difficult to quantify \u2013 for example the classification relying on smell. Detection and rating vary from person to person depending on how accute their sense of smell is. No one category can address all types and nuances. For example, Classification relying on rind alone, puts hundreds of cheeses with no rind in the same category.\nAnother example is classification by aging, it would put a Danish blue cheese and a Farmhouse Brie in the same category. Traveling between different categories- Cheese is a living thing. Every cheese is released with a certain fat content and certain water content. As the cheese ages these percentages change due to water evaporation. Hence, the same triple creamed cheese , tastes much more pungent a month after you bought it! Moreover, a cheese that was classified as Semi-hard like a dutch Gouda will turn rock hard as it ages.\nKnowing this, we can now learn to pickout, describe and appreciate cheeses using the more common categories for classification:\nQueso Manchego - Spanish sheep's milk cheese, has a wonderful and unique bite to it\nTexture\nClassification determined by water content:\nVery soft \u2013 80 % water, spoonable, includes most fresh cheeses like Cottage cheese, Ch\u00e8vre, Labane.\nSoft \u2013 50 %-70% water, spreadable, includes the double and triple creamed cheeses (Brie, Camembert, Robiola, Taleggio, Colummiers\u2026), but also some Feta cheeses (cow\u2019s milk mainly).\nSemihard \u2013 40%-50% water, sliceable, includes Edam, Gouda, Manchego.\nHard \u2013 30%-50% water, very firm and dense, includes Parmigiano Reggiano, Pecorino, Piave, Ossau, Iraty, Mimolette\u2026\nBlue -40%-50% water, a classification within the semi hard group of cheeses, may be sliceable, spreadable or crumbly, includes all blue veined cheeses, like; Valdeon, Cabrales, Roquefort, Gorgonzola\u2026\nNoordhollander Gouda - Yes, there are some delicious kosher variations of this cheese\nAging\nLength of aging prior to release:\nFresh \u2013 Un-aged, produced and released, include Cottage cheese, Cream cheese, Ch\u00e8vre.\nBrief Molding period \u2013 2 weeks-10 weeks, produced and allowed to take shape in a mold ( tub or basket), or for the rind to bloom, includes Feta, almost all blue cheeses and bloomy rind cheeses (Grayson, Taleggio, Brie\u2026).\nAged \u2013 Anywhere between 2 months and 5 years, depending on the cheese, produced and allowed to mature until the cheesemaker deems it fully aged and flavored, includes all hard and semi hard cheeses,like; Parmigiano Reggiano, Idiazabal, Pecorino, Cheddar, Gouda\u2026\nType of Milk\nClassification by what animal produces the milk:\nThe most common are Cow, Goat and Sheep (ewe), but there are also cheeses made with a mix of milk from different animals, and even cheeses from Buffalo, Moose, Camel or Yak\u2019s milk.\nTaleggio\nClassification by degree of pungency:\nA very difficult classification,works mainly for bloomy rind cheeses like \u2013 Taleggio, Robiola, Camembert, Brie\u2026\nMethods of cheese-making\nClassification by main cheesemaking traditional methods:\nFresh Cheese \u2013 Unaged or matured, includes some slightly pressed cheeses(Feta),whey based cheeses that are only strained (Urda, Ricotta) and the spoonable, Cottage, Cream cheese, Ch\u00e8vre.\nPasta Filata Cheese \u2013 The curds are cooked, then streched and folded repeatedly before molding or shaping. The cheese is then ready to eat or may be ripened further and even smoked (Mozzarella, Provolone, Paneer, Kashkaval).\nUnpressed Ripened Cheese \u2013 The curds are minimally cut and allowed to drain . They are then ripened with mold or bacteria on the cheese surface (Camembert, Brie, Taleggio\u2026) or using a starter culture that is applied to the surface or inoculated into the cheese (Stilton).\nPressed and Ripened Cheese \u2013 The curds are pressed before ripening. Examples: Manchego, Idiazabal, Cheddar.\nCooked, pressed and ripened \u2013 The curds are cooked in whey, then milled, molded and pressed. These cheeses are aged for up to 5 years (Parmigiano Reggiano, Piave, Gouda, Edam, Emmental\u2026).\nProcessed \u2013 After the initial cheesemaking process is complete ( see 2nd part of this series ), more milk and emulsifying salts are added, food coloring and preservatives. This yields a very consistent product, yet rather unhealthy. Unfortunately, these cheeses, sold in blocks, slices, tubes and even sprays are the most commonly consumed types in the US. (American cheese, Kraft singles, Cheez Whiz \u2026.and other such varieties of poor excuses for cheese!)\nRind\nDutch Gouda -Uses an artificial wax rind, to lock in moisture and deepen the flavor as the cheese ages\nClassification by type of rind:\nThe rind of the cheese controls the rate of water evaporation from the cheese, oxidation of the surface and escape of gases from within.\nNo rind \u2013 The cheese is produced and packaged or at most strained, salted and packed. Includes all fresh cheeses like: Ricotta, Urda, Cream cheese, Feta\u2026\nWhite mold rind \u2013 The mold grows on the surface and is edible. The rind is sometimes brushed away a number of times throughout ripening, so the cheese will develop a thicker rind. The mold is white at first but as the cheese ages it darkens. Includes: Camembert, Brie, Robiola Bosina.\nWashed rind \u2013 the rind is washed with alcohol, usually Marc (Grape pomace Brandy) or wine. The alcohol dries the surface of the cheese and the white bloomy mold turns pinkish/Orange. The rind is moist and a has a slightly grainy mouthfeel, thus it is not usually eaten. Includes Taleggio, Robiola Pineta, Grayson, Pont I\u2019Eveque.\nNatural dry rind \u2013 The rind is in fact the dry outer surface of the cheese. The rind can be brushed, scraped, oiled or wrapped in cloth depending on the desired result. The rind is inedible, types include: Parmigiano Reggiano, Cheddar, Piave\u2026\nOrganic rind \u2013 Leaves, spices and herbs applied to the surface of the cheese after its made. The reason is to impart flavor and protect from insects traditionally (Fleur de Maquis, Corsican ewe\u2019s milk cheese rolled in herbs & Juniper berries, or Majorero Pimenton \u2013 rolled in smoked pepper). another reason is to lock in moisture. Examples include: Valdeon, wrapped in sycamore leaves; Banon, tied in chestnut leaves and tied with raffia.\nArtificial rinds \u2013 Added after the cheese is made. Rind is generally inedible. Includes Gouda, Edam (wax rind), Cheddar (plastic) and ash edible in St. Maure (for example).\nSo\u2026 these are just the main categories. When I describe a cheese, I try to use all the categories that apply most, focusing on the ones that characterize the paricular cheese category more than others.\nOne last example. Morbier\nOrigin: Comte region, North East France\nMilk: Raw or Pasteurized Cow\u2019s milk.\nTexture: Semi hard (40 %-50% water), sliceable.\nMethod of cheese-making: Pressed and ripened,with a layer of ash running through the center.\nSmell: mild pungent\nRind: Natural dry rind,brushed for firmness.\nAging; 2-3 months\nFat content: 45 %\nInteresting facts: This cheese was traditionally made for consumption by the cheesemakers themselves. Leftover curds were put in a tub, then covered with ash to repel insects, while waiting for additional leftover curds from the evening or the next day.\nEran Elhalal\n"}, {"score": 1669.948, "uuid": "d5eb631a-fc63-5124-b77f-a23553164211", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1705wb-57-09482", "target_hostname": "www.oursimplefarm.com", "target_uri": "http://www.oursimplefarm.com/2011/11/eden-goat-milk-soap-is-up-and-running.html", "page_rank": 1.1786526e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Our Simple Farm: Eden <em>Goat</em> <em>Milk</em> Soap <em>is</em> Up and Running!", "snippet": "Just go to my Eden <em>Goat</em> <em>Milk</em> Soap page and order there.

INTRODUCTION\nCamel milk: What possible importance can camel milk have in the year 1981 in a world beset with a multitude of problems? The answer to this is clear when we consider that one of the biggest problems confronting mankind today is malnourishment. Camel milk can certainly play a far more important role in the prevention of malnutrition than it does today. Growing and raising foodstuffs for the rapidly increasing human population is especially precarious in the hot and arid zones of the world - the very areas where the camel is one of the few animals not only to survive, but also to benefit man.\nBefore presenting data on milk production, both quantity and quality, one must consider in detail all the relevant information about the camel in order to ascertain the full value that this animal can play in human nutrition.\nCamels, or the family of camels, the Camelidae, are found throughout the world and all camels will be mentioned when possible; however, this report deals mainly with the one-humped dromedary, which is found in the desert and semi-desert areas.\nMilk is the main food obtained from a herd of camels, (Dahl, 1979). The one-humped camel was domesticated about 3000 B.C.E. in southern Arabia (Bullet, 1975), mainly for its meat and milk (Epstein, 1971). The camels were, and still are, valued as riding, baggade and work animals, as well as providers of hair and hides. In arid zones the camel is a better provider of food than the cow, which is severely affected by the heat, scarcity of water and feed (Sweet, 1965).\nCamels originated in North America when the land masses were still joined (Leuner, 1963). These animals were no larger than hares. Here they remained from the upper Eocene throughout the Tertiary period, into the Pleistocene epoch, a period of 40 million years. Continued evolution produced the very large American camels. From North America, meanwhile, the animals migrated to other parts of the world, finally disappearing from their original area. The various types and breeds in the camel family are probably a result of evolutionary adaptation to the various environments to which the animals were exposed.\nSome of the camels migrated to the deserts and semi-deserts of northern Africa and the Middle East. Remains of camels have been found in old Palestine, dating to 1800 B.C.E. Field (1979) considered that further migration of camels in Africa was prevented by their susceptibility to tsetseborne trypanosomiasis. However, the camel has been incriminated as the probable host which became infected with Trypanosoma brucei in the northern tsetse areas and spread the infection which evolved to mechanically-transmitted T. evansi, throughout northern Africa into Asia. These camels have one-hump and long spindly legs.\nThe two-humped camel, the Bactrian, was domesticated on the border of Iran and Turkmenistan and spread to an area bordered by the Crimea, southern Siberia, Mongolia and China. These animals are stockier than the dromedary and covered by a thicker wool.\nThe new-world Camelidae are smaller versions of the camels and live in the heights of the mountains in South America.\nAll the members of the camel family are found in the order of the Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates); suborder: Tylopoda (pad-footed); family: Camelidae. The old-world genus is the Camelus, having the two species of the Bactrianus (two-humped) and Dromedarius (one-humped). The new-world genus of the Lama has three species, while the genus of Vicugna has only one species.\nAlthough they chew cud, camels differ from true ruminants in a few anatomical features (Cloudley-Thompson, 1969). Adult camels have two incisor teeth in their upper jaws; they lack an omasum, the third stomach division of the ruminants, which is considered the water reabsorbing portion of the stomach; they have no gallbladder; and the hooves have been reduced to claw-like toes, projecting beyond the pads. In India, camel meat is not eaten by the Hindus (Simoons, 1961), nor by the Christian Copts of Egypt, Zoroastrians of Iran, Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran, Nosaioris of Syria, Ethiopians of Christian Faith nor in Israel the camel is considered as being unsuitable as a source of meat.\nWithin the arid regions the camel-breeding tribes have maintained a dominant position over other societies by virtue of their ability to exploit the often poor grazing ranges (Sweet, 1965). Camel-owning tribes are continually on the move, looking for grazing and water for their animals (Elamin, 1979). They can wander over 1 000 km in a season. The distance covered depends on the availability of water and feed. With rapidly expanding urbanization, these wanderings are causing clashes between cultures and destroying the grazing areas of the camels.\nBecause of its importance as a means of survival for the desert dwellers, the camel often plays an important role in the social and cultural heritage of the tribes. For instance, in various cultures (Hartley, 1979) ownership of a camel begins when a male child is born. He is presented with a femalecalf. The child's umbilical cord is placed in a sac and tied around the neck of the camel. In other societies the camel is used for attracting wives or paying off \u201ccriminal\u201d offences (Dickson, 1951).\nCamels have been introduced by man into various parts of the world, mainly as baggage animals for the arid zones of the country. This happened in Australia, where the camels escaped into the wild and are now considered vermin (McKnight, 1969). In Italy, Spain, South Africa and Texas in the USA camels were also introduced as pack animals, but they soon disappeared. Camels were introduced into the Canary Islands from Morocco in 1402 (Buillet, 1975), where they are still in use in agriculture and as beasts of burden.\nIn Sudan (El-Amin, 1979) there is at present one of the largest populations of one-humped camels in the world. They are found mainly in the arid and semi-arid areas of the country, where the average rainfall is less than 350 mm per year.\nIn the Horn of Africa (Hartley, 1979) the camel is found in the arid and semi-arid rangelands in Ethiopia, Djibuti, Somalia and Kenya. In these areas water supplies range from abundant in the riverine areas, to extreme aridity. In these areas the inhabitants are mainly pastoral and the camels roam according to the range conditions. In the dry season the camels are watered once every 10\u201320 days, compared with every 3\u20138 days for sheep and goats and every 2\u20133 days for cattle. The movement of the camels away from the living centres is divided primarily into far-moving dry herds and the closer-by milch animals.\nBaggage camel\nPloughing with aid of the camel\nPhoto 2\nThe Boran of Ethiopia and Somalia rank their animals as follows: lactating caws, dry cows, lactating camels, dry camels, sheep and goats (Lewis, 1974). The pastoral Somali nomads have only two types of herding units. The first consists of the camels herded by the young unmarried men, which sometimes graze hundreds of kilometers from wells. The second group of milch animals are herded by the family unit of husband, wife, unmarried daughters and young sons. During the rainy season, when feed is freely available, the two herding units meet, and with both milk and meat in abundance, collective rituals and feasts take place.\nFor the Gabbra and Rendille tribes of northern Kenya, the camel is still the most important livestock (Sato, 1976; Torry, 1973). Much of their culture revolves around the camel owing to the animal's ability to survive the extreme aridity and to supply milk, which is the staple diet of these tribes.\nIn Pakistan, as well, there are areas with extremely arid pastures in which the only livestock that can produce milk, meat, wool and skins is the camel (Knoess, 1979). The camels are also valued as pack animals, carrying up to 600 kg on their backs and are also used for pulling carts.\nIn China, Mongolia and Russia the two-humped Bactrian camel thrives. (Dong Wei, 1979). They are mainly used as pack, riding and draught animals. The wool is of some importance, reaching 1 500 tons per year. Meat and milk are of lesser importance (Dong Wei, 1981).\nIn South America the guanaco and vicugna are the wild forms of the camel family (Bustinza Choque, 1979). The llama and alpaca have been domesticated. These Camelidae are utilized mainly as pack animals, but also supply meat, skin and fur. The South American cameloids live in a semidesert habitat that ranges from sea level to the Andean high country, at elevations of 5 000 m or more.\nThe questions that must be answered are:\nWhat makes the camel, particularly the one-humped Arabian camel, so special? Or how is this animal able to adapt so perfectly to his environment?\nCan the natural traits of the animal be improved upon for man's use?\nIf this animal can be of such benefit to man, why hasn't it been more widely used up to now?\nWhat is the composition of camel milk? How much milk can it give? What is its fertility capability?\nWhat does the camel eat?\nThe reason why the camel has not been more widely used is given in the opening remarks of the International Symposium on camels in Sudan, organized by the International Foundation for Science (El-Karouti, 1970). It was stated that \u201cthe prejudice against the camel stems from a misconception that it is of low economic value and is synonymous to under-development\u201d. It is universally accepted that milk and meat for human consumption in established communities are supplied mainly by cattle, sheep and goats. This applies even to arid zones, although it is actually the dromedary which can survive and let alone producing milk and meat for humans in these areas, while other animals have difficulty in staying alive.\nThus, almost no research as to the capacity of the camel to produce milk and meat under drought conditions, in areas, or under conditions where human nutrition is so precarious, has been done. As former camel owners become sedentary, the camel disappears. No thought is given to the ability of this animal to produce food in severe drought periods. In many places of the world the development of infrastructure, especially roads, has caused the camel to lose its value as a riding animal or beast of burden. Motor transport can now reach most outlying areas. However, in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, motor transport is still extremely expensive and in those areas, which are undeveloped and not suited for motor vehicles, the camel is still a prized animal. The trends in camel holding ca be seen in Table 1. Thus it can be seen that in most countries the camel population is declining. The present-day distribution of camels shows that the limit of camel breeding does not pass the 50 cm rain area (Mason, 1979). The Bactrian camel is not found in temperatures over 21\u00b0C.\nResearch in physiology, endocrinology, husbandry, various diseases and their control are among the basic requirements from which further development and reorientation of the camel industry can start. While many aspects of camel anatomy, physiology and diseases are well documented, knowledge of husbandry is lagging far behind. Improved methods of breeding and intensive husbandry have not been systematically examined. The introduction of hardy plants into arid areas for camel fodder is only in its embryo state.\nThe changes in shape and size of camels from their original small size (Zeuner, 1963) were obviously caused by interractions with their environments. This is also true for the wide changes that have been described for the various physiological mechanism. The changes in normal physiological responses to the environment not only allow the animal to survive, but explain the ability of this animal to supply nutrition for their young. This supply cound be used for man, who is attempting to live in these areas. Furthermore, basic knowledge of breeding and lactation is a primary requirement for planning improved husbandry and farming with these animals.\nThe physiological mechanisms, which allow the camel to survive periods of over two weeks without drinking water and to eat the most unpalatable plants, all have to do with the conservation of water. The appropriate physiological mechanisms will be discussed further. What is of interest now is that severe desiccation is tolerated. Up to 30 percent of its body weight can be lost by loss of water - amounts that would be fatal in the case of other farm animals or even man (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1964). Moreover, this loss can be replenished in a matter of minutes (Yagil et al., 1974). The camel has the lowest water-turnover of all animals (Macfarlane, 1977) and is able to regulate water and salt uptake from the colon and their excretion from the kidneys (Yagil and Etzion, 1979). Camels do not need to sweat to lower body temperature, thus conserving water (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1964). The camel increases its body temperature from 34\u00b0C in the early morning to over 41\u00b0C in the late afternoon, at which time the environment cools greatly. Thus the camel stores its heat during the day and cools off by conduction and convection in the evening. The water-deprived camel reduces its metabolism (Schmidt-Nielsen et al., 1967; Yagil et al., 1975) which also conserves water.\nTogether with the examples of physiological adaptation mentioned above, there are also behavioral adaptations. These consist mainly of presenting the smallest possible surface area to the rays of the sun (Ingram and Mount, 1975) and by being less active in the heat of the day. Even the covering of the camel changes from a wool in the winter to a sleek shiny reflecting hair in the summer. Equatorial camels do not shed their hair, but maintain a smooth reflecting coat throughout the year. The hump does not serve as a water reservoir, nor solely as an energy reserve, but its greatest use is that being a concentration of body fat it leaves the subcutaneous tissues virtually fat-free, thus allowing for an efficient cooling to a relatively cooler environment (Cloudley-Thompson, 1969).\nThe future of the camel lies in the exploitation of the milk and meat producing capabilities in areas where perennial drought conditions cause many human deaths each summer. In addition, the interaction between livestock and vegetation will decide the degree of continued desert encroachment or rehabilitation.\nTable 1.

The process/instructions are the same whether you use raw milk or pasteurized milk.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Nick at 12/17/10 4:26 PM\nWhen using milk kefir grains with coconut milk, can it be unsweetened coconut milk that does not contain any sugar?\nI apologize for the delay responding to your message--it looks like we had a system glitch that delayed these messages coming through to us.\nIdeally you'd want to use unsweetened coconut milk. Any additives have the potential to interact negatively with the kefir grains and potentially damage them. Unsweetened would be safest.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Adam at 1/10/11 7:44 PM\nHi where are your kefir grains originally sourced/grown? Do you post to Australia?\nWe grow our kefir grains ourselves in a licensed food processing facility--this allows us to maintain the highest quality product. We do ship kefir grains to Australia.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Nick at 1/10/11 11:22 AM\nI rehydrated my kefir grains in cow milk and they came out great. I then switch to unsweetened organic coconut milk for two days and the grains no longer seem to be active, even after switching back to cow milk. Do you know why this could be? If the milk is unaffected after 24-36 hours are the grains no longer active? Thanks.\nKefir grains can take a few days to adjust to a new milk medium. For example, if you switch your kefir grains from cow to goat milk, it can take a few batches for them to adjust to the composition of the new milk and start working properly. Same thing happens if you go from pasteurize cow milk to raw cow milk and sometimes even different brands of milk (feed, etc. can vary from farm to farm). Different chemical compositions can mean an adjustment period of up to a few batches. So go ahead and put them back in coconut milk and give them a batch or two to adjust (maybe just the coconut milk that isn't kefiring in the meantime to cook or in a smoothie or something). They should perk up and start doing their thing in a few days. With coconut milk though you'll need to put them back in cow milk for 24 hours to revitalize for every few weeks they spend in cow milk.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Steena at 1/25/11 4:37 AM\nHow many kefir grains are sold in one box? How many are needed for one batch? I'm new to kefir and I'm just wondering if there's enough for a \"backup\" in this box? Or enough to share with a friend? Thanks!!\nKefir grains are one of the hardiest cultures so there's just one portion in the box. Kefir grains are a wonderful culture for a beginner because they are very easy to use and it's very rare to mess them up. Kefir grains do generally start to multiply after 6-8 weeks and usually within 3-5 months will have grown enough to have extras to share with friends. We can't guarantee they will multiply since it's due to a large number of factors but it's rare for them not to multiply.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Emma at 1/28/11 8:38 AM\nHello, what is the quantity (tablespoons?) of the grains once rehydrated? Thank you!\nThe milk kefir grains rehydrate to about 2 teaspoons which is sufficient to culture up to a quart of milk every 18-48 hours. Once they begin to multiply, of course, you can culture more milk at one time.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Lynn at 2/6/11 12:31 PM\nCan kefir be made with powdered milk? If so how does this effect quality?\nWell, you could try it... There's not much information around on whether this would work, or how well. One concern is that powdered milk is highly processed, and is usually very low in fat, so it might not produce a suitably thick result. On the other hand, it does contain lactose, so it would provide sufficient food for the grains.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Nick at 2/11/11 7:12 PM\nCan heavy whipping cream be cultured with kefir grains? If so, would heavy whipping cream be sufficient to revitalize the grains when used with coconut milk?\nHeavy whipping cream might be a little too much for a decent result with milk kefir grains. The grains require lactose to survive and reproduce, and there is very little lactose in heavy cream. You could try half-and-half, or even just adding some cream to the milk.\nFor the same reason, you should use regular milk (whole milk is fine) to revive the grains periodically when you are culturing coconut milk.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Madison at 2/12/11 9:02 PM\nWill the grains \"go bad\" if not used frequently enough? Thanks!\nIt's not so much that they would go bad, but they would starve if they don't get fresh milk (for milk grains) or sugar (for water grains). If you want to take a break from making kefir, our packages include instructions for doing that. It's pretty easy.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Terri at 2/21/11 1:48 PM\nAre milk and water kefir grains the same? Or can they be used interchangeably? Of course the need for several days of adjustment?\nMilk kefir grains and water kefir grains are actually different organisms. Milk kefir grains eat lactose (present in milk) and water kefir grains eat glucose/sucrose.\nMilk kefir grains can be converted (slowly) to work with water, but they can't be converted back. Water kefir grains can't be converted.\nDo you find this question helpful?

She says her creamy goats\u2019 milk concoction\u2013served up with seasonal flavors and fruit garnishes\u2013is \u201csomething entirely new.\u201d That\u2019s because without butter or added fat, \u201ctechnically it\u2019s not ice cream,\u201d and while there is yogurt added to the mix, it\u2019s not really fro-yo either.\nInstead Victory\u2019s rich, creamy frozen concoction is inspired by dondurma, a form of Turkish goats\u2019 mik ice cream from Anatolia. It\u2019s thickened by salep, the root of a wild orchid, an ingredient Brittan uses in two of her flavors. Brittan lived for six months in Beirut, Lebanon after getting a degree from Georgetown University in comparative studies of Latin America and the Middle East. There she came to know Middle Eastern flavors and dondurma, travelling to Turkey in 2009, she says, \u201cto specifically eat Turkish dondurma from the place of its birth, Kahramanmaras.\u201d\nAs someone who tries to eat local but also loves the texture of soft-serve, Brittan craved a frozen alternative derived from \u201creal ingredients.\u201d Victory Garden\u2019s goats\u2019 milk hails from Beltane Farm in Lebanon, Connecticut, where their La Mancha and Oberhasli goats forage for hay and grass, and are raised free of hormones and antibiotics.\nBrittan relishes the \u201cearthiness\u201d of goats milk and is waiting to see whether in the fall, her ice-cream might \u201cbecome more earthy tasting and tangy\u201d due to the change in the goats\u2019 diet. Goat\u2019s milk already has more of a tang than cow\u2019s milk, but usually not what people are expecting, says Brittan: \u201cA lot of people are surprised when they come here, and it doesn\u2019t taste \u201cgoat-y\u201d or \u201coverpowering,\u201d she says. \u201cGoat\u2019s milk has a really nice natural, sweet flavor to it.\u201d\nBrittan explains that her soft-serve is also \u201clighter on the digestion\u201d than those soft-serves traditionally made from cows milk, and is also fine for the lactose intolerant.\nVictory Garden also makes flavored soft serves, most possessing a Middle Eastern and Mediterranean inflection. Her staple flavors are salted caramel, chocolate and mastic; a \u201cresin from trees, a popular ingredient in Chios, Greece,\u201d says Brittan, who procures hers from Mastiha Shop in the Lower East Side (profiled in Edible Manhattan last year).\u00a0Her namesake Victory Garden is an herb and spice blend. Refreshing and sweet, it\u2019s comprised of ten ingredients\u2013 rosemary, anise hyssop, sage, mint, oregano, thyme, jasmine, lavender, orange blossoms and cardamom. Both the mastic and Victory Garden are also thickened with salep, traditionally used in Turkey.)\nThere\u2019s also often an Ethiopian coffee made with cardamom, lemon poppy, dark chocolate rosemary and Turkish delight whipped up from Damascene rose with mastic. Brittan, who is of Mexican descent, uses chocolate made from Mexican stone ground chocolate and stocks cajeta, Mexican goats\u2019 milk caramel (goats milk simmered with sugar until it caramelizes) sourced from a Vermont farm.\nBrittan also makes homemade sour cherry or blackcurrant sauce, sourcing the fruit from the Union Square Farmers Market. There are plans for stone fruits later in the season, slow roasted grapes and quince in fall and \u201csomething apple-centric for September to November,\u201d says Brittan.\nCategories: Farms & Foodshed , Products We Love , Uncategorized\nhttp://brodskyorg.com Brodsky Organization\nSounds amazing!

And aren't we all ready for a bit of a fresh start? We are moving into the lunar month of the Milk Moon -- a thought which makes me smile because I am an unabashed lover of milk and all things dairy. But before I dive into an homage to milk, I want to let those of you in the Bay Area know that I will be teaching a cooking class at Crissy Field Center on Sunday June 1st: Everyday Cooking from the Farmers Market. The class will be from 10am to 1pm and costs $25. You can register by calling (415) 561-7752. I would love to see you there.\nThis first day of the Milk Moon also happens to be Beltane -- May Day -- the first day of Summer in the old Celtic calendar. Beltane was the day when people left their winter homes and drove their herds up onto summer pasture, so it is only fitting that it should correspond to the Milk Moon. According to tradition, the sheep would go first, followed by the cattle in order of their ages, then the goats, and finally the horses. There is nothing that pulls at my heartstrings like the image of animals on open pasture, high up in the hills.\nAs a child, my favorite book was Heidi , Johanna Spyri's lovely story of a young orphan sent to live on a mountainside in the Alps with her cranky but devoted grandfather, the \"Alm-Uncle.\" Her grandfather makes her a little three-legged stool and a bed of hay in a loft. Heidi spends her days following her friend Peter the goatherd up high into the mountains where they keep watch over the village goats whilst frolicking among the wildflowers. Each day they eat their lunch of rye bread, homemade cheese, and fresh goat's milk.\nIt is a vision that was endlessly romantic to me as a child, and I reread the book recently as an adult and was completely re-enchanted. I was also very interested to read between the lines of the story and find so much culinary healing wisdom. The story is really a paean to the healing powers of milk and of a traditional, rugged way of life.\nAlthough Heidi is happy with her grandfather, she is taken away to the city to be a companion to the disabled daughter of a wealthy urban businessman. Heidi is ever-cheerful and a good companion to Klara, but is so homesick that she begins sleepwalking. Eventually Heidi is returned home to the Alps and her grandfather. Not long afterward, when it is decided that the country air might do her good, Klara is sent to the country to visit her. She has to be carried up the mountain in her wheelchair, and lifted up into the hayloft at bedtime. The grandfather puts her on a healing regimen of milk from one of his two goats. He feeds this goat special herbs and all her milk is given to Klara -- who drinks bowl after foaming bowl of it -- raw, of course. After a number of weeks of this healing food, Klara is able to walk for the first time in her life.\nPerhaps it was my love of this story as a child that kept me always skeptical of the many accusations I heard about milk and dairy products over the years. I experimented with veganism for a while, won over briefly to the notion that dairy was, after all, a bad thing. But I hated it. Cream, yogurt, butter, cheese, and milk -- these are among my very favorite things. I was sulky without them. Soy milk always tasted chalky and fake to me, and too sweet. Rice milk was thin, like anemic milk, with unpleasant overtones. Almond milk was kind of tasty, but it tasted like almonds, not like milk. Soy 'cheezes' tasted like the rubbery imitations that they are; and I'd rather have my toast dry than spread it with margarine, which is awful. I am always amused when someone hands me one of these knock-offs and professes that it tastes 'actually pretty good.' I can never concur. I always wonder what kind of brainwashing (tastebudwashing?) it must take to make someone think that a soy cheeze tastes 'pretty good.'\nBut I can see why they have garnered a following. The conventional dairy industry is a disaster. Veganism and the yucky fake-dairy products seem preferable to miserable cows and over-processed milk. Heidi, those free goats munching on wild herbs, the healing milk -- these are things of the past, we assume, or fictional things. Things of another time and place, another planet almost... a distant memory nearly forgotten.\nBut when I was in Switzerland two years ago, I took a hike in the Alps. Climbing over a small incline, I heard the gentle ringing of bells break through the vast quiet. And then I saw them -- a herd of cows munching on grass, the large bells around their necks clanging as they chewed their cud... I was crying. I was ecstatic. I was home. But we climbed up higher, and saw a small herd of goats making their way over a crag. After a long and sometimes frightening hike along a high ridge, we descended the mountain, and ordered a drink at a little cafe. Sitting there we heard the clanging of bells again, far off, then closer. Looking up into the sunset, we saw that first herd of cows returning to the farmhouse after their day up the mountain. We sat and watched the cows come home. The cowherd and his dog followed, making sure none ran astray. The cowherd was on a motorbike, but other than that, it could have been a hundred years ago. The ranch hung a sign out that read, 'lait cru' -- 'raw milk.'\nI have never quite understood the argument against milk that asserts that because humans are the only species that drinks milk after weaning, somehow it isn't a 'natural' food. Those of you who saw the movie MicroCosmos about the fascinating world of insects may remember an amazing scene featuring ants and aphids. After the movie, I inquired about what was going on in that scene, and was informed that ants do something that could be described as 'keeping herds' of aphids, and 'milking' them. A kind of entomological ranching. But I don't see anyone pointing to ants and saying, \"well, they're the only species that milks aphids so they should stop...\" It would be ludicrous.\nThe way I look at it, humans evolved over thousands of years in relation to other species on the planet, including dairy animals, honey bees, and many others. We are not the only species who will drink milk after adulthood (my dog and countless cats are proof of that), just the only species that developed the skill and practice of keeping dairy animals and milking them.\nThen comes the argument that the ability to digest milk is a genetic mutation. But unlike other genetic mutations such as eye-color, hair-color, or skin-color, the ability to digest milk is somehow unnatural. Not far around the bend from this argument is the notion that dairy products are inextricably tied to Europeans and European history and that milk is somehow a colonial or even racist food. I'm not kidding -- I read an article that made this argument. Yes, Heidi was European and her very local and indigenous diet of milk, cheese and dark rye bread was a part of that cultural heritage. But dairy products are a part of indigenous foodways in many places around the world -- among those peoples that had access to dairy animals and a climate and landscape conducive to grazing. Yak dairy, especially butter, is a critical part of the Tibetan diet high in the Himalayas. The famed Masai warriors of Africa lived largely on raw milk and blood from their cows. Cultures in the South Asian subcontinent such as India use dairy products liberally, especially in the form of yogurt and ghee (clarified butter). Bri Maya Tiwari, who grew up in an Indian community in British Guiana, writes beautifully of the milk of her childhood:\n\"I grew up in an idyllic village not far from the sea. In the still afternoons, women gathered on their kitchen verandas and sifted through grains and dhals... The lithe ebony milkman, whose feet were always in flight, would arrive before tea and fill the milk buckets that were waiting for him on the landing below. The milk was delivered, buff-colored and foaming, within the hour of the milking. It was never preboiled. Milk was a vital and living food for as long as the ancestry could remember. The cows were gentle and happy. They grazed in the green pastures of fertile and rich land. They roamed by instinct, with their own rhythm. No one questioned why they should seek shelter from the blazing sun, or why they sat and gazed with those stupendous lotus eyes... No child ever felt threatened by the presence of the cows. They were part of the dynamism of our life. A field without grazing cows would have been inconceivable in those evanescent afternoons...\"\nfrom A Life of Balance by Maya Tiwari\nTo portray milk as an oppressive 'white man's food' is to completely misrepresent reality. The true culprits of culinary colonialism are white sugar, white flour, and 'soft drinks.' These foods have invaded and colonized the diets of people around the world. They are the foods we should be worrying about, not milk.\nThere are of course those who have trouble digesting dairy products, and others who are very allergic to them. Some people will die if they eat peanuts, and others, shellfish. I can't eat mangoes without getting violently ill. This doesn't mean that peanuts, shellfish, and mangoes are bad foods. The well-publicized problem of 'lactose intolerance' seems to me to be a combination of factors: natural patterns of allergies; the genetic evolution of certain peoples that did not have dairy in their native diet; the heavy use of chemicals and hormones in modern milk production; and the widespread pasteurization of milk, which kills bacteria but also enzymes which help us to digest lactose.\nlast month:\n"}, {"score": 1635.7059, "uuid": "b0b91246-4901-5081-8ff5-248fa8069db5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0511wb-68-32533", "target_hostname": "www.oasisadvancedwellness.com", "target_uri": "http://www.oasisadvancedwellness.com/learning/dangers-cows-milk.html", "page_rank": 1.1730564e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "The Dangers of Cow\u2019s <em>Milk</em>", "snippet": "In organic <em>milk</em> there are fewer antibiotic residues, no added hormones, and <em>cows</em> are given <em>better</em> feeds.

There is really no reason for a child to drink cow\u2019s milk and, in fact, children who do not drink milk seem to be healthier and experience less doctor\u2019s visits.\nThe Dangers of Cow's Milk\nLinda Folden Palmer, D.C.\nToday, many of the problems parents have with their babies are linked to new parenting and feeding techniques that have been implemented during the recent century. Colic, for instance, is far more common in the U.S. than in many other places around the world. Two chief causes for its rise are the stress suffered by babies being regularly separated from their mothers, and the common difficulties babies have tolerating the large cow's milk proteins in infant formulas and breastfeeding mothers' diets. Cow's milk is a foreign substance that has pervaded every corner of our diets\u2014starting with artificial infant feeds, but finding its way into mother's breastmilk through the foods she eats as well. As it turns out, health problems such as childhood diabetes, obesity, bowel disease, osteoporosis, heart disease, cataracts, colic, ear infections, hyperactivity, and cancer, on the rise in both children and adults, are strongly linked to infant feeding choices.\nWhile there are literally thousands of research studies, each revealing at least one of milk's hazards, the dairy industry goes to great lengths to stifle any damaging rumors. Blanket statements, such as, \"There is simply no scientific research to back up these claims,\" are easily made. With a long and successful history of dairy promotion, these are readily accepted by the public. More people need to go to the real research and learn the truth for themselves. They should be very suspicious of these foreign foods being pushed on their children. They should question motives as well as possible outcomes. Although some of the dangers of cow's milk consumption relate more to adults than to children, parents' actions form the basis for lifelong dairy-consuming habits in their children.\nThe harmful components of cow's milk include all the major parts of it, as well as some more minor elements. Lactose is a sugar meant for babies, but it's generally harmful to adults. The proteins in cow's milk are different from human milk proteins and cause problems of digestion, intolerance, impaired absorption of other nutrients, and autoimmune reactions. Few of the proteins meant for baby cows are found naturally in human mother's milk, and none are found in any natural adult human food. Even the high protein content in cow's milk creates problems. Human babies need the saturated fats and cholesterol in mother's milk. Bovine milk fat is not appropriately composed for human babies and is only deleterious to the health of children and adults. Cow hormones are not meant for humans, and older children and adults are not meant to consume hormones. And, cows have been selectively bred over time to create high levels of these hormones\u2014those being the cows that grow the fastest and produce the greatest amount of milk. Cows also concentrate pesticides and pollutants into their milk fat, from their high dietary food and water requirements. The high amount of drugs now given to cows adds to this chemical soup. But we need milk to build strong bones, don't we? Actually, heavy milk consumption leads to increased osteoporosis.\nDeflating Dairy\nThe highly promoted idea that milk builds strong bones refers to the prevention of osteoporosis\u2014this is the reason for strengthening bones. Decades of effort to demonstrate that high calcium diets chiefly derived from dairy products build strong bones have failed to prove any such correlation. In fact, the opposite seems to be true(1). It appears that high calcium intake before puberty, and especially in young childhood, may have some slight positive effect on bones, but this diet is not the answer. A balanced intake of all the bone minerals, along with adequate vitamin A, C, and D, is what is truly needed. A balanced intake of minerals cannot occur when the diet emphasizes dairy. Dairy's high calcium causes relative deficiencies in magnesium and other bone-building minerals, and its high phosphorus and animal protein reduces calcium availability. Physical activity has the greatest benefit\u2014the body efficiently uses what is available to build strong bones when it senses the need. Human milk and vegetable sources are superior to dairy for calcium and other nutrients in many ways. There are fewer nutritional or other health advantages to giving cow's milk to children than is generally believed, while there are certainly many risks.\nAlmost every day another health research finding is made about whole grains, soy, a serving of vegetables, two fruits per day, cashews, legumes, fish, or some other food, other than milk that is, and their connection to a reduced risk of heart disease, breast cancer, stroke, diabetes, or other disease. This is because cow's milk and its derivatives today make up one-third of the adult diet, and half to two-thirds of caloric intake in children, thus replacing so much other important, nutritious food needed in the diet. This leads to insufficient intake of important vitamins, several minerals, and healthy fiber and vegetable oils. Cancer-preventing antioxidants in foods are missing in this milk diet as well. While one form of antioxidant vitamin A is added to milk (but not all dairy products), it is likely counteracted by the pesticide and drug residues. The full complement of vitamin A and associated enzymes, found in vegetables and other foods, are required for cancer prevention. Many, many more kinds of antioxidants are found in vegetables, legumes, fruits, and grains.\nNo other animal in the animal kingdom drinks milk beyond childhood. No other animal suffers from osteoporosis, except the occasional pet raised on human meals.\nIf there remains a desire to provide milk to a child who has no diarrhea, rashes, or other intolerance reactions, organic (organic\u2014not raw) non-fat milk would be the best choice. In raw (unpasteurized) milk there can be many potentially dangerous microorganisms, in addition to the leukemia virus. In organic milk there are fewer antibiotic residues, no added hormones, and cows are given better feeds. Non-fat means less chemical residue and no artery-damaging saturated fat. Children can obtain fat in the form of non-hydrogenated (especially monosaturated) vegetable oils, be it in potato chips or cashews. Goat's milk is considered by many to be superior in many ways, and today low-fat versions are available. Much less documented information is available about goat's milk, but it appears that the proteins are less problematic for digestion, although allergic intolerance to these can also occur. Lactose and hormones would remain an issue although, to date, goats apparently are not injected with extra growth hormone.\nAlthough it was apparent from day one that formula was a health risk for infants, back when it was first promoted, cow's milk for older children appeared to be a nutritional manna. And with one or two glasses a day from a healthy, range-fed animal, it likely nearly was. Since this time, however, the quality of dairy has drastically reduced while its consumption has exploded... with a little advertising help. The evidence suggesting that the early faith in milk was misplaced has been building up for decades. The dairy industry has had to take increasingly extreme efforts to keep this information out of public awareness.\nI have only touched on the tip of the existing evidence against the health claims of the milk industry promoters. Since our childhood, the dairy industry has worked hard to have dairy products enshrined in a food group of their own. Even though they were given their own space in the new Eating Right food pyramid, they found themselves placed in a small upper portion and have lobbied to have the pyramid withdrawn.2 Many nutrition experts such as Harvard's Dr. Walter Willett3 suggest they should not be a featured group in the pyramid at all. The dairy industry has also successfully convinced many vegetarians that milk from cows, especially cheese, is a vegetarian food. Since few substantiated health claims can be made anymore, the milk industry's most recent promotion has been to simply show their product on the upper lip of celebrities of all kinds, even those who are dairy-allergic (Bill Clinton), and even on those who are too young to be consuming whole milk (the Rugrats). Before this promo, it was simply \"Got milk?\" While an ever-growing preponderance of scientific information points to the dangers of cow's milk, favorable public and even mainstream medical opinion about dairy products has been very successfully maintained.\nKnowing and avoiding the potentially harmful effects that high dairy consumption and milk-sensitivity reactions can have on your child is just as important and loving as nursing, close bonding, and informed health care decisions. What we feed our children matters; how we parent them matters. These measures will lead to the best health, comfort and happiness available to a child. Parents have the power to create and enjoy healthier, happier children with brighter futures.\nReferences\n1 L. H.

In the 1970s, Australian dairy herds switched from using Jersey cows to Holsteins and at that time some dairy farmers\u2019 families noticed effects on their health, keeping a Jersey cow for their own use.\nA2 is also the brand name of milk containing predominantly A2 beta casein protein (see www.a2australia.com.au ).\nWhat are the health benefits of A2 milk?\nMilks containing mostly A2 proteins are often said to be better for \u2018allergies\u2019 (such as gut, skin rashes, hayfever, cough). There is also research to suggest that A1 beta casein may be associated with serious health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes type 1 and autism.\nFrom the Food Intolerance Network point of view, we are interested in the reports from our members who have noticed improvements by switching to A2 milk \u2013 and I am one of them (for allergic rhinitis).\nFor long term heart health, a number of men who have read the book Devil in the Milk \u2013 including my husband \u2013 won\u2019t touch A1 milk again.\nFamilies seem to find the switch to A2 milk the easiest of all dietary changes to make. It seems to work best for people with physical symptoms \u2013 such as gut, rashes, ear infections \u2013 than behaviour, although some children with behavioural conditions do improve on A2 milk. However, they may do even better on soymilk or ricemilk and some children who are affected by A1 milk are affected as badly by A2 so you need to do a challenge.\nReader reports\n[929] Irritable bowel symptoms transformed by A2 milk (July 2010)\nFor the past 18+ months my wife has suffered from an increasing problem with gut issues and chronic diarrhea and related symptoms. She has tried various milks and milk substitutes (soy, etc). None have made any difference to her gut problems. Her GP has not found any specific cause and has recommended a range of tests and indicated it was probably \"irritable bowel syndrome\" which I'm sure you know is one of the catch-all medical labels which basically means \"we don't really know\".\nOn pure chance my wife (who had seen your report a couple of years ago on A2) decided about 6 weeks ago she had nothing to lose by trying A2 milk .\nOur life has been transformed and this happened literally overnight! Gut patterns are back to normal, a far far cry from many daily urgent dashes to the loo, usually immediately after eating or drinking almost anything but particularly things containing dairy products. Literally life became normal within 4 hours of her first bowl of oatmeal with A2 milk. Absolutely amazing.\nThe transformation has been astounding and we are very grateful to the people that have figured out the A2 story - Russell by email.\n[928] Dairy free but now happy on a2 yoghurt (July 2010)\nWe were very excited to try A2 yogurt - our 6yo daughter developed stomach pains last year which we finally attributed to dairy, and were very pleased that she responded really well to A2. Our baby son was also super-sensitive to cow's milk, while breastfeeding I had to be on a strict dairy-free diet or he'd be in terrible pain. He's now 18 months and the Jalna A2 yoghurt is his favourite food - no tummy pain at all! We've had to be careful not to overdo it - forgot that it was moderate amines - and he can only have the natural because of the salicylate content in the flavoured ones, but he has it either plain or with maple syrup, and thinks it's the best food ever. - Megan, by email\n[927] Brief reports on A2 milk and rhinitis, autism and weight gain (March 2009)\nMy allergic rhinitis (stuffy and runny nose, chronic cough, congestion, hayfever during pollen season) appears to be entirely related to A1 but not A2 milk. For the last two years I have enjoyed unlimited A2 milk after 12 years on soymilk.\nA failsafe-friendly dietitian reports the use of A2 milk during an elimination diet for a boy with autistic type behaviour: \u2018I placed him on a milk-free elimination diet, but allowed A2 milk. He consumed several cups of this per day whilst on the diet. His behaviour, concentration and sense of humour all improved. However, when we challenged with normal milk, concentration etc deteriorated. So it is back to the A2 milk whilst we go through other challenges.'\nThe dietitian asked my skinny 7 year old son \u2013 who tested negative for coeliac disease - to go gluten free and he felt better but lost a lot of weight. Then three months ago we switched to A2 milk and now he is doing really well. He has even been able to go back on gluten.\n[622] Amazing change in my child due to A2 milk (February 2008)\nMy 10 yr-old disabled daughter was on neocate advance which she didn't tolerate and I was told she was past the hospital\u2019s expertise so they didn't know what to do with her. She was getting sick, looked shocking and her behaviour was very hard to manage (especially as mentally she is about two-year-old) so I gave her ricemilk instead of neocate advance. After four days I realized she wasn't tolerating ricemilk. So in desperation I tried A2 milk after seeing what it did for a friend\u2019s son - his behaviour improved dramatically, he stopped screaming, his ear infections stopped and he started to talk.\nMy daughter has been on A2 milk for a week now (due to underweight issues she is tube fed over a litre a day) and she looks heaps healthier. Since commencing A2 milk the diarrhoea has stopped and nappies are becoming more solid, no vomiting, rashes are gone, wheezing gone and she is wanting her tube feeds - and more - plus solids, usually we have big problems getting her to eat orally. In a week she has gone from 18.2 to 19.4kg (400g being in the last 2 days) that's the best weight gain she has ever had. Her behaviour is wonderful. She is so calm and she has started to talk (she was non verbal before). She even sat with her baby sister for an hour and actually played with the baby\u2019s toy with her. That's amazing as usually she hasn't got a very good concentration span - one minute if you\u2019re lucky is all I've managed out of her - and she doesn't play, never has done - so her changes are amazing and very strange as she doesn't tolerate cows milk.\n[358] Cranky and irritable (December 2004)\nWe've switched to the A2 milk as both the boys had to have soy formula milk when they were little. I noticed the difference in Ryan when we didn't bother to get it one week - Ryan was cranky and irritable and both boys woke up with phlegm on the chest.\nSee testimonials on the A2 website www.a2australia.com.au\nAre there any medical reports?\nIn Australia and NZ, A2 milk is too new to have been used in studies, but there is a medical report of allergies managed by camel milk, which also contains a2 beta casein protein.\nIn this study, eight children with severe food (mainly milk) allergies recovered fully from their allergies by drinking camel milk. Medical researchers at the Ben-Gurion University in Beer Sheva Israel reported that the children aged 4 months to 10 years suffered from symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting after eating, skin rashes, asthma, lactase deficiency and \u2018chemical imbalance\u2019 that did not respond to conventional treatments. The 4 months old child had been taken home from hospital because of lack of improvement and constant diarrhoea. A girl from the US was anaphylactic to cows milk and extremely allergic to all but a few foods. Families were supplied with bottles of frozen unpasteurised camel milk to be thawed as needed and instructed not to heat the milk which would destroy the immunoglobulins and protective proteins. The milk replaced all other foods for 2 weeks, after which other food was gradually added to the diet as chosen by parents. All children showed improvement with 24 hours of starting to drink the milk and all symptoms disappeared with in 4 days. No recurrence of the allergic symptoms was reported within 30 days. The 4 month old later suffered a severe ear infection which improved on reintroduction of camel milk. The child from the US returned home after two weeks and was able to eat foods to which she had previously been allergic. The researchers suggested that the rapid improvement in the children\u2019s health and later ability to digest other foods may be due to both the lack of the allergenic beta-lactoglobulin and particular beta-casein protein found in cows milk combined with protective proteins found in camel milk.\nReference: Shabo Y et al, Camel milk for food allergies in children, Isr Med Assoc J. 2005;7(12):796-8, http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar05dec-12.pdf\nSee more from medical journals under More Information below.\nWhy doesn\u2019t my doctor know about this?\nIn New Zealand, where the laboratory test for A2 beta casein protein was discovered, doctors do know about this. An editorial in the journal of the NZ Medical Association commented that it would be reasonably straightforward to change New Zealand dairy herds to produce only A2 milk if that was necessary. \u2018The intervention would require no change in behaviour by New Zealanders and could be implemented with little personal difficulty for substantial health gain', the author concluded.\nHowever, as with any topic where money is involved, there is a lot of controversy created by people with vested interests. Dairy industries in New Zealand and Australia do not want to change to A2 milk because they don\u2019t want to admit that the product they sell now - ordinary milk- may be associated with health problems.\nIs A2 milk diluted with permeate?\nNo, unlike many regular milks, A2 is not diluted with permeate which is a by-product of milk processing. See http://www.a2australia.com.au/ . That\u2019s probably partly why it costs more \u2013 but we figure it is worth the extra.\nWhere can I buy A2 milk - in Australia, UK, USA?\nIn Australia, see www.a2australia.com.au for stockists\nIn the USA, see Hy-Vee grocery stores in the Midwest, www.hy-vee.com\nIn the UK, for milk containing A2 beta casein protein, see buffalo milk www.buffalomilk.co.uk\nWhere can I buy A2 yoghurt?\nA2 yoghurt is now available in stores as Jalna a2 yoghurt, mostly in Coles Supermarkets. According to RPAH guidelines, the natural flavour is the most suitable for failsafers - although yoghurts are now not recommended on the strict elimination diet (due to moderate amines), but can be incorporated into your diet after challenges if you can tolerate them, see [928] Reader Report above. The vanilla and fruit flavoured options are not failsafe due to salicylates (as the vanilla flavour contains fruit juice).\nYou can make your own yoghurt using A2 milk (you will need to use more starter than usual and take a longer setting time than usual).\nOr you can buy sheep milk yoghurt, see www.meredithdairy.com for stockists. Pure sheep milk yoghurt - Meredith Dairy Yoghurt is made from ewe\u2019s milk. Sheep milk yoghurt offers a healthy alternative to people with an aversion to cows milk.\nGREEN LABEL & LID \u2013 is made using Lacto Bacillus Acidophilus & Bifidus (Probiotic).\nBLUE LABEL & LID \u2013 is made using Greek Lacto Bacillus Thermopilus & Bulgaris\nMore information\nFor a scientific, balanced and readable account of the politics preventing A2 milk from becoming mainstream, I strongly recommend the book Devil in the Milk by Professor Keith Woodford.

There have been 6 comments\nPrint\nWhy Milk from Certain Breeds of Cattle Is Toxic\nIn 2007, Dr. Keith Woodford wrote a book called Devil in the Milk. In this text, he explains exactly why milk from certain cows is far more toxic in the body than milk from ancient breeds of cattle.\nDr. Woodford is a Professor of Farm Management and Agribusiness at Lincoln University in New Zealand. In his book, he discusses the dangers of certain forms of casein in milk versus others. As you may expect, because dairy is such a large industry worldwide, Dr. Woodford has received a great deal of grief and badgering through the press for voicing his concerns about what he calls the \u201cmilk devil.\u201d\nHowever, as he says in the introduction to his book: \u201cI have now got to a stage in life where some things are more important than others. I believe [this] story is one that needs to be told.\u201d (1)\nDr. Thomas Cowan, an M.D. practicing in San Francisco, California, wrote the forward to Devil in the Milk. He tells us that milk, or casein sensitivity, has been a long-time issue with his own patients, which is usually accompanied by gut disorders. As he explains:\nA certain protein called beta-casein is found in the milk solids.\nBeta-casein is a long chain of amino acids - 229 to be exact.\nTypically in ancient breeds of cattle, an amino acid called proline is number 67 in this long chain of amino acids.\nThis protein found in ancient breeds of cattle is called beta-casein A2.\n5,000 years ago, a mutation happened in this long chain of amino acids.\nWhen the mutation occurred, an amino acid called histidine replaced proline.\nThis new protein is called beta-casein A1.\nWhat makes beta-casein A1 milk so different and so dangerous?\nAccording to Dr. Woodford\u2019s research, once the mutation in beta-casein occurred, the new beta-casein A1 breed of cattle spread rapidly throughout Western countries. And unfortunately, this form of casein has been linked with type I diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, autism, and schizophrenia. Throughout his argument in Devil in the Milk, Dr. Woodford cites over 100 papers found in peer-reviewed journals.\nAs he explains, beta-casein A1 is different from the more ancient version of beta-casein because of the proline /histidine switch that took place 5,000 years ago.\nIn both beta-casein A1 and A2, there is a side chain amino acid that comes off amino acid 67.\nThis side chain amino acid is called BCM7.\nBCM7 is a powerful opiate and responsible for much of the grief related to current milk consumption in the United States.\nThis includes various forms of casein sensitivity related to autism and autoimmune conditions.\nThis also includes minor irritations, such as BCM7\u2019s ability to bind to mucous membranes in the nose and stimulate mucous secretions.\nBCM7 is less likely to be absorbed by those with a healthy gut.\nIs milk really the enemy? If milk has been making you sick, it could be because of the type of milk you are drinking.\nEven though BCM7, which is an amino acid opiate, is present in both forms of beta-casein A1 and beta-casein A2, the older breeds of cattle have a stronger hold on this dangerous little amino acid. This means that in older breeds of cattle that have the beta-casein A2 structure, the opiate is far less likely to become free in the body.\nBeta-casein A1, which is found in cattle populating nearly all dairy farms in the United States, has a weak bond to this dangerous opiate called BCM7. Biochemically, histidine simply cannot hold on to BCM7 for very long. What ends up happening? Much of BCM7 gets into our bloodstream, especially in those who have a permeable or \u201cleaky\u201d gut. The absorption of BCM7 causes all sorts of changes in the immune system, the blood vessels, and in the brain.\nAmasi: A Traditional Drink Made with Milk That Is Free from Beta-Casein A1\nAmasi is a food and beverage that is popular in South Africa. Similar to yogurt and kefir, amasi is fermented and generally made with cow or zebu milk. Traditionally, fermentation usually takes place in a gourd or hide sack, although leaving raw milk out to ferment, or clabber, will also produce amasi.\nThe milk used to make amasi is generally harvested from zebu cattle, also known as Bos indicus. All ancient breeds of cattle, such as the zebu cattle, produce milk that is free of beta-casein A1.\nZebu cattle:\nAre common throughout Africa, India, and throughout much of Asia.\nHave large, floppy ears and a fatty hump between their shoulders. For this reason, they\u2019re also called \u201chumped\u201d cattle.\nAre ancient cattle - which means that the milk they produce is free of beta-casein A1.\nLike other forms of fermented dairy, amasi has a number of health benefits. When zebu cattle are fed a green diet of grasses and forage, the milk that they produce is high in:\nOmega-3 fatty acids\n"}, {"score": 1629.6919, "uuid": "46fb1e98-56ee-5314-bd8f-c1dc9969c699", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000tw-54-16559", "target_hostname": "www.straight.com", "target_uri": "http://www.straight.com/article-323104/vancouver/joanne-chang-mothers-day-story-about-milk-cows-and-veal-calves", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Joanne Chang: A Mother&#x27;s Day story about <em>milk</em> <em>cows</em> and veal calves | Vancouver", "snippet": "It&#x27;s important to note that any kind of <em>milk</em> <em>is</em> produced through this same method. <em>Goats</em> have their babies taken away for <em>goats</em> <em>milk</em> as well.

We believe that humans are somehow required to drink cow\u2019s milk in order to have good health. Or that dairy cows lactate uncontrollably so it is up to the heroic humans to keep their udders from exploding. We hold these ridiculous beliefs to be truths because if cows truly only produced milk to feed their babies, then where are all the calves?\nTo answer that question, let me tell you the true story of Mario.\nMario was born on a dairy farm. On the day of his birth, he was taken away from his mother. She cried and searched anxiously for days after losing him. She carried him for nine months, but only got to meet him for a brief moment.\nMario was a male calf born to a dairy cow. He was never to see his mother again.\nThe day after he was born, Mario ended up at a livestock auction to be sold for veal. His umbilical cord was still attached to his soft baby belly.\nHad Mario been a perfect little calf, he would have sold to a veal farmer at the auction\u2014and then either slaughtered that very same day to make \u201cbob veal\u201d, or chained up to a tiny stall, deprived of movement for six months and then slaughtered to make \u201cfancy\u201d or \u201cwhite veal\u201d. The veal industry is simply a by-product of the dairy industry, consisting entirely of unwanted male calves like Mario.\nBorn with a leg injury, Mario was far from the perfect little calf. No one wanted to buy a \u201cdefective product\u201d, and so Mario failed to fetch a single dollar at the auction. A male dairy calf whose flesh can\u2019t be sold is as good as garbage. As the auction came to an end, Mario was tossed on top of a pile of dead animals. He stood on top of the corpses, waiting for his own death, just one day after his birth.\nDespite a cruel beginning, Mario\u2019s life was turned around by the kindness of one compassionate person. The truck driver who came to pick up the corpses couldn\u2019t find it in himself to throw away this little calf. Instead, he found Farm Sanctuary in California and took Mario there.\nWhen Mario was released to join the herd of cows at the sanctuary, he was immediately adopted by Dawn, the matriarch of the herd. She was a rescued beef cow who probably never had a calf of her own. But her maternal instinct was so strong that she adopted every calf that came to the sanctuary as if they were her own. Some afternoons, Dawn and Mario would be seen spooning under a tree. The two stayed close together until Mario was old enough to roam on his own.\nAs for Mario\u2019s birth mother, she was probably re-impregnated by the dairy farmer through artificial insemination two months after she lost Mario. Dairy cows must be kept constantly pregnant in order to lactate. After four years of forced pregnancy and constant milking, dairy cows are considered \u201cspent\u201d and are sent to slaughter.\nDespite common beliefs, cows, like all mammals, do not lactate spontaneously. They only produce milk to feed their babies and not humans. This biological fact does not change whether the dairy comes from a conventional, family, organic, or free-range farm. There is no such thing as a cruelty-free dairy as the cruelty is inherent. No farming method changes the fact that in order to produce milk for human consumption, cows must be impregnated and their babies must be taken away and killed. And no boycott of veal is truly genuine unless dairy is also boycotted.\nThis Mother\u2019s Day, I\u2019d like to challenge every compassionate person to take a pledge to go dairy-free in honour of loving mothers like Dawn and the millions of nameless dairy cows like Mario\u2019s birth mother.\nJoanne Chang is a director of Liberation B.C. , a Vancouver-based animal-rights organization.\n"}, {"score": 1626.9426, "uuid": "b5c02cd4-5148-597c-9b24-86d5b109de6b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1606wb-31-16414", "target_hostname": "slowfood.com", "target_uri": "http://slowfood.com/rawmilk/eng/13/food-and-places", "page_rank": 1.2253962e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Food and Places - The Diversity of <em>Milk</em> | Raw <em>Milk</em> - From cheese the event", "snippet": "A historic cheese, Roccaverano Robiola, <em>is</em> produced here.

Milks and cheeses are the product of the animal that produces them and human intervention, but most of all they are the product of a place, influenced by its climate, vegetation, geology and other factors.\nMilk from places where the grass grows wild, the flora is rich and diversified and the animals are free to graze whatever they like will inevitably be better milk. In their natural habitat, animals will naturally eat the plants they need to stay healthy. The aromatic compounds in wild plants are fat soluble and can be transmitted to the milk through fats, and from there to the cheeses. Only whole raw milk, milked and processed directly in those places, can give cheeses these fragrances. To return to wine terminology, the beauty is that each place has its own bouquet.\nThe use of wild plants to feed livestock is an ancient practice. Fodder plants grow primarily in three environments:\nA meadow where the crop stays in the ground for more than a year, and is mown to feed livestock.\nA field in which the fodder crop is short-lived, usually just one year, and is alternated with other crops. As with the meadow, the fodder is mown before being fed to the livestock. The most common plants are grasses, legumes and crucifers.\nA pasture, grassland used almost exclusively for farming and herding livestock. The fodder is not mown, but is grazed directly by the animals. Mountain pastures are of particularly interest for cheesemaking.\nFodder plants can be given to the livestock fresh or dried to become hay. They can also be turned into silage and stored year-round. Making silage involves acidifying the plant mass to prevent deterioration, and is carried out in an airtight environment. Cereal plants can also be dried, becoming hay used for barn feeding during periods when the herds are far from pastures. They can also be silaged, which extends their storage life but affects the milk's sensory qualities.\nIt is clear that each animal has its own preferred habitat in which it produces the best milk. Goats usually eat the green parts of shrubs and adapt well to both the arid lands of the Mediterranean and Alpine pastures. Sheep and cows prefer lush green land full of grasses, herbs and flowers and their varied scents and flavors.\nHere are some examples of grazing terroirs whose unique nature contributes to the distinctiveness of cheeses made there.\nThe Proven\u00e7al Garrigue and Rove Goats\nGarrigue is a type of vegetation, and along with maquis it represents the main vegetation present around the Mediterranean. Garrigue flourishes in steep, rocky, arid land and is made up of scattered shrubs, aromatic and spiny with down-covered leaves. Garrigue is more varied than maquis because the scattered shrubs leave plenty of space for other herbaceous species, both perennials and annuals.\nTypical garrigue plants include heather, thyme, savory, lavender, Helichrysum, Cistus, Greek spiny spurge, juniper, rosemary and Aphyllanthes. The plants that dominate give their name to the type of garrigue. The environment is highly suited to raising goats, who graze on the shrubs and keep the vegetation (and potential wildfires) under control.\nGarrigue typically covers the landscape in many parts of southern France (Provence and Languedoc-Roussillon), including the environments where Rove goats graze. A breed originally from Mesopotamia, its milk is used to make Brousse du Rove cheese. The landscape is also home to the goats used to make another famous cheese, P\u00e9lardon. The goats eat mostly hardy plants: broom and its sweet flowers, Kermes oak and other types of oak, which give the Brousse and P\u00e9lardon cheeses a unique and highly recognizable flavor.\nThe changing seasons bring changes to the flora available to the animals, who follow the seasonal cycle and feed on the foods necessary to keep them healthy. The seasonally changing diet also has an influence on the cheeses.\nRead more about the Rove Brousse Presidium and the P\u00e9lardon Affin\u00e9 Presidium\nThe Roccaverano Robiola Pastures\nHerbaceous, shrubby and arboreal species live alongside each other in high-altitude pastures. The range of herbaceous plants comes from a number of different botanical families: grasses, legumes, umbellifers, etc. From a chemical perspective, the legumes are the most important in terms of nutrition and the characteristics they give the milk. Aromatic herbs like thyme, sage and wild mint are present in limited quantities but make a significant contribution to the sensory profile of the milk and resulting cheeses.\nIn addition to the herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees also grow in the high-altitude pastures, becoming an invaluable resources during periods of drought or intense cold.\nThe hills around Asti, in the northwestern Italian region of Piedmont, are of particular interest. A historic cheese, Roccaverano Robiola, is produced here. The cheese must be at least 50 percent goat's milk, while the remaining 50 percent can come from cows, sheep or goats. The native goat breed, the Roccaverano, has been somewhat replaced by other international breeds, but continues to be raised by a few local herders.\nA study carried out in the Robiola production area showed the existence of five crus, five zones within the same geographic area differentiated by specific characteristics of terrain and vegetation. The landscape is made up mainly of varying combinations of sessile oak, Turkey oak and locust woodland and grasslands of different levels of stability and aridity. The study showed a strong correlation between Robiolas from the five different areas and the different botanical species present in those areas.\nRead more about the Roccaverano Robiola Presidium\nTexel Island: A Unique Interweaving of Landscapes\nTexel is an island with an unusual ecology, located in the Dutch Weddenzee. It is made up mostly of dunes which are covered or uncovered depending on the tides. Over time, the land above sea level has become covered in vegetation, creating dunes that alternate with depressions, heaths, water meadows and grassland. The flora is still quite unspoilt, and includes grasses, legumes, bulbs and other plants. The plants flourish because of the mild climate and the nearby sea. The heath, in particular, can be formed by over 800 species of plants, including heather, rhododendrons and wild blueberries, which decompose to form hummus and nutrients. The soil is wet, acidic and permeable.\nThe main animals farmed on the island are Texel sheep. This native breed has lean, muscular meat, a characteristic that has made it popular around the world from Canada to New Zealand. This has overshadowed its milk potential and the island's cheesemaking traditions. A Presidium was established to protect the use of the breed's milk and Texelse Schapenkaas, a traditional, artisanal sheep's milk cheese with hints of the sea, fragrant with the scents of the varied vegetation.\nRead more about the Texel Sheep Cheese Presidium\nSlow Food - P.IVA 91008360041 - All rights reserved\n"}, {"score": 1624.5863, "uuid": "0afc7a59-2189-5e9e-8735-ef34b0e08c68", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1302wb-51-28228", "target_hostname": "www.antoniotahhan.com", "target_uri": "http://www.antoniotahhan.com/tag/milk/", "page_rank": 1.4512229e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Tony Tahhan \u00bb <em>milk</em>", "snippet": "On my recent trip to Aleppo I was reminded how important yogurt <em>is</em> in Middle Eastern cuisine. <em>Cow</em>, <em>goat</em> <em>or</em> sheep.

Spider-less silk is also one of the nature\u0092s most sought-after materials. And, now researchers from Nexia Biotechnologies in Montreal seem to be on the verge of manufacturing it in large quantities, and by a most surprising method \u0096 in the milk of transgenic goats.\nTransgenic animals are the results of special biological engineering processes in the course of which extra genes from other animals \u0096 often entirely different species \u0096 are inserted into their genome. Researchers have been fiddling about with the DNA of different creatures for years. Scientist have inserted into rhesus monkeys and rabbits the gene that makes jellyfish glow in the dark, they've produced chickens that never grow feathers, they\u0092ve made salmon grow up to six times larger than normal, they\u0092ve altered cow and goat milk many times in order to obtain the desired composition, and have accomplished many other similar far-fetched feats. But only recently have they begun to develop large-scale industrial plans for these creatures. And the production of spider silk from goat milk is the best example of a certain plan to industrially produce an exceptional, but very useful thing by means of biotechnology.\nAs a matter of fact, Nexia's project is less about altering nature than harnessing it. And, if it does succeed \u0096 which seems very probable \u0096 the product, called \"BioSteel\" may soon be used for a variety of applications, from medical sutures to bulletproof vests to space stations. The process may also mark an outstanding stride toward the production of other biomaterials, and the commencement of a new kind of technical and industrial revolution \u0096 one based on the use of organic processes instead of minerals.\nSpider web silk has an average tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch and is both stronger and lighter than compounds based on steel or petrochemicals. The exceptional properties of spider silk have long been recognized. Experienced old fishermen in India have always appreciated its outstanding quality that has had a particular value in the production of fishing nets. American Civil War soldiers frequently used spider web as surgical dressing. The eternal problem, however, has been its dearth, from which stems the great interest of being able to produce it in sufficient quantities, perhaps the way the ancient Chinese learned to \u0093harvest\u0094 silk from silkworms.\nHowever, the grand plan to collect spider silk has one small hitch \u0096 whereas silkworms are tame herbivores, content with dwelling in close quarters and munching mulberry leaves, thus being submissive subjects of animal husbandry, spiders are aggressive territorial predators that need plenty of space and resist socialization. They always vehemently attack and eat each other if placed in contact or in close proximity. Thus, if you put a bunch of them together, soon you\u0092ll probably end up with only one big, fat, happy spider. And that is the very reason why all attempts to domesticate spiders have failed miserably. However, farming amiable goats is a cinch.\nBiotechnology researchers have tried producing spider silk the way they produce medically useful proteins such as human insulin. This involves inserting the gene for the desired material into bacteria, which consequently synthesize the desired proteins in their normal vital course at a fairly good rate. But that produced only a gooey substance with little similarity to the natural product, and no commercial value.\nNow, researchers at the Quebec-based Nexia along with scientists at the U.S. Army's Soldier Biological Chemical Command (SBCCOM) in Natick, MA, say they may have figured a way out of the sticky situation. The actual solution consists of inserting the spider genes that code silk structure into the DNA of milk animals. Although there is no general anatomical similarity between spiders and goats or cows, and combining their genomes seems patently outlandish, there is, in fact, an absolutely logical scientific background. The pivotal point is the fact that, unlike the case in the \u0093Spiderman\u0094 movie, no fictional and spine-chilling mutations are going to take place \u0096 the genes taken from spiders will only express themselves in the mammary glands of these animals. And this is more than logical, as there are very close anatomical similarities between the silk-producing glands of spiders and the milk-producing glands of ruminant animals. It\u0092s just that, when evolution figures out a way of doing something, it often does that with slight variations in many different species. Thus, actually, female mammals are nature's protein factories, inasmuch as milk production is basically protein synthesis. And that is why the goats represent a promising new avenue in the controversial field of transgenic bioengineering.\nThe scientists' first efforts in the laboratory involved splicing the spider-silk gene into cells taken from the mammary glands of large animals. The silk genes worked with amazing efficiency in the mammary cells, and Nexia scientists were soon producing high-quality spider silk through cell culture. They then produced a line of transgenic mice to see how it would work in living animals.\nThat experiment also succeeded. The next step was to get the gene into some full-size milk-producing animals. They selected a type of African goat known for its ability to begin reproducing and lactating at an early age (as early as three months after birth). All the transgenic goats are supposed to join a special menagerie of genetically engineered animals, many of which produce proteins in their milk.\nThe entire procedure seems rather simple, though all the work needs painstaking attention. The spiders are frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then ground into a brown powder. Since every cell of a spider contains the precious silk-producing genes, it's easy to extract them. These genes are then tested in the \u0093Charlotte machine\u0094, what scientists call a \u0093synthetic goat\u0094 that tests whether or not the gene will function inside an actual goat. Next, the gene is altered. A \u0093genetic switch\u0094 is added, which programs the gene to \u0093turn on\u0094 only inside the mammary gland of its new female host during lactation. The altered gene is then pushed on a fine glass pipette into a goat egg. The baby goat will have a spider gene present in each of its cells (its eyes, ears and hooves will all be part spider), but only in the mammary glands of female goats will the silk gene actually spring to life. The goat will eventually start lactating a kind of silk-milk mixture, which looks and tastes just like normal milk. This milk is first skimmed of fat, and salt is added to make the silk proteins curdle into thin whitish particles that promptly sink to the bottom. After the residue has been removed from the milk, a little water is added to this sediment until it turns into a golden-tinged syrup. This silk concentrate is known to scientists as \u0093spin dope\u0094 and is more or less identical to what is inside a spider's belly. Now completely stripped from its milky context, the syrupy raw silk is ready for spinning.\nThe next challenge comprises the procedure of pure silk protein extraction from the milk and its spinning into fabric by processes roughly comparable to the way artificial fabrics are manufactured from petrochemical solutions.\nThe spin dope is extruded through a tiny aperture at the end of a device that looks like a syringe and into another solution of methanol, prompting the proteins to align and form crystals spontaneously, assembling into fibers that are lighter, yet tougher than Kevlar, and nearly as elastic as nylon. By playing with the production conditions, or adding a second spider protein, they hope to achieve the flex of natural silk.\nNaturally occurring spider silk is widely recognized as the strongest, toughest fiber known to man. It is a science wonder, a self-assembling, biodegradable, high-performance, nanofiber structure one-tenth the width of a human hair that can stop a bee traveling at 20 miles per hour without breaking. Spider silk has long been admired by material scientists for its unique combination of toughness, lightness and biodegradability. Dragline silk, which comprises the radiating spokes and serves for anchoring the spider webs, just 3 microns thick, is roughly three times as tough as DuPont's bulletproof Kevlar, stretches better than nylon and, weight for weight, is five times stronger than steel. A woven cable as thick as your thumb can bear the weight of a jumbo jet. These incredible qualities are the product of 400 million years of evolution, and have incontrovertibly dwarfed man\u0092s achievements in material science to date. And, now spider yarn has been spun by Nexia Biotechnologies of Montreal, marking a milestone in efforts to ape arachnids.\nSpider silk is ultra strong, light, elastic and biodegradable \u0096 simply ideal for everything from surgical sutures to body armor. Since it is compatible with the body, the first uses of BioSteel will probably be in microsurgery for super-thing biodegradable sutures, and then, possibly, for the production of artificial tendons or ligaments. Medicine could also apply it for hemostatic dressings. Fashion\u0092s another thing that could benefit. Farther down the line, it might be the stuff of bulletproof vests lighter and stronger than those currently in use, parachute cords, aircraft and automobile material, the coatings of space stations, perhaps even in bridges or other structures.\nIt is of course a bit early to know where this will lead, but we live in fast-moving times when technological changes often leap ahead of the most optimistic imagination. Clearly it advances a new field of biotechnology \u0096 biomaterials \u0096 which could be not only commercially viable but also have more appeal to environmentalists than some other biotechnology products, since spider silk is both a renewable resource and a biodegradable material. In some ways this work recalls the dreams of the social philosophers of the early 1900s, who speculated about a shift to \"biotechnical\" industries in which biological production systems would replace the inorganic machines of the factory and end (or at least reduce) reliance on mineral-based materials.\nBy Denis Dilion\n"}, {"score": 1597.4335, "uuid": "a45845d3-28cf-540f-88ea-5d29df9d854c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-87-03757", "target_hostname": "www.naturopathicmilestones.com", "target_uri": "http://www.naturopathicmilestones.com/thalia-charneys-articles-newsletters/milk-is-it-good/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Milk</em>: The Controversy \u00ab Naturopathic Milestones", "snippet": "<em>Cows</em> <em>milk</em> seems to be the biggest culprit, versus <em>milk</em> from <em>goats</em> <em>or</em> sheep.

The following commentary is based on ample clinical experience, a number of scientific and epidemiological studies with a side order of common sense.\nMy Observations. In my own clinical experience I have seen many conditions clear up remarkably after the removal of dairy from the diet, especially when the production of mucous is involved (for example, asthma or sinusitis), but also just about anything from eczema to headaches. Cows milk seems to be the biggest culprit, versus milk from goats or sheep.\nAllergy Tests and Milk. I frequently perform a blood allergy test on my patients that tests for an immune reaction to 96 common foods. This tests is different than the scratch tests often performed by allergists which identifies IgE allergies. This test picks up IgG and IgA allergies that tend to be more subtle, delayed and far reaching in terms of their affects on the body. Cows milk, along with wheat and eggs are in the top three positions of the biggest offenders.\nLactose Intolerance. Some of us can\u2019t tollerate milk simply because we lack enough of the enzyme lactase to digest a milk sugar called lactose. Essentially, there is a strong hereditary component based on whether or not your ancestors were dairy or non-dairy consumers. If you are of Northern or Western European origin (Great Britain, France, Germany or Scandinavia), you are less likely to have problems. If you or your ancestors are from Eastern Europe, Northern India or the Mediterranean, you may not have the required lactase enzymes to digest lactose. Everyone has some lactase enzymes to digest lactose, but not all of us have enough. These enzymes either drop dramatically after childhood or gradually as we age. They can also drop suddenly after abdominal surgeries. The amount of lactose varies depending on how dairy is processed. For example, even if you can\u2019t tolerate milk, you might be able to eat some traditionally made yogurts and aged cheeses.\nDo We Need Dairy for Calcium? In my opinion, this is a marketing gimmick of the dairy industry. I do not believe dairy deserves official food group status in the Canada Food Guide. Many cultures that don\u2019t consume milk after infancy have a much lower incidence of osteoporosis than we do. With proper nutritional counseling you can get all your calcium needs met from nuts/seeds, dark leafy greens and the like. Furthermore, one might question the recommended daily intake (RDA) for calcium set by the USA Food and Nutrition Board of 1000-1500 mg. The World Health Organization recommends only 400-500 mg. Most people in underdeveloped countries consume 300 \u2013 500 mg and their rate of osteoporosis is much lower than in the USA.\nHumans are the only species who consume milk after weaning off their mothers! Have you heard of cows developing osteoporosis? To boot, we are consuming milk from another species. Each species\u2019 milk reflects its environment and growing needs. Balance is important and more is not necessarily better. A cow\u2019s milk has a much higher protein, calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium content than human milk. In the mid 1800\u2019s the policy of US hospitals to feed infant\u2019s cow\u2019s milk during emergency situations was changed due to resulting illness. The high protein content was to blame. Infant formulas since then contain added sugar to dilute protein concentrations.\nDiary and Immune Disease Dairy has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases n various studies including Type-1 Diabetes in children, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis and Psoriasis. Many of them are linked to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and the development of what is often called \u201cleaky gut syndrome\u201d. Not only dairy is implicated in this type of reaction, for example, the wheat protein gluten is often suspect.\nDairy and Prostate Cancer. A 2001 Harvard Review of Research on prostate cancer and dairy consumption commented: \u201cDairy is one of the most consistent dietary predictors for prostate cancer in the published literature and those that consume the most dairy have 4x risk of metastatic and fatal prostate cancer\u201d. This certainly is a strong statement and should be taken very seriously.\nModern Milk Production. How milk is produced must be taken into consideration. I\u2019ve had more than a few patients tell me that they had no issues with milk growing up on a farm where it was consumed fresh and raw, and that since starting to drink city milk they cannot tolerate it. There are fundamental differences between raw milk (which some of our ancestors consumed), and pasteurized, homogenized dairy medicated with growth hormones and antibiotics. Furthermore, most of our ancestors due to lack of refrigeration drank or ate fermented milk products which are suggestively and nutritionally superior.\nPersonally, I consume small amounts of whole organic fermented dairy such as sheep\u2019s yogurt and homemade kefir on a regular basis. These seem to cause not problems even though dairy allergies and lactose intolerance run through my family. These products are easy to digest and provide good bacteria for gastrointestinal health. For my calcium I rely on dark leafy greens like kale, and nuts and seeds such as almonds and sesame seeds. I also prevent excess loss of calcium by avoiding carbonated drinks and eating plenty of alkaline foods such as fruits and vegetables. That is my take!\nReferences\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2000), 59, 573\u2013579 573\nCow\u2019s milk and immune-mediated diabetes. Hermann E.

The fatty acid composition in sheep milk is easily altered by different feed supplements. Average composition of milk from sheep, goats, cows and humans is comprehensively documented and compared relatively to the nutrient supply from human milk and to the recommended human daily dietary allowances. The unique richness in short chain and medium chain fatty acids in sheep milk, sheep cheeses, sheep butter (so far very neglected commercially), and their special values in human health and as treatment for many disease conditions is discussed extensively.

Introduction\nWhy milk sheep or even goats, when cows give much more milk and require less maintenance and labour per animal unit? That is a serious question often heard among economists. It is true that a unit of milk is more costly produced from sheep, also from goats, than from cows. Therefore, dairy products like cheeses, the main form of sale of sheep milk in most countries, are more expensive for consumers than cow milk products, e.g. cow milk cheese ( Table\u00a01 ), provided the sheep milk producer wants to not go bankrupt and out of business after a few years of hard toil, but actually make a living for his family, and some profit. On the other hand, milk is presently a better avenue to make a living in many parts of the sheep world ( Table\u00a02 ), since wool has a poor market return, and sheep meat, mutton and lambs is in a tight profit position except for ethnic markets.\nThus, why milk sheep? Is it because it is a better alternative to wool and meat sheep farming, or is it an alternative to cow dairying, which has had times of uncontrolled surplus production, quota restrictions, and cow milk intolerance problems, which the medical research community has not adequately addressed?\nBut how to justify milk sheep economically? Just because sheep milk has a higher solids content than cow and goat milk, and therefore has a much better cheese yield? That is not necessarily a good enough reason for the general negative economics of scale. Actually, buffalo (16.9%), reindeer (36.7%) and yak (17.9%) milk have at least the same high solids contents (Path, 1995; Kon and Cowie, 1961) as sheep milk for superior cheese yield compared to cow milk (12.6%), and they would have the economics of scale advantage as cows do. However, the large population size of sheep breeds, their wide adaptability to climates and forages make sheep much more widely accepted and genetically of greater potential.\n2. Research publications\nWhat other reasons for milking sheep can be found, than the addiction of the sheep farmer to nothing but sheep? Matching sheep milk products to the consumer is probably the best reason for milking sheep. The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) considered the British Sheep Dairy News worthy for regular inclusion in their world wide computer scientific journal abstract service.\nSearching the CAB for the past 10 years, the numbers of publications world wide on sheep milk, sheep cheese and allergies related to sheep milk are minor compared to those on cow milk ( Table\u00a03 ). Certainly there are more publications in earlier years, but those would be based on less sophisticated analytical methods. Publications on the nutritional value of sheep milk often give only gross composition without detailed identification of more specific unique components of benefit in human nutrition, although trade magazines contain many anecdotal reports, that are waiting for scientific evaluation. However, among the about 1,000 research projects on sheep world wide ( Table\u00a03 ), less than 4% deal with topics of sheep milk and sheep dairying.\nMost textbooks on \"Milk\" deal only with cow milk, and human milk to some extend (Kon and Cowie, 1961; Falconer, 1971; Renner, 1982; Gravert, 1983). The only major sources of research information on sheep milk appear to be the bulletins and proceedings of the International Dairy Federation Seminars held in Greece in 1985 and 1995 (IDF, 1983; 1986; 1996). Not even the 1st World Congress of Dairy Products in Human Health and Nutrition (Serrano Rios, 1994) recognised the existence or contribution of sheep milk products to human nutrition, nor does the handbook of the US Sheep Industry Development Program (Scott, 1986). In France, the scientific journal Le Lait devoted an entire issue to goat milk, including its role as an alternative to cow milk (Le Lait, 1993). A bibliography on goat milk (Freund, 2000), and the proceedings of a national colloquium on the nutritional and dietetic qualities of goat milk (Freund, 1996) have been published, but similar efforts on sheep milk are still missing. Even a book on buffalo milk is available (Deepak Sahai, 1996).\n3. Effects of breeds, season, feeds, mastitis\nAmong the more than 25 recognised dairy sheep breeds, which are mostly in the Mediterranean region, great genetic variation exists in milk composition, lactation length, lactation yield and seasonality of milk production. Using artificially controlled photoperiods of daylight can change milk production by 25-38% with concomitant changes in fat and total solids contents (Bocquier et al., 1997). Milk yields can differ more than ten times between breeds and within breeds, and lactation lengths can vary by 100%, which is a considerable potential for genetic selection and improvement. Even normal sheep milk composition may differ between 6 and 9% for fat, 4 and 7% for protein, 17 and 21% for total solids, 4 and 6% for lactose ( Table\u00a04 ) (Dario et al., 1995; Margetin, 1996; Simos et al., 1996), making sheep milk the composition leader next to reindeer among the 8 farm species, that produce milk for man (Path, 1995; Renner, 1982).\nGenetic differences in milk protein polymorphisms are of great interest to the cheese maker, because of correlations to curd firmness, coagulation time, casein content and cheese yield. Many studies on cow and goat milk proteins have shown that genetic selection for polymorphisms can have advantages for cheese processing, but much less is known for sheep milk. New analytical techniques during the last 5 years have made identifications of sheep milk protein polymorphisms possible (Pirisi et al., 1999b). Sheep milk protein comprises caseins, and the whey proteins beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, serum albumin, and immunoglobulin mainly. The caseins comprise 4 main fractions, alpha s-1, alpha s-2, beta and kappa, and each has a number of genetic polymorphs, which are due to different phosphorylation levels, amino acid substitutions, glycosylation differences, alterations in electrical charge, molecular weight, and hydrophobicity of the proteins. The hetrogeneity of alpha s-1 casein polymorphisms in sheep milk consists of either A, B, C, D, E, or F genes (Pirisi et al., 1999b), contributed by each parent. The D gene has a frequency of <0.01 in Lacaune, but 0.03 in Sarda sheep, and may be associated with low levels of fat, total protein, casein and poor curd forming characteristics. CC sheep milk had higher casein content by 3.5% than CD, and by 8.6% than DD milk ( Table\u00a05 ). CC milk also had higher protein : fat ratio, smaller casein micelle diameter, and better renneting properties. Three genetic polymorphisms of beta-lactoglobulin, A, B, and C, in sheep milk have been reported, and homozygous AA had higher cheese yield and fat contents than AB or BB (Pirisi et al., 1999a). Kappa casein has A and B variants, alpha s-2 casein 3 variants A, B, and C, and beta casein has 3 variants, beta-1, 2, and 3 (Martin and Addeo, 1996).\nMilk composition during the lactation follows typical curves. Therefore tables of average milk composition of any species do not tell the whole story, since fat, protein and ash contents increase considerably towards the end of lactation, while lactose contents decrease (Casoli et al., 1989; Fenyvessy et al., 1991; Dario et al., 1995; IDF, 1996; Ploumi et al., 1996). This influences the taste of milk, as it may be more salty at the end of lactation, and also affects cheese making characteristics (Piredda et al., 1996; Perea et al., 2000).\nMilk composition of major and minor components is affected by feeding regimes, ration components and forage : grain ratios (Perea et al., 2000). Supplementation of a mixed ration of rye grass pasture, vetch-oats and alfalfa hay with 20% calcium soaps of palm oil fatty acids increased milk fat content by 23%, yield by 16%, in milk of Manchega ewes, but decreased milk protein content by 9%; while 30 or 45% rumen undegradable protein had little effect on milk composition ( Table\u00a06 ) (Casals et al., 1999).\nMilk fatty acid composition is of particular interest to consumers with concern of health and heart disease. Studies aiming to modify the fatty acid profile of milk lipids have shown that type of diet will be effective. Adding supplementary rumen protected fat can increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in sheep milk. Adding supplementary rumen protected methionine and lysine increased the levels of Cl6:0-Cl8:3 by 5%, the unsaturated : saturated fatty acid ratio by 4%, but reduced C4:0-C12:0 by 12%, and left C12:0-C16:0 unchanged in milk of Comisana ewes ( Table\u00a07 ) (Sevi et al., 1998). Feeding ammonia treated olive tree leaves to Karagouniko ewes also decreased C6:0-C6:1, while increasing C18:0-C18:l fatty acids (Fegeros et al., 1995).\nMastitic conditions affect milk composition in sheep as it does in cow or goat milk, except that the monitoring indirect parameter of somatic cell counts (SCC) in milk is much less related to pathogenic conditions in sheep as it is in goat udders compared to cow udders, and that high SSC (>1 million/ml) do occur in normal sheep and goat milk, especially towards the end of lactation (Bufano et al., 1996). Nevertheless, with increasing SCC it has been reported that milk pH, whey protein, fat contents, rennet clotting time, and rate of clot firming time rise, while lactose, casein contents, and clot firmness decreased ( Table\u00a08 ) (Diaz et al., 1996). It has not been determined, however, whether the deterioration of renneting characteristics is due primarily to the normal physiological SCC increase at the end of lactation and the concurrent change in milk composition, or to subclinical and clinical mastitic conditions in the udder, which also produce high SCC and changed milk composition.\n4. Standard nutritional reference tables\nAverage nutritional values of sheep milk in comparison to its 3 main competitors, cow, human and goat milk have been published years ago most comprehensively, but have not been updated apparently ( Tables\u00a09, 10, 11 ) adapted from (Kon and Cowie, 1961; Posati and Orr, 1976; Renner, 1982). They do show, however, the superiority of sheep milk composition, in relative terms compared to the composition of human, cow and goat milk ( Tables\u00a012, 13, 14 ); and in such critical nutrients as protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin D, medium chain fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, linolenic acid, and all 10 essential amino acids. This is shown also in ( Table\u00a015 ) in actual values compared to the recommended daily minimum allowances for human nutrition, when 2 cups (490 g) of milk of one of the 4 species are consumed. Most importantly, daily calcium requirements and those of riboflavin and 5 of the essential 10 amino acids are completely covered by just drinking 2 cups of sheep milk without eating anything else. As drinking sheep milk is not widespread, more likely 2 cups of sheep milk yoghurt will meet those daily requirements, or the milk equivalent in 93 g of sheep cheese.\nThe nutritional values of sheep cheeses have not been published much nor in detail compared to those of cow cheeses. ( Table\u00a016 ) attempts to show how sheep cheeses compared to cow cheeses can make a valuable contribution for consumers. More significantly this is demonstrated in ( Table\u00a017 ) for MCT, the medium chain fatty acids C6:0-C14:0, especially on a total solids or dry matter basis.\n5. MCT and other uniqueness\nMedium chain length fatty acids or medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have been recognised as unique lipids with unique applications (Babayan, 1981; Babayan and Rosenau, 1991; Haenlein, 1992). Their medical and nutritional values have been the subject of at least 102 publications during the past 10 years demonstrating real benefits in malabsorption syndroms, chyluria, steatorrhea, hyperlipoproteinemia, and in cases of intestinal resection, coronary by-pass, premature-infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis and gallstones, because of their unique metabolic ability to provide energy instead of contributing to adipose tissues as other lipids do. MCT also inhibit or limit cholesterol deposition, dissolve cholesterol gallstones, and contribute to normal growth of infants. MCT are unique, because they do not follow the general lipid transport pathway through the lymphatic system and into the prostaglandin metabolism (Babayan and Rosenau, 1991). Instead they go through the portal system directly into the liver, where they are oxidised into quickly available energy for body utilisation. Thus, patients have been prescribed daily intake of MCT supplements for at least 40 years.\nThe unique content of about 25% MCT in total sheep milk fat and its possible quantitative modification through feeding has not been exploited commercially nor explored in research. Daily recommended patient intakes of 15 g MCT (Dulloo et al., 1996) could be provided by about 60 g sheep butter, but sheep butter making may have to be reinvented. A novel approach has been proposed by Babayan and Rosenau (1991) to make cheese, either cheddar or fontinella, enriched with MCT oil as a palatable and more attractive option for patients who suffer from various malabsorption syndroms and must consume MCT.\nAnother interesting research programme is pursued at the University Wisconsin (Wendorff 1998) in utilising the unique properties of sheep milk, especially its flavourful fatty acids, to enrich the flavour of low-fat cow milk cheeses such as Muenster or Manchego by adding 20% sheep milk. The blended 9-months aged Manchego-type cheese has become popular at the dairy store of the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Odorous substances are actually at a higher level in sheep milk than in goat or cow milk, except for buffalo milk ( Table\u00a018 ) (Moio et al., 1993). Another potentially important study by Ramet (1996) has demonstrated that the poor cheese making properties of camel milk can be significantly improved by adding from 10 to 50% sheep milk.\nOf particular interest to dairy sheep farmers is the possibility of using sheep milk as an alternative to cow milk in cases of cow milk allergy. Medical research, however, has not adequately pursued the many practical experiences and anecdotal reports of benefits to patients suffering from cow milk allergy. ( Table\u00a03 ) shows that there has been a fair number of publications on cow milk allergy, but few on sheep milk as an alternative. Actually there are at least 3 papers during the last 10 years indicating allergy also to sheep milk, because of cross reactivity between the milk proteins of bovine, ovine or caprine origin (Wuthrich and Johansson, 1995; Fenyvessy and Csanadi, 1999; Umpierrez et al., 1999).\n6. Niche marketing\nVarious nutritional preparations are on the market for use by people in need or interested in boosting their energy. Sheep milk has been proposed as a more natural and better tasting alternative with great nutritional and clinical potential (Hardy, 2000), because of its many valuable constituents, discussed here, and in a market estimated e.g. in the U.K. as worth $100 million. Of course, the sheep cheese market is well established and growing, but there is much room for innovations as the new dairy sheep industry in USA has demonstrated in artisanal and direct marketing of sheep cheeses and yogurt with the support of the American Cheese Society during the last 10 years.\nToday's consumer is much more interested in low-fat than whole milk. Therefore to market any substantial amounts of whole sheep milk with its very much higher fat content than cow milk may not be very successful. Low-fat sheep milk apparently has not been tried in marketing, but because of its high protein content and full taste, it should have potential. Also the resulting cream can be a good market in itself or as sheep butter or for sheep ice cream production, always utilising the name \"sheep\" as a special label for sales with possibly a higher price. Promotion of sheep milk and its products could be much better organised and a greater market share realised, not just a special niche for connoisseurs, but also for medical needs, if producers, at least in developed countries, would make a regular percentage check-off money of their product sales available for a central agency for advertisements and research. In many developing countries it is also of vital economic importance to assure a fair price for sheep milk products to maintain the farmer's future on the farm, besides providing critical protein, calcium and energy food for subsistence and to fight malnutrition. In this effort, much is needed to improve the genetic ability of many dairy sheep populations to have longer lactations and to focus on much better udder morphology.\nTable 1 Comparison of costs of producing Cheddar cheese from cow, goat and sheep milk (Wendorff, 1995) (1)\nCow\n"}, {"score": 1578.321, "uuid": "a08bd3df-e8fe-5993-b835-36bd1953cd41", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200tw-13-09153", "target_hostname": "fromthebartolinikitchens.com", "target_uri": "http://fromthebartolinikitchens.com/2012/02/01/you-milk-the-goat-i-make-the-cheese/", "page_rank": 1.2732635e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "You <em>Milk</em> The <em>Goat</em>, I Make The Cheese | from the Bartolini kitchens", "snippet": "It <em>is</em> still <em>better</em> than the stuff with all of the preservatives and additives. Thanks for stopping by! Oh No, Now I have to get a <em>goat</em>?", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted on February 1, 2012 by ChgoJohn\nI came to making my own cheeses by a rather indirect path. Almost 4 years ago, on some cooking show, I watched as labneh was made by straining plain yogurt using coffee filters. I tried it, liked the result and then, following their lead, seasoned it with some herbs. I was so pleased with the end-result that I served it that Thanksgiving and it was well-received. Shortly thereafter, on another sleepless night, I was searching the web looking for more things to do with labneh when I stumbled upon one of the many cheese making websites. Soon I was jumping from site to site, surprised to learn how relatively simple cheese is to create depending, of course, upon the type you\u2019re making \u2014 and I\u2019ve been making a few select cheeses ever since.\nWith the right equipment, supplies, and environment, you can make almost any cheese. Living in the city, however, I cannot get many of the dairy products needed to make some cheeses. Neither do I have, nor am I going to build, a temperature-controlled room to age the hard cheeses that require it. So, right off the bat, I\u2019ve eliminated most types of cheese \u2014 and that\u2019s just fine. I\u2019m very satisfied making just goat cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, mascarpone, and mozzarella. Besides, no matter how good the home-made parmesan, I don\u2019t use nearly enough to make it worth my while to make some. (The Bartolini kitchens prefer Pecorino Romano, anyway, but try to find lactating sheep in Chicago.)\nGoat Cheese Prepared with Herbes des Provence\nRecently, when I decided to share my cheese making experiences, I mapped out a game plan starting with the easiest cheese to make. In my opinion, ricotta is that cheese, especially since my recipe is non-traditional, meaning not made from the whey created when mozzarella is made. \u00a0(Having made ricotta both ways, I\u2019ll stick with the recipe I posted for reasons of both taste and ease of preparation.) Somewhere along the way I had planned to talk about making butter at home but Celi did such a good job with it that I\u2019ll just send you to her kitchen\u2019s garden for a look-see. So, having already\u00a0shared\u00a0the ricotta recipe and with the butter instructions out-of-the-way, that brings us to the next cheese in the schedule: goat cheese.\nTo make goat cheese, you begin by adding a little rennet to a combination of goat\u2019s milk and cultured buttermilk. That mixture is gently warmed and then set aside to allow the formation of curds. Once formed, the curds are separated from the whey and the resulting goat cheese is ready for use in your favorite recipe, or, once salted and possibly herbed, can be used as a tasty spread. It really is that easy, as you\u2019ll soon see.\nIf you are new to cheese making, before attempting to make this cheese,\u00a0please refer to my Cheesy Stuff page. Chock full of cheesy details, it provides information about ingredients, cleaning/sterilizing equipment, spices & seasonings, a few tips, and sources for supplies and information.\nHome-Made Goat Cheese Recipe\nyield: about 20 oz. of cheese\nIngredients\n1/2 gallon goat\u2019s milk (never ultra-pasteurized)\n1 pint (2 cups) cultured buttermilk (no substitutions)\n1/2 tablet rennet, dissolved in 1/4 cup distilled water\nsalt (optional, though strongly recommended)\nherbs (optional)\nolive oil (optional)\nDirections\nPlace the goat\u2019s milk, buttermilk, and rennet into a large, non-reactive pot. Over med-low heat, slowly raise the mixture\u2019s temperature to 180*, stirring\u00a0occasionally\u00a0to prevent its scorching on the pot\u2019s bottom.\nOnce it has reached 180*, remove the mixture from the heat, pour it into a large glass bowl, cover it, and set it aside, undisturbed, for about 12 hours. If the curds have not yet formed, leave it undisturbed until they do. It could take as long as another 12 hours (although it has never taken that long for me).\nTake some sterilized cheesecloth or a handkerchief and use it to cover the inside of a strainer. Slowly pour the mixture into the cloth-lined strainer. Once most, if not all the liquid (whey) has passed through the strainer, gather the corners of the cloth and tie them together, forming a sack, of sorts, with the curds inside. Hang this sack over a bowl and refrigerate at least overnight.\nRemove the goat cheese from the cloth and season with salt, to taste, and whatever herbs and olive oil you prefer.\nGoat Cheese Stuffed Shells\nVariations\nYou can do many things with goat cheese and much depends upon how well it is drained. If you intend to use it as a spread, do not drain it fully and leave it a little on the moist side or, if you like, add a little olive oil. Season it with your favorite herbs and spices and you\u2019ll have a delicious spread for crostini and\u00a0crudit\u00e9s, or you may crumble it and use it in salads. Drain it more thoroughly and although you can still season it and use it as was already mentioned, you\u2019ll find that you can, also, use it as you would ricotta in lasagna, cheesecake, or stuffed shells, or on top of pizza or bruschette.\nNotes\nThere are any number of places where you can purchase molds used to press various cheeses into recognizable shapes. If I were to make more kinds of cheese, I would probably buy a few of them. Since I really don\u2019t make enough cheese to warrant purchasing molds, I made do. Using a large can that had been used for pineapple rings, I\nremoved the can\u2019s top & bottom, saving one of the lids, and filled it with goat cheese. I placed a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and covered it with a piece of waxed paper in which I\u2019d punctured some holes in an area a little larger than the size of the can. I placed the cheese-filled can over the holes, replaced the lid, and placed a heavy can on top of the lid, thus applying pressure to force more whey out of the cheese. Everything was refrigerated overnight and the cheese was used later that day to make the stuffed shells pictured above.\nComing Soon\nIn the weeks ahead, look for my posts detailing the making of cream cheese, mascarpone, and mozzarella. Speaking of mozzarella, please let me know if you are aware of a nearby water buffalo herd.\nInspired by Fankhauser\u2019s How to Make Farmer\u2019s Cheese web page.\nHere\u2019s Flat Ruthie Now \u2026\nFlat Ruthie visited Chicago and stayed long enough to take part in my 2 day birthday celebration.

Will it also work with homemade nut milk?\nThe strains in the Gi ProHealth starter are: Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus casei.\nThe Vegetal yogurt starter contains Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. It also contains rice maltodextrin.\nThe Vegatal starter is especially formulated to work well with rice milk, and should also work well with homemade nut milk.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Sarah L. at 3/8/11 6:13 PM\nWill you be getting the larger size back in stock?\nWe may carry the larger size at some point, but we have not had a lot of demand for it in the past, and we don't have a date for when it will be available, if at all.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Rebecca W at 3/24/11 6:07 AM\nwhen you write the The Vegetal yogurt starter is completely vegan do you mean that the culture it grew on is non dairy? so there are'nt even any traces of dairy.\nI'm asking because some startes claim to be vegan but when I asked I was told that the traces of dairy are almost negligible and therfore considered non dairy.\nMy daughter is very sensitive so the answer is very important.\nThankes Rebecca\nThe Vegetal starter is initially cultured in non-GMO soy milk.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Rebecca w at 3/28/11 1:15 PM\nHi again ,\nthanks for your prompt answer.\njust to make sure you wrote- The Vegetal starter is INITIALLY cultured in non-GMO soy milk , and then it is cultured in something else ? (initially- means in the beginning)\nJust have to make sure that there is absolutely no trace of dairy (or anything else not specified)\nThanks Rebecca\nThe Vegetal starter is entirely vegan, suitable for use in vegan diets, so there is no milk in it at all.\nDo you find this question helpful? Yes No\nFrom Misha at 4/5/11 12:46 PM\nHi, I was wondering if I could use the SO Delicious coconut milk that is sold in the dairy section at Whole Foods. It's made to be drunk like soy milk is. It's thickened with guar gum. Also, since coconut milk has less sugar in it, could I add a type of sugar to make it thicker? Thanks!\nWe generally recommend to just choose a coconut milk with the least amount of additives. Guar gum doesn't generally present an issue though. No extra sugar is needed but often coconut milk does better with a longer culturing period so it's worth keeping an eye on the yogurt as you may need to let it culture longer than normal.\nDo you find this question helpful?

In fact, milk is one of the best muscle foods on the planet. You see, the protein in milk is about 20 percent whey and 80 percent casein.

It contains practically all the elements required by the economy of man to build bone, muscle, nerves, and brain; in sugar of milk are found the elements which furnish heat and energy sufficient to keep the human machine functioning. It is a far more complete food than meat. When meat is used as a basic food, it is necessary to combine with it other foods which contain the elements which meat does not have, such as the organic mineral elements, vitamins, and energy-creating material. It is also essential that fruits and vegetables be added to a meat diet in order that these may help eliminate the acids, toxins, and urates contained in the meats.\nBesides being an almost perfect food (lacking only in cellulose), milk is a remedial agent whose use alone has been the means of eliminating various ailments, particularly those caused by the toxins and acids with which the system has become filled by the use of too much meat and denatured foods.\nMilk contains the organic mineral elements and an abundance of the vitamins, both of which are essential to the normal health and growth of children; it is also the ideal basic diet for those who are suffering from \"deficiency\" or \"wasting\" diseases, but when prescribed for these ailments, the whole milk must be used as most of the vitamins are contained in the butterfat.\nThough a perfectly balanced food, milk alone is too concentrated to maintain health in grown people - cellulose is needed and eliminating agents; these are secured by the free use of vegetables, and of fruit between meals.\nTHE ORGANIC MINERAL ELEMENTS: These elements, termed cell salts, are tissue builders, tissue preservers, creators of vital energy, stimulators of the ductless glands, and the preventors of disorganization and putrefaction, in much the same manner as ordinary table salt - chloride of sodium - preserves meats and other foods.\nThese elements are found in abundance in many vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts, but are contained in their richest state in cow's and goat's milk. In countries where milk is unobtainable, fish, natural rice, soy beans, millet, barley, cocoanuts, etc., may be substituted. Although these substitute foods are rich in organic mineral elements, they cannot take the place of milk as a child's food and this is the reason why the death rate is usually extremely high among children who are deprived of milk. In a quality of milk there is found nearly one per cent of the organic mineral elements per hundred weight, in the form of calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, etc., cell salts required for the normal functioning of the body. Deformity in a young child or animal, except when caused by accident, indicates that during the period of gestation the mother subsisted on food deficient in these vital elements, this lack preventing the unborn body from developing harmoniously.\nIn the animal kingdom, the feeding of the female while with young, has almost reached a science, so that deformities seldom occur. There are of course exceptions and, setting aside accidents, these exceptions, despite the fact that the mother's food was rightly selected and combined, are due to the fact that the organic elements were not present in the food. This fault could be obviated if all feed were first analyzed.\nIn the human kingdom, man is as yet unenlightened or refuses to believe that diet is of supreme importance to human welfare - he is far more concerned with the appearance and taste of what he eats than with its relation to health, normal development of the body, spirituality, success, and happiness; therefore there are being born an increasing number of deficient and deformed children whose parents, otherwise enlightened and cultured, are ready to blame any and every cause for the tragedy, except the right one: food.\nThe organic mineral elements are rich in milk even when part or all of its cream has been removed, and in cases of weak bones, rickets, or non-development of the bony structure in children, a need for more than the usual amount of milk is indicated, and skim-milk is better than whole milk; when whole milk is give in large quantity in addition to other foods rich in fat, the system receives too much fat in proportion. Torpidity of the liver will result from this error, followed by indigestion, mal-assimilation, malnutrition, and other ailments thus offsetting all the benefit the milk can render. When milk is used as a basic food with but little else containing fat included in the diet (as, for example, a menu composed of milk, baked whole potatoes, or whole cereal bread with plenty of vegetables), then whole milk should be used. And right here enters a delicate and important dietetic question, one which frequently receives little or no attention and the result is that the science of diet has ben condemned. Too many who claim to understand dietetics, have made the mistake of prescribing whole milk in ample quantity and with other foods rich in fats, or of prescribing skim-milk without other basic foods rich in fat. In either case, results are disastrous, and the diet is condemned rather than the real cause - the food combinations.\nVery young children up to the age of two or three years, should be given entire fresh milk, reducing this whole milk with water to the strength desired. After that age, part of the butterfat may be removed and less water added - this, however, only in proportion as other foods containing fats are added to the skim-milk and vegetables.\nThere is no food substance known which is in any way better for a growing child than plenty of fresh milk with vegetables of almost all varieties. To this combination there should be gradually added whole-grain breads with butter, and whole baked potatoes, though these two starches should not be served at one meal. Serve milk, bread and butter, and vegetables at one meal; milk, baked potatoes and vegetables at the next. These foods supply all the vital mineral elements, material for nerve and brain development; growth proceeds normally, and it is practically impossible for mental or physical weaknesses to develop.\nThe ideal food for all normal children from the age of three to eighteen is in the various combinations of whole-grain bread in limited quantities, milk and butter, eggs and cheese, vegetables and fruits - all fruits being eaten between, never with, meals. Meat is unnecessary, undesirable, and to be included only when a need for stimulating food is indicated. Milk contains warmth and energy-creating material, protein and casein, which renew or build nerves and tissues, and the large percentage of cell salts vital for repair and equalization of the entire organism. Young animals fed on milk develop rapidly and normally, show strength and vitality; those fed on substitutes for milk, however perfect these substitutes appear to be, are usually more or less weak, sickly and in some manner undeveloped. However much we may dislike the idea and deny the fact, the human body is essentially an animal body and is governed by the one law which governs the growth of all the animal bodies.\nALBUMEN: This is an important food element contained in milk. It is called the muscle-builder, as from it the muscles of men and animals are built and kept in repair. It is in milk in the form of protein. Albumen is found also in the white of eggs and if the eggs are fertilized, it is even more vital and concentrated, provided the eggs are fresh.\nAlbumen, whether given to children, young animals, or grown people, should never be boiled. Heat coagulates it and may partly or totally destroy its value as a protein or albuminous food. A farmer who boiled or sterilized the milk intended for a calf would be adjudged more or less insane or wholly ignorant - not fit to be a farmer. An authority on this subject, H.N. Parker, has said: \"To obtain the required effect of pasteurizing, a temperature of 142 degrees Fahrenheit is required, and it varies between 135 and 150 degrees. If the milk contained tuberculosis germs, I should expect some of them to survive the process. The albumen in the milk would probably be partly coagulated.\" In other words, according to this authority - and his statements have been widely accepted - pasteurizing at this degree of heat would not kill all the tuberculosis germs and would partly or wholly destroy the food value of the milk, and, unquestionably, of the vitamins therein as well. The process therefore is proved to be useless and destructive.\nSUGAR: Mothers who have fed their babies on bottle milk are more or less familiar with sugar of milk. This sugar is obtained from the milk of cows and goats, and not, as frequently supposed, from vegetables or chemicals through a process of refining. Sugar of milk is one of the most desirable of all the energy-producing agents, because, like whole milk, it does not long remain in the stomach but mixes readily with water and albumen, and the system quickly absorbs it. In this respect it is radically different from all manufactured sugars which are only partly absorbed and are actually, in most cases, treated in the system as foreign substances.\nHoney, though a sugar, cannot be considered in the same list with the various refined sugars but is to be classified with sugar of milk. Among other mineral products it contains sulfur which is not a part of sugar of milk to any perceptible degree. In the restoration of youth and the change of the intestinal flora, sugar of milk and whey are much more valuable than gland transplantation, although being common substances and easily obtainable, they are ignored and refused the consideration they deserve.\nCASEIN\nThe Nerve and Brain Builder\nBecause casein has been classified with albumen found in milk, it has been considered mainly as a muscle builder, whereas it is a most important nerve and brain-builder. If the American people could be induced to accept this one fact and give to common cottage cheese the place on their daily menus which it deserves, it would be the direct agency of making them probably fifty per cent more efficient, and the stigma of our country being a \"nation of neurasthenics\" would soon be removed.\nCasein in the form of cottage cheese is easily digested and quickly and perfectly assimilated. It repairs and builds tissue, stimulates the cells of the body to greater activity and acts as a natural tonic without stimulation; to the nerves and brain it is a food beyond compare. In neurasthenia, anemia, nervous irritation, the debility present in organic and inorganic diseases, malnutrition, nervous disease, tuberculosis, rickets, pellagra, as a basic food for most chronic invalids as well as for elderly people, casein is a food-medicine. It is found in skim-milk and fresh uncreamed milk. Casein easily replaces all other forms of protein and this is the reason for its great value as a fundamental constructive agent in the diseases mentioned. It must, of course, be well combined with vegetables as it is low in vitamins because of the withdrawal of butterfat, the vitamin carrier, and the whey in which is found most of the organic mineral elements.\nBUTTERFAT: The fat of milk is a compound of many substances and forms, on an average, four per cent of the milk, if cows have been correctly fed. It is rich in carbon and hydrogen. As an energy producer it furnishes more than twice as much to the ounce as does sugar of milk. It is a food of great value to children and adults not only because of its energy-producing power in concentrated and easily digested form, but also because it is the carrier of an animal or vitalized vitamin which is found in sufficient abundance in no other fat; vegetable and nut fats contain it to a slight degree.\nButterfat is of greatest value when taken with milk before the cream has had time to separate itself. A chemical change takes place during this process, both in the milk and the cream, after which they no longer are the same as when they formed the primary natural mass. When milk and cream are separated and then remixed and given as a food, digestion is somewhat retarded, because the fat is then retained in the stomach with the casein, and the digestion is much slower. Due to this fact, it is best that fresh milk be served to children and invalids, and if it is still so fresh as to be warm from the cow, it is at its best for all cases in which vitality is extremely low. Babies and calves suckle warm milk from the mother's breast; Nature knows what is best for their normal development.\nMILK AND OTHER FATS: the difference between milk fat and other fats in their relation to the growth of the young and the health-controlling qualities in the case of adults, is due to the presence in the mild fat of a larger proportion of the elusive but active substances known as vitamins, as well as of a more abundant supply of organic mineral elements.\nPeanut oil, cocoa butter, and cocoanut oil, nut butters made from a combination of the fats of cocoanuts and other nuts, are valuable in the dietary. They are free from disease-creative constituents but are deficient in the important elements contained in milk fats and other fats, and become dangerous to health if wholly substituted for dairy butter in the dietary of children and invalids. These butter or fat substitutes, find their most important place when used in cooking and baking. Real butter should be served with breads, muffins, and potatoes. When it is impossible to obtain a sufficient amount of butterfat, the consequent shortage in vitamin and the organic mineral elements must be offset by the use of a greater amount of milk and a larger proportion of fresh vegetables and fruits; children should be served more tomato and fruit juices between meals. If milk and butter are entirely unobtainable, then animal fats and the richest kind of fish should be plentifully supplied as a basic food to old people, invalids, and even children; fish, especially, will help to make up the deficiency.\nMILK FOR THE HEALTHY: Many people have come to the conclusion that milk is valuable as a food only for the young, or as a food-medicine for invalids and those suffering from tuberculosis, anemia, neuritis, rheumatics, and for nervous wrecks and neurasthenics. This is erroneous. Milk is as valuable a basic food for the well as it is for the ill and on the family table readily takes the place of meat. As an example, let us consider the menu usually served for a family lunch: meat in some form, potato, bread and butter, a vegetable. The eaters would do well from every point of view if they would take instead: a glass or two of milk - instead of the meat, whole-grain bread, and butter, two or three vegetables. These combinations are identical with the meal based on meat save that the toxins and ureas found in meat are absent, and the meal more perfectly balanced. If soup is liked, a vegetable soup may be served first, and then the milk, potato or bread (not broth), and vegetables. The mistaken idea that milk is not solid or heavy for a basic food and that meat, being more substantial is needed, should be discarded. Milk, being coagulated by the digestive juices as a first process of digestion, is actually a more \"solid\" food than meat. The idea that milk is a \"light\" food is due to the fact that ignorance has always considered milk to be only a drink - a mere fluid - and not \"solid\" nourishment.\nMEAT SUBSTITUTES: From all that we have said the conclusion may be arrived at that it is always necessary to serve the whole milk if it is to be a complete substitute for meat. This is not entirely true. Skim-milk may readily and correctly be compared to the lean cuts of meat, while milk with all its cream is comparable to the richer cuts. The fat in milk is a more than desirable substitute for the fat in meat. On the other hand, skim-milk is a more than good substitute for lean meat because in it is found the organic mineral element which meat lacks. When skim-milk is used as a basic food, a fat must be supplied, but this is equally true when lean meats are served.\nIt is not necessarily true that milk must be taken as a drink in order to substitute it for meat. Many soups may be prepared with milk as a base but care should be taken that the milk is added just before serving; if it boils, the albumen is coagulated and over-heating might also destroy the vitamin though it would have little or no effect on the organic mineral elements.\nWhen skim-milk is used as a food without the addition of butterfat, then about a tablespoonful of some substitute - cocoanut butter or cocoanut oil, nut butter or other vegetable fat - should be added to a cup of milk to make up the deficiency.\nCHEESE: Cheese is one of the most perfect substitutes for meat and if a fairly good grade is selected, it contains between one-sixth and one-fourth of its weight in fat, and more than one-third of its weight in vital casein. It is well to use frequently a good cheese in place of meat or other meat substitutes. And, since cheese contains a fairly large proportion of fat, it is not necessary that fat of any nature be added at a meal, with the exception of butter for the bread or potatoes that are served also. Bread and butter, cheese and several creamed or fresh vegetables, form an ideal meal, a perfect combination of foods for the brain or sedentary worker. Those who are engaged in more strenuous labor may require the addition of heavier foods.\nA DESIRABLE HOME PRODUCT: In country districts, the value of cottage cheese as a good food is well recognized and the wise housewife is certain to use all surplus skim-milk for its production. The skim-milk is allowed to sour or clabber and then heated to body temperature until it separates from the whey; it is drained, salted to taste, and softened with a little sweet milk or cream. It can be spread on bread in place of butter. Some add a good honey. This is a delicious combination and a splendid nerve builder. Children naturally prefer it to other foods and it should always be served in place of cake made from denatured flour, refined sugars, irritating spices. If this truth about cottage cheese were more generally known and observed, the United States would not be accursed as now with an average of four million defective children.\nSince cottage cheese contains about one-third pure casein, acid fruits should not be served with it. Acid, of whatever nature, affects the albumen and casein, destroying at least in part the nerve-and-brain-building qualities even though already coagulated in cottage cheese. This is true with all milk products. Many of the world's greatest physicians and chemists recognize and warn against combining acid fruits with preparations mostly composed of albumens and casein.\nBUTTERMILK: Many have the mistaken idea that buttermilk is not a food but a more or less refreshing \"drink.\" buttermilk differs but slightly from skim-milk. It has undergone a chemical change in which lactic acid is a product, and it contains a somewhat greater proportion of butterfat.\nThe casein content of the buttermilk does not vary greatly from that found in skim-milk; the amount of organic mineral elements is about the same; therefore, practically in all respects it is just as valuable as a food, is more readily accepted by some stomachs than skim-milk, and, due to the greater neutralizing qualities of the lactic acid not present in skim-milk, is more desirable in the treatment of some ailments. In malnutrition, tuberculosis, intestinal affectons and especially toxo-absorption, if skim-milk is not easily accepted by the digestive organism, buttermilk is the ideal food-drink.\nButtermilk is frequently of great benefit to invalids, elderly people and children above the age of six months. It should be served between meals or as a meal in combination with baked potatoes of whole-grain bread and fresh vegetables. (When given to children of tender age, the baby's bottle should be thoroughly cleansed after its use, so as to avoid all possibility of souring the fresh milk at the next feeding.)\nWHEY: By-product of cottage cheese. When correctly used, it quickly changes the intestinal flora, destroys noxious germ life in the intestinal canal, and is abundantly supplied with mineral elements.\nFOOD VALUE: One quart of fresh milk containing all its native butterfat, is equal in food value to any one of the following:\nThree-fourths pound of beef\nOne-half to three-fourths pound of fowl\nOne-half pound of nuts\nOne pound of peas, beans , or lentils\nIt is to be noted that the food-value difference in beef and fowl cannot be precisely estimated since they lack the organic mineral elements and vitamins. Eggs, peas, beans and lentils contain these elements but they are not as easily digested not as readily assimilated. The vital value of a quart of good milk may be estimated to equal that of one pound of the best beef.\nCOTTAGE CHEESE\nAs already stated, cottage cheese is almost a pure casein and is rich in all the essential elements such as the organic mineral elements and vitamins. It contains no toxins or ureas. It is a blood, nerve and muscle-builder, and regulator of bodily functions. One pound of cottage cheese is equal to one pound of beef, pork, lamb, veal, game, or fowl. Fat is absent but this is readily supplied by additional butter or cream, or in soups served with it. Cottage cheese costs less than one-half the price charged for meats and, considering its food value, would be cheap if three or four times the price of meat were charged for it. There is not one objection to it as a food for everyone, beginning with the child of ten months or a year to the very aged.\nMILK AND THE IDIOSYNCRACIES OF SOME CHILDREN(1)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n(1) Many so-called milk idiosyncracies are due to the body's lack of lactase to digest lactose (the sugar of milk). Lactase can now be obtained from a Natrura physician for those with this problem.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nFOR EXAMPLE: \"I know of a child about one year old who seems to be poisoned whenever she takes cow's milk. A rash breaks out on her body, with itching, and she has gone into convulsions, even when milk was modified according to the prescribed formula.\"\nDespite the fact that there are occasional individual idiosyncracies like the above, milk is the natural food for babies and children. When mother's milk, which of course is best, is unavailable, goat's milk should be substituted; failing this, cow's is the next best. Whenever there is an indication that such substitution for mother's milk may cause trouble, care should be exercised to secure good milk from one goat or cow and use none but that.\nAt first glance, the above case may appear to be unusual but it is not - usually one or more such instances are met by every physician who treats children. The condition is not unknown in adults. Unless one has had experience with these cases, the conclusion is apt to be that the milk is a poison - or acts as such - and should be discarded. The real cause is seldom found in the milk, though occasionally a stomach is found which will not tolerate it and in which toleration cannot be established.\nMilk is a sub-acid food and if the system is in a sub-acid state then it is not acceptable and may not even be coagulated in the usual manner by the digestive juices, the digestion being so long delayed that it becomes almost like a poison. To overcome this, it is only necessary that a drink prepared from the juice of grapefruit or tomatoes - not oranges - be taken one-half hour before the milk, then the digestive juices will be prepared for it and it will be readily coagulated and digested.\nIn the majority of case, the system is super-acid and the degree of reaction is in proportion to the acidity. Sometimes the milk at first induces a feverish condition followed by a rash, and if its use is continued the symptoms are aggravated. At this point, the average person concludes that the milk is not a good food and discontinues its use. A physician who has had experience will know that instead of being a poison, the milk is actually acting beneficially for the patient. The symptoms of poisoning and fever with raising of temperature even to 103 degrees, indicate the normal action of the milk in neutralizing the bodily acids and toxins, eliminating the poisons which had resulted from this neutralization, and equalizing the vital forces. Therefore, if the milk is wisely continued for a sufficient length of time, the symptoms will gradually subside, rash disappear, temperature go to normal, and it will be found that toleration has been established. This is what took place: When first imbibed, because of the condition of the system, as stated, the milk was an opposing force. The acid present caused too rapid coagulation with excessively large lumps of curd; and this condition may be so severe as to cause gas and the distension of the stomach, which in turn induces fever and convulsions. As the milk is continued, it gradually counteracts the acid, establishing balance. However, it is not necessary that milk taken into a super-acid system induce this condition. A test may be made and the exact state of the system known. When super-acidity is indicated, a sub-acid fruit such as orange of pineapple, eaten half an hour previous to the milk, will in part counteract the extreme acidity. For children, the usual procedure is to give lime water directly or add it to the milk. The theory is the same.\nThe test referred to above is readily made by the use of litmus paper, first using the blue for saliva and urine. If the paper turns a decided red, acidity is present. In the case of a child, we proceed to reduce whole milk to almost the strength indicated by age and general condition, adding one or more tablespoons of lime water without the milk and an hour afterwards feed milk and lime water. Should the stomach still reject the milk, prepare barley water and to this add lime water and feed as usual. Then one-half hour before the next feeding give the lime water and when it is time for feeding, give the milk and lime water, This method, plus a little patience and common sense, will overcome the worst case.\nWhen children of one or more years of age cannot take milk, the procedure is more simple, fruit juices being used in the same manner as for adults.\nWhen there is no acid-reaction, the test should be made for sub-acidity. If this is indicated, a few drops of grapefruit, lemon or lime juice may be given in water half an hour before feeding time, then followed by the milk. Baked sour apples, tart berry juice, or the juice of other tart fruit may be used.\nIn some cases of milk intoleration the action of the liver may be at fault, being either sluggish or over-active. Whatever the cause, it must be found, removed or neutralized, and this being done there will be few cases of intoleration.\n"}, {"score": 1553.1985, "uuid": "c136def9-ca3a-5ec7-8c3a-74b76fab753f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1310wb-97-31203", "target_hostname": "www.denverspiritualcommunity.org", "target_uri": "http://www.denverspiritualcommunity.org//Wisdom/DietChpt9.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Diet; Key To Health - <em>Milk</em>", "snippet": "This sugar <em>is</em> obtained from the <em>milk</em> of <em>cows</em> and <em>goats</em>, and not, as frequently supposed, from vegetables <em>or</em> chemicals through a process of refining.", "explanation": null, "document": "DIET; A KEY TO HEALTH \u00a9 1983\nMILK\nA More Complete and Perfect Food Than Meat\nMilk is considered one of Nature's most perfect foods. It contains practically all the elements required by the economy of man to build bone, muscle, nerves, and brain; in sugar of milk are found the elements which furnish heat and energy sufficient to keep the human machine functioning. It is a far more complete food than meat. When meat is used as a basic food, it is necessary to combine with it other foods which contain the elements which meat does not have, such as the organic mineral elements, vitamins, and energy-creating material. It is also essential that fruits and vegetables be added to a meat diet in order that these may help eliminate the acids, toxins, and urates contained in the meats.\nBesides being an almost perfect food (lacking only in cellulose), milk is a remedial agent whose use alone has been the means of eliminating various ailments, particularly those caused by the toxins and acids with which the system has become filled by the use of too much meat and denatured foods.\nMilk contains the organic mineral elements and an abundance of the vitamins, both of which are essential to the normal health and growth of children; it is also the ideal basic diet for those who are suffering from \"deficiency\" or \"wasting\" diseases, but when prescribed for these ailments, the whole milk must be used as most of the vitamins are contained in the butterfat.\nThough a perfectly balanced food, milk alone is too concentrated to maintain health in grown people - cellulose is needed and eliminating agents; these are secured by the free use of vegetables, and of fruit between meals.\nTHE ORGANIC MINERAL ELEMENTS: These elements, termed cell salts, are tissue builders, tissue preservers, creators of vital energy, stimulators of the ductless glands, and the preventors of disorganization and putrefaction, in much the same manner as ordinary table salt - chloride of sodium - preserves meats and other foods.\nThese elements are found in abundance in many vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts, but are contained in their richest state in cow's and goat's milk. In countries where milk is unobtainable, fish, natural rice, soy beans, millet, barley, cocoanuts, etc., may be substituted. Although these substitute foods are rich in organic mineral elements, they cannot take the place of milk as a child's food and this is the reason why the death rate is usually extremely high among children who are deprived of milk. In a quality of milk there is found nearly one per cent of the organic mineral elements per hundred weight, in the form of calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, etc., cell salts required for the normal functioning of the body. Deformity in a young child or animal, except when caused by accident, indicates that during the period of gestation the mother subsisted on food deficient in these vital elements, this lack preventing the unborn body from developing harmoniously.\nIn the animal kingdom, the feeding of the female while with young, has almost reached a science, so that deformities seldom occur. There are of course exceptions and, setting aside accidents, these exceptions, despite the fact that the mother's food was rightly selected and combined, are due to the fact that the organic elements were not present in the food. This fault could be obviated if all feed were first analyzed.\nIn the human kingdom, man is as yet unenlightened or refuses to believe that diet is of supreme importance to human welfare - he is far more concerned with the appearance and taste of what he eats than with its relation to health, normal development of the body, spirituality, success, and happiness; therefore there are being born an increasing number of deficient and deformed children whose parents, otherwise enlightened and cultured, are ready to blame any and every cause for the tragedy, except the right one: food.\nThe organic mineral elements are rich in milk even when part or all of its cream has been removed, and in cases of weak bones, rickets, or non-development of the bony structure in children, a need for more than the usual amount of milk is indicated, and skim-milk is better than whole milk; when whole milk is give in large quantity in addition to other foods rich in fat, the system receives too much fat in proportion. Torpidity of the liver will result from this error, followed by indigestion, mal-assimilation, malnutrition, and other ailments thus offsetting all the benefit the milk can render. When milk is used as a basic food with but little else containing fat included in the diet (as, for example, a menu composed of milk, baked whole potatoes, or whole cereal bread with plenty of vegetables), then whole milk should be used. And right here enters a delicate and important dietetic question, one which frequently receives little or no attention and the result is that the science of diet has ben condemned. Too many who claim to understand dietetics, have made the mistake of prescribing whole milk in ample quantity and with other foods rich in fats, or of prescribing skim-milk without other basic foods rich in fat. In either case, results are disastrous, and the diet is condemned rather than the real cause - the food combinations.\nVery young children up to the age of two or three years, should be given entire fresh milk, reducing this whole milk with water to the strength desired. After that age, part of the butterfat may be removed and less water added - this, however, only in proportion as other foods containing fats are added to the skim-milk and vegetables.\nThere is no food substance known which is in any way better for a growing child than plenty of fresh milk with vegetables of almost all varieties. To this combination there should be gradually added whole-grain breads with butter, and whole baked potatoes, though these two starches should not be served at one meal. Serve milk, bread and butter, and vegetables at one meal; milk, baked potatoes and vegetables at the next. These foods supply all the vital mineral elements, material for nerve and brain development; growth proceeds normally, and it is practically impossible for mental or physical weaknesses to develop.\nThe ideal food for all normal children from the age of three to eighteen is in the various combinations of whole-grain bread in limited quantities, milk and butter, eggs and cheese, vegetables and fruits - all fruits being eaten between, never with, meals. Meat is unnecessary, undesirable, and to be included only when a need for stimulating food is indicated. Milk contains warmth and energy-creating material, protein and casein, which renew or build nerves and tissues, and the large percentage of cell salts vital for repair and equalization of the entire organism. Young animals fed on milk develop rapidly and normally, show strength and vitality; those fed on substitutes for milk, however perfect these substitutes appear to be, are usually more or less weak, sickly and in some manner undeveloped. However much we may dislike the idea and deny the fact, the human body is essentially an animal body and is governed by the one law which governs the growth of all the animal bodies.\nALBUMEN: This is an important food element contained in milk. It is called the muscle-builder, as from it the muscles of men and animals are built and kept in repair. It is in milk in the form of protein. Albumen is found also in the white of eggs and if the eggs are fertilized, it is even more vital and concentrated, provided the eggs are fresh.\nAlbumen, whether given to children, young animals, or grown people, should never be boiled. Heat coagulates it and may partly or totally destroy its value as a protein or albuminous food. A farmer who boiled or sterilized the milk intended for a calf would be adjudged more or less insane or wholly ignorant - not fit to be a farmer. An authority on this subject, H.N. Parker, has said: \"To obtain the required effect of pasteurizing, a temperature of 142 degrees Fahrenheit is required, and it varies between 135 and 150 degrees. If the milk contained tuberculosis germs, I should expect some of them to survive the process. The albumen in the milk would probably be partly coagulated.\" In other words, according to this authority - and his statements have been widely accepted - pasteurizing at this degree of heat would not kill all the tuberculosis germs and would partly or wholly destroy the food value of the milk, and, unquestionably, of the vitamins therein as well. The process therefore is proved to be useless and destructive.\nSUGAR: Mothers who have fed their babies on bottle milk are more or less familiar with sugar of milk. This sugar is obtained from the milk of cows and goats, and not, as frequently supposed, from vegetables or chemicals through a process of refining. Sugar of milk is one of the most desirable of all the energy-producing agents, because, like whole milk, it does not long remain in the stomach but mixes readily with water and albumen, and the system quickly absorbs it. In this respect it is radically different from all manufactured sugars which are only partly absorbed and are actually, in most cases, treated in the system as foreign substances.\nHoney, though a sugar, cannot be considered in the same list with the various refined sugars but is to be classified with sugar of milk. Among other mineral products it contains sulfur which is not a part of sugar of milk to any perceptible degree. In the restoration of youth and the change of the intestinal flora, sugar of milk and whey are much more valuable than gland transplantation, although being common substances and easily obtainable, they are ignored and refused the consideration they deserve.\nCASEIN\nThe Nerve and Brain Builder\nBecause casein has been classified with albumen found in milk, it has been considered mainly as a muscle builder, whereas it is a most important nerve and brain-builder. If the American people could be induced to accept this one fact and give to common cottage cheese the place on their daily menus which it deserves, it would be the direct agency of making them probably fifty per cent more efficient, and the stigma of our country being a \"nation of neurasthenics\" would soon be removed.\nCasein in the form of cottage cheese is easily digested and quickly and perfectly assimilated. It repairs and builds tissue, stimulates the cells of the body to greater activity and acts as a natural tonic without stimulation; to the nerves and brain it is a food beyond compare. In neurasthenia, anemia, nervous irritation, the debility present in organic and inorganic diseases, malnutrition, nervous disease, tuberculosis, rickets, pellagra, as a basic food for most chronic invalids as well as for elderly people, casein is a food-medicine. It is found in skim-milk and fresh uncreamed milk. Casein easily replaces all other forms of protein and this is the reason for its great value as a fundamental constructive agent in the diseases mentioned. It must, of course, be well combined with vegetables as it is low in vitamins because of the withdrawal of butterfat, the vitamin carrier, and the whey in which is found most of the organic mineral elements.\nBUTTERFAT: The fat of milk is a compound of many substances and forms, on an average, four per cent of the milk, if cows have been correctly fed. It is rich in carbon and hydrogen. As an energy producer it furnishes more than twice as much to the ounce as does sugar of milk. It is a food of great value to children and adults not only because of its energy-producing power in concentrated and easily digested form, but also because it is the carrier of an animal or vitalized vitamin which is found in sufficient abundance in no other fat; vegetable and nut fats contain it to a slight degree.\nButterfat is of greatest value when taken with milk before the cream has had time to separate itself. A chemical change takes place during this process, both in the milk and the cream, after which they no longer are the same as when they formed the primary natural mass. When milk and cream are separated and then remixed and given as a food, digestion is somewhat retarded, because the fat is then retained in the stomach with the casein, and the digestion is much slower. Due to this fact, it is best that fresh milk be served to children and invalids, and if it is still so fresh as to be warm from the cow, it is at its best for all cases in which vitality is extremely low. Babies and calves suckle warm milk from the mother's breast; Nature knows what is best for their normal development.\nMILK AND OTHER FATS: the difference between milk fat and other fats in their relation to the growth of the young and the health-controlling qualities in the case of adults, is due to the presence in the mild fat of a larger proportion of the elusive but active substances known as vitamins, as well as of a more abundant supply of organic mineral elements.\nPeanut oil, cocoa butter, and cocoanut oil, nut butters made from a combination of the fats of cocoanuts and other nuts, are valuable in the dietary. They are free from disease-creative constituents but are deficient in the important elements contained in milk fats and other fats, and become dangerous to health if wholly substituted for dairy butter in the dietary of children and invalids. These butter or fat substitutes, find their most important place when used in cooking and baking. Real butter should be served with breads, muffins, and potatoes. When it is impossible to obtain a sufficient amount of butterfat, the consequent shortage in vitamin and the organic mineral elements must be offset by the use of a greater amount of milk and a larger proportion of fresh vegetables and fruits; children should be served more tomato and fruit juices between meals. If milk and butter are entirely unobtainable, then animal fats and the richest kind of fish should be plentifully supplied as a basic food to old people, invalids, and even children; fish, especially, will help to make up the deficiency.\nMILK FOR THE HEALTHY: Many people have come to the conclusion that milk is valuable as a food only for the young, or as a food-medicine for invalids and those suffering from tuberculosis, anemia, neuritis, rheumatics, and for nervous wrecks and neurasthenics. This is erroneous. Milk is as valuable a basic food for the well as it is for the ill and on the family table readily takes the place of meat. As an example, let us consider the menu usually served for a family lunch: meat in some form, potato, bread and butter, a vegetable. The eaters would do well from every point of view if they would take instead: a glass or two of milk - instead of the meat, whole-grain bread, and butter, two or three vegetables. These combinations are identical with the meal based on meat save that the toxins and ureas found in meat are absent, and the meal more perfectly balanced. If soup is liked, a vegetable soup may be served first, and then the milk, potato or bread (not broth), and vegetables. The mistaken idea that milk is not solid or heavy for a basic food and that meat, being more substantial is needed, should be discarded. Milk, being coagulated by the digestive juices as a first process of digestion, is actually a more \"solid\" food than meat. The idea that milk is a \"light\" food is due to the fact that ignorance has always considered milk to be only a drink - a mere fluid - and not \"solid\" nourishment.\nMEAT SUBSTITUTES: From all that we have said the conclusion may be arrived at that it is always necessary to serve the whole milk if it is to be a complete substitute for meat. This is not entirely true. Skim-milk may readily and correctly be compared to the lean cuts of meat, while milk with all its cream is comparable to the richer cuts. The fat in milk is a more than desirable substitute for the fat in meat. On the other hand, skim-milk is a more than good substitute for lean meat because in it is found the organic mineral element which meat lacks. When skim-milk is used as a basic food, a fat must be supplied, but this is equally true when lean meats are served.\nIt is not necessarily true that milk must be taken as a drink in order to substitute it for meat. Many soups may be prepared with milk as a base but care should be taken that the milk is added just before serving; if it boils, the albumen is coagulated and over-heating might also destroy the vitamin though it would have little or no effect on the organic mineral elements.\nWhen skim-milk is used as a food without the addition of butterfat, then about a tablespoonful of some substitute - cocoanut butter or cocoanut oil, nut butter or other vegetable fat - should be added to a cup of milk to make up the deficiency.\nCHEESE: Cheese is one of the most perfect substitutes for meat and if a fairly good grade is selected, it contains between one-sixth and one-fourth of its weight in fat, and more than one-third of its weight in vital casein. It is well to use frequently a good cheese in place of meat or other meat substitutes. And, since cheese contains a fairly large proportion of fat, it is not necessary that fat of any nature be added at a meal, with the exception of butter for the bread or potatoes that are served also. Bread and butter, cheese and several creamed or fresh vegetables, form an ideal meal, a perfect combination of foods for the brain or sedentary worker. Those who are engaged in more strenuous labor may require the addition of heavier foods.\nA DESIRABLE HOME PRODUCT: In country districts, the value of cottage cheese as a good food is well recognized and the wise housewife is certain to use all surplus skim-milk for its production. The skim-milk is allowed to sour or clabber and then heated to body temperature until it separates from the whey; it is drained, salted to taste, and softened with a little sweet milk or cream. It can be spread on bread in place of butter. Some add a good honey. This is a delicious combination and a splendid nerve builder. Children naturally prefer it to other foods and it should always be served in place of cake made from denatured flour, refined sugars, irritating spices. If this truth about cottage cheese were more generally known and observed, the United States would not be accursed as now with an average of four million defective children.\nSince cottage cheese contains about one-third pure casein, acid fruits should not be served with it. Acid, of whatever nature, affects the albumen and casein, destroying at least in part the nerve-and-brain-building qualities even though already coagulated in cottage cheese. This is true with all milk products. Many of the world's greatest physicians and chemists recognize and warn against combining acid fruits with preparations mostly composed of albumens and casein.\nBUTTERMILK: Many have the mistaken idea that buttermilk is not a food but a more or less refreshing \"drink.\" buttermilk differs but slightly from skim-milk. It has undergone a chemical change in which lactic acid is a product, and it contains a somewhat greater proportion of butterfat.\nThe casein content of the buttermilk does not vary greatly from that found in skim-milk; the amount of organic mineral elements is about the same; therefore, practically in all respects it is just as valuable as a food, is more readily accepted by some stomachs than skim-milk, and, due to the greater neutralizing qualities of the lactic acid not present in skim-milk, is more desirable in the treatment of some ailments. In malnutrition, tuberculosis, intestinal affectons and especially toxo-absorption, if skim-milk is not easily accepted by the digestive organism, buttermilk is the ideal food-drink.\nButtermilk is frequently of great benefit to invalids, elderly people and children above the age of six months. It should be served between meals or as a meal in combination with baked potatoes of whole-grain bread and fresh vegetables. (When given to children of tender age, the baby's bottle should be thoroughly cleansed after its use, so as to avoid all possibility of souring the fresh milk at the next feeding.)\nWHEY: By-product of cottage cheese. When correctly used, it quickly changes the intestinal flora, destroys noxious germ life in the intestinal canal, and is abundantly supplied with mineral elements.\nFOOD VALUE: One quart of fresh milk containing all its native butterfat, is equal in food value to any one of the following:\nThree-fourths pound of beef\nOne-half to three-fourths pound of fowl\nOne-half pound of nuts\nOne pound of peas, beans , or lentils\nIt is to be noted that the food-value difference in beef and fowl cannot be precisely estimated since they lack the organic mineral elements and vitamins. Eggs, peas, beans and lentils contain these elements but they are not as easily digested not as readily assimilated. The vital value of a quart of good milk may be estimated to equal that of one pound of the best beef.\nCOTTAGE CHEESE\nAs already stated, cottage cheese is almost a pure casein and is rich in all the essential elements such as the organic mineral elements and vitamins.

It contains practically all the elements required by the economy of man to build bone, muscle, nerves, and brain; in sugar of milk are found the elements which furnish heat and energy sufficient to keep the human machine functioning. It is a far more complete food than meat. When meat is used as a basic food, it is necessary to combine with it other foods which contain the elements which meat does not have, such as the organic mineral elements, vitamins, and energy-creating material. It is also essential that fruits and vegetables be added to a meat diet in order that these may help eliminate the acids, toxins, and urates contained in the meats.\nBesides being an almost perfect food (lacking only in cellulose), milk is a remedial agent whose use alone has been the means of eliminating various ailments, particularly those caused by the toxins and acids with which the system has become filled by the use of too much meat and denatured foods.\nMilk contains the organic mineral elements and an abundance of the vitamins, both of which are essential to the normal health and growth of children; it is also the ideal basic diet for those who are suffering from \"deficiency\" or \"wasting\" diseases, but when prescribed for these ailments, the whole milk must be used as most of the vitamins are contained in the butterfat.\nThough a perfectly balanced food, milk alone is too concentrated to maintain health in grown people - cellulose is needed and eliminating agents; these are secured by the free use of vegetables, and of fruit between meals.\nTHE ORGANIC MINERAL ELEMENTS: These elements, termed cell salts, are tissue builders, tissue preservers, creators of vital energy, stimulators of the ductless glands, and the preventors of disorganization and putrefaction, in much the same manner as ordinary table salt - chloride of sodium - preserves meats and other foods.\nThese elements are found in abundance in many vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts, but are contained in their richest state in cow's and goat's milk. In countries where milk is unobtainable, fish, natural rice, soy beans, millet, barley, cocoanuts, etc., may be substituted. Although these substitute foods are rich in organic mineral elements, they cannot take the place of milk as a child's food and this is the reason why the death rate is usually extremely high among children who are deprived of milk. In a quality of milk there is found nearly one per cent of the organic mineral elements per hundred weight, in the form of calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, etc., cell salts required for the normal functioning of the body. Deformity in a young child or animal, except when caused by accident, indicates that during the period of gestation the mother subsisted on food deficient in these vital elements, this lack preventing the unborn body from developing harmoniously.\nIn the animal kingdom, the feeding of the female while with young, has almost reached a science, so that deformities seldom occur. There are of course exceptions and, setting aside accidents, these exceptions, despite the fact that the mother's food was rightly selected and combined, are due to the fact that the organic elements were not present in the food. This fault could be obviated if all feed were first analyzed.\nIn the human kingdom, man is as yet unenlightened or refuses to believe that diet is of supreme importance to human welfare - he is far more concerned with the appearance and taste of what he eats than with its relation to health, normal development of the body, spirituality, success, and happiness; therefore there are being born an increasing number of deficient and deformed children whose parents, otherwise enlightened and cultured, are ready to blame any and every cause for the tragedy, except the right one: food.\nThe organic mineral elements are rich in milk even when part or all of its cream has been removed, and in cases of weak bones, rickets, or non-development of the bony structure in children, a need for more than the usual amount of milk is indicated, and skim-milk is better than whole milk; when whole milk is give in large quantity in addition to other foods rich in fat, the system receives too much fat in proportion. Torpidity of the liver will result from this error, followed by indigestion, mal-assimilation, malnutrition, and other ailments thus offsetting all the benefit the milk can render. When milk is used as a basic food with but little else containing fat included in the diet (as, for example, a menu composed of milk, baked whole potatoes, or whole cereal bread with plenty of vegetables), then whole milk should be used. And right here enters a delicate and important dietetic question, one which frequently receives little or no attention and the result is that the science of diet has ben condemned. Too many who claim to understand dietetics, have made the mistake of prescribing whole milk in ample quantity and with other foods rich in fats, or of prescribing skim-milk without other basic foods rich in fat. In either case, results are disastrous, and the diet is condemned rather than the real cause - the food combinations.\nVery young children up to the age of two or three years, should be given entire fresh milk, reducing this whole milk with water to the strength desired. After that age, part of the butterfat may be removed and less water added - this, however, only in proportion as other foods containing fats are added to the skim-milk and vegetables.\nThere is no food substance known which is in any way better for a growing child than plenty of fresh milk with vegetables of almost all varieties. To this combination there should be gradually added whole-grain breads with butter, and whole baked potatoes, though these two starches should not be served at one meal. Serve milk, bread and butter, and vegetables at one meal; milk, baked potatoes and vegetables at the next. These foods supply all the vital mineral elements, material for nerve and brain development; growth proceeds normally, and it is practically impossible for mental or physical weaknesses to develop.\nThe ideal food for all normal children from the age of three to eighteen is in the various combinations of whole-grain bread in limited quantities, milk and butter, eggs and cheese, vegetables and fruits - all fruits being eaten between, never with, meals. Meat is unnecessary, undesirable, and to be included only when a need for stimulating food is indicated. Milk contains warmth and energy-creating material, protein and casein, which renew or build nerves and tissues, and the large percentage of cell salts vital for repair and equalization of the entire organism. Young animals fed on milk develop rapidly and normally, show strength and vitality; those fed on substitutes for milk, however perfect these substitutes appear to be, are usually more or less weak, sickly and in some manner undeveloped. However much we may dislike the idea and deny the fact, the human body is essentially an animal body and is governed by the one law which governs the growth of all the animal bodies.\nALBUMEN: This is an important food element contained in milk. It is called the muscle-builder, as from it the muscles of men and animals are built and kept in repair. It is in milk in the form of protein. Albumen is found also in the white of eggs and if the eggs are fertilized, it is even more vital and concentrated, provided the eggs are fresh.\nAlbumen, whether given to children, young animals, or grown people, should never be boiled. Heat coagulates it and may partly or totally destroy its value as a protein or albuminous food. A farmer who boiled or sterilized the milk intended for a calf would be adjudged more or less insane or wholly ignorant - not fit to be a farmer. An authority on this subject, H.N. Parker, has said: \"To obtain the required effect of pasteurizing, a temperature of 142 degrees Fahrenheit is required, and it varies between 135 and 150 degrees. If the milk contained tuberculosis germs, I should expect some of them to survive the process. The albumen in the milk would probably be partly coagulated.\" In other words, according to this authority - and his statements have been widely accepted - pasteurizing at this degree of heat would not kill all the tuberculosis germs and would partly or wholly destroy the food value of the milk, and, unquestionably, of the vitamins therein as well. The process therefore is proved to be useless and destructive.\nSUGAR: Mothers who have fed their babies on bottle milk are more or less familiar with sugar of milk. This sugar is obtained from the milk of cows and goats, and not, as frequently supposed, from vegetables or chemicals through a process of refining. Sugar of milk is one of the most desirable of all the energy-producing agents, because, like whole milk, it does not long remain in the stomach but mixes readily with water and albumen, and the system quickly absorbs it. In this respect it is radically different from all manufactured sugars which are only partly absorbed and are actually, in most cases, treated in the system as foreign substances.\nHoney, though a sugar, cannot be considered in the same list with the various refined sugars but is to be classified with sugar of milk. Among other mineral products it contains sulfur which is not a part of sugar of milk to any perceptible degree. In the restoration of youth and the change of the intestinal flora, sugar of milk and whey are much more valuable than gland transplantation, although being common substances and easily obtainable, they are ignored and refused the consideration they deserve.\nCASEIN\nThe Nerve and Brain Builder\nBecause casein has been classified with albumen found in milk, it has been considered mainly as a muscle builder, whereas it is a most important nerve and brain-builder. If the American people could be induced to accept this one fact and give to common cottage cheese the place on their daily menus which it deserves, it would be the direct agency of making them probably fifty per cent more efficient, and the stigma of our country being a \"nation of neurasthenics\" would soon be removed.\nCasein in the form of cottage cheese is easily digested and quickly and perfectly assimilated. It repairs and builds tissue, stimulates the cells of the body to greater activity and acts as a natural tonic without stimulation; to the nerves and brain it is a food beyond compare. In neurasthenia, anemia, nervous irritation, the debility present in organic and inorganic diseases, malnutrition, nervous disease, tuberculosis, rickets, pellagra, as a basic food for most chronic invalids as well as for elderly people, casein is a food-medicine. It is found in skim-milk and fresh uncreamed milk. Casein easily replaces all other forms of protein and this is the reason for its great value as a fundamental constructive agent in the diseases mentioned. It must, of course, be well combined with vegetables as it is low in vitamins because of the withdrawal of butterfat, the vitamin carrier, and the whey in which is found most of the organic mineral elements.\nBUTTERFAT: The fat of milk is a compound of many substances and forms, on an average, four per cent of the milk, if cows have been correctly fed. It is rich in carbon and hydrogen. As an energy producer it furnishes more than twice as much to the ounce as does sugar of milk. It is a food of great value to children and adults not only because of its energy-producing power in concentrated and easily digested form, but also because it is the carrier of an animal or vitalized vitamin which is found in sufficient abundance in no other fat; vegetable and nut fats contain it to a slight degree.\nButterfat is of greatest value when taken with milk before the cream has had time to separate itself. A chemical change takes place during this process, both in the milk and the cream, after which they no longer are the same as when they formed the primary natural mass. When milk and cream are separated and then remixed and given as a food, digestion is somewhat retarded, because the fat is then retained in the stomach with the casein, and the digestion is much slower. Due to this fact, it is best that fresh milk be served to children and invalids, and if it is still so fresh as to be warm from the cow, it is at its best for all cases in which vitality is extremely low. Babies and calves suckle warm milk from the mother's breast; Nature knows what is best for their normal development.\nMILK AND OTHER FATS: the difference between milk fat and other fats in their relation to the growth of the young and the health-controlling qualities in the case of adults, is due to the presence in the mild fat of a larger proportion of the elusive but active substances known as vitamins, as well as of a more abundant supply of organic mineral elements.\nPeanut oil, cocoa butter, and cocoanut oil, nut butters made from a combination of the fats of cocoanuts and other nuts, are valuable in the dietary. They are free from disease-creative constituents but are deficient in the important elements contained in milk fats and other fats, and become dangerous to health if wholly substituted for dairy butter in the dietary of children and invalids. These butter or fat substitutes, find their most important place when used in cooking and baking. Real butter should be served with breads, muffins, and potatoes. When it is impossible to obtain a sufficient amount of butterfat, the consequent shortage in vitamin and the organic mineral elements must be offset by the use of a greater amount of milk and a larger proportion of fresh vegetables and fruits; children should be served more tomato and fruit juices between meals. If milk and butter are entirely unobtainable, then animal fats and the richest kind of fish should be plentifully supplied as a basic food to old people, invalids, and even children; fish, especially, will help to make up the deficiency.\nMILK FOR THE HEALTHY: Many people have come to the conclusion that milk is valuable as a food only for the young, or as a food-medicine for invalids and those suffering from tuberculosis, anemia, neuritis, rheumatics, and for nervous wrecks and neurasthenics. This is erroneous. Milk is as valuable a basic food for the well as it is for the ill and on the family table readily takes the place of meat. As an example, let us consider the menu usually served for a family lunch: meat in some form, potato, bread and butter, a vegetable. The eaters would do well from every point of view if they would take instead: a glass or two of milk - instead of the meat, whole-grain bread, and butter, two or three vegetables. These combinations are identical with the meal based on meat save that the toxins and ureas found in meat are absent, and the meal more perfectly balanced. If soup is liked, a vegetable soup may be served first, and then the milk, potato or bread (not broth), and vegetables. The mistaken idea that milk is not solid or heavy for a basic food and that meat, being more substantial is needed, should be discarded. Milk, being coagulated by the digestive juices as a first process of digestion, is actually a more \"solid\" food than meat. The idea that milk is a \"light\" food is due to the fact that ignorance has always considered milk to be only a drink - a mere fluid - and not \"solid\" nourishment.\nMEAT SUBSTITUTES: From all that we have said the conclusion may be arrived at that it is always necessary to serve the whole milk if it is to be a complete substitute for meat. This is not entirely true. Skim-milk may readily and correctly be compared to the lean cuts of meat, while milk with all its cream is comparable to the richer cuts. The fat in milk is a more than desirable substitute for the fat in meat. On the other hand, skim-milk is a more than good substitute for lean meat because in it is found the organic mineral element which meat lacks. When skim-milk is used as a basic food, a fat must be supplied, but this is equally true when lean meats are served.\nIt is not necessarily true that milk must be taken as a drink in order to substitute it for meat. Many soups may be prepared with milk as a base but care should be taken that the milk is added just before serving; if it boils, the albumen is coagulated and over-heating might also destroy the vitamin though it would have little or no effect on the organic mineral elements.\nWhen skim-milk is used as a food without the addition of butterfat, then about a tablespoonful of some substitute - cocoanut butter or cocoanut oil, nut butter or other vegetable fat - should be added to a cup of milk to make up the deficiency.\nCHEESE: Cheese is one of the most perfect substitutes for meat and if a fairly good grade is selected, it contains between one-sixth and one-fourth of its weight in fat, and more than one-third of its weight in vital casein. It is well to use frequently a good cheese in place of meat or other meat substitutes. And, since cheese contains a fairly large proportion of fat, it is not necessary that fat of any nature be added at a meal, with the exception of butter for the bread or potatoes that are served also. Bread and butter, cheese and several creamed or fresh vegetables, form an ideal meal, a perfect combination of foods for the brain or sedentary worker. Those who are engaged in more strenuous labor may require the addition of heavier foods.\nA DESIRABLE HOME PRODUCT: In country districts, the value of cottage cheese as a good food is well recognized and the wise housewife is certain to use all surplus skim-milk for its production. The skim-milk is allowed to sour or clabber and then heated to body temperature until it separates from the whey; it is drained, salted to taste, and softened with a little sweet milk or cream. It can be spread on bread in place of butter. Some add a good honey. This is a delicious combination and a splendid nerve builder. Children naturally prefer it to other foods and it should always be served in place of cake made from denatured flour, refined sugars, irritating spices. If this truth about cottage cheese were more generally known and observed, the United States would not be accursed as now with an average of four million defective children.\nSince cottage cheese contains about one-third pure casein, acid fruits should not be served with it. Acid, of whatever nature, affects the albumen and casein, destroying at least in part the nerve-and-brain-building qualities even though already coagulated in cottage cheese. This is true with all milk products. Many of the world's greatest physicians and chemists recognize and warn against combining acid fruits with preparations mostly composed of albumens and casein.\nBUTTERMILK: Many have the mistaken idea that buttermilk is not a food but a more or less refreshing \"drink.\" buttermilk differs but slightly from skim-milk. It has undergone a chemical change in which lactic acid is a product, and it contains a somewhat greater proportion of butterfat.\nThe casein content of the buttermilk does not vary greatly from that found in skim-milk; the amount of organic mineral elements is about the same; therefore, practically in all respects it is just as valuable as a food, is more readily accepted by some stomachs than skim-milk, and, due to the greater neutralizing qualities of the lactic acid not present in skim-milk, is more desirable in the treatment of some ailments. In malnutrition, tuberculosis, intestinal affectons and especially toxo-absorption, if skim-milk is not easily accepted by the digestive organism, buttermilk is the ideal food-drink.\nButtermilk is frequently of great benefit to invalids, elderly people and children above the age of six months. It should be served between meals or as a meal in combination with baked potatoes of whole-grain bread and fresh vegetables. (When given to children of tender age, the baby's bottle should be thoroughly cleansed after its use, so as to avoid all possibility of souring the fresh milk at the next feeding.)\nWHEY: By-product of cottage cheese. When correctly used, it quickly changes the intestinal flora, destroys noxious germ life in the intestinal canal, and is abundantly supplied with mineral elements.\nFOOD VALUE: One quart of fresh milk containing all its native butterfat, is equal in food value to any one of the following:\nThree-fourths pound of beef\nOne-half to three-fourths pound of fowl\nOne-half pound of nuts\nOne pound of peas, beans , or lentils\nIt is to be noted that the food-value difference in beef and fowl cannot be precisely estimated since they lack the organic mineral elements and vitamins. Eggs, peas, beans and lentils contain these elements but they are not as easily digested not as readily assimilated. The vital value of a quart of good milk may be estimated to equal that of one pound of the best beef.\nCOTTAGE CHEESE\nAs already stated, cottage cheese is almost a pure casein and is rich in all the essential elements such as the organic mineral elements and vitamins. It contains no toxins or ureas. It is a blood, nerve and muscle-builder, and regulator of bodily functions. One pound of cottage cheese is equal to one pound of beef, pork, lamb, veal, game, or fowl. Fat is absent but this is readily supplied by additional butter or cream, or in soups served with it. Cottage cheese costs less than one-half the price charged for meats and, considering its food value, would be cheap if three or four times the price of meat were charged for it. There is not one objection to it as a food for everyone, beginning with the child of ten months or a year to the very aged.\nMILK AND THE IDIOSYNCRACIES OF SOME CHILDREN(1)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n(1) Many so-called milk idiosyncracies are due to the body's lack of lactase to digest lactose (the sugar of milk). Lactase can now be obtained from a Natrura physician for those with this problem.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nFOR EXAMPLE: \"I know of a child about one year old who seems to be poisoned whenever she takes cow's milk. A rash breaks out on her body, with itching, and she has gone into convulsions, even when milk was modified according to the prescribed formula.\"\nDespite the fact that there are occasional individual idiosyncracies like the above, milk is the natural food for babies and children. When mother's milk, which of course is best, is unavailable, goat's milk should be substituted; failing this, cow's is the next best. Whenever there is an indication that such substitution for mother's milk may cause trouble, care should be exercised to secure good milk from one goat or cow and use none but that.\nAt first glance, the above case may appear to be unusual but it is not - usually one or more such instances are met by every physician who treats children. The condition is not unknown in adults. Unless one has had experience with these cases, the conclusion is apt to be that the milk is a poison - or acts as such - and should be discarded. The real cause is seldom found in the milk, though occasionally a stomach is found which will not tolerate it and in which toleration cannot be established.\nMilk is a sub-acid food and if the system is in a sub-acid state then it is not acceptable and may not even be coagulated in the usual manner by the digestive juices, the digestion being so long delayed that it becomes almost like a poison. To overcome this, it is only necessary that a drink prepared from the juice of grapefruit or tomatoes - not oranges - be taken one-half hour before the milk, then the digestive juices will be prepared for it and it will be readily coagulated and digested.\nIn the majority of case, the system is super-acid and the degree of reaction is in proportion to the acidity. Sometimes the milk at first induces a feverish condition followed by a rash, and if its use is continued the symptoms are aggravated. At this point, the average person concludes that the milk is not a good food and discontinues its use. A physician who has had experience will know that instead of being a poison, the milk is actually acting beneficially for the patient. The symptoms of poisoning and fever with raising of temperature even to 103 degrees, indicate the normal action of the milk in neutralizing the bodily acids and toxins, eliminating the poisons which had resulted from this neutralization, and equalizing the vital forces. Therefore, if the milk is wisely continued for a sufficient length of time, the symptoms will gradually subside, rash disappear, temperature go to normal, and it will be found that toleration has been established. This is what took place: When first imbibed, because of the condition of the system, as stated, the milk was an opposing force. The acid present caused too rapid coagulation with excessively large lumps of curd; and this condition may be so severe as to cause gas and the distension of the stomach, which in turn induces fever and convulsions. As the milk is continued, it gradually counteracts the acid, establishing balance. However, it is not necessary that milk taken into a super-acid system induce this condition. A test may be made and the exact state of the system known. When super-acidity is indicated, a sub-acid fruit such as orange of pineapple, eaten half an hour previous to the milk, will in part counteract the extreme acidity. For children, the usual procedure is to give lime water directly or add it to the milk. The theory is the same.\nThe test referred to above is readily made by the use of litmus paper, first using the blue for saliva and urine. If the paper turns a decided red, acidity is present. In the case of a child, we proceed to reduce whole milk to almost the strength indicated by age and general condition, adding one or more tablespoons of lime water without the milk and an hour afterwards feed milk and lime water. Should the stomach still reject the milk, prepare barley water and to this add lime water and feed as usual. Then one-half hour before the next feeding give the lime water and when it is time for feeding, give the milk and lime water, This method, plus a little patience and common sense, will overcome the worst case.\nWhen children of one or more years of age cannot take milk, the procedure is more simple, fruit juices being used in the same manner as for adults.\nWhen there is no acid-reaction, the test should be made for sub-acidity. If this is indicated, a few drops of grapefruit, lemon or lime juice may be given in water half an hour before feeding time, then followed by the milk. Baked sour apples, tart berry juice, or the juice of other tart fruit may be used.\nIn some cases of milk intoleration the action of the liver may be at fault, being either sluggish or over-active. Whatever the cause, it must be found, removed or neutralized, and this being done there will be few cases of intoleration.\n"}, {"score": 1554.2511, "uuid": "89f9c1af-3e83-52cd-ad1e-df98a69c059c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1913wb-22-30804", "target_hostname": "www.yemoos.com", "target_uri": "http://www.yemoos.com/faqmothermilks.html", "page_rank": 1.2279752e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Yemoos Nourishing Cultures | FAQ: Fermenting Other <em>Milks</em>", "snippet": "Kefir grains love and thrive on raw <em>milk</em>, be it <em>cow</em> <em>or</em> <em>goat</em>.

Artificial\nsweeteners will not provide kefir with the calories or nutrients it needs to live. Lactose-free milk,\nsuch as Lactaid, contains the enzyme lactase to break the lactose sugars down into glucose and\ngalactose. These are simpler sugars that are easily digestible. Since the milk still contains sugar,\njust in a different form, our hypothesis \u00a0(since we haven't tested this ourselves yet) is that the milk\ngrains may be able to survive off this, though it is not suggested. It's not even necessary because\nkefir grains act much in the same way as the lactase put into Lactaid and other brands of\nlactose-free milk (and that is why kefir is so well tolerated by lactose intolerant individuals!).\nIs it easy to switch to another brand or % of milk?\nGrains usually have very little to no trouble adjusting to another type of milk of the same mammal -\nin other words, switching from cow whole milk to cow skim milk or simply to another brand is\nusually quite easy for the grains to do. There may be a small adjustment period, where you may\nnotice the consistency fluctuating, but usually they switch over just fine with no help needed.\nSwitching mammal to mammal (such as cow to goat) is usually almost just as well tolerated. It is\nmore likely you will see an adjustment period of a couple days - week, but in most cases it is able\nto still properly ferment it into kefir that you can drink. If the grains are really struggling, you can try\ngiving half of the milk its used to with half of the newer milk. In most cases you will see them\nhappily adapt. As a side note goats milk kefir is known to be thinner, due to the structure of the milk\n(the smaller fats and proteins involved), and not the fault of the grains. Goats yogurt is thinner too,\nbecause of this.\nCan you use kefir liquid as a starter (instead of the grains)?\nYes, kefir liquid contains billions of microscopic organisms that are effective at making a\nyogurt-like consistency out of milk when you stir in a tablespoon or two in a cup or two of milk and\nlet sit out or in the fridge for 24 hours. It will dilute and get weaker each time, so its best to start with\nfreshly made kefir (from kefir grains) each time for the freshest and safest ferment.\nWhat about raw milk?\nKefir grains love and thrive on raw milk, be it cow or goat. Raw milk is really the optimal way to\nconsume milk if you can find a reliable trusty-worthy local source. You will want to be sure that the\ncow is healthy and the owner is using sanitary methods to ensure your milk is safe. Besides the\nfact that it will most likely be coming from a cow that is not confined (thus less stress and other\nissues like growth hormones), raw milk is much healthier and some argue it tastes much better,\ntoo. It contains many more enzymes and natural healthy bacteria of its own, the proteins have not\nbeen cooked, and the fat has not been homogenized. These enzymes and bacteria are sensitive to\nheat and unfortunately destroyed during the pasturization process. Raw milk also has the cream\nwhich floats to the top and can be used to make butter, whip cream, cream cheese, sour cream,\netc.! Homogenization is used in manufacturing to break up the fat globules until they are very fine\nand unable to separate and rise to the top. This process uses a forceful spinning motion to break\nthe fat globules of milk by propelling them at high speeds against the sides of the container,\nbursting the globules into small pieces (like paint hitting a wall). How far pastuerization and\nhomogenization affect our health is a hot topic of debate and subject of much current research. As\nfar as we're concerned it only makes sense that milk in its natural form has more to offer and is\nsometimes better digested or tolerated. It also supports a more natural, sanitary and less\nstressful environment for the cow, the farmer and the world at large while promoting local foods\nand respect for and connection to the animals and their farms we consume from. We encourage\nyou to read more about raw milk safety and FAQ's at Raw Milk Facts.\nWhat milks or other liquids can you ferment with kefir grains?\nIts possible to ferment all forms of mammalian milk (mare, goat, sheep, cow, buffalo, camel etc).\nSome people with cancer have even experimented fermenting human milk as a medicinal therapy.\nYou can also try to ferment other non-milk mediums such as coconut milk, coconut water (also\ncalled juice), soy milk, rice milk, or almond milk. You can also convert them to be used in making\nwater kefir with sugar and water or juice and water. In this case you will have to convert the grains\ngradually and keep some on back-up in case they fail to thrive. Kefir can also in a pinch be made\nfrom re-hydrated dry milk, or UHT (ultra-pastuerized) milk, though they are not the best options for\ncontinued grain health.\nHow can you convert milk grains to kefir other liquids such as coconut or soy?\nConverting grains is a patient process of trial and error. It is best to mix the two mediums for\nawhile if possible, letting the grains get acquainted with the new liquid, while still having access to\nsome of its familiar liquid (for example, if you usually ferment with cows milk and want to switch to\nsoy, mix in half cows milk, half soy milk for a week or two). You can gradually taper the grains off of\ntheir previous medium and see if they continue to ferment and grow in their new one. Some grains\nwill just refuse to grow, but will still produce a kefired product. This is ok, just make sure that you\nhave some backup grains or even some that you are maintaining in a liquid that they do grow in. It\nis actually quite common for kefir grains to be able to produce a kefir, but are not able to grow and\nreproduce in it. It is also a good idea to sometimes 'refresh' your grains by giving them some good\nwhole fat milk every month or so just to increase the likelihood that they will maintain their strength\nand health in their other liquid (though this is not always necessary - some people have had great\nsuccess doing just purely soy etc - just watch your grains and adjust to their needs). If you need to\nhave the other liquid (rather than milk) and your grains seem to struggle, you will mostly likely have\nto keep a 'mother source' in the milk, creating new healthy grains that you can continuously use in\nthe new liquid and dispose of. This requires more work, but is an option if all else fails. You can\nalso use kefir (from kefir fermented in milk) instead of grains to ferment other liquids. Simply put in\nabout 10% kefir into the soy or other milk-alternative and let sit out for 12-24 hours at room\ntemperature. There are enough bacteria and yeast within kefir itself to properly ferment. We do not\nrecommend trying this with store-bought kefir, since it may not contain enough cultures to safely\nferment at room temperature.\nWhat can you do to encourage growth and proper fermenting in milk-alternatives?\nSometimes milk grains will take to another liquid, and sometimes they won't. If it looks like your\ngrains need a little encouragement, there are a few options. You can include a couple more\ningredients to help boost its health and growth, such as barley or rice malt extract (available from\nbrewing stores and sites), or a sweetener such as raw cane sugar (Rapunzel makes a nice one)\nor some fresh fruit juice from an acidic fruit (such as grape juice, apple juice, lemon orange or lime\njuice, tropical juices such as pineapple, kiwi, mango or papaya). You can also go with just adding\na little bit of milk (10%-50%) if that is not an issue. If the grains refuse to ferment in your\nmilk-alternative, then it may be best to continue to ferment your grains in their native milk, and then\nsimply take a spoonful or two of the finished kefir and add it to your milk-alternative. This finished\nkefir, even without the grains, is powerful enough to properly ferment. This way your grains\nthemselves are never in contact with your other liquid, and continue to grow and thrive in their milk,\nwhile at the same time producing a starter you can use in the other liquid. This means there would\nbe a minor amount of milk (5%-10%) in your milk-alternative kefir, but it is another option if that is\nnot an issue.\nCan you add other things in with kefir while its fermenting?\nYes, but experiment carefully as some things may hinder or even harm the grains (some foods\ncontain natural antibacterial properties, such as grapefruit). You can just as easily add the desired\ningredients or flavors after you have strained the grains out, and then let the kefir sit for 12-48\nhours before consuming. Adding mangos, vanilla beans or raspberries are some of our favorite\nsecondary ferment flavors!\n"}, {"score": 1552.8903, "uuid": "c0ef739c-1191-5471-9a4f-4d3411b0dd2b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-59-20763", "target_hostname": "www.harvesthaven.com", "target_uri": "http://www.harvesthaven.com/newsandarticles/articles/rawmilk.html", "page_rank": 1.1756776e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Harvest Haven Health - Raw <em>Milk</em> Myths", "snippet": "Therefore, 7) your food \u201cchoices\u201d affect me negatively, and 8) regulation <em>is</em> the government\u2019s job. 1) Raw <em>milk</em> <em>is</em> <em>milk</em> from <em>cows</em>, sheep, <em>or</em> <em>goats</em> that has not been pasteurized \u00e2\u0080\u0093 True. 2) To kill harmful bacteria \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Pasteurization does not kill all the harmful bacteria. \u201cThis <em>is</em> a common misconception", "explanation": null, "document": "Subscribe\nRaw Milk Myths\nWe received this response to the Harvest Haven Bulletin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Food Freedom Follow-up. There is much misinformation circulating about the \u201cdangers\u201d of raw milk. Marilyn\u2019s letter addresses those concerns with the facts and first hand experience.\nHi Cheryl,\nWhile you have given us your opinion about raw milk, I will give you the facts. I am addressing a number of the statements you make in your letter because you have been misinformed.\nI have numbered the points within your letter, then answered them below:\nYour letter:\n1) Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized 2) to kill harmful bacteria. 3) This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria, 4) which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses.\n5) These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.\n6) The result of these illness, rare or not, is an increased burden on our health care system, meaning more $$$$ in taxes. Therefore, 7) your food \u201cchoices\u201d affect me negatively, and 8) regulation is the government\u2019s job.\nRegards,\nCheryl\nMy answer for each point:\n1) Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized \u00e2\u0080\u0093 True.\n2) To kill harmful bacteria \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Pasteurization does not kill all the harmful bacteria. \u201cThis is a common misconception. Scientific studies have shown that pasteurization does NOT inactivate the shiga toxins released by e.coli O157:H7 (the toxin that killed people in Walkerton). Furthermore, other bacteria that are implicated in Crohn\u2019s disease also survive pasteurization.\u201d ( source )\n3) This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria, - Not if it has been properly collected from cows fed organic grass and a minimum of grain. \u201cGrass-fed milk has natural antibiotic properties that help protect it (and those lucky enough to drink it) from pathogenic bacteria.\u201d ( source )\nWhat about the increased use of antibiotics in conventional dairies and the risk of antibiotic resistance? Over 80% of all antibiotics are used in the raising of factory farmed animals. A significant portion of this percentage is used in conventional dairies because the living conditions of the cows are so unhealthy. Because of unhealthy animals and less than sanitary conditions, pasteurization is required to deal with the product from these conventional dairies.\n4) Which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 These pathogens do cause illnesses, but raw milk has seldom, if ever, been the carrier. This past summer there were the deaths and illnesses caused by cantaloupes from a contaminated warehouse in Colorado, but it is not illegal to buy cantaloupes. There was the serious problem with Listeria at the Maple Leaf processing plant that cost millions, but it\u2019s not illegal to eat the mystery meat produced there. Even though the consumption of such processed meats causes many health problems, it\u2019s not illegal to buy it.\n5) These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems \u00e2\u0080\u0093 There has been no documented evidence of this. Most information points to the benefits of raw milk for everyone, especially children. The US Center for Disease Control had to \u201cadmit earlier this year, after being pressed and warned of a potential Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request if it failed to comply, that not a single person has died from raw milk consumption in over a decade.\u201d\nLearn more: CDC Admits Not a Single Person Has Died from Consuming Raw Milk Products in 11 Years\nAnd:\nThe Power of Numbers in the War Over Raw Dairy\u00e2\u0080\u0094How the CDC Came to Admit a Death Wasn\u2019t Categorized Correctly\n6) The result of these illness, rare or not, is an increased burden on our health care system, meaning more $$$$ in taxes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 With next to no illnesses and virtually no deaths from raw dairy consumption, but scores of sick people from legally mass-produced ground turkey, peanut butter, eggs, and leafy greens \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not to mention alcohol, trans fats, tobacco, and the like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who is placing the true financial burden on the health care system? These products have been proven hazardous to health, yet they are all legal.\n7) Therefore, your food \u201cchoices\u201d affect me negatively \u00e2\u0080\u0093 The truth is that the consumption of raw dairy products is beneficial to health and, therefore, affects you positively because there is a reduction of the burden on the health care system. \u201cUnheated milk contains its full complement of enzymes and lactase-producing bacteria needed by our bodies to break down and assimilate the milk sugar lactose. These helpful bacteria are killed in the pasteurization/homogenization process.\u201d ( source )\nHomogenization is another serious problem of pasteurized milk. \u201cWhile research supporting the causal relationship between XO and hardening of the arteries is not clear-cut, one matter stands true: homogenization facilitates the entry of milk fat directly into the bloodstream that would otherwise be subjected to the digestive process in the GI tract.\u201d\nRead more about how serious that problem is:\nIs Homogenized Milk Better or Worse for You?\nOur choices do affect everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going to McDonalds, smoking, or buying a freezer full of processed meals costs all of us, as people get sicker and sicker. But it is not illegal to do these things.\n8) Regulation is the government\u2019s job \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Raw milk advocates welcome regulation... just not mandatory pasteurization. In Quebec it has been legal to sell raw milk cheeses since 2008. \u201cThe province's change is accompanied by strict new rules to ensure the safety of the raw-milk cheeses, including monthly quality checks of producers' milk and veterinary inspections of cattle herds.\u201d Read more: Quebec to allow raw-milk cheeses .\nI\u2019m not talking about everyone being forced to buy raw milk, but giving those who understand the advantages of raw milk the freedom to eat this proven wholesome wonder food, backed by a tremendous track record going back to the days of \"the land of milk and honey\" and beyond.\n\u00c2\nIf others want to buy milk from cows raised in unsanitary factory conditions, they can continue to support such operations. However, let it be known that they shouldn\u2019t be permitted to do so.\nWhy?\nOne, factory farming isn\u2019t humane to the animals.\nTwo, factory farm milk production necessitates the use of copious amounts of antibiotics. The consumer ingests these antibiotics with the milk, which makes the use of antibiotics to treat human illnesses ineffective and contributes to the evolution of superbugs, against which there are no antibiotics.\nThree, not only does heat treating (pasteurization) kill only some of the pathogens that get into milk, it kills the beneficial bacteria naturally inherent in milk to help the consumer digest it. Lactose intolerance is often a problem not with the consumer, but with the product. We have personally witnessed this for ourselves.\nFour, because of homogenization and pasteurization of milk and the proven substantial ill effects on consumers, a needless and not insignificant burden is laid upon the taxpayer in health care costs.\nA sixteen-year old girl wrote an interesting essay about the issues of raw milk. It is a good read:\nI include below a letter from another woman who had something to say about this most recent mail-out.\nIf you have any more questions or comments, please let me know.

In Germany they have had a voluntary set of raw milk certification regulations, and voluntary testing, and have not had a single illness in 100 years...now that is food safety.\u00a0 Compare that to approximately 11 million cases of food-borne illnesses reported annually in Canada and you can see where extra healthcare tax dollars are actually spent...cleaning up after industrialized foods is what I see.\u00a0 I trust the people at the farms I support far more than I trust Corporations or Government standards and inspections.\nHope this provides a bit of info you can pass on to support raw milk availability.\u00a0 Let me know if you need some other info and maybe we can help you more.\nSharlene\u2019s letter to the Premier of Ontario, Dalton McGuinty:\nDear Dalton McGuinty,\nI write to you today, one individual to another, requesting that you take mercy on Michael Schmidt and grant his request for a meeting.\u00c2\u00a0 It is such a simple thing to do, to change the course of a man\u2019s life.\u00c2\u00a0 He is starving just to have an hour of your time.\nI write to you today, one parent to another, that I was suffering and worried for my children\u2019s health.\u00c2\u00a0 No Medical Doctor could help me.\u00c2\u00a0 My children refused to eat, and when they did eat it was very limited foods.\u00c2\u00a0 They were in a category that the Medical Community could call \u201cfailure to thrive\u201d, meaning they were not gaining weight as they should, and the cause was unknown.\u00c2\u00a0 Neither of my sons\u00c2\u00a0 are able to digest pasteurized milk, and soy was not possible either.\u00c2\u00a0 My second son was also sensitive (much digestive upset) to other foods like wheat, corn, potatoes, squash, just to name a few.\u00c2\u00a0 I was at wits end trying to use pea protein shakes to up their protein and calorie intake.\u00c2\u00a0 I found out from a Naturopathic Doctor that my children were probably reacting to the protein in milk that is altered by modern pasteurization.\u00c2\u00a0 He said it would be quite easy if we were in France, where the Doctor was from, to access safe raw milk, which would most likely be tolerated well by my children.\u00c2\u00a0 While I had been trained in University (I actually have a degree in Nutrition and Dietetics from the University of Saskatchewan) that raw milk was dangerous, I began to research raw milk and weather it could be produced safely.\u00c2\u00a0 I found out that both my parents had been raised on raw milk on their family farms.\u00c2\u00a0 They, their families, and all their neighbours all drank raw milk and they were healthy and no one had ever been sick.\u00c2\u00a0 After months of research I was convinced, that scientifically speaking raw milk could be produced safely and I knew we had to try it (but only from a source I could trust).\u00c2\u00a0 I contacted Michael Schmidt, and told him my story.\u00c2\u00a0 He responded with love.\u00c2\u00a0 HE TOOK MERCY ON ME AND MY CHILDREN!\u00c2\u00a0 He allowed us to join his Farm-share, bypassing an estimated 300 family waiting list, so that my babies could be helped immediately!\u00c2\u00a0 From the first day they tasted it, it made an amazing impact and improved their health, even improved their appetite for other foods!\u00c2\u00a0 Today, they are happy healthy and THRIVING!!\u00c2\u00a0 We had gone for 6 months with no weight gain for my 2 yr old and in 18 months he has gained 10lbs.\u00c2\u00a0 When I used to pray for ounces in weight gain\u2026he now gains in pounds, and his little brother is right behind him!!\u00c2\u00a0 When all other foods had been rejected by choice or by the pain they caused, RAW MILK has always been accepted and relished, and has been the building block of strength and vitality for my family.\u00c2\u00a0 Please don\u2019t take away this vital food from them.\nPlease HAVE MERCY ON MICHAEL SCHMIDT AND MEET WITH HIM TO SAVE HIS LIFE, if for no other reason than that you know he has done this for my family and would do the same for yours or any other that needed him to.\nI have spoken today, one heart to another, please respond with you heart now and end this impass.\u00c2\u00a0 Please meet with Michael Schmidt.\nSincerely,\n"}, {"score": 1548.3309, "uuid": "586857e4-d586-5b36-97fd-1e6b540cf54e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-94-18159", "target_hostname": "westernstandard.blogs.com", "target_uri": "http://westernstandard.blogs.com/shotgun/2010/01/is-raw-milk-more-hazardous-than-tyranny.html", "page_rank": 1.1769667e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "The Shotgun: <em>Is</em> raw <em>milk</em> more hazardous than tyranny?", "snippet": "Open your own site if you don&#x27;t want to see my name, <em>or</em> <em>better</em> yet don&#x27;t read <em>what</em> i write, no one forces you to read, then respond.

This warning comes after the B.C. Centre for Disease Control tested and confirmed fecal contamination in raw milk products distributed recently in the Lower Mainland.\nKendall writes :\nThere have been several media stories over the past few weeks concerning \u201craw milk\u201d product consumption in British Columbia. The term \u201craw\u201d in this case refers to unpasteurized milk.\nBy law, all milk sold or distributed in B.C. must be pasteurized \u2013 a process that raises milk to temperatures high enough to kill harmful bacteria. This is not a new public health protection idea. Commercial pasteurization of milk was first introduced in 1895, after Louis Pasteur discovered that the process inactivated spoilage organisms.\nPasteurization of raw milk has prevented thousands of illnesses and deaths. It is one of the great advances in public health of the 20th century. It removes potentially harmful bacteria, while in no way compromising milk\u2019s nutritional qualities.\nThe BC Centre for Disease Control advised this week that it has tested and confirmed fecal contamination in raw milk products distributed recently in the Lower Mainland.\nAs part of an ongoing investigation by public health officials in Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health, the BCCDC Public Health Labs recently tested products from the Home on the Range raw dairy in Chilliwack , which distributes through a variety of outlets in the Lower Mainland. Products tested included unpasteurized raw milk, yogurt, cream, butter and cream cheese. Of these samples, five tested positive for fecal contamination.\nThe BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) is advising British Columbians to discard any unpasteurized dairy products from this dairy.\nThe sale of raw milk is illegal in Canada, something the Canadian Constitution Foundation is working hard to change.\u00a0In November 2009, the Western Standard reported that:\nAt a press conference at Queen\u2019s Park today, the Canadian Constitution Foundation (CCF) announced its support for a court case involving consumer choice, freedom of contract, and the right to earn an honest living free from government regulation that is arbitrary, unreasonable, unnecessary and unfair.\nThe case concerns Ontario dairy farmer Michael Schmidt, who has been providing unpasteurized milk to consumers for approximately 20 years without a single incident of illness attributable to milk borne germs.\nWhile the CCF is primarily concerned with defending consumer choice and free enterprise, the organization also notes medical research on the health benefits of unpasteurized milk:\nA study published in 2006 in the medical journal Clinical and Experimental Allergy demonstrated that raw milk has a beneficial effect on children\u2019s health. Scientists from prestigious American and European universities and children\u2019s hospitals studied 14,893 children aged 5\u201413 years. The children who consumed raw milk had a significantly reduced incidence of asthma and allergies, compared with those who drank pasteurized milk.\nKendall disagrees, and concludes his article with this statement:\nIt is important that all British Columbians be aware of the serious health risks associated with consuming unpasteurized milk. Any perceived health benefits of drinking raw milk are most certainly offset by the serious risks of contracting disease.\nThis may be true. But is the erosion of liberty as a result of the ban on the sale of raw milk offset by the disputed health benefits of pasteurization?\nPosted by Matthew Johnston\n"}, {"score": 1544.4487, "uuid": "c0c7ac92-8333-5e5e-a82a-3aee534e4d71", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0512wb-31-24377", "target_hostname": "www.keeperofthehome.org", "target_uri": "http://www.keeperofthehome.org/2009/10/raw-milk-substitute.html", "page_rank": 1.172687e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Raw <em>Milk</em> Substitute for Cultured Dairy Products", "snippet": "We have several dairy <em>goats</em> so are drinking raw <em>goat</em> <em>milk</em> for every thing, including our keifer .

Not sure I ever will be considering I can\u2019t get many things where I live, including raw milk. We sometimes can\u2019t even afford regular organic milk, especially when it comes to cheese, so sometimes my husband eats the regular stuff and my daughter gets the organic\u2026we do what we can but sometimes that can\u2019t even be done. Espeically with rising and rising and rising prices.\nI\u2019ve tried making yogurt a few times but haven\u2019t been successful at all. My family really doesn\u2019t like it (will not eat it, I end up hiding it in something which is not the point\u2026even in smoothies they can tell). I\u2019ve been hoping to try it again, but this time with a culture. I\u2019ve been doing it just with store bought yogurt as a starter. Is a culture what comes in a little box that you use instead of using a Tablespoon or two of plain yogurt? Would you recommend that place Cultures for Health for Canadians too? Or is there somewhere else? I found a culture, I think, at the local grocery store but it doesn\u2019t look like that good of a quality. My friend told me it did make her yogurt more like store-bought though. I\u2019d love to have my family not be able to really tell the difference since we eat a lot of store bought yogurt and it is pricey. I\u2019d love to be able to get a better quality food AND for cheaper\u2026.if possible I love it when that works out!\nReply\nJana February 2, 2011 at 7:48 pm\nHi Nola, I just wanted to say that we\u2019re in Canada too and I just ordered from Cultures for Health, and had no problem getting them to ship up here and it wasn\u2019t very expensive, as I recall. I ordered Kombucha and Kefir starters, so I\u2019m anxiously awaiting their arrival!\nAbout yogurt making, I think homemade yogurt is so much better tasting than anything you can buy in the store, but perhaps it\u2019s also in the method. I tried making it in the Crockpot a few times but after the first time, it never came out right so I gave that up and now I make it with a really simple method and it comes out super delicious every time. The first time I started with a high-quality organic store-bought plain yogurt (for the culture/starter), and then every time after I just make sure to save a 1/2 cup (per gallon of milk, this makes a gallon of yogurt) for the next batch. I find that adding too much culture/starter results in the yogurt not turning out well; less is better, as too much crowds the bacteria (something like that anyway).\nSo here\u2019s how I do it: I heat one gallon of organic whole milk in a stainless steel pot until it is scalded (skin on top and bubbling around the edges). Make sure you heat on medium to low heat to avoid burning the milk. Then I take it off the heat and cool it until I can comfortably stick my finger in it and hold it there (just warm). At this point, I mix the 1/2 cup culture/starter with one or two cups of the milk (dipped out into a small bowl), then pour the whole thing back into the pot of milk. I use my whisk to mix it really well. Now, I get my gallon glass jar ready (you can buy pickles at Costco and reuse the huge jar) by rinsing the inside and lid with just-boiled water. I dry it out carefully with a clean kitchen towel, then place it in the sink. I then carefully pour the milk into the jar. It may seem like it won\u2019t all fit but it will. I then screw the lid on tight and place the jar of milk on the lowest rack in my oven on a heating pad set on high. I close the door and let it be, undisturbed, for 12 hours. At this point I turn down the heating pad to low, then leave it for another 12 hours. In total, it should culture for 24 hours. After this I place it in the fridge to chill overnight or at least 8 hours. Now it is ready to eat! This method makes extremely delicious yogurt and after the lengthy culturing, it is virtually lactose-free. My whole family likes it very well. It may seem like a lot of steps but it\u2019s really not and you just forget about it in between steps. Also, I find that my husband really likes it when I serve it to him with blueberries and raw honey!\nI hear you about the rising and rising prices\u2026.I go to the store and something that was just such and such a price is now so much more all of a sudden! And no one ever explains why! It is tough, and very challenging. At least here in Canada we don\u2019t have the artificial growth hormones in our milk, so if you can\u2019t get organic, at least you aren\u2019t consuming something terrible. I feel like the milk here is somewhat more natural than the regular milk in the States, and I\u2019ve lived in both places. Making yogurt the way I do is really inexpensive, in the sense that you get a whole gallon of yogurt for the price of a gallon of milk, and where I am, a small container of organic yogurt costs so much, around $6 or $7! So making it yourself, you get 4x as much for just a dollar or two more, if you buy organic milk.\nHope this helps a bit. Good luck in all your endeavors! :)\nReply\nMelissa October 21, 2009 at 10:34 am\nIt surprises me that the WAP Foundation and Sally Fallon have given their okay to this. According to this article ( http://www.westonaprice.org/modernfood/dirty-secrets.html ) \u201cWhen they remove the fat to make reduced fat milks, they replace the fat with powdered milk concentrate, which is formed by high temperature spray drying. All reduced-fat milks have dried skim milk added to give them body, although this ingredient is not usually on the labels. The result is a very high-protein, lowfat product. Because the body uses up many nutrients to assimilate protein\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially the nutrients contained in animal fat\u00e2\u0080\u0094such doctored milk can quickly lead to nutrient deficiencies. \u201d\nI\u2019m blessed to be able to get raw milk for $6/gallon, so thankfully I don\u2019t have to worry about it. I\u2019m just curious about the seeming inconsistency.\nReply\nKika October 21, 2009 at 9:07 am\nIf you moved to a location where there was neither raw nor organic milk available, what would you use for your family?\nReply\nalexis October 21, 2009 at 8:54 am\nThanks for the tip\u2026very interesting. Raw milk isn\u2019t readily available to us, so I may try this.\nReply\nRenee October 21, 2009 at 7:16 am\nI searched for a low-pasteurized milk to culture my yogurt from Cultures for Health and thankfully found a great milk by Farmers\u2019 Creamery at our natural food store. It is a bit more expensive than all of the organic UHT milks but it is very worth it. It is non-homogenized as well! I love it.\nApril October 21, 2009 at 7:15 am\nStephanie,\nI have not tried culturing my dairy products (I\u2019m not quite there on the baby step trail!), but I wanted to let your readers know of a resource I thought they might find helpful. If you live in the Midwest United States and have access to a Hy-Vee grocery store, their store-brand organic milk is NON-homogenized, and is VAT pasteruized, which means it is heated to a lower temperature than conventional pasteurization, so it retains more of the enzymes than other milks. We cannot fit raw milk into our budget right now, but this is the closest thing we have been able to find in a store. It has the Hy-Vee label on it, but it is actually put out by Kalona Organics (www.kalonaorganics.com), so you might want to check and see if they sell it in your area as well. We love it!\nAmy @ Finer Things October 21, 2009 at 6:57 am\nYou need to move to Kansas, girl. ;-) I found a farm with raw milk a few months ago. We pay $3.50 per gallon. My kids love going to see \u201cour milk cows.\u201d\nReply\nChristy October 21, 2009 at 5:24 am\nStephanie, raw milk is illegal where we live. We purchase milk from a local farm that delivers. The farm though not certified organic, practices organically and allows their cows to graze all day, though they do provide some additional supplemental feed in the barns\u2013so not purely grass-fed but definitely healthier and humane. All their milk is delivered in glass bottles and we buy their cream top whole milk, which is unhomogenized. The price of a gallon of their milk is about the price of a gallon of organic milk in our stores, so it\u2019s quite reasonable.\nReply\nJenna October 21, 2009 at 4:42 am\nAh\u2026I know where you\u2019re coming from. We used to buy raw milk until we moved to the farm and now we are selling raw goat milk shares and soon cow. Ours is $8 a gallon which is a fortune to some people, but when you start feeding and caring for them (the animals) like I do, you realize that the cost isn\u2019t that great for everything that we as farmers put into it!!\nI wish you all success in your endevours to find a healthy and reasonable source for raw milk =)\nJenna\nReply\nJulie October 21, 2009 at 4:34 am\nOh, I love this post. We are VERY fortunate to be able to purchase raw milk at a farm just 6 miles from our home. (I actually found the farm by following a link you posted\u2014thank you!) And it\u2019s only $6/gallon.\nI also don\u2019t use it for making yogurt for cost reasons, so I love this suggestion.

He said to wrap it up in plastic wrap or better yet, wrap it up in the paper it was sold in, that is if you purchase a chunk of cheese and not a whole piece, and then wrap that up in plastic wrap.\nI have been using a Food Savor system at home and find my cheeses last much longer. It is a little bit more effort to take out the appliance but I am not throwing out as much cheese.\nearl le tissier said,\non January 14th, 2010 at 1:23 pm\nMay the rind of the P\u2019tit Basque cheese be eaten.

It doesn\u2019t taste that different from the cheese itself. It certainly doesn\u2019t taste like the icky rind on St. Andre et al.\nmarc said,\non May 30th, 2010 at 7:42 am\nAm American born from a French family. I was always chastised for not eating the rind\u2026until I asked my French cousins & a hotelier there\u2026 they don\u2019t eat it either although a majority of French probably do eat it. If you like the taste of the rind, then eat it and if you don\u2019t, then don\u2019t. Hard core cheesies may say you have to but its OK to ignore them.\nHi Marc, thanks for your input. Great advice! - RG\nrk said,\non December 12th, 2010 at 12:22 am\nLabel on Costco Petit Basque states that milk was pasteurized.\nYou are correct and thank you for pointing this out.

They work in harmony with each other and with other nutrients.\nSodium + Potassium\nA necessary and beneficial combination.\nSodium is healthy?\nChronic indigestion, intestinal irritation, constipation, ulcers and other stomach disorders as well as joint troubles such as arthritis, rheumatism and osteoporosis are often signs that the bio-organic sodium is deficient in the body. Reserve supplies of sodium are stored in joints, ligaments, and lymph fluid, but chiefly in the walls of the stomach and small bowel. This makes the tissues of the stomach highly alkaline, which is needed to withstand the hydrochloric acid normally produced in the stomach. If it were not for the presence of sodium, the stomach walls would be destroyed by the acid in these tissues.\nAcids are produced in the body through devitalized foods, stress, mental strain, etc. When this occurs sodium is withdrawn from the above mentioned sights to neutralize the acid. If we overdraw from the sodium reserve in the stomach it will be withdrawn from the joints and ligaments and they will suffer lack. This is because the blood, in attempt to maintain chemical balance, will borrow sodium, but calcium will remain in the joints causing pain and rigidness that is so evidently common today.\nRemember, bio-organic sodium is food sodium, not to be confused with table salt sodium, NaCl, which is processed at extreme heat using many chemical procedures, including bleaching, to get the finished product. The stomach, intestines, joints, and ligaments are sodium organs and are in constant need of food sodium.\nPotassium: necessary for a peak performance\nHeart irregularity, fatigue and immune deficiencies, along with acid alkaline imbalance may signal bio-organic potassium deficiencies. Potassium is primarily stored in the muscles (including the heart muscle). It\u0092s functions include neutralizing acid wastes and, with the help of sodium, controlling the acid alkaline balance in the muscles.\nPotassium and Sodium perform many of the same functions and are nearly always found together in the body. Second only to breathing and maintaining heartbeat the most important metabolic function our bodies perform is to maintain a specific pH. Electrolytes, chiefly sodium and potassium, keep the pH balance in our bodies nearly constant.\nQuestions and Answers:\nQ: What does the term \u0093trace minerals\u0094 or \u0093trace elements\u0094 mean?\nA: Minerals are divided into two groups. Macro minerals (sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, etc.) are needed in fairly large amounts. Micro, or trace, minerals (copper, zinc, manganese, vanadium, cobalt, molybdenum, etc.) are needed in very small amounts. Although minimal in size, trace minerals are a critical factor in maintaining a proper balance of health. Capra Mineral Whey contains an abundance of both macro and micro minerals.\nQ: Does Capra Mineral Whey have electrolytes? What do they do?\nA: Yes, the most plentiful mineral ingredients in Capra Mineral Whey are electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and phosphorus). Electrolytes are electrically charged ions, positive and negative, which are capable of conducting electricity in a liquid. They help maintain the membrane potentials of cells and are crucially involved in muscle function, high energy levels, heart activity, and the pH balance in the blood and tissues.\nQ: Are Capra Mineral Whey minerals helpful to enzymes in the body?\nA: Definitely! There are over 3,000 active enzymes in every cell of the body! An entire \u0093family\u0094 of enzymes are called metalloenzymes because one or more metallic minerals play an essential role in their function. For example, copper is a key element in many enzymes that build or tear down body tissue. Manganese is used by enzymes needed to utilize several vitamins. Zinc is used in over 80 enzymes that are needed by everyone.\nQ: Can I still take the product if I am lactose intolerant?\nA: Many people who are lactose intolerant enjoy taking Capra Mineral Whey. It is wise, with any medical condition, to consult your doctor before you begin using a new product.\nQ: Is there a \u0093best way\u0094 to take Capra Mineral Whey?\nA: Capra Mineral Whey is available in the capsule or powder form. We suggest five capsules three times per day or two tablespoons per day of the bulk powder. The most common way of taking the Capra Mineral Whey powder is mixing one tablespoon in a cup of warm water. Some customers like Capra Mineral Whey in vegetable juices like celery, beet, carrot, or tomato juice. Others enjoy adding it to tea, yogurt, soup, and casseroles, or sprinkling it on top of salads or fruit.\n"}]]}
