After four to five years of undergraduate coursework and more than a decade and a half of schooling altogether, it should only be pursued by individuals who place high value on education.\nThere are several different types of master's degrees; the Master of Science (MS), Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Business Administration (MBA) are the most common. More specialized degrees also exist, like the Master of Education and Master of Public Health. These degrees, along with the MS, MA and many MBA programs, take two years to complete. However, there are some accelerated one-year MBA programs that require a higher volume of courses, while others are part-time \u2013 often taken by busy professionals \u2013and usually last more than three years. In many cases, MBA programs require previous work experience as an admissions requirement. Students who wish to attain management-level jobs must first be familiar with how businesses operate. A professional degree, like an MBA, is supposed to supplements a student's firsthand experience, whereas an academic degree, like a Master of Arts, focuses on intellectual growth.\nStudents may also enroll in five-year joint bachelor's and master's degree programs. A Master of Accountancy is usually one extra year tacked onto a bachelor's degree, which gives the students the 150 credit hours needed before taking the CPA exam in most states. In 3-2 engineering programs, students are required to complete three years of undergraduate work and then transfer into a school of engineering. For example, students at Old Dominion University may complete Bachelor of Science followed by a Master of Engineering during a five year period. The University of Colorado offers a five year joint BA/MA in Cognitive Psychology five year joint BA/MA in Cognitive Psychology . And there are programs that last even longer. The University of Albany has complete seven-year programs that combine biology with optometry or dental school; both of which are taken at different universities.\nUltimately, the time it takes to complete a master's degree program depends on the subject area, school, whether it's full-time or part-time and the ability of the student to learn the information.\n"}, {"score": 3470.689, "uuid": "328132fc-6665-5225-9dce-469f1db3db3e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-29-15802", "target_hostname": "www.collegeonline.org", "target_uri": "http://www.collegeonline.org/library/choosing-degree/bachelors-degree.html", "page_rank": 1.1823541e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "What <em>is</em> <em>a</em> <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em>?", "snippet": "<em>A</em> <em>bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> <em>is</em> the most common of all college degrees.

It is usually obtained within a four-year period, and can usually be completed with 120 or more credit hours. In order for students to move to pursue a master's degree , they must have a bachelor's degree first. There are two basic categories of bachelor's degrees: the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science. The bachelor's degree programs can vary greatly, from education, journalism, and arts, to political science, criminal justice, and engineering. Additionally,\u00a0a bachelor's degree has more course requirements than an associate's degree. Some schools require bachelor's degree-seeking students to maintain a GPA of at least a 2.0 throughout the entire school career.\nHow Do Employers View Bachelor's Degrees?\nMany employers look for candidates who have received their bachelor's degree. Certain fields require this as minimum criteria just to apply for a certain position. Other careers such as doctors and lawyers require candidates to go on and receive their master's degree and/or doctorate in addition to a bachelor's degree. Statistically, people who have earned their bachelor's degree earn thousands of dollars more over the length of their careers than those who have not.\nTime to Complete a Bachelor's Degree Program\nWhile the standard length of time it takes to get the degree is about four years, it may take longer for some. Some people can be in school as long as six to seven years, depending on their personal circumstances, like working full-time or attending to family members. Ideally, four years is the standard length of time it takes to achieve this goal. Today's colleges offer up hundreds of different degree paths for bachelor's level students. Check into these and find out if your choice of degree is listed. This will also depend on the college or university that you choose as well.

The choice is a personal one and should be based on your individual background and future career plans. For example, if you want to work as a finance manager and already have a great deal of management training, you may be better off with a traditional master's program with a focus on finance. If, on the other hand, you haven't had any management training prior to attending graduate school, an MBA program with a focus on finance may be the right choice for you.\nReasons to Earn a Master's Degree\nThere are many different reasons to consider earning a master's degree in a business specialization. To start, this education track can open the door to better jobs and more earning potential. Individuals who hold a master's degree are eligible for different and more advanced employment opportunities than individuals with a bachelor's degree. They also tend to earn more on an annual basis.\nEarning a master's degree also allows you to immerse yourself in the study of a topic that interests you. Master's degree programs encourage research and hands-on experience so that students are prepared to apply newly acquired knowledge in the field.\nWhere to Earn a Master's Degree\nMaster's degrees are awarded by many different colleges and universities. The degree can typically be earned online or through an on-campus program. The number of classes or credit hours required to earn a master's degree can vary depending on the program of study.\nChoosing a Master's Degree Program\nFinding the right master's degree program can be a difficult.

When you look at the numerous programs across the country, there are many different structures for degree programs, and it all depends on the subject matter you\u2019re studying.\nWhen it comes to \u201cprofessional bachelor\u2019s degrees,\u201d these programs generally have a different structure than a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science program, because these professions are regulated by a governmental or licensing body. Professional degrees have a curriculum that is made up, in large part, of career training. \u00a0For example, a Bachelor\u2019s of Science in nursing program has a very strict set of classes students must take in order to learn the hands-on knowledge required to be a nurse.\nIn addition, some professional degrees take longer to earn or require post-graduate study. Many professional degrees require a certification exam before the student can start practicing, such as the CPA exam for accountants or the NCLEX for registered nurses.\nTo help you chose the professional degree that\u2019s right for you, we\u2019ve put together a list of those bachelor\u2019s degrees that fall into this special category.\nProfessional Bachelor\u2019s Degree Programs\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Architecture\nIf you\u2019re looking to become an architect, you\u2019ll need highly-specialized skills. You have two options to choose from: the first is to earn a Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch), which, unlike other bachelor\u2019s degree programs, takes five years (if you are able to finish on time).\nAnother option is to earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in architecture, which still follows the normal four-year bachelor\u2019s degree timeline. If you choose this option, you\u2019ll be required to earn a Master\u2019s of Architecture (M. Arch) in order to practice.\nOnce either the B. Arch or M. Arch is earned, you must pass the Architect Registration Examination (ARE), which is the licensing exam for the field.\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Accounting\nThe field of accounting is for those who would love to work with finances and taxes, which for someone who loves numbers may be a dream come true.\nAlthough a Bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting looks like it should take the normal four years, as of 2009 the requirements of 46 states increased the credit hours necessary for becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).\nYou must pass the CPA exam after earning the necessary hours, so be sure to factor that into your educational timeframe.\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Engineering\nEngineers are necessary for making this country run. Whether it is biomedical engineers, civil engineers, or chemical engineers, these professionals deserve way more credit than they receive.\nA degree in engineering includes a strong foundation in mathematics, science, English, social sciences, and humanities. These areas are studied for the first two years, while the last two are focused on a specialty such as biomedical engineering.\nOnce they earn their degrees, engineers must have licensure before providing their services directly to the public. Licensed engineers who have passed the required state examination are called professional engineers (PEs).\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Education\nThis Bachelor\u2019s degree does look more like a typical degree program than the last three, but the similarities stop at time commitment. Degrees in education at any level (i.e. elementary and secondary) are designed specifically for teaching students in their target area. Many schools across the country even offer professional development schools, which are partnerships between universities and elementary or secondary schools that allow students to teach for a year while under professional guidance.\nAfter earning their degree, education students must be licensed by the state if they plan on teaching at public schools (which is the usual place for teachers to work).\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Social Work\nA Bachelor\u2019s degree in social work (BSW) is required for most positions in the field of social work, but a Master\u2019s degree is necessary in order to advance in the field or to work in specific areas such as clinical work.\nIn addition to this degree, social workers need to be licensed by their state in order to practice. Although these requirements vary from state to state, the normal conditions require two years or 3,000 hours of supervised clinical experience.\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Psychology\nIt would make sense that the people who study the mind would need to be licensed to make sure they know what they were doing. In general, psychologists must have a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology or a related subject, as well as a master\u2019s degree and preferably a PhD.\nAfter earning a degree in psychology, students need to adhere to their state-specific requirements, which vary depending on the state.\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Nursing\nIf professionals studying your mind need to be certified to practice, the people in charge of keeping you physically alive should be held to at least the same standard.\nA Bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing prepares you to become a registered nurse typically, but before practicing, you need to pass the National Council Licensure Examination, or NCLEX-RN.\nIn addition to passing this licensing examination, requirements to practice vary by State.\nOf course, these are just a few examples of professional degrees, which also include medical programs, pharmacy programs, law programs, and many more.\nFind My Degree\n"}, {"score": 3068.5488, "uuid": "9070da67-3528-5ba6-8187-a8919797c9dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-45-10971", "target_hostname": "myfootpath.com", "target_uri": "http://myfootpath.com/degrees-and-programs/bachelors-degree-programs/", "page_rank": 2.7092837e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Programs &amp; <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Schools", "snippet": "However, <em>a</em> <em>bachelor\u2019s</em> program can be completed in anywhere <em>from</em> two to six years depending on <em>how</em> much time you commit and what type of <em>bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> program you choose.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u2192 Bachelor\u2019s Degree Programs\nBachelor\u2019s Degree Programs\nA bachelor\u2019s degree is the standard college degree and it usually takes four years to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in the U.S. However, a bachelor\u2019s program can be completed in anywhere from two to six years depending on how much time you commit and what type of bachelor\u2019s degree program you choose.\nBachelor\u2019s degrees are offered at thousands of college and universities \u2013 both online schools and on campus schools \u2013 around the country.\nObtaining a bachelor\u2019s degree typically leads to jobs that deliver a higher income than one or two years of college or just completing high school or your GED.\u00a0 A bachelor\u2019s degree can also prepare you for many different experiences, careers or graduate school.\nTypes of Bachelor\u2019s Degree Programs Available\nThere are a number of different types of bachelor\u2019 s degrees available, but the most common ones are Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees.\u00a0 B.S. degrees are geared more towards math and science, whereas B.A. degrees are focused on the arts and humanities.\nNo matter the type of bachelor degree you decide to work towards, you will have to study a wide range of subjects to get a well-rounded education.\u00a0 The majority of your coursework, though, will be in your chosen area of study.\nFeatured Schools with Bachelor\u2019s Degree Programs\nWestwood College: Online\n"}, {"score": 2988.9722, "uuid": "1b95ec72-3ee7-5c30-a081-c70f6e0eb5c7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-63-18409", "target_hostname": "myfootpath.com", "target_uri": "http://myfootpath.com/mypathfinder/earning-bachelors-degree-year-by-year-guide/", "page_rank": 1.1804607e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Earning Your <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> | <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Programs", "snippet": "Most bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em>degree</em> programs have some specific requirements for freshmen, such as <em>a</em> writing requirement. <em>From</em> there, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to take <em>a</em> range of courses in <em>different</em> areas, such as <em>a</em> certain amount of credits in foreign language, quantitative reasoning, etc., in order to graduate.", "explanation": null, "document": "By No\u00ebl Rozny\nWeb Editor & Content Manager\nWhen you first land on campus your freshman year of college, you might not be thinking of the details of earning your bachelor\u2019s degree .

(If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a large school, this task can seem especially daunting.)\nHere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of the general goals you should strive to hit in order to graduate from your bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree program on time.\nFreshman Year Bachelor\u2019s Degree Tips\nWelcome to campus! Freshman year is a great time to explore your college or university, make new friends, and sign up for activities that interest you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a chance to explore the wide range of classes and subjects available for study, which will be much broader than your high school options.\nGet started by speaking to an academic advisor about the overall requirements for your bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree degree. Most bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree programs have some specific requirements for freshmen, such as a writing requirement. From there, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be asked to take a range of courses in different areas, such as a certain amount of credits in foreign language, quantitative reasoning, etc., in order to graduate.\nBy talking to an advisor, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a better sense of what those requirements are. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also know if any AP exams you took allow you place out of certain requirements. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re enrolled in a specialized school, such as engineering or nursing , there maybe be specific requirements for your first year.\nSophomore Year Bachelor\u2019s Degree Tips\nDuring your freshman year, you were hopefully able to experiment and take classes that were never available to you before. While you can continue to take those classes during your sophomore year, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also time to start thinking about what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like your major for your bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree to be. Explore the classes required by different departments, and be prepared to declare your major by the end of sophomore year or early junior year. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking about having a double major or a minor, now\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a great time to find out what you would need to do to make that happen.\nJunior Year Bachelor\u2019s Degree Tips\nBy now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused in on what you want your major to be, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s philosophy, English, or organic chemistry. You should also have completed most of your general requirements, and are now focused on the classes you need for your major. Early junior year is a great time to check in with an academic advisor and get a review of your credits. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to point out any classes you still need to take and exactly how many credits you have left to complete. (One tip: make sure you get any credit audits in writing, just in case you have a dispute in your records at a later date.)\nSenior Year Bachelor\u2019s Degree Tips\nWhen senior year rolls around, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to finish up any remaining requirements you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completed, as well as the classes you need to satisfy the requirements for your major. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that you plan your schedule accordingly; if you have senior projects to complete in order to receive your bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree (such as a thesis), take that into account as you make your schedule. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, for example, schedule your most difficult classes during the bulk of your thesis writing. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also want to meet with an academic advisor one last time (preferably early during your first semester) to double check your records and make sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all set to graduate.\nhttp://twitter.com/peopledothat Jeff Lovingood\nWhere is the networking?u00a0 Where is the mentoring?u00a0 Where are the internships?u00a0 ~50% of graduates change their major once, ~25% change twice or more!u00a0 A little early focus on what to take before starting college is the best tool for making the best of college efforts and costs.\nFind My Degree\n"}, {"score": 2766.6409, "uuid": "aeb5d109-479e-528b-962d-d057284b804b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000tw-15-01098", "target_hostname": "myfootpath.com", "target_uri": "http://myfootpath.com/mypathfinder/reasons-to-get-masters-degree/", "page_rank": 1.1757821e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Three Reasons to Get <em>a</em> <em>Master\u2019s</em> <em>Degree</em>", "snippet": "Quite often <em>a</em> <em>bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> can help you get <em>a</em> toehold into <em>a</em> field or industry, but <em>a</em> <em>master\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> (or even <em>a</em> PhD) <em>is</em> what you\u2019ll need to get to the next level.", "explanation": null, "document": "By No\u00ebl Rozny\nWeb Editor & Content Manager\nWhether you\u2019re looking at an MA, MBA or PhD, there\u2019s no getting around it: graduate school is an additional investment of time and money on top of your bachelor\u2019s degree. Students and professionals alike often ask themselves: is it really worth it?\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about getting a master\u2019s or graduate degree, it helps to think about your end goal and how a master\u2019s will help (or hurt). Are you only going back to school because you\u2019re not sure of your next move, or because you know for certain it will help your career?\nHere are three ways a master\u2019s can help you advance to the next level. If one (or all) applies to you, it might be time to enroll!\nThree Reasons You Should Get a Master\u2019s Degree\nYou Want to Change Careers\nWe get a lot of calls and questions from people who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in a general subject, such as English, history, or sociology, and now they want to enter a new career, such as social work or physical therapy. Often the best way to make this change is to go back to school to earn your master\u2019s.\nThe great thing about going to graduate school is that it builds upon the educational foundation you already have, allowing you to skip general education requirements and get right to the good stuff. Since graduate school is so highly focused, you\u2019ll be in and out in approximately two years, rather than the four years it takes for a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nOne thing to note: some graduate programs specifically require undergraduate coursework in a similar subject. If, for example, you majored in French literature in college, and now you want to become a nurse, you can\u2019t go directly into a master\u2019s of nursing program. To be sure, check with an admissions counselor at the graduate program you plan on applying to.\nYou Need it to Advance\nQuite often a bachelor\u2019s degree can help you get a toehold into a field or industry, but a master\u2019s degree (or even a PhD) is what you\u2019ll need to get to the next level. A bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice or paralegal studies, for example, can help you find work in the law industry, but to become a lawyer you\u2019ll need a JD. Psychologists, social workers, physical therapists, college professors, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are all examples of professions that require graduate degrees.\nIf you know you\u2019re heading towards a certain career or position that requires a master\u2019s degree, you might want to look into taking the GRE.\nIt Will Take You in a New Direction\nAnother common reason people enroll in master\u2019s degree programs is that they want to stay in their current career, but add a new skill set or head in a slightly different direction. Many college graduates take their undergraduate degree and use it to start a career in sales, marketing, of finance. As they excel and move forward, they often come across a new aspect of their field that they want to add to their resume. At this point, going back to school for a master\u2019s degree to get that knowledge is a natural next step.\nWithout a doubt, graduate school is an investment of time and money, not to mention a different ball game than your undergraduate program. But if you know it\u2019s going to give you the skills and knowledge to steer your career in the right direction, the ROI will be well worth it.\nhttp://twitter.com/PaulAngone Paul Angone\nYep.

The many different kinds of bachelor degree programs can be overwhelming, though. Here, we\u2019ll break them down into several main categories to make them a little easier to understand.\nTypes of Bachelor\u2019s Degree Programs Include:\nBachelor of the Arts (BA)\nA Bachelor of the Arts is an umbrella degree for a wide variety of programs that focus primarily on the arts, social sciences, and the humanities. For example, if you wanted to major in a humanities subject, such as English, a foreign language, history, psychology, or sociology, you would complete your coursework and have a Bachelor of the Arts when you graduate.\nBachelor of Science\nSimilar to a Bachelor of the Arts, a Bachelor of Science covers the many degrees that focus on the sciences. If you\u2019re interested in focusing on biology, math, chemistry, or physics, you would graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree once you have completed your coursework.\nSpecialty Bachelor Degree Programs\nThis is where the acronyms get a little tricky. Certain degree programs require such specialized coursework and training that they are separate from a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science program. Some of the most common include:\nBachelor of Architecture (BArch) \u2013 The degree program future architects must complete.\nBachelor of Business Administration (BBA) \u2013 An undergraduate program for students interested in business.\nBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) \u2013 Students who pursue study in creative writing, dance or another fine art graduate with this degree.\nBachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) \u2013 This specialty degree prepares nurses to treat patients.\nThe key to specialty bachelor degrees is that they are often separate programs or departments within the university you\u2019re attending. This means that if you want to enroll in the Bachelor of Architecture of the Bachelor of Fine Arts program, you generally need to apply directly to that department for admission.\nBachelor of General Studies\nSome schools also offer a Bachelor of General Studies degree. Unlike other bachelor\u2019s degree programs, which require students to follow guidelines and fulfill certain requirements, this program allows students to combine several disciplines and chart their own learning course.\nTips for Choosing a Type of Bachelor Degree\nHopefully the list above gave you a better sense of the different kinds of bachelor\u2019s degrees available to you. Which one is right for you will depend on where your interests lie and what future career you\u2019d like to pursue. For information on the degree requirements for different careers, check out the career profiles section on our site. And remember, you do have time your first few years of college to take different classes and figure out which type of bachelor degree program is right for you.\nWhich degree will you choose and why?

And maybe you\u2019ve asked yourself, \u201chow is a terminal master\u2019s degree different from a regular master\u2019s degree?\u2019\nTerminal Master\u2019s Degrees\nIn the strictest sense of the word, a \u201cterminal degree\u201d is the highest degree awarded in a given field\u2014for most academic disciplines, this is the doctorate, or Ph.D.\nIn this context, a \u201cterminal master\u2019s\u201d versus a \u201cnon-terminal master\u2019s\u201d usually refers to a master\u2019s degree that does not typically lead to a Ph.D. Master\u2019s degrees in business administration (MBAs), master\u2019s in fine arts (MFAs), and master\u2019s in social work (MSWs) are among these types of degrees. Note that this does not mean that students who earn terminal master\u2019s degrees cannot go on to doctorate programs or other advanced studies. Nor does it necessarily mean that there are no doctorates in the given field, but they are often more rare. For example, most people who earn an MBA do not go on to earn a doctorate in business, although some do.\nIn addition, the phrase \u201cterminal master\u2019s\u201d can also refer to a situation in which a given school does not offer a Ph.D. in that field. Additionally, it can refer to the student\u2019s choice as to whether or not they\u2019re pursuing a doctorate in the field with that school.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re pursuing a master\u2019s degree in geology at a school that offers only a master\u2019s degree in that subject. Some would say that your master\u2019s degree will be terminal\u2014because you don\u2019t have the option of receiving a Ph.D. from that school. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go on to your doctorate elsewhere\u2014\u201cterminal master\u2019s\u201d in this context is absolutely no different than any other master\u2019s: it simply means that\u2019s as far as you could go at that school.\nNon-Terminal Master\u2019s Degrees\nThe phrase \u201cnon-terminal master\u2019s\u201d is a bit more straightforward. Let\u2019s say you attend a school that offers both a master\u2019s degree and a Ph.D., and you decide to pursue a Ph.D. Some departments that offer both levels of graduate degrees will award a non-terminal master\u2019s degree to their Ph.D. students after they\u2019ve completed the required coursework. Once the qualifications are met, the degree is awarded, and the student continues on toward his or her Ph.D. degree. The degree is considered non-terminal because the student is continuing on for a doctorate.\nSo to summarize: the phrase \u201cterminal master\u2019s degree\u201d will mean slightly different things to different people. In certain fields, the master\u2019s degree is the highest degree attainable. For others, however, there is no practical difference between a terminal and a non-terminal master\u2019s degree. It is simply a matter of choice by the student based on where they choose to attend and what level of study they sought to receive.\nNate Abbott is currently a graduate student and a writer for myFootpath.\nFind My Degree\n"}, {"score": 2623.4949, "uuid": "7dc9d60d-c289-52b3-bfde-6d80b690e822", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0110wb-36-22427", "target_hostname": "www.henley-putnam.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.henley-putnam.edu/terrorism-and-counterterrorism-library/masters-degree-in-counterterrorism.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1765193e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Counterterrorism", "snippet": "Earn <em>a</em> <em>Master\u2019s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Terrorism and Counterterrorism <em>from</em> Henley-Putnam University There are many <em>different</em> paths to working in counterterrorism and earning an advanced <em>master\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> directly in the field <em>from</em> expert faculty with real world experience <em>is</em> <em>a</em> great way to open <em>a</em> wide-array of potential", "explanation": null, "document": "1.888.852.8746 | 1.408.453.9900\nEarn a Master\u2019s Degree in Terrorism and Counterterrorism from Henley-Putnam University\nThere are many different paths to working in counterterrorism and earning an advanced master\u2019s degree directly in the field from expert faculty with real world experience is a great way to open a wide-array of potential counterterrorism career opportunities.\nReceiving a highly-targeted, specialized education in the career field that you want to either go into or advance within is a wise investment, especially since counterterrorism career opportunities have expanded in importance after 9/11 and subsequent terrorist attacks in Bali, Madrid, and London.\nSubsequently, counterterrorism professionals need to understand terrorist group dynamics, strategy, targeting, and tactics as well as how policies are formulated, developed and implemented to counter terrorist planning and operations.

The following article covers all aspects on how to choose graduate studies programs that are a good fit for you. Providing grad school tips that take into consideration career options, flexibility, requirements, financial aid and even tips on finding the right advisor, this article provides a great checklist to use when researching grad school options.\nFull Article\nWhen making a decision as important as which master's degree program you will enter, it is best to do a lot of research. Not all colleges and programs are the same. If you don't know exactly what you want to do, you need to look at a degree that has a wide range of flexibility.\nStep 1 Decide which area you want to get your master's degree in. For example, you can find a master's degree in one of these traditional fields such as business, law, medical or education. You can also find many new master's degree programs in many fields other than the traditional, such as \"Child Development\" or \"Early Childhood Education.\"\nStep 2 Research some colleges that have a master's degree program in your field of interest. This will take some time and most researches suggest that you attend graduate school at a different college than where you took your undergraduate. This allows for different teachers, teaching styles and different perspectives of teachers and students.\nStep 3 Try to find a faculty adviser at the college you want to attend. This will be someone that you meet with each semester or quarter depending on your college and discuss the classes necessary to finish your master's degree program.\nStep 4 Take the time to know if you will start graduate school immediately after finishing your bachelor's, because you feel you are used to being a student, possibly have few obligations requiring you to get a full time job and you feel your study skills are quick. Or you can decide to wait so you can get a better understanding of your goals, have a more mature attitude about school and get some work experience first.\nStep 5 Consider how you are going to pay for graduate school. Take time to look at the difference in tuition and apply for financial aid.\nStep 6 Go to a few college campuses and talk to both faculty and students that attend. This can help you assess the facilities.\nStep 7 Choose a Master's Degree program that best suits your needs.\nTips & Warnings\nSome colleges will have better reputations and alumni networks than other colleges, so do your research.\nTypically you will find colleges from the West coast to the East coast go from least expensive to most expensive as far as tuition is concerned.\nContacting the department head of the school you want to attend can give you more information about the school and can help you get a recommendation for that graduate program.\nIf your GPA isn't good enough for the master's program you want to get into, consider taking a few classes that will boost your GPA.\nCitation\n"}, {"score": 2555.07, "uuid": "31268637-f346-543f-a6c3-d32728adb4ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-31-33084", "target_hostname": "distancelearn.about.com", "target_uri": "http://distancelearn.about.com/od/onlinecourses/a/Bachelor_Degree.htm", "page_rank": 1.3468892e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Earn an Online <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em>", "snippet": "Don\u2019t let your credits go to waste \u2013 <em>a</em> few credits <em>from</em> two or three schools could shorten your study time by <em>a</em> semester or more.

Many upper-level positions are only offered to applicants that have completed bachelor degrees. Earning an online BA can give you the chance to learn new skills and learn about a subject you are passionate about. Additionally, studies have shown that the average college graduate makes approximately one million dollars more during his or her lifetime than the average high school graduate.\nWho Should Earn an Online Bachelor\u2019s Degree?\nOnline bachelor degree programs are ideal for mid-career professionals looking to further their education during off-hours. A growing number of younger students are also enrolling in online programs after graduating high school. Additionally, many students that have earned online associate\u2019s degrees choose to pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree through the internet. In order to be successful, online students must be motivated and able to work independently. Because most online coursework consists of independent reading, students should be proficient in English reading and writing. (See: Is Distance Learning Right for You? )\nSchool Accreditation\nAccreditation is the most important factor to consider when selecting a school. Don\u2019t spent thousands of dollars towards a \u201cdiploma mill\u201d degree that won\u2019t be accepted in academia and the workplace. If you want your degree to be recognized by employers and other colleges, make sure that the online college you choose is accredited by the appropriate regional board .\nAlternatively, you may choose to enroll in a college accredited by the Distance Education Training Council . Although degrees from DETC accredited colleges are accepted by a large number of employers, it is not always possible to transfer these credits to other colleges.\nYou can determine whether or not a school is accredited by visiting the Department of Education\u2019s website. (See: Check Any School\u2019s Accreditation Status )\nWhat Else to Look for in an Online Bachelor\u2019s Degree Program\nIn addition to proper accreditation, make sure that your online college offers students the chance to speak with a counselor who can help plan an individualized course of study. Check to see that the bachelor\u2019s program has been around for a while (five or more years) and has a large number of satisfied graduates. Talk with former students to see what you can learn from their experiences. (See: Choosing the School for You )\nTypes of Bachelor\u2019s Degrees\nThere are many different types of bachelor\u2019s degrees. The three most popular are the bachelor of arts, the bachelor of science and the bachelor of fine arts.\nBachelor of Arts (BA) \u2013 This degree is generally awarded to students studying academic subjects. Students earning this degree may choose to start a career or pursue further studies such as a master\u2019s degree. The BA generally requires at least 120 semester credits, usually spread evenly between general education and major requirements.\nBachelor of Science (BS) \u2013 This degree is usually awarded to students studying technical, career-oriented subjects. Most BS degrees are considered terminal and most students pursue a career after graduation. The BS degree generally requires at least 120 semester credits, the majority of which are completed in the major.\nBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA)- This degree is awarded to students studying a visual or performance art. Most graduates seek a career in the arts after completing the degree. The BFA generally requires at least 120 semester credits, the majority of which are completed through fine arts courses in studio or lab settings (as opposed to lecture courses).\nThe Testing Option\nIf you have subject-specific expertise or are an exceptional test-taker, you may be able to complete many bachelor degree requirements through passing exams. Several regionally accredited online colleges allow students to complete a degree entirely by passing exams. Be aware that the tests are difficult. If you do not have prior knowledge, you may need to spend an extensive amount of study time. In many cases, it is easier to simply take a class. (See: Diploma Programs That Turn Test Scores and Life Experience Into College Credit )\nCombining Credits from Multiple Schools\nIf you have college credits from multiple schools, you may be able to combine them into a single transcript by using a credit bank or by enrolling in a school that has a liberal credit acceptance policy. Don\u2019t let your credits go to waste \u2013 a few credits from two or three schools could shorten your study time by a semester or more.

Why did Grace College make a change in its method of education?\nGrace College is committed to its mission as an evangelical institution of higher education that applies biblical values to developing students\u2019 character, sharpening their competence, and preparing them for service. We value the needs of hard-working students and their families and are seeking ways to make an education at Grace more affordable. We have listened to their concerns and are trying to address them. The package of recommendations we are making is intended to help make a quality education at Grace both affordable and practical while still maintaining a biblical foundation.\n2. I heard that Grace has a model that is different from other schools. What is it?\nThe changes we can look forward to are:\nA compressed calendar of two, 8-week sessions in each of the fall, spring, and summer semesters.\nOptions to graduate in three years with a bachelor\u2019s degree, four years with a bachelor\u2019s degree, or four years with a combined bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree.\nScheduling courses in a way that allows for in-depth study of 2-3 courses at a time\nA modified housing and meal plan\nAn intentional focus on applied learning as part of each student\u2019s check sheet\nOnline, summer courses\nThe common general education experience, called the Grace Core, will be offered more frequently (see question 5)\n3. What is applied learning? Is it more than student teaching? What about study abroad?\nApplied learning could include any number of activities or projects students complete outside the regular classroom experience that applies their knowledge about their discipline in a practical way, has oversight by a faculty member, and includes an academic component. Student teaching and study abroad are examples of applied learning that could be required by the major or minor, but they are not the only options.\n4. Will everyone have to graduate in three years?\nGrace will continue to be a four-year school; however, all degrees in all disciplines will allow students to graduate in three years if they choose to do so. Students will have the option of completing their bachelor\u2019s degrees in either four years or three years, depending on their individual needs. For example, student athletes, students choosing a combined bachelor\u2019s/master\u2019s degree, or students who determine they want a more flexible schedule or no summer courses might choose the four-year graduation option.\n5. What will the Grace Core look like?\nWe believe that learning about God\u2019s creation is an act of worship that relates to the various disciplines represented at Grace College. The Grace Core will be a common educational experience for all students who attend Grace College. The Core will include Freshman Foundations, a first-year experience course, and Global Perspectives and its cross-cultural experience. The Core will consist of Bible courses as well as those representing the disciplines of Behavioral Science, Communication, Economics, English, and History. It will also include an integrated humanities course focusing on art, music, and literature, and an integrated science and math course. The BA and the BS provide further distinctions by requiring an additional 6 language credits for a BA and 6 credits of math and of science or social science courses for a BS.\n6. What will the tuition be in this new model? Will we have to pay extra for the summer school on-line semester?\nStudents enrolled for 12-18 credits pay a flat tuition fee. Students registering for more than 18 credits in the fall semester or spring semester will be charged at a per-credit tuition rate beyond the 18 credits.\nIf students are enrolled full-time in the fall and spring semesters, they can take up to 6 credits in the summer for the technology fee only (no tuition). A maximum of 6 credits may be taken in any one summer 8-week session. In summer sessions, students will pay the technology fee and regular tuition rates (a) beyond 6 credits, (b) if they were not enrolled full-time in a degree-program the previous two semesters, or (c) if they are registering for credits that exceed the 120 credits needed for graduation with a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n7. How will financial aid work for a 3-year degree vs. a 4-year degree?\nStudents should be eligible for one year of financial aid for every year of full-time enrollment until the point they graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree (up to four years). Under the new model, completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree within the four years will also allow a student to retain four years of his or her financial aid. In all cases, any time students have a question about financial aid, they should speak directly to that office (800.544.7223, ext. 6162) regarding their individual circumstances.\n8. How will a 3-year college experience impact a my personal development? Do I need all four years to be ready for life post-graduation?\nStudents\u2019 development is important to us and is reflected in our mission as we develop their character, sharpen their competence, and prepare them for service. We believe that coming alongside students through a combination of experiences, such as student/advisor relationships, on-campus employment, applied learning, strong local church involvement, and campus-wide leadership positions will help them develop personally. We also believe that some of our redesigned Grace Core courses will help students address some very practical life issues related to healthy living, goal setting, relationship development, and financial responsibility. Additionally, students will always have the option of a four-year graduation plan if they believe this is best for their personal situation.\n"}, {"score": 2512.0205, "uuid": "afc3f739-1bde-5553-864e-a7538487c73a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0005wb-65-27504", "target_hostname": "psychology.about.com", "target_uri": "http://psychology.about.com/od/education/tp/bachelors-degree-in-psychology.htm", "page_rank": 1.2632944e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Psychology - FAQ About the <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Psychology", "snippet": "<em>How</em> Does <em>a</em> Bachelor of Arts Differ <em>from</em> <em>a</em> Bachelor of Science?

Learn more about earning a bachelor's degree in psychology, including how long it will take, your career options after graduation and possible alternative degrees that you might want to consider.\nWhat Is a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology?\nA bachelor's degree in psychology is an undergraduate-level degree. Typically, it takes four years to complete a bachelor's degree program. However, some students are able to finish in three, while other may take five to complete all the necessary coursework.\nBachelor's programs in psychology are prevalent at universities throughout the world, and the degree has become a very popular option among students. These programs can also help prepare students for advanced study in psychology and other subjects including medicine and the law. According to The College Majors Handbook, however, nearly 75 percent of all students who earn a bachelor's degree in psychology do not go to graduate school.\nWhat Can You Do With a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology?\nSome people who graduate with an undergraduate degree in psychology opt to work in the social services field. A few common jobs in this area that are open to those with a bachelor's-level degree include case managers, psychiatric technicians and psychosocial rehabilitation workers. The majority of students go on to find work in areas outside of psychology. One report found that the most common areas of employment include sales, marketing, human resources and real estate. Learn more about some of the job options with a bachelor's degree in psychology .\nHow Do You Earn a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology?\nIf you think that a bachelor's degree in psychology might be the right choice for you, it is important to learn about some of the educational requirements. Exact requirements can vary considerably from one program to another, but most programs require students to complete a number of general education courses, core psychology courses and psychology electives. Some of the commonly required core psychology courses include general psychology, statistics, experimental psychology and personality psychology.\nOnce you determine that a bachelor's in psychology might be a good choice for you, it is important to start planning early. If you are still in high school , take any psychology courses that your school offers in addition to other science classes. As you begin college, take note of the classes you will need to take in order to graduate and develop a four-year course schedule to ensure that you complete all of the required classes as well as any electives that you wish to take.\nA typical four-year course schedule for a bachelor's degree in psychology might look a bit like this:\nYear 1\nFall Semester: Introduction to psychology, English literature, speech, math and life science (i.e. biology, zoology, botony, etc.).\nSpring Semester: Developmental psychology, careers in psychology, history, English literature and life science.\nYear 2\nFall Semester: Personality psychology, abnormal psychology , government and one or two electives.\nSpring Semester: Psychological testing and measurement, biopsychology, statistics and two electives or general education courses.\nYear 3\nFall Semester: Psychology of learning, cognitive psychology, experimental psychology and two electives.\nSpring Semester: Social psychology, sensation and perception, ethical issues in psychology and two electives.\nYear 4\nFall Semester: History of psychology, senior seminar courses, research courses and any required course you still need to take to complete the program.\nSpring Semester: Psychology electives, advanced level topics or clinical practicum courses that you would still like to take before graduating.\nHow Does a Bachelor of Arts Differ from a Bachelor of Science?\nMany universities offer two different types of bachelor's degree: the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science (B.S.). As you begin working toward earning your degree, you will need to decide which one is best suited to your needs, interests and goals. Generally, the difference between the two degrees lies in the general education courses that are required. The B.A. usually requires more liberal arts courses including languages and humanities, while the B.S. demands more science coursework such as biology, zoology and anatomy and physiology. Learn more about the differences between B.A. and B.S. psychology degrees before you decide which one you would like to pursue.\nWhat Are Some Alternatives to a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology?\nSome students may find that while they have a strong interest in psychology, the bachelor's degree option just isn't the right fit for their personality, interest or career goals. Fortunately, there are many different options that these students can consider.\nFor students interested in the physiological influences on behavior, a program in medicine or the health sciences might be a good alternative to the bachelor's degree in psychology. Those who want to help people directly in a highly applied field might want to consider a bachelor's degree in social work.\nSome possible undergraduate degrees you might also consider include:\nBiology\n"}, {"score": 2509.677, "uuid": "874fc62f-a24a-5917-9d4a-83b8d5016e50", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1709wb-95-14632", "target_hostname": "www.statemaster.com", "target_uri": "http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Bachelor%27s-degree", "page_rank": 1.2267383e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "StateMaster - Encyclopedia: <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em>", "snippet": "<em>A</em> Scottish Designated <em>Degree</em> <em>is</em> <em>different</em> <em>from</em> an English Pass <em>Degree</em> even though both are denoted BSc Bachelor of Science.", "explanation": null, "document": "9 External links\nHonors degrees and academic distinctions\nUnder the new English system, and those influenced by it, such as the American , Canadian , Irish , Jordanian , Indian , Malaysian , Maltese , Sri Lankan , Singaporean , Zimbabwean , and Hong Kong , undergraduate degrees are differentiated either as pass degrees or as honours degrees, the latter denoted by the appearance of \"(Hons)\" after the degree abbreviation.[citation needed] An honours degree generally requires a higher academic standard than a pass degree, and in Malta , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand , Scotland , Sri Lankan , South Africa , and some Canadian universities an extra year of study. Previously in the UK Polytechnics, an honours degree took one more year of study than an ordinary degree. This applies in Scotland with ordinary MA and MA(Hons) degrees (which are the equivalent of English first (BA) degrees).

Prior to the mid 20th century all candidates would take an Ordinary degree, and then be selected to go on for a final year for the Honours degree. Now this may be reduced to two either by direct second year entry (for people who have done foundation degrees or changed subject or similar) or by doing compressed courses (which are being piloted by several newer universities). [1] . For funding reasons (funding for undergraduate programs is automatic, funding for postgraduate programs is not) it is becoming increasingly common to skip the Bachelor's stage entirely and go straight to Masters level on a four year (five year if with industrial experience) course (which often shares the first three years with the equivalent Bachelor's course). The Foundation Degree is a vocational qualification introduced by the UK government in September 2001. ... A masters degree is an academic degree usually awarded for completion of a postgraduate course of one or two years in duration. ...\nHonours degrees are of a superior academic standard. However the practice of writing 'Hons' as part of the degree designation is unofficial and is considered by many as an affectation. An Honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first class degree, the next best, an upper second class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), the next a lower second class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third class degree. An Ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but hasn't obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Alternatively a degree may be denied honours if the student has had to retake courses. An ordinary degree usually requires 300 CATS points whereas an honours degree requires 360 CATS points. It is possible to be awarded an ordinary degree with distinction if the average of the 300 CATS points is 70%+.\nFor a detailed explanation of the classification system see British undergraduate degree classification . This article does not cite any references or sources. ...\nOrdinary degrees are unclassified degrees awarded to all students who have completed the course and obtained sufficient marks to pass the final assessments and examinations. Ordinary degree courses usually have lower entry requirements than Honours degree courses. Although Ordinary degree courses are often considered to be easier than Honours degree courses, this is not always the case, and much depends on the university attended and the subject being studied. Some modern universities offer the opportunity for Ordinary degree students to transfer to an Honours degree course in the same subject if an acceptable standard is reached after the first or second year of study.\nScotland\nAt the four Ancient universities of Scotland (St Andrews, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen) and also at Dundee, undergraduate degrees are differentiated as either Designated Degrees or Honours Degrees. The Ancient universities of Scotland are those universities founded during the medieval period, and comprise (list by year of being chartered): The University of St Andrews, founded 1411 by papal bull The University of Glasgow, founded 1451 by papal bull The University of Aberdeen, founded 1495 by papal bull (as...\nAn Honours degree (( Master of Arts MA (Hons) for arts/social sciences or BSc (Hons) for sciences)) is awarded for students who have completed four years at university - two years at sub-honours level, studying a variety of different subjects, and two years at honours level studying one subject in depth, usually including a dissertation in the final year. Honours degrees are further subdivided in classes. These are first class, upper second class (2:1) and lower second class (2:2).\nA designated degree (MA or BSc) is awarded to students who have completed three years at university studying a variety of related subjects. The first two years of both a Designated Degree and an Honours Degree are identical, but candidates for the Designated Degree study in less depth in their final year, and often over a wider variety of subjects. Candidates for the Designated Degree do not usually complete a dissertation. A Scottish Designated Degree is different from an English Pass Degree even though both are denoted BSc Bachelor of Science.\nUnited States\nAlmost all U.S. universities and colleges award bachelor's degrees with honors -- usually \"cum laude\" (with honor/praise), \"magna cum laude\" (with great honor/praise), the occasionally seen \"maxima cum laude\" (with maximal honor/praise), and \"summa cum laude\" (with highest honor/praise) -- degrees without honors are awarded \"rite\".[citation needed] Requirements for such notations of honors generally include minimum Grade Point Averages (GPA), with the highest average required for the \"summa\" distinction. In the case of a few schools, a senior thesis for degrees in the humanities , and laboratory research for \" natural science \" (and, sometimes, \" social science \") degrees is also required. A notable exception is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , which does not have a dean's list, cum laude recognition, or undergraduate honors subjects. Some schools require students to pass comprehensive exams in order to receive a bachelor's degree.

Some U.S. colleges and universities have a separate academic track known as an \"honors\" or \"scholars\" program, generally offered to the top percentile of students (based on GPA ), and offering more challenging courses or more individually-directed seminars or research projects in lieu of the standard core curriculum . The students are awarded the same bachelor's degree as students completing the standard curriculum, but with the notation \"in cursu honorum\" on the transcript and the diploma . Usually, the above \"laude\" honors are separate from the notation for this honors course, but a student in the honors course generally must maintain grades at least worthy of the \"cum laude\" notation anyway.[citation needed] Hence, a graduate might receive a diploma Artium Baccalaureatum rite or Artium Baccalaureatum summa cum laude in the regular course, or Artium Baccalaureatum summa cum laude in cursu honorum, for instance.

The Magister degree, originally a graduate degree, became the new first degree after five years of study. In 1899 a second first degree, the Diplom , was introduced when the Technische Hochschulen received university status. However, in 1998 a new educational legislation reintroduced the Bachelor's degree (first degree after 3 to 4 years of study) in Germany. Today these degrees can be called either Bakkalaureus or Bachelor (in accordance with federal law) but the English term is more common. The traditional degrees will be abolished by 2010.

Also see: 2002 (number). ...\nSwitzerland\nSimilarly to Austria and Germany, Switzerland does not have a tradition of Bachelor degrees.

Former degrees such as the baccalaureus (bc. for Bachelor), doctorandus (prefix abbreviated to drs.; it corresponds to MA or MSc), ingenieur (ing. for those having graduated from a university of applied science and ir. for those having graduated from university), meester in de rechten (mr.; it corresponds to LL.M.) and doctor (dr.; it corresponds to Ph.D) are still granted along with their international equivalents. A vocational university (professional university, or college of higher vocational studies) is an institution of higher education and sometimes research, which provides both tertiary and sometimes quaternary education and grants academic degrees at all levels (bachelor, master, and sometimes doctorate) in a variety of subjects. ...\nBachelor's degrees are granted by both accredited colleges and universities. For colleges after four years of education a bachelor's degree is obtained (e.g. B.Com., B.Eng. but no B.A. or B.Sc.). For universities after three years of education a degree is granted (B.A., B.Sc. and LL.B.)\nWhether a bachelor's degree is granted by a college or university makes a lot of difference. B.A.'s from a university grant 'immediate' entry into a master's programme (and are usually considered a formality to allow students entering foreign universities master's programmes), bachelor degrees from a college require an extra 'bridge year' (often called a 'pre-master' year) to be allowed into a master's programme, since university bachelors are already tutored in research fields, whereas college bachelors are not. Granted degrees may be used as suffixes (Jan Jansen B.Sc.). Note: the English prefix 'Mr.' corresponds in Dutch with the official, and protected prefix 'mr.', meaning a 'meester in de rechten', i.e. a Master of Law, or the English equivalent LL.M.\nDenmark\nThe Bachelor degree was re-introduced at universities in Denmark in 1993, after the original degree baccalaureus was abandoned in 1775. The bachelor degree is awarded after 3 years of study at a university. Two bachelor degrees are used at university level today:\nBachelor of Science (BSc), awarded to students with main focus on scientific, medical or technical areas.\nBachelor of Arts (BA), awarded to students with main focus on humanistic, theological or jurisprudence areas.\nThe bachelor degree has also been used since the late 1990s in a number of areas like nursing and teaching. Usually referred to as a profession-bachelor these degrees usually requires 4 years of study at a college. These bachelor degrees do not grant automatic access to a university master's program, as opposed to the traditional bachelor degrees awarded by universities.\nItaly\nSince the Bologna Process the old Italian five years laurea system is no longer in use. The BA level corresponds today to the \"Laurea\" (its name has been \"Laurea Triennale\" for a short time after reform), which has a normative time to completion of three years (notice that in Italy students graduate from high school at the age of 19) and grants the access to postgraduate degrees (the equivalent of Master Degree being \"Laurea Magistrale\", even though its name after reform has been \"Laurea Specialistica\" for a short time). In order to graduate, students must complete 180 credits and write a thesis. Graduation marks go from 66 to 110 (for some important Universities such as Polytechnics the maximum mark awarded is 100). According to each faculty internal ruling a lode (distinction) may be assigned to candidates with a 110/110 mark for recognition of the excellence of the thesis. BA and MA graduates in Italy are addressed as Dottore (for a man) or Dottoressa (for a woman). The purpose of the Bologna process (or Bologna accords) is to create the European higher education area by making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe. ... In Italy, the laurea is the main post-secondary academic degree. ...\nPoland\nIn Poland, the licentiate degree corresponds to the Bachelor's degree in Anglo-Saxon countries. Licentiate (from Latin licentia doctorandi = permission/right to teach) is the title of a person who holds an academic degree called a license. ...\nRussia and Ukraine\nThe specialist degree ( Russian : \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442) was the first academic distinction in the Soviet Union . In the early 1990s, Bakalavr (Bachelor's) degrees were introduced in all the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States , except Turkmenistan . After Bakalavr degree, one can earn a Master's degree (another 1-2 years) while preserving the old 5-year Specialist scheme. Specialist degree is now being discontinued in universities that take part in Bologna process, so new students don't have this option. The Specialist degree in the English-speaking world The Specialist degree is found in some programs of education or psychology and is awarded for study beyond the Masters degree but below the doctorate. ...

The University of Malta is the highest teaching institution in the Republic of Malta. ... Medicin\u00e6 Baccalaureus & Baccalaureus Chirurgi\u00e6 (MB BChir or MB ChB or MB, BS or variations thereof) are the two degrees awarded after a course in medicine and surgery at a university in the United Kingdom and other places following the British tradition, such as Australian, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Jamaican...\nThis was historically taken at Oxford and Cambridge universities after the initial BA degree, and in Oxford and Cambridge the BA is still awarded for the initial three years of medical study, with the BM BCh or MB BChir being awarded for the subsequent clinical stage of training. Some British universities give a bachelor's degree in science, or medical science, mid-way through the medical course, and most allow students to intercalate a year of more specialised study for a Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSci) or Bachelor of Medical Biology (BMedBiol) degree with honours.\nAlthough notionally MB and BChir are two degrees, they must be taken together, and by convention entitle the bearer to use the title of Doctor . In some Irish universities a third degree, Bachelor of the Art of Obstetrics (BAO), is added.\nThe non-university (licentiate) qualifications allowing registration as a medical practitioner in the UK, which have not been awarded by the United Examining Board since 1999, also conferred the courtesy title of \"doctor.\" There are very few or no other articles that link to this one. ...\nNew bachelor's degrees\nThe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are perhaps alone in the United Kingdom today in awarding the B.A. for all undergraduate degrees. Almost all American universities award B.A. and B.S. degrees, though a number of small liberal arts colleges award only the B.A. (e.g. Hamilton College ). However, on a global scale, in many universities over the last hundred years the range of bachelor's degrees has expanded enormously, especially in Australia , New Zealand , India and South Africa . This represents a move towards specialization in tertiary education , in which college or university in these countries is intended to be training for a specific career , and therefore akin to vocational education . It is a departure from the liberal arts approach common in the United States, in which the graduate is versed in a wide variety of subjects in addition to an academic major , with the intent they be well prepared to pursue any number of careers, or a progression of careers. A liberal arts college is an institution of higher education found in the United States, offering programs in the liberal arts at the post-secondary level. ...

To apply for a master\u2019s degree you usually must already hold an undergraduate degree (a bachelor\u2019s degree).\nA master\u2019s degree typically requires a year and one-half to two years of full-time study.\nTo earn a master\u2019s degree you usually need to complete from 36 to 54 semester credits of study (or 60 to 90 quarter-credits). This equals 12 to 18 college courses. Most master\u2019s degrees are awarded by public or state universities.\nTIP: The most popular online master\u2019s degree is the master\u2019s in business administration (MBA). Many managers today earn the MBA to qualify for competitive management positions in areas as diverse as technology management and healthcare records administration.\nWhen to Seek a Master\u2019s Degree\nWhen You \u2026.\n\u2022 Already hold a bachelor\u2019s degree\n\u2022 Know that your chosen career will require a master\u2019s degree\n\u2022 Need a graduate degree to qualify for a higher salary grade\nTIP: Some careers may require a specific type of master\u2019s degree. For example, if your goal is to become a public school principal, your state Board of Education will require, at minimum, a master\u2019s degree in education\u2014and that degree will need to include some very specific courses. Check with your state licensing board before enrolling in any master\u2019s degree in accounting, education, nursing, counseling and engineering, in particular.\nTIP: You don\u2019t have to hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in the same major area you wish to study at the master\u2019s level. Example: You may hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology but decide to earn a master\u2019s in management. Most master\u2019s in management programs will accept you with any type of bachelor\u2019s degree. Some master\u2019s program may require you to take specific undergraduate prerequisite courses to help qualify for advanced graduate-level study in a new area. Check course prerequisites carefully before enrolling in any master\u2019s degree online.\nShow Me an Online Master\u2019s Degree\nEvery college will have its own degree plan that includes both required courses, courses that you must take, and elective courses\u2014courses that you can elect or choose to take to earn an online master\u2019s degree.\nIf you decide to major in a special area, such as business or psychology, most of your courses will be about business and psychology. Master\u2019s degrees often focus on a single specialty area. For example, you may earn a master\u2019s in addiction studies and counseling or a master\u2019s in technology management. The ability to focus on one niche makes the master\u2019s a good credential if you want focus your career in a high-demand niche area.\nBelow is the sample curriculum (plan of required study) for a master\u2019s degree in education with an emphasis on new learning and literacies from the University of Illinois Online. Different colleges will require different programs of study. Compare degree requirements at different schools carefully when selecting the best online master\u2019s degree for your situation.\nUniversity of Illinois Online\nOnline Master's of Education with Emphasis in New Learning and New Literacies\nThe degree involves taking eight courses, in sequence, plus doing two capstone projects over the course of the two-year program.\nCourses are:\n1.

But, how do you know if online learning is the right choice? How do you choose a school that will get respect in the workplace? And, is it possible to convince your employer to fund your education? Read on.\nWho Should Earn an Online Master\u2019s Degree?\nBefore enrolling in an online graduate program, ask yourself two questions: \u201cWhy do I want to earn this degree?\u201d and \u201cWill earning the degree actually help be achieve that goal?\u201d Do you want to earn the degree to make more money, qualify for a new job, or simply have the opportunity to learn? While undergraduate degrees are helpful in a majority of workplaces, not everyone\u2019s career can benefit from a graduate degree. Some positions require a specific master\u2019s degree or offer substantial monetary incentives for graduate degrees. Other positions do not consider graduate work a factor for granting promotions or increasing salaries. Earning an online master\u2019s degree requires a considerable investment of time and money \u2013 make sure that the payoff is worth it.\nOnline studies are best suited for students with organized and dedicated personalities. Mid-career professionals are often successful in online master\u2019s programs. Potential students should be able to read and understand advanced texts and be able to write at a college-level. Students should be aware that most online graduate programs award grades based on writing assignments, online reading discussions, and written exams.\nOnline Master\u2019s Degree Program Accreditation\nDon\u2019t be tricked by a \u201cdiploma mill\u201d school. Degrees from unaccredited, low-quality programs are almost always rejected by employers. Instead, find a school that is regionally accredited from one of the six regional organizations. This will help ensure that your degree is accepted by employers and that your transcripts are accepted by other schools should you choose to transfer or pursue additional studies. See also: Check Any School\u2019s Accreditation Status .\nAlternatively, you may choose to enroll in an online master\u2019s degree program accredited by the Distance Education Training Council (DETC). Although many employers accept degrees with DETC accreditation, be aware that DETC accreditation is not as universally accepted nor as highly regarded as regional accreditation.\nWhat Else to Look for in an Online Master\u2019s Degree Program\nIn addition to selecting a regionally accredited school, make sure that your online master\u2019s program provides the support you will need as a student. Quality schools offer a competitive student to teacher ratio, student mentors, and career placement services. See: Choosing the School for You .\nTypes of Master\u2019s Degrees\nThere are many different types of master\u2019s degrees. The most common are the Master of Arts (MA) and the Master of Science (MS).\nMaster of Arts (MA) \u2013 This degree is awarded to students completing studies in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Fine Arts, or in Theology. Some MA programs are also designed for students intending to do additional graduate work after graduation (i.e. earning a doctorate degree). Typically, the degree takes two-years of full-time study and requires a thesis or a comprehensive exam (or both).\nMaster of Science (MS) \u2013 This degree is granted to students completing studies in the Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Business, and Technology. Many (but not all) MS programs are designed to be professional degrees for students entering the workforce instead of pursuing additional studies. Typically, the degree takes two-years of full-time study and requires a thesis or a comprehensive exam.\nOther master\u2019s degrees include: Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Fine Arts (MFA), Master of Education (MEd), Master of Health Administration (MHA), Master of Library Science (MLS), Master of Music (MMus), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Philosophy (MPhil), and additional specialized degrees.\nOnline Master\u2019s Degree Residency Requirements\nMany online graduate programs require students to clock a specified number of \u201cresidency hours\u201d attending lectures on school grounds.\nNo residency \u2013 Some online master\u2019s programs can be completed without setting foot on campus. Exams are typically taken under the care of a proctor in your area.\nLimited residency \u2013 Other master\u2019s program require students to attend weekend or week-long seminars at a physical campus. The limited-time seminars are generally held during weekends or in the summer months.\nSubstantial residency \u2013 Some master\u2019s online master\u2019s programs require students to spend an extended residency at the college campus. If you enroll in one of these programs, you may be expected to spend a semester or two in on-campus courses, even though your degree is technically being earned online.\nPaying for an Online Master\u2019s Degree Program\nOnline master\u2019s programs can be expensive. Paid teaching fellowships, which are a staple of many traditional master\u2019s programs, are not an option for students who choose to learn online. However, many students qualify for government subsidized grants and loans . You may also want to search the web for private scholarships .\nIf your master\u2019s degree will help you in your current job, you may be able to convince your employer to pay for part or all of your education. Ask your employer if there are any educational funding programs in place. If not, ask for a meeting to explain how funding your degree will benefit the company.\nEarning a graduate degree through the internet can be a challenge. But, carefully choosing your school and master\u2019s degree program can help you make the most of your experience.\nChoosing a School\n"}, {"score": 2474.488, "uuid": "e4e817e9-1632-5bc4-a132-71511fb755df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1017wb-33-23171", "target_hostname": "www.clinicalforensicpsychology.org", "target_uri": "http://www.clinicalforensicpsychology.org/tag/masters-degree/", "page_rank": 1.9810065e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "<em>Master\u2019s</em> <em>Degree</em> | ClinicalForensicPsychology.org", "snippet": "<em>A</em> <em>Bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> <em>is</em> required for admission to the Masters program.", "explanation": null, "document": "January 30, 2012 By Patricia Zapf 2 Comments\nAfter having reviewed the five fully online masters programs in forensic psychology , numerous requests were received for more information on the campus-based masters programs in forensic psychology that are available. Thus, this series of articles will review each of the masters programs in forensic psychology and provide information on each program in a similar format so as to assist in comparisons between the various options.\nThe goal of this series of articles is simply to provide information in a consistent format to assist those individuals who are considering an education in forensic psychology and not to convince anyone to attend a particular program. Having been a professor in this field for the last 13 years I am familiar at some level with almost every forensic psychology program available in North America. Many undergraduate students are not familiar with all the possible options and so this series will lay them out in a consistent format for ease of comparison.\nMasters Degree in Forensic Psychology \u2013University of North Dakota\nProgram Description\nThere are two masters degree programs in forensic psychology offered by the University of North Dakota, a Science-based program (M.S.) and an Arts-based program (M.A.) From the website : 1) Master\u2019s of Science (M.S.). In the U.S. forensic graduates obtain master\u2019s-level psychology jobs in agencies and institutions such as prisons, juvenile facilities, social service agencies, police departments, child care agencies, probation, parole, family court, addiction services, hospitals, and community mental health centers. Some students get jobs as forensic researchers doing studies and evaluations of at-risk populations. A few graduates will be accepted in federal law enforcement agencies after earning the Master\u2019s degree. You would expect to see forensic graduates working in the following areas: secure forensic units in state facilities, jails/prisons, probation services, court service units, community mental health centers, protective services, violence risk assessment, specialized agencies (i.e. child advocacy centers), law enforcement, and trial consulting. The M.S. degree in forensic psychology will also allow some students to advance to doctoral programs in forensic psychology, forensic science, and law school. Students in the M.S. Forensic Psychology Program at UND are required to attend classes on campus and complete 44 credits of study. This includes 26 credits of required course work, 12 credits of elective courses, and a minimum of 6 credit hours for thesis work.\n2) Master\u2019s of Arts (M.A.). The Department of Psychology, in conjunction with the Division of Continuing Education, has designed an online forensic psychology program targeted for working professionals. The M.A. Forensic Psychology program is the first to be offered online by a nationally recognized, fully accredited university. Through the 34-credit M.A. program, students will learn how to provide the psychological expertise and knowledge needed by the legal community and agencies having a strong forensic focus. Students in the program will likely be in-service professionals, such as law enforcement personnel, who want to further their career as well as those with a behavioral or social science background, such as counselors or social workers, who are interested in applying psychology to their work involving forensic issues.\nThe online Master\u2019s degree is described elsewhere . The M.S. in Forensic Psychology is described below.\nSpecializations\nThe Masters in Forensic Psychology does not appear to have formal specializations, but allows for an individualized program of study by allowing students to choose from a number of electives (minimum of 12 credits/4 courses).\nCredits\nThe program consists of 44 credits, which include 26 credits of required coursework, 12 credits of elective coursework, and 6 credits of thesis work.\nThesis\nStudents are required to complete a thesis in this program. The thesis is worth 6 credits of the 44 required credits for this program.\nExternship/Practicum\nAlthough the required coursework includes a 2-credit course in Supervised Field Work, it does not appear that this would be a clinical placement, but rather, would include placement at various settings where research would be the primary focus of the fieldwork.\nAdmission Requirements\nFrom the website : Applicants must have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university with a behavioral or social science major allied with psychology, e.g., psychology, criminal justice, sociology, counseling, social work. Applicants must submit scores from the Graduate Record Examination, including the Advanced Examination in Psychology. Advanced students who have earned, or will earn, a graduate degree in psychology, counseling, social work, sociology, any related behavioral science can also apply. Applicants must have a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.2 or above, or a graduate GPA > 3.75; an analytic GRE writing test score > 2.5; and Verbal & Quantitative GRE scores must both equal or exceed the 30th percentile. Applicant must also submit three letters of recommendation, academic transcripts, and an essay. Applicants not meeting these standards may be admitted on a provisional basis with continued enrollment contingent on successful performance in the program. A 250-300 words essay discussing reasons for pursuing a graduate degree in forensic psychology is required as part of the admissions material to be submitted.

There are a good number of electives from which to choose so that students may personalize the coursework to fit their interests. The coursework does not appear to be intended to prepare master\u2019s level clinicians and so students interested in becoming master\u2019s level clinicians should consider either the online M.A. in Forensic Psychology offered by the University of North Dakota or another master program. This is one of the few master\u2019s program that prepares students for research careers or further study at the doctoral level.\n"}, {"score": 2468.4214, "uuid": "1131c40c-fafa-592d-b5b3-f0a15b1934a1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0808wb-56-00136", "target_hostname": "www.drexel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/education-degrees/ms-si/international.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1957407e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Teaching <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> online", "snippet": "native language <em>is</em> not English and who hold <em>a</em> <em>bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> <em>from</em> <em>a</em> U.S. institution * Students who earned <em>a</em> <em>bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> <em>from</em> <em>a</em> U.S. institution or have worked full-time in an English-speaking country for more than two years (email <em>is</em> sufficient proof) * Applicants whose native language <em>is</em> English", "explanation": null, "document": "NOTE:\n*WES course-by-course evaluation is required by the iSchool Graduate Admissions Office.\n*The College of Nursing & Health Professions UNDERGRADUATE programs also accept transcript evaluations from the following organizations:\nCGFNS International (for foreign trained nurses only) : http://www.cgfns.org/\nInternational Consultants of Delaware : http://www.icdeval.com/\nEducational Credential Evaluators: http://www.ece.org/\n*The College of Nursing & Health Professions\u00a0GRADUATE programs and the School of Public Health also accept transcript evaluations from the following organizations:\nCGFNS International (for foreign trained nurses only) : http://www.cgfns.org/\nInternational Consultants of Delaware : http://www.icdeval.com/\nAdditional Admissions Requirements - TOEFL\nMost programs require a minimum TOEFL score of 79 on the iBT\u00a0(550 for the paper test).

Or perhaps you\u2019ve been volunteering at your local veterinary clinic and now you want to learn the ins and outs of veterinary medicine. If you were exposed to a certain field or skill and you want to learn more, that\u2019s a great reason to enroll in a bachelor\u2019s degree program.

Small Schools\nEarning a Bachelor\u2019s Degree: Big Vs. Small Schools\nBy Alexander Diedrick\nAre you a big school student or a small school student?\nThis question shapes your entire experience on your path towards a bachelor\u2019s degree . Many variables change when comparing a university and a smaller, fine arts school, but when it comes down to it, it\u2019s a matter of preference.\nHere are some of the main differences in what your bachelor\u2019s degree will look like when comparing the two types of schools.\nYour Bachelor\u2019s Degree: How It\u2019s Affected by School Size\nStudent Body Size\nLet\u2019s start with the most basic of aspects to point out: the amount of students is vastly different when comparing a big school and a small school. Although this may be obvious, the way that this might change your bachelor\u2019s degree path isn\u2019t necessarily as clear.\nAt a university, your classes are going to be a lot bigger than at a fine arts school, and this can change the entire dynamic depending on what you want to get out of your courses. Would you rather be in a class made up of 13 students or 300 students? Of course, it\u2019s not always going to be that much of a jump in numbers, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind.\nSmaller classes allow for a more personal relationship between you and your professor and classmates. On the other hand, larger classes can give you a greater sense of community between you and your classmates, which might give you more resources for the course.\nAdvice and Resources for Your Bachelor\u2019s Degree\nWhile the work toward a bachelor\u2019s degree rests primarily on your shoulders, it\u2019s important to know that there are many people who are more than willing to help you. However, these resources can vary drastically from a big school to a small school.\nBig schools are obviously going to have a higher number of full-time staff than smaller schools. This means that you are likely to have professors that work at your school exclusively, so they would have more available office hours than a teacher that is working three jobs. A bigger staff also allows for a bigger number of advisors in each of the academic departments, and that means that there are plenty of people who are skilled in helping you reach your goals.\nBut those reasons don\u2019t mean that large schools win in the advice category. Small schools may have a smaller staff, but they also have significantly less students. That means that you can have a stronger connection with your teachers and advisors because they have less students to interact with. And that means that you have more people invested in you earning your degree.\nTypes of Classes\nLarge schools and small schools cater to two very different types of students, and that means that the types of classes offered for your Bachelor\u2019s degree are going to be very different.\nSmaller schools, such as fine arts colleges, are attuned to help their students follow their passions, no matter how strange. For example, at my school, many gen ed classes (i.e. math, science, speech) are geared toward students in their specific majors. One course is called Physics for Filmmakers, which teaches physics through movie scenes. There are also classes focused on Harry Potter and being a DJ. Imagine taking those classes at your school.\nCourses for your bachelor\u2019s degrees at large schools, on the other hand, tend to be broader as there are more people who need to take each class. However, there are a wider ranger of majors offered, so you can dabble in a variety of subjects while earning your degree.\nUltimately there\u2019s no right or wrong way to go. What you do need to do is examine the offerings at both large and small universities, and then pick the one that speaks to our unique learning style. The better the fit, the more successful you\u2019ll be in your bachelor\u2019s degree program.\nAlexander Diedrick is a writing intern at myFoopath who has attended both a large state university and a smaller arts college.\nFind My Degree\n"}, {"score": 2456.464, "uuid": "2e39da86-5867-510f-88db-b6ed15ba9e0d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500wb-79-30925", "target_hostname": "www.geteducated.com", "target_uri": "http://www.geteducated.com/career-center/detail/what-is-a-bachelors-degree", "page_rank": 1.1920336e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "What <em>is</em> <em>a</em> <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em>? | Career Center | GetEducated.com", "snippet": "<em>Different</em> Paths to <em>a</em> College <em>Degree</em>, Sept.

It typically takes four years of full-time study to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. In these four years, you will complete 120 semester credits or about 40 college courses.\nIf your college uses a quarter system rather than a semester system, you\u2019ll need to complete a minimum of 180 quarter credits to earn an accredited bachelor\u2019s degree.\nIn most cases, more than half of a bachelor\u2019s degree consists of general education or liberal arts courses in areas such as English, critical thinking, psychology, history and mathematics.\nTypically only 30 to 36 credits\u201410 to 12 courses\u2014will be in your major area of study. Regionally accredited liberal arts colleges award most of the bachelor\u2019s degrees in the United States.\nHistorically, the term \u201ccollege degree\u201d meant a bachelor\u2019s or traditional four-year degree. The bachelor\u2019s degree remains the standard for entry into many professional careers.\nIn most cases, you cannot attend a professional graduate school in law, medicine, or teacher education unless you hold a bachelor\u2019s degree.\nWhen to Seek a Bachelor\u2019s Degree\nWhen You \u2026\n\u2022 Know that a bachelor\u2019s degree is required for your career\n\u2022 Have already earned more than 60 semester college credits or hold at least one associate degree.\n\u2022 Know that a graduate or professional degree will be required for your career.\nTIP: Some careers may require a very specific type of bachelor\u2019s degree. For example, if your goal is to become a public school teacher your state Board of Education will require, at minimum, a bachelor\u2019s degree in education \u2014and that degree will need to include some very specific courses. Check with your state licensing board before enrolling in any bachelor\u2019s degree program in accounting, education, nursing, counseling and engineering, in particular.\nTIP: Should you earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree? In most cases, the answer is NO. If you have a bachelor\u2019s in one area\u2014say art history\u2014and are trying to re-tool to work in another area, such as human resources, consider adding a certificate to your resume rather than trying to earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree. By earning a certificate you\u2019ll essentially be adding a new \u201cmajor\u201d area of study to the general education studies of your original bachelor\u2019s degree.\nShow Me an Online Bachelor\u2019s Degree\nBasically, a bachelor\u2019s degree looks like an associate degree doubled.\nBelow is a sample bachelor's degree so you can see the type of curriculum commonly required.

If you don't know which teaching degree you need, see our article, \" How to Become a Teacher .\"\nHow to Get a Master's in Education\nWhile it's hard to generalize about master's degrees, to get accepted into a master's in education, you'll first need a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. You'll generally also need to choose a specialty. For a Master in Teaching (MIT), you'll decide whether you want to teach elementary or secondary school, and/or what subject you'll teach. Special education is also a popular choice.\nFor a Master of Education (M.Ed.), you'll choose between the following specialties: Curriculum and Instruction, Educational Psychology, Educational Leadership and Policy, or Special Education.\nCoursework depends on your area of expertise, but will consist of upper-level courses (400- and 500-level, and above), educational research, exams and term papers.\nStudents must often complete a final project to fulfill their degree requirements. Depending on the school and specialty, your final project may be comprised of one\u2014or any combination\u2014of the following:\nA master's thesis overseen by an adviser\nA written exam\nA non-thesis work (research project, internship or special assignment)\nMost students find the work they do in their master's of education quite stimulating. This degree can lead to good jobs in a number of different educational settings.\nMaster's Degree in Education Program Choices\nWhether you are a newly graduated, bachelor's degree-holding hopeful or a teaching veteran looking to advance your career, there are Master's in Education programs you can complete in as little as one year. One of the biggest benefits of holding a master's degree in teaching is the ability to become a National Board Certified Teacher , whose certification will follow them throughout the country. Higher salaries, more advancement opportunities and the option of transitioning into school leadership positions such as educational administration or leadership roles are other common perks.\nFifth Year Master's Degree in Education\nFifth year master's degree programs allow college graduates to take another year of coursework and intensive student teaching to qualify for a teaching credential and a master's in education. Additional state requirements may have to be completed to become a certified teacher; however, almost all master's programs meet state requirements. Many secondary teachers choose this degree because it allows them to focus on their subject area as an undergraduate, then learn pedagogy\u2014the art of teaching\u2014as part of their graduate education.\nMaster's Degree in Education (MEd)\nOf all of your educational master's degree options, the MEd tends to be the most general degree you can get. Teachers interested in entering educational administration , leadership or research and policy do well with this degree as it provides a nice base for further educational opportunities, such as an educational specialist degree or doctorate. It is often a requirement for guidance counselors and other counseling professions.\nMaster's in Teaching (MIT)\nIf you are currently studying to become a teacher and are looking to increase your skill level and earn a higher starting salary , a master's in teaching degree may be your quickest ticket to career growth. Master's in Teaching degrees are specialized in a particular area of study, with common degree titles such as Master of Arts in Curriculum and Instruction, or Master of Arts in Special Education. They offer the most hands-on, classroom-centered classes from among your master's choices. It usually takes a minimum of 30 credit hours and includes a semester of student teaching. It is a common candidate for fifth year programs (see above), as well as night and evening classes.\nOnline Master's Degree in Education\nIn states where a master's degree isn't required to start teaching, students with a bachelor's degree may be able to continue teaching while earning their master's degree at night or online. An online master's degree in education is a great option if you work full-time or cannot commute to class, giving you the flexibility to fit continuing education into your busy schedule.

A master's degree can open up a whole new world of career opportunities, but you should start by exploring some frequently asked questions about the degree in order to determine if it is the right educational choice for you. Learn more about earning a master's degree in psychology, including how long it will take, your career options after graduation and possible alternative degrees that you might want to consider.\nWhat Is a Master's Degree in Psychology?\nA master's degree in psychology is a graduate level-degree that generally involves two to three years of study beyond the undergraduate degree. The two most common types of psychology master's degree are the Master of Arts (M.A.) and the Master of Science (M.S.). An M.A. degree may indicate a stronger liberal arts focus, while an M.S. may indicate a stronger concentration on research and the sciences. The type of degree offered may depend upon the school and program, however, since the academic requirements are often very similar.\nSome master's programs in psychology offer what is known as a terminal degree. This type of degree is designed to prepare graduates for professional practice in their specialty area. In other cases, a master's degree may serve as preparation for further study at the doctoral-level.\nSpecific course requirements can vary considerably, so take a careful look at the course outline of any program you are considering. You may also have to choose between a thesis and non-thesis option. Completing a thesis is a good choice if you are interested in further graduate study, while the non-thesis alternative might be ideal if you are more interested entering the workforce immediately after graduation.\nWhat Can You Do With a Master's Degree in Psychology?\nWhile having a master's degree means you'll find more job opportunities than you will at the bachelor's level, job options are still limited if you are interested in entering the field of professional psychology. A terminal master's program, however, does open the door to entry level jobs in fields such as mental health, industrial-organizational psychology and forensic psychology. Other sectors of employment include colleges, universities, private business and government. Learn more about some of the job options with a master's degree in psychology .\nHow Do You Earn a Master's Degree in Psychology?\nIf you are interested in pursuing a master's degree in psychology, it pays to start planning early. Take a look at the requirements of a few programs you are considering, and then be sure to schedule all of the pre-requisite courses during your years of undergraduate study. Statistics, experimental methods and developmental psychology are just a few of the common courses required by psychology graduate programs .\nBefore you apply to a master's program, you may also be required to take the Graduate Record Examination, or GRE. In addition to taking the main test, you might also need to take the GRE Psychology Subject Test .\nOnce you've been admitted to a master's program, make a course schedule that outlines all of the courses you plan to take. Take note of the required courses, and check out your school's class offering schedule. Some classes are only offered every other semester or every other year, so plan carefully to ensure that you are able to take all the classes you need.\nShould You Earn a Master's Degree Before Earning a Doctorate?\nOne of the biggest questions facing students interested in earning a graduate degree in psychology is whether or not they should earn a master's degree before applying to a doctorate program. Many Ph.D. and Psy.D. programs do not require a master's degree, and students are able to begin these doctoral programs immediately after completing their bachelor's degrees.\nIf you are unsure if doctoral study is right for you, a master's degree can be a good option. Spend some time talking to your college advisor and faculty members to determine which options is the best choice based on your educational interests and career goals.\nWhat Type of Master's Degree Should You Earn?\nWhile there are generalist programs available, many students elect to focus on a particular specialty area. Some of the different types of master's programs available include:\nM.A. or M.S. in Experimental Psychology\nM.A. or M.S. in Industrial-Organizational Psychology\nM.A. or M.S. in Forensic Psychology\nM.A. or M.S. in Clinical Psychology\nM.A. or M.S. in Social Psychology\nM.A. or M.S. in Child Development\nIn addition to traditional master's programs, there are a variety of online master's degree in psychology available. Students should carefully consider all of their options before determining which option is best suited to their needs.\nWhat Are Some Alternatives to a Master's Degree in Psychology?\nIf you determine that a master's degree in psychology is not the best choice to help you fulfill your academic and career goals, there are a number of related alternative programs to choose from. If you know that you want to work in the field of mental health, there are still plenty of other options to consider. Counseling, social work, school psychology, education and health sciences are other academic options that might also appeal to you.\nSome possible alternative degrees include:\n"}, {"score": 2400.2266, "uuid": "1491bbc2-4d1f-5768-ad10-be6c722f89e4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-23-12626", "target_hostname": "www.gatewaygourmet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.gatewaygourmet.com/blog/tag/bachelors-degree-in-culinary-arts/", "page_rank": 1.1830417e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>Degree</em> In Culinary Arts | GatewayGourmet Blog", "snippet": "<em>Bachelor\u2019s</em>&#x2F;<em>Master\u2019s</em>: <em>A</em> <em>Bachelor\u2019s</em> <em>degree</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> four-year program, offered almost always though <em>a</em> public or private university.

Depending on what type of school you attend and what the program entails, you might walk away with a certificate of completion and enough skills to get an entry-level job, or you might end with a four-year degree and a desire to keep going until you get a Master\u2019s.\nThis doesn\u2019t always make one program better than another; it just makes them suited for different professional goals. If you\u2019re considering culinary school, you\u2019ll need to determine what your goals are and which program will best help you accomplish this.\nThe Different Culinary \u201cDegrees\u201d\nWorkshop: A culinary workshop is typically a one-day, one-weekend, or other short program that offers training in a single skill. From the elements of Thai cuisine to basic knife cuts, these courses are ideal for the home cook or amateur chef. The cost tends to be low and includes supplies, and you can often find the courses through big-name culinary schools. In most cases, you\u2019ll walk away without any official \u201cdegree\u201d unless the school offers continuing education credits for working professionals.\nCertificate/Diploma: In most cases, the education you get at a private culinary school will be a certificate of completion or a diploma. In the academic setting, these have no value other than how they relate to that specific school or the culinary field as a whole. For example, Le Cordon Bleu offers a certificate program. This certificate won\u2019t help you transfer to a four-year university, and it won\u2019t have much meaning outside the culinary world, but it does indicate to your peers and employers what you have learned.\nAssociate: An Associate degree is a two-year degree that combines general education classes with your chosen specialty (in this case, culinary training or restaurant management). These degrees are offered both at community colleges and from many of the private culinary schools you\u2019ll come across. Although you\u2019ll spend most of your time in a kitchen or learning about the restaurant industry, you will have to meet standards in math, English, social sciences, and communication.\nBachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s: A Bachelor\u2019s degree is a four-year program, offered almost always though a public or private university. The Master\u2019s degree is similar, though it takes six years in all (or two years above and beyond a Bachelor\u2019s degree). In terms of strict culinary training, these degrees are rare. If you do intend to seek a Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree, you\u2019ll most likely combine culinary skills with business or hospitality management . In this way, these degrees can cross fields, and if you decide to leave the restaurant industry, you may be able to apply your skills elsewhere.\nAttending culinary school can be a great step toward your future. Make sure you evaluate all your professional and personal goals before you get started, since it can be difficult to change schools in the middle of the program without having to backtrack or take on additional costs.\nRelated Topics:\n"}, {"score": 2399.6348, "uuid": "8daac168-5f02-55b3-9305-9a13581e6fc6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-53-25158", "target_hostname": "www.mustuniversity.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mustuniversity.com/must/accrediteddegreeprogram.asp", "page_rank": 1.2429208e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Online Accredited Degrees | Associate, <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em>, <em>Master&#x27;s</em> &amp; Doctorate", "snippet": "By filling in the following form, you can email us and get <em>a</em> guaranteed response with in 24 hours.

Students have countless opportunities and career options after obtaining a Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration because it\u2019s disciplines are in demand in every area of the workforce. More and more top positions of organizations are being filled by individuals who have obtained their M.B.A. in Business Administration.\nMaster\u2019s Programs in Business Administration offer the student different specialties and seek to provide a knowledge and expertise that prepares the student to organize, direct, and control a modern-day firm or organization and to solve complex business problems. Specialties make the graduate more marketable and include Organizational Management, Information Technology Management, International Business, Finance/Accounting, Health Care, and Entrepreneurship. The Master\u2019s level education offered by many colleges and universities offers students the ability to work directly with organizations on real-world business issues and projects, enabling students to gain first-hand knowledge of the dynamics of many management issues. Completion times for a Master\u2019s degree vary depending on the student\u2019s level of attendance, but typically allows students who work full-time to obtain their M.B.A in one to two years and slightly longer if the student is specializing. The average cost of an M.B.A again depends on a students specialization, but ranges anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000. It is important to research the many different M.B.A programs, as many do not accept students who have not worked in the field for at least four to five years.\nThe Internet has dramatically changed the way that Business Administration Master\u2019s degree programs are administered to students. The online M.B.A. degree programs in Business Administration offered by many colleges and universities have made it more convenient than ever to obtain an education in the industry. Several colleges offer online programs in which students can earn their Business Administration degree from the comfort of their own homes according to their own schedule, in addition to more convenient evening and weekend courses for those students who still prefer the traditional classroom setting. Many colleges and universities also offer students internships and Credit for Prior Learning programs in the Business Administration disciplines.\nTopics covered in an M.B.A. program vary depending on the student\u2019s specialty. They range from Economics, Marketing, Business Strategy, Quality Management, Data Administration, International Management, Competitive Analysis, Global Marketing, Investments, and Labor Economics. Among the colleges and universities offering Master\u2019s programs in Business Administration include Capella University, University of Phoenix, and Warren National University.

Why? Although, studying through DL is harder (because the course work is basically dumped on the student who has to swim out of it alone), in my opinion, DL programs are notoriously passive and this does not serve young people well because of the absence of face-to-face social interaction, which is critical to developing inter-personal and other soft skills - critical skills that serve students well (after they graduate) in their professional careers. So I would seriously discourage against going the DL route for the first BS degree.\nPosts\n533\nThere's only a few situations where I would recommend a young person pursue an online degree.

I think the college experience is incredibly overrated and over-romanticized. Of course, I only have a minimal B&M experience, and it wasn't even on-campus, so I am not talking from personal experience... but let's be real for a second.\nPeople go ga ga and blah blah over how great college is for teaching you to meet deadlines and keep appointments. Uh, yeah, so does a job. By the way does this REALLY take four years to learn? LOL. Try being an unreliable employee for a week, and you will learn quickly that your mommy, daddy, uncle and guidance counselor were not joking with you for all of those years. Therefore, when people say \"college helps you prepare for the real world\" I say, \"yeah... so does the real world.\"\nSecond, this idea about being exposed to people of differing backgrounds and opinions. Unless you live in a commune, such people are not to hard to find outside of a college campus. They're everywhere! Just say hi to one of them, or something. A combination of volunteer work, paid work in an urban setting, public ministry and travel have done the trick just nicely for me. I wish there was a way to count, but I'm nearly certain that by the time my high school classmates graduated from college, I had friends from many more states and many more countries than just about any one of them did... but I can top them in that my friends came of all ages and social statuses, not just in the typical college aged, can-afford-it, crowd. Then there's the fact that you can actually get to know these people, rather than just sit on opposite ends of the same room while staring towards the front of it.\nLastly, if you can get your degree with comparable academic rigor, with less of an overall investment of time an money, you are getting a much better start in life. Why not suggest to your daughter that she take up a language using the time that she would normally be traveling to/from/between classes, and the time that she saved by taking some extra CLEPs. Afterwards, she can report to you whether that time was more wisely spent learning a real-world skill, and that money more wisely spent on real-world expenses.\nSo... there it is, my polar opinion. An online degree is the way to go. If one is worried about name recognition, then FOOOEY, there are B&M's with fantastic reputations that offer degrees that can be done by distance. Even if it can't be done fully by distance, they will in almost all cases accept some CLEP and some transfer credit from online courses, to make a balance of the situation (which doesn't have to be limited to just online or just B&M, anyway).\n***This message was brought to you by the letters M and C.***\nEducation Degrees\nEducation Degrees\nTeachers play an important role in fostering the intellectual and social development of children during their formative years. The education that students acquire is key to determining the future of those students. Whether in elementary or high schools or in private or public schools, teachers provide the tools and the environment for their students to develop into responsible adults.\nTeachers act as facilitators or coaches, using classroom presentations or individual instruction to help students learn and apply concepts in subjects such as science, mathematics, and English. They plan, evaluate, and assign lessons; prepare, administer, and grade tests; listen to oral presentations; and maintain classroom discipline. Teachers observe and evaluate a student's performance and potential. They are increasingly asked to use new assessment methods\n\u0095Public school teachers must be licensed, which typically requires a bachelor's degree and the completion of an approved teacher education program; private school teachers do not have to be licensed but may still need a bachelor's degree.\n\u0095Job prospects are best for teachers in high-demand fields, such as mathematics, science, and bilingual education, and in less desirable urban or rural school districts.\n\u0095Teachers must have the ability to communicate, inspire trust and confidence, and motivate students, as well as understand students' educational and emotional needs.\n"}, {"score": 2353.9478, "uuid": "d51878e3-c6c8-51a7-a42c-726242c09728", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200wb-84-20167", "target_hostname": "www.getdegrees.com", "target_uri": "http://www.getdegrees.com/d/master-degrees/psychology", "page_rank": 1.1928942e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Psychology - Online Psychology <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Programs", "snippet": "Psychology <em>is</em> <em>a</em> part of everyday life, as <em>a</em> person&#x27;s psychology <em>is</em> what drives them to do the things they do.

These career options might initially appear to have little to do with the field of psychology. However, an undergraduate education in psychology helps students develop skills that are important in a variety of careers.\nTypical Career Options\nMany students graduating with a bachelor's degree will work in some division of human or social services. Some common job titles in the area include:\nCase Management\nRehabilitation Specialist\nPsychiatric Technician\nSome important skills for those working in this area include the ability to assess client needs, keep thorough and accurate records, express care and empathy and to act as an advocate for your client.\nIn addition to social services, a bachelor's in psychology can provide excellent training for many other types of jobs. Some of the most important things you have learned during your undergraduate years are interpersonal skills. Your understanding of the human mind and behavior make you a good candidate for jobs that require good communication skills. Some examples jobs in this area include those in sales, marketing, case management and social services.\nAs an undergraduate, you have also done a considerable amount of research and writing. This skill would be useful in many jobs such as a library assistant, probation officer, business manager, case worker and many others.\nWhen searching for your first post-graduation job, be sure to consider all of the skills you have acquired during your time as a student. Make a list of things you learned in various classes to help you assess your skills and talents in order to find a job best suited to your educational background and professional goals.\nPsychology Degree's are Flexible and Adaptable\nA bachelor's degree in psychology is sometimes seen as a stepping stone toward a graduate degree. In fact, as many as 40 percent of psychology majors end up going on to business school, law school or some other type of advanced degree program. However, there are many different types of career options for those with a bachelor's psychology degree.\nAccording to Charles Brewer, a psychology professor at Furman University, looking at psychology undergraduate degrees as simply a step toward an advanced degree is often a mistake. \"A lot of people think that in order to do anything with a degree in psychology you must get a Ph.D and become a psychologist,\" he explained in an article by CNN. \"Most parents, even if they are professionals in their own right, don't understand what opportunities are open to psych majors.\" He also suggests that the biggest advantage of a bachelor's degree in psychology is its adaptability.\nSo what are the most commonly held careers for those with a bachelors degree in psychology? According to The College Majors Handbook, some of the top occupations that employ those with a bachelor's psychology degree are:\nTop- and mid-level management and administration\nSales\n"}, {"score": 2342.0505, "uuid": "7f935025-2ce4-5332-a6d7-00725cf6b602", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0808wb-56-00134", "target_hostname": "www.drexel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/education-degrees/ms-si/curriculum.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1979165e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Teaching <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> online", "snippet": "Students need only to complete three graduate quarters to be eligible to obtain <em>a</em> <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Teaching, Learning and Curriculum.

and as MA Psychologists in various other states, depending upon their licensing laws].\nQ: What is the Focus of the Program?\nA: The focus of the program is on forensic psychology, and \u00a0mental health disability law. \u00a0In addition to the MA in forensic psychology, students will be required to include 12 online credits about aspects of mental health disability law offered by NYLS.\nQ: How Many Credits are Required for Graduation?\nA: The curriculum is composed of the existing required and elective courses for the MA and for the JD, \u00a0requiring a combined total of 128 credits, including 42 credits for the completion of the MA Program in Forensic Psychology and 86 credits for the completion of the JD Program in Law. \u00a0However, 12 New York Law School online credits focusing on mental disability law will be credited towards both the JD and the MA Program. \u00a0Likewise 12 MA credits from the John Jay Forensic Psychology MA Program will be credited also to the New York Law School JD program. \u00a0Consequently, due to the 24 transfer credits applied in the dual degree program, the actual number of credits taken will be 104, resulting in graduation for full-time students in four years instead of five.\nQ: What is the Course Sequence?\nA: Students may begin their training in either the MA or the JD program, but the first year must be exclusively in one program, followed by the second year exclusively in the other program. \u00a0Students may then mix their courses between the two programs in their third and fourth years.\nThe MA Program in Forensic Psychology will consist of 24 required credits; 15 forensic elective credits, including 12 credits from the NY Law School Mental Health and Disability Law track; and 3 credits of externship. \u00a0The JD from New York Law School will consist of 41 required credits, 12 credits from the Mental Disability Law Studies, 12 transfer credits from the\u00a0JJC MA Forensic Psychology Program, and 21 additional law school elective credits.\nA typical course sequence for a student choosing to start in the MA Program would look like this: First Year at\u00a0JJC would cover Mental Health Professionals & the Law, Research Methods, Psychopathology, Statistics, Human Growth & Development, Criminal Psychological Assessment, Advanced Forensic Assessment, and Clinical Interviewing.\nSecond Year at\u00a0NYLS would include Civil Procedure, Contracts, Torts, Legal Reasoning, Property, Criminal Law, Advocacy, Legislation, and Lawyering.\nThird Year at both would include Survey of Mental Disability Law, Forensic Psychology Elective, Constitutional Law I, Two\u00a0NYLS electives, Professional Responsibility, Mental Health Disability Elective, Constitutional Law II, and Evidence.\nFourth Year at both would include two\u00a0NYLS Mental Health Disability (online) Electives, 5 additional\u00a0NYLS electives, and the\u00a0JJC psychology externship.\nQ: What are the Admissions Requirements?\nA: Applicants must apply to both programs for the joint dual-degree program. \u00a0For admission to the MA Program, a bachelor\u2019s degree, with an undergraduate minimum GPA of 3.0;

Depending on what type of school you attend and what the program entails, you might walk away with a certificate of completion and enough skills to get an entry-level job, or you might end with a four-year degree and a desire to keep going until you get a Master\u2019s.\nThis doesn\u2019t always make one program better than another; it just makes them suited for different professional goals. If you\u2019re considering culinary school, you\u2019ll need to determine what your goals are and which program will best help you accomplish this.\nThe Different Culinary \u201cDegrees\u201d\nWorkshop: A culinary workshop is typically a one-day, one-weekend, or other short program that offers training in a single skill. From the elements of Thai cuisine to basic knife cuts, these courses are ideal for the home cook or amateur chef. The cost tends to be low and includes supplies, and you can often find the courses through big-name culinary schools. In most cases, you\u2019ll walk away without any official \u201cdegree\u201d unless the school offers continuing education credits for working professionals.\nCertificate/Diploma: In most cases, the education you get at a private culinary school will be a certificate of completion or a diploma. In the academic setting, these have no value other than how they relate to that specific school or the culinary field as a whole. For example, Le Cordon Bleu offers a certificate program. This certificate won\u2019t help you transfer to a four-year university, and it won\u2019t have much meaning outside the culinary world, but it does indicate to your peers and employers what you have learned.\nAssociate: An Associate degree is a two-year degree that combines general education classes with your chosen specialty (in this case, culinary training or restaurant management). These degrees are offered both at community colleges and from many of the private culinary schools you\u2019ll come across. Although you\u2019ll spend most of your time in a kitchen or learning about the restaurant industry, you will have to meet standards in math, English, social sciences, and communication.\nBachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s: A Bachelor\u2019s degree is a four-year program, offered almost always though a public or private university. The Master\u2019s degree is similar, though it takes six years in all (or two years above and beyond a Bachelor\u2019s degree). In terms of strict culinary training, these degrees are rare. If you do intend to seek a Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree, you\u2019ll most likely combine culinary skills with business or hospitality management .

Where would I start?\nConsultants with master\u2019s degrees represent a broad spectrum of experience. Your role upon beginning your career at McKinsey depends on your academic and professional background. Generally, if you earned an undergraduate degree fewer than four years ago, you\u2019ll be considered for a business analyst position; if you earned your undergraduate degree more than four years ago, you\u2019ll be considered for an associate position.\nWe understand that the additional training you received and the expertise you developed by attaining a master\u2019s degree add value to your work as a McKinsey consultant. McKinsey was the first consulting firm to systematically hire consultants with advanced professional degrees outside of business, and currently, more than 3,000 of our consultants worldwide hold master\u2019s degrees in fields other than business.\nOften, because of their professional experience, business analysts with master\u2019s degrees show promise immediately, putting them on a fast track for promotion to associate. At McKinsey, consultants advance based on performance\u2014not background or tenure\u2014so if you perform well, you\u2019ll be considered for early promotion.\nHere are some example scenarios for possible entry points to a career at McKinsey:\n\u2022\u00a0 If you are interested in the German office and hold a bachelor\u2019s degree and completed a one-year master\u2019s program, you will join as a fellow.\n\u2022\u00a0 If you are interested in joining the U.K.&Ireland office with a master's degree, you will typically join as a business analyst.\n\u2022\u00a0 If you are interested in a North American office and hold a bachelor\u2019s degree and have work experience or completed a three- to four-year master\u2019s program/PhD track, you will join as an associate.\nLearn more about the business analyst role at McKinsey.\nWhat do business analysts and associates do?\nBusiness analysts take responsibility for one part of the larger problem-solving effort on a client engagement; associates lead a key portion of an engagement. Consultants in both roles typically begin their careers at McKinsey as generalist consultants. They contribute to every aspect of a project, from fact gathering to analysis to implementation. They also collaborate with senior consultants and client leadership, participating in brainstorming, problem solving, and client communication and working on-site with clients to implement McKinsey\u2019s recommendations.\nYou might conduct market research to help a high-tech client launch a new product, manage media communications for a major corporate merger, or revamp the processes in a client\u2019s human resources program. Your day-to-day work will vary depending on the client you\u2019re working with and the problem you\u2019re addressing. And with each engagement, you\u2019ll be challenged to take on new responsibilities and master new skills.\nDepending on your experience, you may consider specializing by joining one of our 18 industry practices, such as financial services or telecommunications, or one of our seven functional practices, which focus on core business disciplines such as marketing, operations, and strategy.\nHowever you choose to shape your career at McKinsey, you\u2019ll be recognized as a valuable team member on each client study, and your voice will be heard. All consultants, regardless of role or tenure, are expected to shape discussions, solve critical client problems, and contribute at the highest level.\nLearn more about the associate role .\nI earned my master\u2019s degree in a field I\u2019m interested in, but I would be open to trying something new. Can I explore new subject areas at McKinsey?\nWhether you work in the area of your existing expertise or move beyond your discipline will be up to you.\nYou could be hired as a generalist consultant, or you could choose to enter one of our industry or functional practices. Generalist consultants work on projects in a variety of industries and take on responsibilities in all aspects and stages of each client study. This option gives you the widest choice, the most diverse professional experiences, and the opportunity to learn about different industries and functions. Joining one of McKinsey\u2019s practices requires some expertise in and an affinity for a particular area\u2014be it an industry practice such as pharmaceuticals or a functional practice such as corporate finance. You\u2019ll spend most of your time on projects in your chosen area, but you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to apply your skills in others.\nMcKinsey\u2019s clients come from a wide array of industries, and we serve them as experts in a variety of core business functions. As a McKinsey consultant, you might advise one of the world\u2019s largest consumer electronics companies in developing a new product, devise a growth strategy for a new biotech firm, or work on a merger integration between two industrial goods companies. With each engagement, you\u2019ll have the chance to apply your skills and expertise in new ways to solve critical problems for the world\u2019s top organizations.\nLearn more about our industries and functions .\nIs a master\u2019s degree enough to ensure my success at McKinsey, or should I get my PhD before applying?\nWhile we value consultants with PhDs for the strong problem-solving skills and deep topic expertise they bring to the firm, a consultant does not need a doctorate to succeed. In fact, more than one-third of our consultants hold master\u2019s degrees in fields other than business as their highest degrees.\nThe same qualities that led you to earn your master\u2019s degree\u2014critical problem solving, intellectual rigor, and the desire to delve deeper into a subject of interest\u2014will help you succeed as a consultant.

If you choose to pursue a PhD, we support your choice and hope you\u2019ll consider joining the firm once you\u2019ve completed the program.\nWhat will my peers be like?\nMcKinsey consultants come from all backgrounds and education levels, from new graduates with bachelor\u2019s degrees to consultants with advanced professional degrees to experienced professionals. Diverse backgrounds help create dynamic client study teams.\nJoining as a business analyst is a two-year commitment, and during that time, you\u2019ll become close to your fellow business analysts. Each business analyst class is generally active socially, with plenty of opportunities to bond as a group through training programs and class events. At the end of the two-year program, you and your peers will decide how to proceed\u2014some stay with the firm, some choose to pursue another academic degree, some find jobs in industries that interest them, and some choose to participate in McKinsey\u2019s Global Rotation Program, which allows them to join McKinsey offices abroad temporarily.\nIf you join as an associate, you\u2019ll be part of the community of McKinsey consultants who hold advanced professional degrees, including PhDs, JDs, MDs and nonbusiness master\u2019s degrees. Special training programs and business education opportunities will give you the chance to spend time with your peers while you learn the core skills you need to succeed as a consultant.\nBeginning with your first client engagement, you\u2019ll learn that working on a McKinsey team involves more than work; it can be fun, too. You\u2019ll get to know your team members\u2014those with business backgrounds and those without\u2014during and after working hours. Many consultants develop lasting friendships while working closely on projects. With each client engagement, you\u2019ll add to the personal network of mentors and colleagues that you\u2019ll rely on throughout your time at McKinsey and beyond.\nWhat opportunities for professional growth and development does McKinsey offer?\nThere are more than 3,000 McKinsey consultants worldwide who hold master\u2019s degrees in fields other than business, and there are more than 13,500 in our global network of alumni. Some consultants stay to become partners; some join clients in an area they\u2019ve become passionate about; and some go on to become leaders in organizations they became familiar with while working at McKinsey.\nAs a consultant, you\u2019ll benefit from an accelerated career path. You\u2019ll be constantly challenged to expand your skill set and take on new leadership roles, and you\u2019ll be promoted based on your performance. This merit-based system means advancement happens much faster than in academia or the corporate world.\nIt also means that, while expectations are high, you won\u2019t be competing against your fellow consultants. With our emphasis on informal mentorship and our firmwide culture of support, you\u2019ll get the help and advice you need to step confidently into roles with new and greater responsibilities.\nWhether you choose to stay with the firm or move on, you\u2019ll find that joining McKinsey expands your career options and creates new possibilities for growth.

Consultants with master\u2019s degrees have a proven record of success at the firm.\nWe\u2019ll provide the business knowledge to help you do your best work and perform comfortably and confidently in the business world.

As this study shows, workers who only have a high school diploma have a higher unemployment rate than college graduates. In addition, high school graduates with no additional education will make a media annual wage of $30,000 to $35,000 in their mid-twenties and thirties, while college graduates of the same age will take home closer to $50,000.

Both degrees will require you to take a wide range of classes to gain a liberal arts education; however, the Bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of Science will be more heavily focused on science and mathematics. Students who study biology, chemistry, or ecology would graduate with a Bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of science, while students who major in English, foreign languages, or psychology would graduate with a Bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of the Arts.\nNot All Bachelor\u2019s Degree Programs Require a Major Right Away \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nWe get a lot of calls and emails from high school seniors and incoming college freshmen who are worried that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they want to major in. Take a deep breath and relax: you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to declare your major right away. In fact, many colleges and universities encourage you to take a wide variety of classes your freshmen year to get a sense of all the majors available to you. Once you know what interests you the most, then you can talk to an academic advisor about declaring your major.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 But Some Specialty Bachelor\u2019s Programs Do\nWhile many bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree programs don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require you to declare your major right away, there are a few that do. These specialty programs, such as nursing or engineering , require a highly-specialized level of training, and therefore you generally start taking classes in that field right away. If you know you want to go into a specialized field, contact an admissions representative at the college you plan on attending to find out what you need to do to get started.\nYes, You Can Change Your Major\nMany incoming freshmen feel anxious about declaring a major because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re worried they might change their mind. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not the first college student to be unsure about your studies. If you start down one educational path and realize you need to change course, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s totally doable. Just try to change majors before you junior year if possible, as that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be completing much of your field studies. The longer you wait to switch, you could run the risk of having to stay in school and extra semester or two to complete your required classes.\nDo you have a question about your bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree programs?

Upon conferral of the degree, the post-nominal letters M.A. may be used.\nThere is no examination or study required for the degree beyond those required for the undergraduate Bachelors programs.\nThe three year waiting period required reflects that the graduate has acquired six or seven years' seniority as a member of the university.\nThe historical basis of this award dates from the Middle Ages, when traditionally the study of the liberal arts took seven years. In between matriculation and the granting of a license to teach, which was awarded at the end of undergraduate study, and upon which the Master in Arts degree was conferred, an intermediate baccalaureate or Bachelors\u2019 degree was taken. Upon eventual admission to the degree of Master in Arts, a student would become a full member of the university, with the rights and privileges contained therein.\nThis tradition is continued today at The University of Dublin (and at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge) in which the conferral of the Master in Arts, reflects the senior status achieved by the student and their entitlement to membership of the Senate, the legislative body of the University.\n"}, {"score": 2228.2512, "uuid": "bf3aeb05-2b8a-59d6-a729-a329d6549789", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1713wb-88-08580", "target_hostname": "www.findyoureducation.com", "target_uri": "http://www.findyoureducation.com/tp2/oed/business/masters/schools.do?zip=&careerInterestId=101&degreeTypeId=30", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Online <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Programs | Business Studies", "snippet": "Our <em>degree</em> programs are designed for adults with <em>different</em> levels of experience, <em>from</em> new students who have never attended <em>a</em> university to those interested in advancing or changing their careers.", "explanation": null, "document": "Online Master's Degree Programs | Business Studies\nFind online degrees:\nRequest information\nThe University of Phoenix offers accredited online and campus programs in business, communications, criminal justice, education, health care, psychology, and technology.

Taking the degree will involve training on both the artistic and technological aspects of the field. What the degree hopes to achieve is the production of web design professionals equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills, and understanding to produce good web pages and build notable websites by ensuring site navigability, accessibility, and usability.\nDegree Choices\nIf you\u2019re here asking the question \u201cWhat is a web design degree\u201d you should be assured there are multiple degree choices available to you. Web design degrees are offered both on-site and in the online environments. A certificate program in web design will provide students the basic skills in website design including animation, page edit, web video production, and web graphics. Diploma programs will most likely include courses in computer literacy while having opportunities to explore site-design models; the various styles and designs used by personal, commercial, and government sites; and various tools, techniques, and software applications.\nAssociate degree courses in web design will already include courses in marketing and business management in addition to computer-based courses. Students can also expect to study different types of computer operating systems plus extensive coursework on graphic design and HTML programming. Graduates are expected to develop online working skills that can ably address customer needs.\nA bachelors program would entail the completion of all the required classes that will enable the student to gain a comprehensive understanding of the web design field. Aside from computer-based and multimedia application, students will also have to complete courses in business management, advertising, marketing, and financial planning. Students will likewise be allowed to specialize on a particular area of interest.\nCareer Paths for those asking What is a Web Design Degree?\nGraduates of web design degrees will have career opportunities as web designers for design marketing and advertising firms, usability specialists working to help companies build strong websites, or a design firm principal who runs his own design firm. Completion of a web design degree also opens up opportunities for entrepreneurship in the web design and development industry. Web design students are encouraged to invest in good computers and other equipments since they are expected to use their equipment as long as they are in the business of web design, whether as an employee or a business owner. This should answer the question what is a web design degree.\nSchool Rankings\n"}, {"score": 2214.0215, "uuid": "ec063c81-c342-5cc8-815c-cde73b0195cd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-38-32129", "target_hostname": "www.onlinedegrees.com", "target_uri": "http://www.onlinedegrees.com/master/business/", "page_rank": 1.2422676e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Online <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Programs in Business", "snippet": "Expand your career horizons with an online <em>degree</em> <em>from</em> Everest University Online.

While some types of jobs only require plenty of experience, others require more education than what can come from experience. Some positions, like a massage therapist, may only require a certification. Other types of employment may require an associate or bachelor\u2019s degree. Many of the most well paid positions out there require a Master\u2019s degree or higher, in order for a candidate to be considered worthy of even applying. The trouble is that most people don\u2019t have a Master\u2019s degree. In fact, only about nine percent of the American population over the age of 18 has a Master\u2019s degree.\nWhy Don\u2019t More People Have a Master\u2019s Degree?\nWith the type of success that can be obtained by a person with a Master\u2019s degree, one would think that more people would take the steps necessary to obtain one. The truth is that many people don\u2019t go on to pursue an education past high school, so even fewer obtain an associate\u2019s degree or bachelor\u2019s degree, let alone the highly coveted Master\u2019s degree.\nThere are many reasons for this. The first is that school isn\u2019t for everyone. Many people get along in their desired employment field with the amount of education they currently possess, with no need to go any further than that. While many people seek education for personal enrichment, values are different and college isn\u2019t for everyone.\nAnother factor in the decision of whether or not to pursue a Master\u2019s degree, or any type of degree under it, is that there are significant costs involved. While the United States Government does offer some help through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid Program, this is not always enough to cover the costs for many folks. Student loans are expensive, and many people do not see the value in taking out a loan to pursue a higher education.\nThe Benefits of a Master\u2019s Degree\nHaving a Master\u2019s degree has a variety of benefits. Different people pursue this coveted degree for different reasons. Some people wish to advance in their careers and do not see that as a possibility without pursuing a higher education. Others want to make more money and feel that educating themselves is the best way to qualify for a raise.\nWhile many people seek a Master\u2019s degree for financial enrichment, other people seek the education for personal enrichment. There is nothing like completing something momentous, and coursework leading up to a Master\u2019s degree is momentous, to say the least. For those who hold a good education in high regard, having a Master\u2019s degree is important and can lead to great things in life.\nJust because only nine percent of the adult population has a Master\u2019s degree doesn\u2019t mean the degree is not important. What it does mean is that those who do hold such degrees are esteemed, the cream of the crop in many regards, and have the potential to go far in life and in their careers.\n"}, {"score": 2192.8594, "uuid": "6ba8d4f0-9d65-552c-ac5b-a27263103516", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-10-17137", "target_hostname": "siam.org", "target_uri": "http://siam.org/students/resources/guidelines.php", "page_rank": 1.1759708e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "SIAM: SIAM Guidelines for <em>a</em> Professional <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em>", "snippet": "The most challenging aspect of designing this <em>degree</em> <em>is</em> the Internship and Work Experience category.

This interest arises from the demand for more broadly-trained, quantitatively competent professionals and from the success of in-place and emerging programs. The influential 1995 SIAM report, \"Mathematics in Industry,\" (MII) documents a need for graduates who are trained in a combination of mathematics, applications, and computation.\nA core curriculum is suggested of scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, statistics, applied analysis, as well as a course from among discrete mathematics, differential equations, or optimization. The core includes a concentration in a field of application and an internship in business, government or industry. A complete master's degree curriculum will include course work or training in presentation and writing skills.\nThe core curriculum is not intended to be a monolith. Examples of master's programs may be found on the web; a search of http://www.sciencemasters.com/students/ will produce several such lists. Successful master's programs demonstrate the wide spectrum of curricula possible. What they have in common is a suite of courses that includes the essentials of analytical, computational, and stochastic modeling; an intern experience; and provision for the learning of presentation and writing skills. These are the sine qua non of a master's program that offers a realistic preparation for working with engineers, scientists, or managers.\nIntroduction\nTwo articles on the applied master's degree appeared in the September 1985 issue of SIAM News. One article noted that the MS degree is often treated by PhD-granting institutions as a mere way station on the path to a PhD. Unlike such fields as biology, engineering, and psychology, mathematics has not recognized the Master's as a terminal degree [3]. In the second article, it is noted that industry is not hypnotized by the mere presence of a PhD. Thomas Morrisette, with 15 years of industrial experience suggests that, \"Most of my employers would regard a PhD as proof that its holder couldn't find, let alone solve, a problem in the 'real world'.[5]\" Similar, though more diplomatic, statements can be found in the ground-breaking 1995 SIAM report, \"Mathematics in Industry.[2]\" This report documents a need for graduates who are trained in a combination of mathematics, applications, and computation, whatever the degree is. The MII report also makes it clear that an applied master's degree is a good match for many positions in business, government, or industry.\nEven prior to 1985, there were programs that produced employable MS-holders in applied mathematics. Clemson, the Claremont Colleges, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Washington State University all had successful programs, yet they were emulated by few other schools. Instead, universities extended their limited resources by going into expensive PhD programs, although there was no indication that their candidates\u0097most of whom were innocent of modeling in any form\u0097would find positions.\nThe first panel discussion on the applied MS degree was held in 1987 [4]. The panel was held under the auspices of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), but the organizer, moderator, and panelists were all SIAM members. The ring was closed ten years later with a panel discussion at the 1997 SIAM Annual Meeting at Stanford University, A Proposed Curriculum for the Professional MS Degree [6]. This panel marked the first time that the SIAM Education Committee aired a curriculum.\nMuch of the credit for generating recent interest in this degree is due to the work of Avner Friedman when he was at the University of Minnesota. Although he prefers the adjective \"industrial,\" this term should be understood as shorthand for \"business, government, or industry.\" (Even that is too restrictive, since it excludes many non-profit organizations.) The term, \"Professional Master's Degree\" was suggested by Friedman in 1991 at a meeting of the Board on Mathematical Sciences [1].\nRationale\nThe \"Mathematics in Industry\" report is perhaps the first official document by any mathematics organization dominated by PhDs that recognizes MS-holders and their contributions [2]. This report is both a symptom and a contributing cause of the increased attention that is being paid to the MS degree by business, government, and industry. It is worth noting that the approximate MS:PhD ratio of employed mathematicians is 9:1.\nThe goals of the MII report are: 1) to examine the roles of non-academic mathematicians and characterize their working environment; and 2) to use the views of non-academic mathematicians and their managers to suggest changes in the conventional graduate curriculum that will better prepare students for available employment opportunities.\nThe MII Executive Summary lists the first most important backgrounds or skills for a non-academic mathematician. Following is a list of one-word renditions:\nModeling\nInterdisciplinary\nCommunications\nThe MII report urges graduate schools to develop curricula that will impart to their students the five backgrounds and skills listed above. They are features of practically every attempt at curriculum change. It should be noted that the last four can be considered consequences of the first.\nHitherto, no organization has proposed curriculum guidelines for an applied master's degree. The MII report provides the impetus, basic rationale, and many of the concepts for constructing and publishing a set of guidelines for a professional master's degree in the mathematical sciences. In the publication of such guidelines, SIAM exercised its leadership responsibilities in the area of applied mathematical curricula.\nProgram Guidelines for a Professional MS Degree\nThe foundation of a professional MS degree includes depth in some field of application and breadth of training in applications. Modeling is the common thread that runs throughout the curriculum. An extended experience in an actual problem-solving situation, preferably in a team setting, is essential. Finally, the student must be provided with opportunities to enhance presentation and communication skills.\nThese are guides (not a straitjacket) for courses, credit hours, and other experiences. The implementation of a program might require modification as determined by the location of the school and the nature of its mathematics department. Curricula can be quite different and yet capture the spirit and essence of these guidelines.\nThe program has three distinct aspects: course curriculum, internship or work experience, and communication skills.\nCourse Curriculum\nCORE COURSES\nScientific Computing 6 credit hours\nIntroduction to numerical methods for solving scientific problems, using a modern program language (such as C/C++) and/or using modern tools like MatLab. Includes an introduction to elements of high performance computing and scientific visualization.\nNumerical Linear Algebra 3 credit hours\nMathematical and numerical study of direct and iterative methods for solutions of linear systems. Topics include SVD, least squares computations and methods for computations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\nStatistics 3 credit hours\nApplied mathematical statistics and data analysis.\nMethods of Applied Analysis 3 credit hours\nFunctional analysis with applications to applied mathematics. Topics include metric and normed linear spaces, bounded and compact operators, inner product and Hilbert spaces, self-adjoint operators, orthogonal expansions and Fourier analysis.\nOptimization 3 credit hours\nLinear, unconstrained and constrained optimizations.\nOne of the following two courses:\nDiscrete Mathematics 3 credit hours\nGraphs, combinatorial optimization, integer programming, discrete algorithms.\nDifferential Equations 3 credit hours\nIntroduction to ordinary differential equations from a modern dynamical systems perspective or an introduction to partial differential equations. Focus on modeling and computational method.\nField of Application 9 credit hours\nThree courses in which the student gains familiarity with the key concepts of the field and is able to contribute to the solution of problems faced by practitioners in the field. Some examples of suitable fields are biology, bioinformatics, engineering, environmental science, finance, genetics, and management science. An alternative arrangement might consist of two courses combined with three credit hours in an internship in the field of application.\nTOTAL: 30 credit hours\nInternship or Work Experience\nInternships at a business, government, or industrial site involving experience on a project. The project should involve cooperation between the site mentor and the student's faculty advisor. The content, scope and objective(s) should be spelled out in advance. This can be done in the three ways listed below, starting with the most desirable:\nFull-time experience on a site for at least one month.\nOne day a week on a site for a period of one semester.\nSummer workshops such as those at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (University of Minnesota) and North Carolina State University.\nShould none of these three options be available, an extended experience on a campus computer, statistics, or applied mathematics lab might be used as a substitute. One danger is that this could result in a year of similar experiences rather than the progressive build-up expected from a structured, guided project.\nCommunication Skills\nSkills in communication are essential when working with a team, the usual mode for solving complex problems. Thus, writing and presenting are an important part of any master's program in applied mathematics. On-the-job experience is an excellent way to learn and to test these skills. Following are a few examples of some ways to bolster a student's confidence in writing and in making presentations.\nInvite engineers, managers, or scientists from local industry to give talks\nHave students give presentations, with constructive evaluation from peers and faculty\nInvite campus engineers, scientists, or administrators to make presentations\nInvite staff from your communication and personnel departments to give seminars\nEncourage students to give papers at professional meetings.\nSome Working Programs\nA list of university programs that satisfy the essentials of the criteria in each of the three categories (Course Curriculum, Internship or Work Experience, and Communication Skills) will be posted on the SIAM Web site in the near future.\nThe most challenging aspect of designing this degree is the Internship and Work Experience category. It is very difficult to learn how to approach off-campus firms for internship arrangements from reading a pamphlet. Consultants should have had such experiences, as well as fairly intimate knowledge of how to organize and secure funding for clinics or similar on-campus centers for providing students with the equivalent of on-the-job experience.\nReferences\nBoard on Mathematical Sciences, National Academy of Science (1991).

But, how can you evaluate it? Well, there are multiple criteria on the basis of which you can decide whether a graduate program is the most suitable for you. When it comes to choosing a graduate school, there are some of the most common and important criteria that people use. Given below are some of the most important criteria that can really help you make a well informed decision when you plan to get enrolled into a graduate program.\nAccreditation\nThere are several careers where you would need to go for an accredited degree program to become successful. However, accreditation is not only program or degree-based, accreditations are also given to institutions. So, students need to consider both the program specific accreditations and academic institution accreditations. Let us take an example. If you are pursuing a degree in law from an unaccredited law school, you will not be allowed to sit for the bar exam. The case is similar with a host of other careers, where licensure requirements exist.\nCost of Attendance & Financial Assistance\nCollege education expenses and tuition fees are rising continuously. And most of us have a tough time when it comes to bearing the cost of college education. Therefore, considering the cost of attendance is one of the most important issues when we consider enrolling into a graduate program. Whether it is the tuition fees, book expenses, housing costs or other similar education expenses, you need to review all the associated cost that you would be bearing. On the other hand, you can also get in touch with the graduate schools (where you plan to get admission) for financial assistance programs. The school may also help in finding you some additional resources for financial support.\nAdmission Standards\nWhen you consider attending a graduate degree program, it is essential to go through the admission standards of the schools you have short-listed. One good idea is to the check out the total number of candidates applying at the graduate school and the number of seats available. If the competition is tough, it means admission standards are tough. And it is always better to be one among select few so you may receive quality graduate education.\nCulture\nDifferent graduate schools may have different cultures. Getting to know the culture of the institution where you plan to get enrolled is one of the most important criteria for choosing a graduate program. It is essential to know about the campus culture and the bonding that the faculty and students share with each other. Graduate schools that match your comfort level and style will offer you a nurturing environment.\nDegrees Offered\nThis is, of course, one of the most fundamental criteria to choose a graduate degree program. What is more important is to exactly know about the degree you are looking for. Can you ever compromise on going for a lesser degree when a degree of your choice is not available at the school? If you are really determined and confident to seek a degree of your choice for career advancement, you should never consider getting enrolled into a lesser degree program.\nFaculty\nIt is quite obvious that the quality of a degree program depends on the quality of its faculty. It is most essential to know the professional background of the faculty who would be teaching you. There are multiple ways in which you can investigate about the expertise of the faculty teaching in a specific degree program. The number of scholarly publications and the national or regional plaudits of faculty members and talking to the ex-students will provide you a lot of information about faculty members at the graduate school.\nLocation of Graduate School\nThe location of the graduate school has an important role to play when you consider enrollment into a degree program. After you have enrolled, you will need to live in the geographical location till the completion of the degree; it could mean several years. Apart from that, it is advisable to obtain an advanced degree from a geographical location where you plan to start your career. An advanced degree has the greatest value in the region from where it is obtained. Therefore, always consider the location of the graduate school before getting enrolled.\nFacilities\nMost of the academic institutions boast state-of-the-art facilities for students. Find out whether the graduate school really offers \u2018state-of-the-art facilities for students. More importantly, you need to investigate whether appropriate facilities for the degree program you select are available or not. Infrastructural facilities, corresponding to the program you attend, need to be investigated.\nSurrounding Community\nAlso have a look at the surrounding area and environment of the school you are going to attend. Are you looking for a surrounding which is urban, rural or suburban? Would you like your graduate school to be located in a city or a small town?\nTags Cloud\n"}, {"score": 2190.2224, "uuid": "dd7d5148-9df9-51df-a03e-4453212e8034", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-34-08300", "target_hostname": "businessmajors.about.com", "target_uri": "http://businessmajors.about.com/od/degreeoptions/a/Should-I-Earn-A-Human-Resources-Degree.htm", "page_rank": 1.1993194e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Human Resources <em>Degree</em> - Should I Earn <em>a</em> Human Resources <em>Degree</em>?", "snippet": "In most cases, you will need <em>a</em> <em>bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> in human resources or <em>a</em> related field before you can earn <em>a</em> <em>master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em>. Choosing <em>a</em> human resources <em>degree</em> program can be difficult--there are many <em>different</em> programs to choose <em>from</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Doctorate Degree\nThere is no set degree requirement for professionals in the human resources field. An associate's degree may be all that is needed for some entry-level positions. There are not many associate's degree programs with an emphasis in human resources. However, this degree can serve as a springboard for students who are interested in entering the field or pursuing a bachelor's degree. Most associate's degree programs take two years to complete.\nA bachelor's degree is another common entry-level requirement. A business degree and experience in areas of human resources can often substitute for a straight-out human resources degree. However, a master's degree in human resources or labor relations is becoming more commonplace, particularly for management positions. A bachelor's degree typically takes three to four years to complete. A master's degree program usually lasts two years. In most cases, you will need a bachelor's degree in human resources or a related field before you can earn a master's degree.\nChoosing a Human Resources Degree Program\nChoosing a human resources degree program can be difficult--there are many different programs to choose from. The most important thing you can do is make sure the program is accredited . Accreditation ensures the quality of the program. If you earn a human resources degree from a school that is not accredited by an appropriate source, you may have a hard time finding employment after graduation. It can also be difficult to transfer credits and earned advanced degrees if you do not have a degree from an accredited institution.\nIn addition to accreditation, you should also look at the program's reputation. Does it provide a comprehensive education? Are courses taught by qualified professors? Is the program in line with your learning ability and education needs? Other things to consider include retention rates, class sizes, program facilities, internship opportunities, career placement statistics, and cost. Looking closely at all of these things can help you find a program that is a good match for you academically, financially, and career wise. See a list of the Best Human Resources Programs\nOther HR Education Options\nStudents who are interested in studying human resources have education options available outside of degree programs. There are many schools that offer diploma and certificate programs in human resources in addition to seminars and workshops related to HR topics. Diploma and certificate programs are available at nearly every academic level. For example, there are some programs designed for students who have a high school diploma or less. Other programs are geared toward students who have already earned a bachelor's or master's degree in human resources or a related field. Seminars and workshops are usually less broad in scope and tend to focus on a particular area of human resources, such as communication, hiring, firing, or workplace safety.\nHuman Resources Certification\nAlthough certification is not required to work in the human resources field, some professionals choose to seek the designation of Professional in Human Resources (PHR) or Senior Professional in Human Resources (SPHR). Both certifications are available through the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) . Additional certifications are also available in specific areas of human resources.\nWhat Can I Do with a Human Resources Degree?\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment opportunities for all human resources positions are expected to grow much faster than average in the coming years. Graduates with at least a bachelor's degree have the best prospects. Professionals with certifications and experience will also have an edge.\nNo matter what type of job you get in the human resources field, you can expect to work closely with others--dealing with people is an essential part of any HR job. In a small company, you may perform a variety of different HR tasks; in a large company, you may work exclusively in a specific area of human resources, such as employee training or benefits compensation. Some of the most common job titles in the field include:\nHuman Resources Assistant - In this entry-level position, you would be responsible for assisting someone else with human resources duties. Tasks may include recruiting, staffing, benefits administration, employee orientation, employee communication, and other administrative duties.\nHuman Resources Generalist - A human resources generalist is typically responsible for a wide range of HR duties. On a day-to-day basis, you may work on recruiting, hiring, employee communication, training, benefits management, the planning of company functions, safety regulations, and much more.\nHuman Resources Manager - In a management position, you will be responsible for supervising one or more human resources professionals. You will assign tasks and take care of many duties yourself. Your office may be responsible for every aspect of staffing, benefits, retention, and motivation.\nLabor Relations Manager - Labor relations managers almost always work for large organizations. In this position, your duties may include implementing and overseeing labor relations programs, collecting data and statistics, assisting with contracts, and negotiating collective bargaining agreements.\nLearn More about Earning a Human Resources Degree\nClick on the links below to learn more about the human resources field:\nHuman Resources - The About.com Guide to Human Resources offers information on employing people, managing people, and succeeding at work.

As well, minors through LS&A (see CoE Bulletin) and a Concentration in Manufacturing Systems Design or in Energy Systems is available. Refer to the ME Website or consult with staff in the ASO.\n* There are dual degree programs with other Engineering Departments and Joint (MDDP) degrees with other Schools such as Music and LS&A.\nCandidates for the B.S.E. (ME) - must complete the program listed above. This is just a sample of a schedule that will lead to graduation in eight terms.\nAdditional Academic Options\nConcentrations\nWithin the undergraduate degree, the ME department offers two concentrations: energy and manufacturing systems. Neither of these concentrations are required, however, they allow interested students to focus their technical electives in a specific subject area. If you elect to pursue a concentration in either energy or manufacturing, it is possible to satisfy both the ME technical elective requirements as well as the requirements for the concentration, which are provided below.\nFor students interested in declaring a concentration, please visit the Forms section of the Undergraduate Handbook and complete the Concentration Declaration sheet. You can either submit the completed form via email by sending a scanned pdf copy to me-aso@umich.edu , or by dropping it off in person to the ASO (2206 GGB). After you graduate and the completion of the concentration has been confirmed, you will see the concentration on your official transcript, but not your diploma.\nIf you have already declared a concentration and wish to drop it, please fill out another Concentration Declaration sheet and submit to the ASO again via email or in person.\nEnergy Concentration\nGlobal economic, geopolitical, and environmental factors all suggest that improvements are needed in the way that energy is produced, converted, and utilized in the modern world. Mechanical systems are integral to all three of these activities. The undergraduate concentration in energy, consisting of 12 credit hours, is defined below. For more information, contact the peer or academic advisors in the Academic Services Office or Professor Wooldridge (mswool@umich.edu) .\nStudents must be in good standing to declare the concentration and must pass all classes with satisfactory grades.

This concentration is open to undergraduates pursuing a degree in the Mechanical Engineering department. The MSC focuses on a systems level approach to manufacturing and design for future requirements; it may also increase employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector.\nThe concentration consists of at least 13 credit hours of coursework in manufacturing related areas; specifically, three concentration core courses for 8 hours and two elective courses for 5-6 hours. For more information, contact the peer or academic advisors in the Academic Services Office, or Professor Elijah Kannatey-Asibu (asibu@umich.edu) .\nConcentration requirements:\nThree Concentration Core Courses (8 cr):\nME 481 - Manufacturing Processes (1,2,3a)\nME 483 - Manufacturing Systems Design (1,2,3a)\nIOE 425 - Manufacturing Strategies (GE)\nChoice of One Process Course (3 cr):\nME 482 - Machining Processes (1,3a)\nME 487 - Welding (1,2,3a)\nME 586 - Laser Materials Processing (3a)\nME 588 - Assembly Modeling for Design and Manufacturing (3a)\nME 599 - Nanomanufacturing (3a,4)\nChoice of One Systems Course (2-3 cr):\nME 401 - Engineering Statistics for Manufacturing Systems (1,3a)\nME 452 - Design for Manufacturability (1,3a)\nME 584 - Control of Manufacturing Systems (3a)\nME 587 - Reconfigurable Manufacturing (3a)\nIOE 499 - Material Handling Systems (3b,4)\n(1) - Category 1 ME Technical Elective (400-level or higher)\n(2) - Category 2 ME Technical Elective (core)\n(3a) - Category 3a ME Technical Elective\n(3b) - Category 3b Non-ME Technical Elective\n(GE) - General Elective\n(4) - These ME 499 and 599 courses should transition to permanent numbers in the next year or two.\n(5) - If in a dual degree program with ME, these courses do not count as Technical Electives for ME.\n(P1) - Permission of Instructor\nIndependent Study - ME490\nThe ME department at the University of Michigan has a multi-disciplinary approach to research that strikes a unique balance of trend-setting research and real-world impact that is highly respected around the world. Conducting research with a faculty member, through ME490 Independent Study, is an excellent way to gain hands-on experience and earn credit towards your degree at the same time.\nStudents with senior standing can receive technical elective credit for completing ME490 research. ME490 can only count for Category 3C technical elective credit; it will not count as an ME4xx level or higher technical elective (Category 1) or as a core technical elective (Category 2). For students interested in continuing their independent research project over two semesters, they can enroll in ME491. However, ME491 is only available when you have already elected and completed ME490.\nIf you are interested in doing a ME490 independent research project, please visit the ME490/590 Registration and Report Submission web page for complete step by step instructions, expectations, and due dates.\nMinors\nFor students looking to compliment their Mechanical Engineering degree with additional coursework in another area of interest, there are several minors and programs available for you to choose from. In general, the department offering the minor is always the one responsible for establishing requirements for that minor and declaring students into the minor. Therefore, questions related to a specific minor should be directed to the department offering it and not the ME department.\nDepending on the minor chosen and the amount of course overlap with ME degree requirements , some courses may be able to be counted for both the B.S.E. degree and the minor. If a course required for a minor will not fit in any of the categories of requirements for the ME degree, it will likely count as a general elective.\nStudents interested in pursuing a minor should visit the websites listed below. Additionally, the CoE Bulletin offers a broad overview of some of these minors that are offered through the College of Engineering.\nInternational Minor - The International Minor addresses the need for engineers who can combine technical expertise with international understanding. The International Minor requirements include foreign language proficiency, coursework pertaining to non-U.S. countries, intercultural communication skills, and global trends in engineering and business. Students must also pursue practical overseas experience through study, work or volunteer abroad. The minor requires 16-20 credits to complete, depending on the foreign language elected.\nMultidisciplinary Design Minor - This minor allows undergraduate engineering students to obtain practical hands-on experience designing, building, and testing technology systems in collaboration with students from other disciplines both inside and outside of engineering. The minor can be satisfied with 15 credits of coursework associated with specialized multidisciplinary team projects, which may include competitive teams such as Solar Car, Steel Bridge, and Human-Powered Submarines.\nElectrical Engineering (EE) Minor - The EE minor is offered through the EECS Department and is intended to give students the opportunity to pursue one of three paths: Systems: Communications, Control, Signal Processing, Electromagnetics and Optics, or Circuits and Solid State. ME students pursuing the EE minor must take EECS 215, which will count in place of EECS 314. For additional information, visit the EECS Department website.\nEntrepreneurship Program - Undergraduate engineering students are able to study business methods associated with writing business plans, obtaining venture capital and other funding, intellectual property, etc. The Program in Entrepreneurship Certificate requires at least 9 credits of business related courses and seminars.\nLSA Minors - Almost all LSA departments offer a minor available to students in any college at the UM Ann Arbor. If you are interested in pursuing a LSA minor, please contact the applicable department directly. For your convenience, the two most common LSA minors are listed below:\n- Minor in Mathematics : Through the ME degree, students are required to take Math 215, Math 216, and an advanced math course, all of which can be double counted toward the math minor. Consequently, ME students interested in pursuing a math minor only need two additional courses to satisfy the Math Department's minor requirements.\n- Minor in Physics : Similar to the math minor, several courses required for the ME degree will double count for the physics minor, including Physics 140/141 and Physics 240/241. To complete the physics minor two additional courses and a laboratory are required.\nStudy Abroad\nStudents who engage in Study Abroad opportunities gain first-hand knowledge of other cultures and learn to appreciate cultural diversity. In addition, from these experiences, students learn to approach engineering problems with new insight. This experience allows students to more readily adapt to new situations and successfully interact with colleagues from around the world.\nIf you are interested in studying abroad and earning credit internationally, please visit the study abroad section of the International Programs in Engineering website. Keep in mind that it will be difficult to find any of our design or lab courses abroad (i.e. ME 250, ME 350, ME 395, ME 450, and ME 495). Because none of these courses can be taken in the same semester, we recommend that students planning to go abroad do so the winter semester of their sophomore year (e.g. take ME 250 in the fall semester) or go abroad over a summer.\nTo determine if a study abroad course will transfer to the UM, please visit the CoE Transfer Credit Office website to locate the course CoE and LSA course equivalency databases.\nDual and Joint Undergraduate Degrees\nDual Degrees\nDual degrees may be obtained with Mechanical Engineering and other programs in the College of Engineering. These require 142 (minimum) credits hours, and result in the award of two B.S.E. degrees (one in Mechanical Engineering and one in the other program). Since these programs involve a substantial amount of double counting of credit, a dual degree student cannot enter the SGUS program. Transfer credit may also be limited.\nAdmission to a dual degree program requires approval from both departments and is available for any student who has maintained a GPA of 3.0 or higher, both cumulative as well as in \"core\" subjects.\nThese dual-degrees programs currently exist:\nAerospace Engineering\n"}, {"score": 2176.5571, "uuid": "ae9b9ede-92ea-5aae-a65b-6ae3c52e21cf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0713wb-99-17205", "target_hostname": "cas.nyu.edu", "target_uri": "http://cas.nyu.edu/object/ug.academicprogram.bamasters", "page_rank": 1.7283529e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "NYU &gt; <em>A</em> &amp; S &gt; Accelerated <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em>&#x2F;<em>Master&#x27;s</em> Program", "snippet": "programs the opportunity to earn both the <em>bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> and the <em>master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> in <em>a</em> shorter period of time and at less cost than <em>is</em> normally the case.", "explanation": null, "document": "Interested students should review the information on this website and consult the relevant department for more information.\u00a0 Students who wish to meet in person to discuss specific aspects of the program should call 212-998-8130 to schedule an appointment.\nClick HERE to download the application\nFrequently Asked Questions\nELIGIBILITY\nI\u2019m a student in Gallatin/Stern/Steinhardt.\u00a0 Am I eligible for the program?\nNo. Unfortunately only students in CAS and Global Liberal Studies are able to apply to the program. GLS students should consult the GLS BA/MA Program websit e for application procedures. Students in other schools should speak to their adviser about other opportunities available to them.\nI\u2019m a Stern/Steinhardt student, but I\u2019m doing a second major in CAS.\u00a0 Can I apply?\nNo.\u00a0 Even though your second major is from CAS your degree is still from your home school.\nI\u2019m a student in the Core Program (formerly LSP) but will transition to CAS next year.\u00a0 Can I apply to the BA/MA program prior to my transition?\nStudents in the Core Program should wait until they have transitioned to the College before applying.\u00a0 Prior to transitioning they should feel free to consult with the BA/MA adviser regarding the program.\nI have more than 96 credits but am only in my third year.\u00a0 Am I still eligible to apply?\nStudents with more than 96 may still be eligible to apply to the program provided they have not yet begun their senior year.\u00a0 To be considered, students must have completed no more than 6 semesters and have at least one year of full time study remaining for their BA.\nI\u2019m a senior but just heard about this program.\u00a0 Is it still possible to apply?\nNo.\u00a0 Seniors are not eligible to apply to the BA/MA Program.\u00a0 That said, seniors can still apply to the Graduate School and take advantage of the CAS/GSAS tuition discount program .\nI\u2019m interested in applying to the program but my GPA is below 3.5. \u00a0Can the 3.5 GPA requirement be waived?\nGenerally no. Students whose GPA is just below a 3.5 (3.4) should speak to the BA/MA adviser regarding eligibility.\u00a0 In certain cases, students with a GPA below a 3.5 may apply to the program provided they raise their GPA above a 3.5 by the end of the semester. In no case will a student be admitted to the Graduate School under the BA/MA program whose GPA is below a 3.5.\nAPPLICATION PROCESS\nWhat do I need to submit with my application?\nIn addition to the application, you will need to submit a statement of purpose, 2 letters of recommendation and an unofficial copy of your transcript (available on Albert). Some departments (Bioethics, World History) also require a writing sample.\u00a0 Please check with the department for any additional required materials.\nWhen are applications due?\nComplete applications, including all supporting materials, are due on November 1 (for Fall) or April 1 (for Spring).\nI missed the application deadline.\u00a0 Can I still apply?\nStudents who miss the application deadline should contact the College Advising Center to see if it is still possible to apply after the deadline.\u00a0 Decisions as to whether to allow students to apply late will be made on a case-by-case basis.\nWhere should I submit my application?\nComplete applications should be submitted to:\nBA/MA Program\n100 Washington Square East, Silver 905\nNew York, NY 10003\nTo ensure that all of your applications materials are received in a timely manner, you are strongly encouraged to submit all of your application materials, including letters of recommendation (in sealed envelopes with signatures across the back flap) together at the same time.\nThe application form asks for department and program codes.\u00a0 What are those and where can I find them?\nDepartment and program codes are available on the GSAS Application Resource Center website .\u00a0 In order for CAS to process your application, you must include both codes.\nThe application form asks for the term I plan to enter GSAS.\u00a0 What does this mean?\nPlease list the term (fall/spring/summer) and year that you plan to enter GSAS as a full-time MA student NOT the term that you plan to begin taking classes.\u00a0 Note that students admitted to the BA/MA program are expected to matriculate into the Graduate School in the fall/spring semester immediately following graduation.\u00a0 Deferments are not possible.\nWho should I ask to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf?\nIdeally, both letters of recommendation would come from full-time faculty in the department to which you are applying. That said students often have difficulty identifying two professors who know them well enough to write a letter on their behalf.\u00a0 In these cases, students can get a second letter from a TA in the department, an instructor outside of the graduate department, or an instructor at an NYU abroad site.\u00a0\u00a0 Letters from internship supervisors, academic advisers, or other individuals who have not had you in class are strongly discouraged.\nWhat should I include in my statement of purpose?\nA statement of purpose for graduate school is different than a personal statement for undergrad.\u00a0 While heartwarming stories about your volunteer work in Mexico or your triumphal performance in your high school\u2019s production of Annie may tell a graduate director something about you personally, it says little about your reasons for pursuing an MA and whether you are prepared to pursue graduate education.\nAn effective statement of purpose should convey your reasons for wanting to pursue graduate study, the specific issues/ideas you want to study in the graduate program, any relevant coursework and experience that has prepared you for graduate study, and how an MA at NYU fits into your overall academic and career goals.\nHow long should my statement of purpose be?\nYour statement of purpose should be one page, single-spaced in a standard font with standard margins.\nI\u2019m currently studying abroad.\u00a0 Can I apply to the program remotely?\nYes.\u00a0 Students studying abroad can submit the application form and personal statement via email (we\u2019ll take care of the transcript).\u00a0 Letters of recommendation can be sent to the Advising Center under separate cover.\nI\u2019ve asked a faculty member from an NYU Abroad Site to write me a letter of recommendation.\u00a0 Is it possible for her to email her letter to you?\nYes.\u00a0 Letters of recommendation from faculty not on the Washington Square campus can be emailed to the BA/MA Program adviser.\nHow long before I know whether or not I\u2019ve been admitted?\nAll applications received in a given semester are forwarded on to the Graduate Directors in the individual departments at the same time, roughly a week after the application deadline.\u00a0 From there, response times vary by the department in question, but generally students should know of their application status within a month of the application deadline. Students who have not received an admissions decision by this time should contact the BA/MA Program adviser.\nNOTE: Since we only send applications to the department once a semester, students who apply to the program early in the semester will need to wait until after the application deadline for an admissions decision.\nAFTER BEING ADMITTED TO THE PROGRAM\nI\u2019ve been admitted to the program, but I still can\u2019t register for graduate classes.What do I do?\nBA/MA students won\u2019t be able to register for graduate courses on Albert until they are formally admitted to the Graduate School at the end of their senior year. Until then, they will need to work with their MA department (typically the Director of Graduate Studies and the MA Program administrator) to register for appropriate graduate courses.\nHow do I know what courses to register for?\nAdmitted students should contact the Director of Graduate Studies for advice on the Master\u2019s component of their program.They should continue to work with their adviser(s) in their undergraduate department(s) on matters regarding their BA program.\nI\u2019m in a Master's course that my undergraduate adviser told me could count towards my major. Can I use this course towards both degree requirements?\nNo.Under no circumstances can a course be used towards the requirements towards both degrees.Students must decide which degree they wish to apply the course towards.\nMy graduate courses are still being listed under my undergraduate degree requirements. How can I fix this?\nIn your last semester (earlier if you wish) you will need to specify which graduate courses will be used towards the MA degree. Until that time, the graduate courses will continue to count towards your undergraduate degree requirements. When assessing your degree progress, it is important to keep this in mind so that you can be sure to complete all of your BA requirements and at least a quarter of your Master's degree.\nMy cumulative GPA dipped below a 3.5. Can I stay in the program?\nStudents must have at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA in order to be formally admitted to the Graduate School. If, prior to graduation, your GPA dips below a 3.5 you must pull it back up to this level in order to matriculate into GSAS.\nWhat is the minimum grade I need to earn in my graduate courses for them to count towards the MA?\nStudents must earn at least a B in any MA coursework that they intend to apply towards the MA degree.\nDo the grades earned in graduate coursework taken as a CAS student count towards the 3.5 GPA requirement?\nNo. Graduate courses will not count towards the undergraduate GPA.\u00a0 Students wishing to transition to GSAS should make sure that their GPA is above a 3.5 once graduate courses are set aside.\nI'm on track to finish the requirements for both the BA and the MA in the same semester.\u00a0 Can I graduate from both schools simultaneously?\nNo. In accordance with NY State law the registrar cannot confer two degrees in the same calendar year.\u00a0 Students are encouraged to finish their undergrad degree in a way that would allow them to spend a full academic year in GSAS.\u00a0 While students who complete a significant amount of MA courses while an undergraduate may not need to a full year to complete their remaining requirements, they must be a matriculated student in GSAS for a year before receiving the MA degree.\nTRANSITIONING TO GSAS\nWhen do I need to notify CAS that I intend to continue with the Master's portion of the BA/MA program?\nStudents must notify CAS by March 1st if they plan to matriculate into GSAS the following fall. Students who intend to matriculate in the spring must notify CAS by November 1st. At this time, students must complete a Request for Matriculation form that specifies the semester that they want to enter the Graduate School and the graduate courses that they would like to use towards the Master's degree.\nI intend to graduate this semester but have not completed the necessary graduate coursework (i.e. a quarter of the masters degree). Can I still matriculate into the Graduate School next semester?\nStudents must complete at least a quarter of the graduate program in order to enter GSAS under the terms of the BA/MA program. If possible, students can take graduate courses over the summer to fulfill this requirement, but would need to take these courses as an undergraduate student, thereby delaying their graduation from CAS until September.\nNow that my graduate courses aren\u2019t counting towards my undergraduate degree, I\u2019m short of the necessary requirements for the BA. What do I do?\nStudents in the BA/MA program are required to complete all of the requirements for the BA degree, so you will need to work with your department and CAS advising to come up with a plan to complete your CAS degree.\nI\u2019m a senior who is graduating this semester. How do I register for graduate classes next semester?\nIn order to register for graduate classes as an MA student you must first be formally admitted to GSAS. Once you receive a formal offer of admission, you will be able to register as an MA student. It is important that you do not register for graduate courses as a CAS student \u2013 doing so will affect your graduation. Please note that very often you will not receive your formal acceptance prior to registration week. This generally will not impact your ability to register for your desired classes.\nAFTER MATRICULATING TO GSAS\nWhen will the 50% scholarship appear on my financial aid statement / bursar's account?\nBA/MA awards are posted after a student has registered for courses. The Graduate School awards are typically on student accounts by the end of August. If a student is registered and does not see their award on their bursar account by the end of August, they may send an email, with their name and UID to gsas.admissions@nyu.edu\nWhat is the procedure for transferring graduate credits earned in CAS onto the GSAS transcript?\nStudents must first contact the graduate administrator in the department. The department administrator along with the student needs to complete a Transfer Credit Request Form: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.pdf.transfercreditrequest\n"}, {"score": 2175.829, "uuid": "8aa5e2e1-41ff-5fd5-97ff-8c2630d266f7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0807wb-25-23530", "target_hostname": "www.productivity501.com", "target_uri": "http://www.productivity501.com/harvard-masters-degree/6463/", "page_rank": 1.4606404e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Online <em>from</em> Harvard Extension School | Productivity501", "snippet": "My thesis involved writing <em>a</em> piece of software and then writing <em>a</em> detailed explanation of <em>how</em> it worked, the technology behind it, and <em>how</em> it was <em>different</em> <em>from</em> other pieces of software.

Modern technology is making education surprisingly easy to obtain and\u00a0 inexpensive.\nYears ago, you\u2019d get a bachelor\u2019s degree, go work for a big company and eventually retire with a gold watch. That model doesn\u2019t really work anymore.\u00a0 If you want to maximize your potential, you need continual education. This can be be formal and informal , but in this article we are going to look at my experience getting a formal education that leads to a degree while working full time. In particular, we are going to look at getting an online masters degree.\nThis is a pretty long articles so here is an executive summary:\nYou can get an online master\u2019s degree from Harvard through their Extension School and take the majority of your classes over the internet. The entrance process is simple and the cost is much lower than similar programs.\nMy Background\nFive years out of high school, I had earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in music composition. During that same period, my summer job at the local hospital had grown into a full-time network administrator position covering two hospitals and a handful of clinics. Technology skills came very easily for me. My music education had been very valuable in learning to work with people, learning to concentrate and learning to understand abstract concepts. Still, it seemed like a good idea to get more formal education related to technology.\nAfter looking at several programs, I finally settled on the ALM in IT program from Harvard\u2019s Extension school . The ALM in IT was one of the few master\u2019s degrees where all the required classes were available online. (The ALM in IT does have a residency requirement as described below.) I signed up for an online class on Java programming and was very impressed. The teachers were great and the class experience was far superior to the correspondence-style classes I had seen people slaving through from other schools.\nHarvard Extension School\nFounded in 1910, Harvard\u2019s Extension School was originally designed to serve local non-traditional students. It is now under the Continuing Education division. The Extension School is the only of Harvard\u2019s thirteen schools to offer both graduate and undergraduate degrees and also the only to offer an associate degree. Anyone can sign up to take a course without being admitted to a degree program. The primary qualification for admittance to a master\u2019s degree program is the successful completion of 12 hours of courses (three classes) with a decent GPA. Some of the programs now require that specific classes be taken as part of those first 12 hours. These are usually the classes that are the hardest. This is actually a very kind requirement. You don\u2019t want to get admitted by taking the 4 easiest courses and complete most of the coursework only to discover that one of the classes you left to the end is well beyond your ability.\nMemorial Hall that serves as the dining hall for freshmen.\nI had a bit of a scare right after I finished my fourth class. They came out with a new requirement for the ALM in IT master\u2019s degree program that one of your first four classes must be the Theory of Computation (or similar class). When I asked about it, they explained that the requirement didn\u2019t apply to current students. After taking the class, I understand why they created this requirement. It was very challenging for someone with more music background than mathematics. It wasn\u2019t necessarily hard; it just required learning a new way of thinking that I hadn\u2019t been exposed to before.\nThere is a beautiful simplicity in letting students take classes to determine admittance. There are no admission tests or GRE scores required. Admission is based on your ability to complete the course work\u2013proven by your ability to do well in four classes. Once you\u2019ve passed the four classes, you can apply to be admitted to the master\u2019s degree program. This involves an application and an essay.\nThe vast majority of people taking classes through the Extension School do not graduate with a degree. I believe it is 97% that don\u2019t get a degree. A high percentage are probably just taking a few classes and never even apply for a degree program, but I\u2019m sure quite a few are pursing a degree and never complete it or run into a required class that they simply can\u2019t handle.\nDistance Education Class Format\nSince I don\u2019t live anywhere near Cambridge, most of the classes I took were online. The online master\u2019s degree classes follow a live class. Most of the time, you can physically go to class if you\u2019re near the Boston area. A few of my classes the classes were using video from a school other than the Extension School, and in those cases, the classes were only available online for Extension students.\nWhen a physical class is held, it is video taped and within 48 hours posted on the web. Most classes use a slide show or PDF synchronized with the video. A few use other, more experimental, methods of synchronizing the visual aids with the lecture. There is usually a teaching fellow assigned to all the internet students to answer questions and hold sections that which are posted to the class website.\nThe online master\u2019s degree classroom experience at Harvard is far superior to what I\u2019ve seen from other online degree programs . Aside from watching the video a day or two later than the physical class, distance students are treated pretty much like on-campus students. Testing is done through a proctor at a local college or university. The proctor receives the test by FedEx and ships it back after you complete it. Quite a few classes avoid tests entirely and instead focused on projects, papers or very complex open book tests that don\u2019t require a proctor.\nResidency Requirement\nThe apartment where we stayed during the 8 week summer semester.\nThe ALM in IT master\u2019s degree program has a one-semester residency requirement. Since the eight-week summer session counted toward this, we chose to spend a few months there during the summer. My wife and I rented a small, one-bedroom furnished apartment a few blocks from Harvard Square, and I took eight credit hours during those eight weeks. We were only a block or two from the Science Center where my classes were held and very near the subway in Harvard Square, so we didn\u2019t need to use our car. It sat in a parking lot for most of the summer with the battery slowly draining from disuse.\nIn retrospect, I would probably take fewer classes during the summer session and spend more time taking advantage of the museums and cultural events in the area. I was also working remotely, so my schedule was pretty full.\nMany of the master\u2019s degrees from the Extension School have some classes that can be taken online. Most require at least two semesters residency. Some programs require that a certain number of hours be taken in person. The masters\u2019 degrees in information technology (ALM in IT) and environmental management are the only two that appear to have the smallest residency requirement. Many of the classes offered by the Extension School do not have an online option, so beyond the residency requirement, some classes must be taken in person.\nMaster\u2019s Degree Courses\nThe ALM in IT program I chose concentrated in Software Engineering\u2013basically a Master\u2019s of Arts in IT focused on developing software. It consisted of 10 four hour courses with the final course being the thesis. In addition to Harvard professors, the Extension School has lecturers teaching elective classes that come from local companies and even non-professors from Harvard. For example, one of the classes I took on XML was taught by the programmer responsible for all of the XML-driven websites and course catalogs for the Extension School. Having these two types of teachers proved very valuable. The Harvard professors were particularly good at teaching theoretical concepts and mathematics. The industry teachers were very good at teaching the classes that dealt with how to get things done in the real world. My program required that at least 8 classes (32 of the 40 hours) be taken from \u201cHarvard Instructors.\u201d I believe most of the other programs have a similar requirement.\nThe difficulty of the courses seemed to vary greatly, but this was probably a function of my previous experience more than anything else. Coming from a totally unrelated field, but with a lot of hands-on experience, meant that there were some gaps I had to fill in while taking classes that probably wouldn\u2019t have been an issue for someone with an undergraduate computer science background. The Theory of Computation class was especially difficult for me. In fact, I took it twice. Halfway through it the first time, I was getting a B, but really struggling. I ended up dropping it. That summer, I took a course in discrete mathematics. It wasn\u2019t required for the degree, but it filled in some of the background I needed to pass the Theory of Computation the next semester.\nI was impressed with how helpful the teaching fellow was during the the class that I found to be difficult. At the same time, I realized how difficult it is to take the classes online when you are struggling. There is something about sitting down in the room with someone that really benefits your comprehension. You simply don\u2019t get trying to explain things back and forth over email. On the other hand, writing your questions on email can help you clarify your thoughts. Often, I found the answer to my problem simply by trying to formulate a written question.\nThe Theory of Computation class was taught by Harry Lewis, who had taught the same class for years. He was teaching the class for the last time. The teaching fellows brought in some cake and refreshments on the last day. That\u2019s another downside of not being on campus\u2013no cake. Interesting side note: Dr. Lewis taught the same class to Bill Gates before he dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft.\nOnline Master\u2019s Degree Distance Education Experience\nTaking classes by watching the lectures on your computer and communicating by email is hard. It is very hard. It is much easier to go to a physical class and sit with a bunch of your fellow students than participate in an online degree program . It is not something that everyone can do. It can be very frustrating and leave you feeling very isolated. Before making a huge commitment to try to earn a master\u2019s\u00a0 degree using distance education technology, make sure you try a class or two. You have to make sure it works with your personality. It definitely isn\u2019t for everyone. Most of my education through high school was self paced and individualized working through textbooks and workbooks on my own. A teacher was available for questions, but there wasn\u2019t any type of lecture. It involved reading, doing problem sets and then telling the teacher when you are ready to take the test. Distance education seemed like something of a hybrid between my college and high school education.\nIn theory, you can watch the lectures multiple times, but in\u00a0 practice, this would require a huge time investment. It is convenient to go back and re-watch a section that you didn\u2019t understand, but not nearly as effective as asking the student sitting next to you, attending a study group, raising your hand, visiting your professor during office hours or catching him/her after class.\nI found some software that would let me speed up or slow down the lectures without changing the pitch. For material that I was already very familiar with, I\u2019d play it 20% faster. Also, if I was reviewing a lecture for the second time, I\u2019d speed it up even more and slow it back down when I came to sections I didn\u2019t fully understand. When I encountered material that was very difficult, I\u2019d slow the playback down to 80% of the original to give myself more time to process what was being said.\nMaster\u2019s Degree Cost\nThe biggest expense of a master\u2019s degree is rarely the the tuition. The opportunity cost\u2013the money you could have been earning at a job during the time you were going to school\u2013usually represents the biggest expense. Unless you have a very flexible employer, it is going to be difficult to take traditional classes while you continue your day job. Distance education courses allow you to minimize this opportunity cost. You can keep working your normal job while taking many of your classes. Make sure you consider the lost income potential of programs that require you to stop working.\nA four-hour class from the Harvard Extension School costs somewhere around $1,800 to $1,850 now. They were slightly cheaper when I started. This works out to about $450 per credit hour. This is extremely inexpensive. Columbia\u2019s Video Network and Standford\u2019s Center for Professional Development both appear to charge around $1,300 per credit hour. Compared to both of those, Harvard tuition seems\u00a0 cheap.\nHarvard\u2019s tuition is only slightly more than the per credit hour cost of master\u2019s degree tuition at both Kansas University and Kansas State University resident tuition and less expensive than out-of-state tuition for either of those institutions. Some state schools\u2019 instate tuition may be more expensive than Harvard. The value provided by Harvard\u2019s Extension School is very good and is less expensive than any other comparable option I could find. In addition it is less expensive than a number of much less reputable schools. (University of Phoenix online tuition works out to nearly $700 per credit hour and it looks like Capella\u2019s tuition is in the $600 per credit hour range.)\nMaster\u2019s Degree Thesis\nMy thesis took a very long time. The actual writing part didn\u2019t take too long, but getting the thesis proposal approved and locating a thesis director took years. Off-campus students seem to have a bit more trouble getting a thesis director assigned. (I think they have made some changes to help fix this, now.) First, you submit a thesis proposal and get it approved by the research adviser for your area of study. Then a thesis director is assigned. The director is the one who will give you your final grade\u2013there isn\u2019t a thesis committee. The research adviser does review your thesis to make sure it meets Harvard\u2019s standards for clarity, organization and formatting. Harvard does a good job of giving you what you need to complete the thesis. There are Microsoft Word templates for the Thesis Proposal and the actual Thesis that make it very easy to deal with the citations, various tables of content, etc.\nMy thesis involved writing a piece of software and then writing a detailed explanation of how it worked, the technology behind it, and how it was different from other pieces of software. In the end, I ended up with a nicely bound 180 page document.\nWhen you are doing things remotely, the thesis work involves a lot of emailing documents back and forth. I ran into some problems getting Word on a Mac to show images correctly when they were transferred to Windows. (It turns out, images don\u2019t embed properly if you just drag them into the document.) So my thesis director would print the PDF I sent him, mark it up, scan it back in and send back the PDF image of the scan. Later on we started using the editing features in Word.\nOnce the research adviser and the thesis director were both happy with the document, I sent it to a bindery in Massachusetts. They printed and bound two copies. One was sent to me in Kansas, and the other was sent to the Harvard Extension School to go in the library there. I highly recommend Wells Bindery .\u00a0 Their cost per page for color was about 1/5th what other binderies were going to charge. They had Harvard\u2019s binding requirements on file and took care of everything without requiring every specific detail.\nBe aware that there is a time limit on how long you can take to complete your master\u2019s degree. I was well beyond that limit, but I was told that once you get to the point where you are waiting on them to find a thesis director \u201cthe clock stops\u201d and doesn\u2019t count against you. Now, if I had needed a further extension on my thesis, I would have needed to petition and possibly retake any classes that were over five years old.\nNot every master\u2019s degree program requires a thesis. The program I was in added the option to do a \u201ccapstone\u201d course instead of a thesis right around the time I was in the middle of my thesis proposal.\nIs it a \u201cReal\u201d Harvard Master\u2019s Degree?\nDiploma from Harvard Extension School\nThis is the question that everyone seems to ask. Yes, it is a real master\u2019s degree from Harvard. You get the same diploma as everyone else. It lists your degree as \u201cMagistri in Artibus Liberalibus Studiorum Prolatorum\u201d that is \u201cMaster of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies.\u201d I think the \u201cExtension Studies\u201d addition is something fairly new and I don\u2019t think that was on diplomas from previous years. I\u2019m guessing that this is due to some of the criticism that admission to the Extension School programs doesn\u2019t involve the same level of scrutiny that is required of other Harvard schools. This is completely true. Admission to the Extension School is based solely on your ability to perform well in that program. It is worth noting that the admission process to other Harvard schools has in the past been criticized for being based on factors other than academic merit.\nOn the other hand, graduates of the Harvard Extension School who worked full-time while getting their master\u2019s degrees might complain that the students who were able to go to school full-time had things too easy. Holding down a full-time job while maintaining the discipline to complete an online master\u2019s degree from an academically rigorous school is very difficult. It is much harder to sit alone in a room late at night after work watching lectures and doing problem sets than it is to attend class with your peers. The skills that will let you pull that off will generally go a long way toward helping you succeed.\nStill, a lot of the value from going to college occurs outside the classroom. This is one of the biggest drawbacks to getting a degree predominately through online classes. For a second Master\u2019s degree while you are working a full time job, it isn\u2019t as big of a deal. Hopefully you\u2019ve already developed the social skills and contacts from your previous 6 years of schooling. However, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for someone who just graduated from high school. In that respect, employers looking for \u201cHarvard graduates\u201d may be looking for more than their academic credentials. They may be looking for someone with the contacts that would come from being physically on campus.\nAs mentioned before, only 3% of people who take classes through the Extension School end up with a degree. By comparison, Harvard College (where students get their undergrad degree) generally accepts around 7% of applicants in a given year. So the Extension School lets everyone try, but is selective in the academic quality of people who achieve passing grades. Harvard College is selective in who they allow into the school in the first place. Since the peer experience is a very important part of Harvard College, this makes sense. It is a much less important part of the Extension School.\nSome employers are upset because they interview people who claim they went to Harvard when all they did was enroll in (and not necessarily complete) a course through the Extension School. I\u2019m sure there are people misrepresenting their degrees or coursework on their resume, but I\u2019m sure this happens with\u00a0 most universities. I know it sometimes happens with universities that are completely fictitious.\nIt is important to realize that the degrees offered by the Extension School may not map directly to degrees offered by other schools. My degree is the ALM in IT with a concentration in software engineering. I do not have a Master\u2019s of Science in Computer Science as is offered by the Harvard Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. While there is some overlap, that degree requires different courses and goes much deeper on the computational theory side of things. The classes I took included several that were more focused on practical use of current technologies rather than being all theory. My required courses seemed about equivalent to the Master of Science in Computer Science degrees from some of the state schools I researched.\nGraduation\nParticipating in commencement is an option, but given the distance from Kansas to Massachusetts and the prospect of traveling with a baby, we opted not to go. So, for all practical purposes, my graduation was on March 10th when I received this email:\nGood afternoon,\nCongratulations on your March 2010 graduation!\nI\u2019m emailing to let you know that you can come by the Professional Programs Office, 7th floor, 51 Brattle Street, to pick up your hard-earned diploma or certificate.

Please accept my best wishes for continued academic and professional success.\nCheers,\nA week later I got a Fed Ex package with my diploma.\nOther Schools\nThere are many other schools offering distance education master\u2019s degrees, but the ones below are the only two that seemed most similar.\nStanford Center for Professional Development \u2013 When I started looking, Stanford was the only other option that seemed to have a really good online classroom. However, they used to require your employer to be a member of SCPD before you could sign up for any classes. This requirement seems to have been dropped, so they might be worth checking into. Their tuition appears to be 2 to 3 times higher than Harvard\u2019s Extension School.\nColumbia Video Network \u2013 Has a number of Master\u2019s degree programs. Classes are two to three times more expensive than Harvard\u2019s Extension School.\nConclusion\nOverall, I was very happy with the experience and education. It significantly added to my education without taking much time off work. I believe this type of degree is particularly valuable for work beyond your first master\u2019s degree. Taking the majority of your classes online does limit your interaction with other students, and this is often one of the most valuable aspects of college. I would be very hesitant to recommend getting a bachelor\u2019s degree online for someone recently out of high school because the student interactions are so valuable. One of my regrets is that I didn\u2019t work harder at networking with classmates during the summer residency.\nWhile there are a number of other schools that offer various types of online master\u2019s degrees, there is a significant benefit in being associated with one of the strongest educational brands in the world and an institution known for solid academics.\nResources\nIf you want more information on Harvard Extension School, here are some useful links:\nHarvard Extended \u2013 A blog written by Ian Lamont who graduated in 2008 with detailed information on his experiences getting his degree.\nThe Spark - An official blog about the Extension School.\nStudent Blog \u2013 An official blog written by current students.\nGraduate Programs \u2013 Looks at some of the other graduate programs outside of a master\u2019s degree that are offered.\nThis article was useful when looking for:\nmasters degree (3714)\n"}], [{"score": 2175.5833, "uuid": "77d9da08-7b3c-5b8b-b7a0-c3355d48a597", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0812wb-28-13093", "target_hostname": "www.productivity501.com", "target_uri": "http://www.productivity501.com/harvard-masters-degree/6463/comment-page-1/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> Online <em>from</em> Harvard Extension School | Productivity501", "snippet": "My thesis involved writing <em>a</em> piece of software and then writing <em>a</em> detailed explanation of <em>how</em> it worked, the technology behind it, and <em>how</em> it was <em>different</em> <em>from</em> other pieces of software.

Modern technology is making education surprisingly easy to obtain and\u00a0 inexpensive.\nYears ago, you\u2019d get a bachelor\u2019s degree, go work for a big company and eventually retire with a gold watch. That model doesn\u2019t really work anymore.\u00a0 If you want to maximize your potential, you need continual education. This can be be formal and informal , but in this article we are going to look at my experience getting a formal education that leads to a degree while working full time. In particular, we are going to look at getting an online masters degree.\nThis is a pretty long articles so here is an executive summary:\nYou can get an online master\u2019s degree from Harvard through their Extension School and take the majority of your classes over the internet. The entrance process is simple and the cost is much lower than similar programs.\nMy Background\nFive years out of high school, I had earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in music composition. During that same period, my summer job at the local hospital had grown into a full-time network administrator position covering two hospitals and a handful of clinics. Technology skills came very easily for me. My music education had been very valuable in learning to work with people, learning to concentrate and learning to understand abstract concepts. Still, it seemed like a good idea to get more formal education related to technology.\nAfter looking at several programs, I finally settled on the ALM in IT program from Harvard\u2019s Extension school . The ALM in IT was one of the few master\u2019s degrees where all the required classes were available online. (The ALM in IT does have a residency requirement as described below.) I signed up for an online class on Java programming and was very impressed. The teachers were great and the class experience was far superior to the correspondence-style classes I had seen people slaving through from other schools.\nHarvard Extension School\nFounded in 1910, Harvard\u2019s Extension School was originally designed to serve local non-traditional students. It is now under the Continuing Education division. The Extension School is the only of Harvard\u2019s thirteen schools to offer both graduate and undergraduate degrees and also the only to offer an associate degree. Anyone can sign up to take a course without being admitted to a degree program. The primary qualification for admittance to a master\u2019s degree program is the successful completion of 12 hours of courses (three classes) with a decent GPA. Some of the programs now require that specific classes be taken as part of those first 12 hours. These are usually the classes that are the hardest. This is actually a very kind requirement. You don\u2019t want to get admitted by taking the 4 easiest courses and complete most of the coursework only to discover that one of the classes you left to the end is well beyond your ability.\nMemorial Hall that serves as the dining hall for freshmen.\nI had a bit of a scare right after I finished my fourth class. They came out with a new requirement for the ALM in IT master\u2019s degree program that one of your first four classes must be the Theory of Computation (or similar class). When I asked about it, they explained that the requirement didn\u2019t apply to current students. After taking the class, I understand why they created this requirement. It was very challenging for someone with more music background than mathematics. It wasn\u2019t necessarily hard; it just required learning a new way of thinking that I hadn\u2019t been exposed to before.\nThere is a beautiful simplicity in letting students take classes to determine admittance. There are no admission tests or GRE scores required. Admission is based on your ability to complete the course work\u2013proven by your ability to do well in four classes. Once you\u2019ve passed the four classes, you can apply to be admitted to the master\u2019s degree program. This involves an application and an essay.\nThe vast majority of people taking classes through the Extension School do not graduate with a degree. I believe it is 97% that don\u2019t get a degree. A high percentage are probably just taking a few classes and never even apply for a degree program, but I\u2019m sure quite a few are pursing a degree and never complete it or run into a required class that they simply can\u2019t handle.\nDistance Education Class Format\nSince I don\u2019t live anywhere near Cambridge, most of the classes I took were online. The online master\u2019s degree classes follow a live class. Most of the time, you can physically go to class if you\u2019re near the Boston area. A few of my classes the classes were using video from a school other than the Extension School, and in those cases, the classes were only available online for Extension students.\nWhen a physical class is held, it is video taped and within 48 hours posted on the web. Most classes use a slide show or PDF synchronized with the video. A few use other, more experimental, methods of synchronizing the visual aids with the lecture. There is usually a teaching fellow assigned to all the internet students to answer questions and hold sections that which are posted to the class website.\nThe online master\u2019s degree classroom experience at Harvard is far superior to what I\u2019ve seen from other online degree programs . Aside from watching the video a day or two later than the physical class, distance students are treated pretty much like on-campus students. Testing is done through a proctor at a local college or university. The proctor receives the test by FedEx and ships it back after you complete it. Quite a few classes avoid tests entirely and instead focused on projects, papers or very complex open book tests that don\u2019t require a proctor.\nResidency Requirement\nThe apartment where we stayed during the 8 week summer semester.\nThe ALM in IT master\u2019s degree program has a one-semester residency requirement. Since the eight-week summer session counted toward this, we chose to spend a few months there during the summer. My wife and I rented a small, one-bedroom furnished apartment a few blocks from Harvard Square, and I took eight credit hours during those eight weeks. We were only a block or two from the Science Center where my classes were held and very near the subway in Harvard Square, so we didn\u2019t need to use our car. It sat in a parking lot for most of the summer with the battery slowly draining from disuse.\nIn retrospect, I would probably take fewer classes during the summer session and spend more time taking advantage of the museums and cultural events in the area. I was also working remotely, so my schedule was pretty full.\nMany of the master\u2019s degrees from the Extension School have some classes that can be taken online. Most require at least two semesters residency. Some programs require that a certain number of hours be taken in person. The masters\u2019 degrees in information technology (ALM in IT) and environmental management are the only two that appear to have the smallest residency requirement. Many of the classes offered by the Extension School do not have an online option, so beyond the residency requirement, some classes must be taken in person.\nMaster\u2019s Degree Courses\nThe ALM in IT program I chose concentrated in Software Engineering\u2013basically a Master\u2019s of Arts in IT focused on developing software. It consisted of 10 four hour courses with the final course being the thesis. In addition to Harvard professors, the Extension School has lecturers teaching elective classes that come from local companies and even non-professors from Harvard. For example, one of the classes I took on XML was taught by the programmer responsible for all of the XML-driven websites and course catalogs for the Extension School. Having these two types of teachers proved very valuable. The Harvard professors were particularly good at teaching theoretical concepts and mathematics. The industry teachers were very good at teaching the classes that dealt with how to get things done in the real world. My program required that at least 8 classes (32 of the 40 hours) be taken from \u201cHarvard Instructors.\u201d I believe most of the other programs have a similar requirement.\nThe difficulty of the courses seemed to vary greatly, but this was probably a function of my previous experience more than anything else. Coming from a totally unrelated field, but with a lot of hands-on experience, meant that there were some gaps I had to fill in while taking classes that probably wouldn\u2019t have been an issue for someone with an undergraduate computer science background. The Theory of Computation class was especially difficult for me. In fact, I took it twice. Halfway through it the first time, I was getting a B, but really struggling. I ended up dropping it. That summer, I took a course in discrete mathematics. It wasn\u2019t required for the degree, but it filled in some of the background I needed to pass the Theory of Computation the next semester.\nI was impressed with how helpful the teaching fellow was during the the class that I found to be difficult. At the same time, I realized how difficult it is to take the classes online when you are struggling. There is something about sitting down in the room with someone that really benefits your comprehension. You simply don\u2019t get trying to explain things back and forth over email. On the other hand, writing your questions on email can help you clarify your thoughts. Often, I found the answer to my problem simply by trying to formulate a written question.\nThe Theory of Computation class was taught by Harry Lewis, who had taught the same class for years. He was teaching the class for the last time. The teaching fellows brought in some cake and refreshments on the last day. That\u2019s another downside of not being on campus\u2013no cake. Interesting side note: Dr. Lewis taught the same class to Bill Gates before he dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft.\nOnline Master\u2019s Degree Distance Education Experience\nTaking classes by watching the lectures on your computer and communicating by email is hard. It is very hard. It is much easier to go to a physical class and sit with a bunch of your fellow students than participate in an online degree program . It is not something that everyone can do. It can be very frustrating and leave you feeling very isolated. Before making a huge commitment to try to earn a master\u2019s\u00a0 degree using distance education technology, make sure you try a class or two. You have to make sure it works with your personality. It definitely isn\u2019t for everyone. Most of my education through high school was self paced and individualized working through textbooks and workbooks on my own. A teacher was available for questions, but there wasn\u2019t any type of lecture. It involved reading, doing problem sets and then telling the teacher when you are ready to take the test. Distance education seemed like something of a hybrid between my college and high school education.\nIn theory, you can watch the lectures multiple times, but in\u00a0 practice, this would require a huge time investment. It is convenient to go back and re-watch a section that you didn\u2019t understand, but not nearly as effective as asking the student sitting next to you, attending a study group, raising your hand, visiting your professor during office hours or catching him/her after class.\nI found some software that would let me speed up or slow down the lectures without changing the pitch. For material that I was already very familiar with, I\u2019d play it 20% faster. Also, if I was reviewing a lecture for the second time, I\u2019d speed it up even more and slow it back down when I came to sections I didn\u2019t fully understand. When I encountered material that was very difficult, I\u2019d slow the playback down to 80% of the original to give myself more time to process what was being said.\nMaster\u2019s Degree Cost\nThe biggest expense of a master\u2019s degree is rarely the the tuition. The opportunity cost\u2013the money you could have been earning at a job during the time you were going to school\u2013usually represents the biggest expense. Unless you have a very flexible employer, it is going to be difficult to take traditional classes while you continue your day job. Distance education courses allow you to minimize this opportunity cost. You can keep working your normal job while taking many of your classes. Make sure you consider the lost income potential of programs that require you to stop working.\nA four-hour class from the Harvard Extension School costs somewhere around $1,800 to $1,850 now. They were slightly cheaper when I started. This works out to about $450 per credit hour. This is extremely inexpensive. Columbia\u2019s Video Network and Standford\u2019s Center for Professional Development both appear to charge around $1,300 per credit hour. Compared to both of those, Harvard tuition seems\u00a0 cheap.\nHarvard\u2019s tuition is only slightly more than the per credit hour cost of master\u2019s degree tuition at both Kansas University and Kansas State University resident tuition and less expensive than out-of-state tuition for either of those institutions. Some state schools\u2019 instate tuition may be more expensive than Harvard. The value provided by Harvard\u2019s Extension School is very good and is less expensive than any other comparable option I could find. In addition it is less expensive than a number of much less reputable schools. (University of Phoenix online tuition works out to nearly $700 per credit hour and it looks like Capella\u2019s tuition is in the $600 per credit hour range.)\nMaster\u2019s Degree Thesis\nMy thesis took a very long time. The actual writing part didn\u2019t take too long, but getting the thesis proposal approved and locating a thesis director took years. Off-campus students seem to have a bit more trouble getting a thesis director assigned. (I think they have made some changes to help fix this, now.) First, you submit a thesis proposal and get it approved by the research adviser for your area of study. Then a thesis director is assigned. The director is the one who will give you your final grade\u2013there isn\u2019t a thesis committee. The research adviser does review your thesis to make sure it meets Harvard\u2019s standards for clarity, organization and formatting. Harvard does a good job of giving you what you need to complete the thesis. There are Microsoft Word templates for the Thesis Proposal and the actual Thesis that make it very easy to deal with the citations, various tables of content, etc.\nMy thesis involved writing a piece of software and then writing a detailed explanation of how it worked, the technology behind it, and how it was different from other pieces of software. In the end, I ended up with a nicely bound 180 page document.\nWhen you are doing things remotely, the thesis work involves a lot of emailing documents back and forth. I ran into some problems getting Word on a Mac to show images correctly when they were transferred to Windows. (It turns out, images don\u2019t embed properly if you just drag them into the document.) So my thesis director would print the PDF I sent him, mark it up, scan it back in and send back the PDF image of the scan. Later on we started using the editing features in Word.\nOnce the research adviser and the thesis director were both happy with the document, I sent it to a bindery in Massachusetts. They printed and bound two copies. One was sent to me in Kansas, and the other was sent to the Harvard Extension School to go in the library there. I highly recommend Wells Bindery .\u00a0 Their cost per page for color was about 1/5th what other binderies were going to charge. They had Harvard\u2019s binding requirements on file and took care of everything without requiring every specific detail.\nBe aware that there is a time limit on how long you can take to complete your master\u2019s degree. I was well beyond that limit, but I was told that once you get to the point where you are waiting on them to find a thesis director \u201cthe clock stops\u201d and doesn\u2019t count against you. Now, if I had needed a further extension on my thesis, I would have needed to petition and possibly retake any classes that were over five years old.\nNot every master\u2019s degree program requires a thesis. The program I was in added the option to do a \u201ccapstone\u201d course instead of a thesis right around the time I was in the middle of my thesis proposal.\nIs it a \u201cReal\u201d Harvard Master\u2019s Degree?\nDiploma from Harvard Extension School\nThis is the question that everyone seems to ask. Yes, it is a real master\u2019s degree from Harvard. You get the same diploma as everyone else. It lists your degree as \u201cMagistri in Artibus Liberalibus Studiorum Prolatorum\u201d that is \u201cMaster of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies.\u201d I think the \u201cExtension Studies\u201d addition is something fairly new and I don\u2019t think that was on diplomas from previous years. I\u2019m guessing that this is due to some of the criticism that admission to the Extension School programs doesn\u2019t involve the same level of scrutiny that is required of other Harvard schools. This is completely true. Admission to the Extension School is based solely on your ability to perform well in that program. It is worth noting that the admission process to other Harvard schools has in the past been criticized for being based on factors other than academic merit.\nOn the other hand, graduates of the Harvard Extension School who worked full-time while getting their master\u2019s degrees might complain that the students who were able to go to school full-time had things too easy. Holding down a full-time job while maintaining the discipline to complete an online master\u2019s degree from an academically rigorous school is very difficult. It is much harder to sit alone in a room late at night after work watching lectures and doing problem sets than it is to attend class with your peers. The skills that will let you pull that off will generally go a long way toward helping you succeed.\nStill, a lot of the value from going to college occurs outside the classroom. This is one of the biggest drawbacks to getting a degree predominately through online classes. For a second Master\u2019s degree while you are working a full time job, it isn\u2019t as big of a deal.

Students in other schools should speak to their adviser about other opportunities available to them.\nI\u2019m a Stern/Steinhardt student, but I\u2019m doing a second major in CAS.\u00a0 Can I apply?\nNo.\u00a0 Even though your second major is from CAS your degree is still from your home school.\nI\u2019m a student in the Core Program (formerly LSP) but will transition to CAS next year.\u00a0 Can I apply to the BA/MA program prior to my transition?\nStudents in the Core Program should wait until they have transitioned to the College before applying.\u00a0 Prior to transitioning they should feel free to consult with the BA/MA adviser regarding the program.\nI have more than 96 credits but am only in my third year.\u00a0 Am I still eligible to apply?\nStudents with more than 96 may still be eligible to apply to the program provided they have not yet begun their senior year.\u00a0 To be considered, students must have completed no more than 6 semesters and have at least one year of full time study remaining for their BA.\nI\u2019m a senior but just heard about this program.\u00a0 Is it still possible to apply?\nNo.\u00a0 Seniors are not eligible to apply to the BA/MA Program.\u00a0 That said, seniors can still apply to the Graduate School and take advantage of the CAS/GSAS tuition discount program .\nI\u2019m interested in applying to the program but my GPA is below 3.5. \u00a0Can the 3.5 GPA requirement be waived?\nGenerally no. Students whose GPA is just below a 3.5 (3.4) should speak to the BA/MA adviser regarding eligibility.\u00a0 In certain cases, students with a GPA below a 3.5 may apply to the program provided they raise their GPA above a 3.5 by the end of the semester. In no case will a student be admitted to the Graduate School under the BA/MA program whose GPA is below a 3.5.\nAPPLICATION PROCESS\nWhat do I need to submit with my application?\nIn addition to the application, you will need to submit a statement of purpose, 2 letters of recommendation and an unofficial copy of your transcript (available on Albert). Some departments (Bioethics, World History) also require a writing sample.\u00a0 Please check with the department for any additional required materials.\nWhen are applications due?\nComplete applications, including all supporting materials, are due on November 1 (for Fall) or April 1 (for Spring).\nI missed the application deadline.\u00a0 Can I still apply?\nStudents who miss the application deadline should contact the College Advising Center to see if it is still possible to apply after the deadline.\u00a0 Decisions as to whether to allow students to apply late will be made on a case-by-case basis.\nWhere should I submit my application?\nComplete applications should be submitted to:\nBA/MA Program\n100 Washington Square East, Silver 905\nNew York, NY 10003\nTo ensure that all of your applications materials are received in a timely manner, you are strongly encouraged to submit all of your application materials, including letters of recommendation (in sealed envelopes with signatures across the back flap) together at the same time.\nThe application form asks for department and program codes.\u00a0 What are those and where can I find them?\nDepartment and program codes are available on the GSAS Application Resource Center website .\u00a0 In order for CAS to process your application, you must include both codes.\nThe application form asks for the term I plan to enter GSAS.\u00a0 What does this mean?\nPlease list the term (fall/spring/summer) and year that you plan to enter GSAS as a full-time MA student NOT the term that you plan to begin taking classes.\u00a0 Note that students admitted to the BA/MA program are expected to matriculate into the Graduate School in the fall/spring semester immediately following graduation.\u00a0 Deferments are not possible.\nWho should I ask to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf?\nIdeally, both letters of recommendation would come from full-time faculty in the department to which you are applying. That said students often have difficulty identifying two professors who know them well enough to write a letter on their behalf.\u00a0 In these cases, students can get a second letter from a TA in the department, an instructor outside of the graduate department, or an instructor at an NYU abroad site.\u00a0\u00a0 Letters from internship supervisors, academic advisers, or other individuals who have not had you in class are strongly discouraged.\nWhat should I include in my statement of purpose?\nA statement of purpose for graduate school is different than a personal statement for undergrad.\u00a0 While heartwarming stories about your volunteer work in Mexico or your triumphal performance in your high school\u2019s production of Annie may tell a graduate director something about you personally, it says little about your reasons for pursuing an MA and whether you are prepared to pursue graduate education.\nAn effective statement of purpose should convey your reasons for wanting to pursue graduate study, the specific issues/ideas you want to study in the graduate program, any relevant coursework and experience that has prepared you for graduate study, and how an MA at NYU fits into your overall academic and career goals.\nHow long should my statement of purpose be?\nYour statement of purpose should be one page, single-spaced in a standard font with standard margins.\nI\u2019m currently studying abroad.\u00a0 Can I apply to the program remotely?\nYes.\u00a0 Students studying abroad can submit the application form and personal statement via email (we\u2019ll take care of the transcript).\u00a0 Letters of recommendation can be sent to the Advising Center under separate cover.\nI\u2019ve asked a faculty member from an NYU Abroad Site to write me a letter of recommendation.\u00a0 Is it possible for her to email her letter to you?\nYes.\u00a0 Letters of recommendation from faculty not on the Washington Square campus can be emailed to the BA/MA Program adviser.\nHow long before I know whether or not I\u2019ve been admitted?\nAll applications received in a given semester are forwarded on to the Graduate Directors in the individual departments at the same time, roughly a week after the application deadline.\u00a0 From there, response times vary by the department in question, but generally students should know of their application status within a month of the application deadline. Students who have not received an admissions decision by this time should contact the BA/MA Program adviser.\nNOTE: Since we only send applications to the department once a semester, students who apply to the program early in the semester will need to wait until after the application deadline for an admissions decision.\nAFTER BEING ADMITTED TO THE PROGRAM\nI\u2019ve been admitted to the program, but I still can\u2019t register for graduate classes.What do I do?\nBA/MA students won\u2019t be able to register for graduate courses on Albert until they are formally admitted to the Graduate School at the end of their senior year. Until then, they will need to work with their MA department (typically the Director of Graduate Studies and the MA Program administrator) to register for appropriate graduate courses.\nHow do I know what courses to register for?\nAdmitted students should contact the Director of Graduate Studies for advice on the Master\u2019s component of their program.They should continue to work with their adviser(s) in their undergraduate department(s) on matters regarding their BA program.\nI\u2019m in a Master's course that my undergraduate adviser told me could count towards my major. Can I use this course towards both degree requirements?\nNo.Under no circumstances can a course be used towards the requirements towards both degrees.Students must decide which degree they wish to apply the course towards.\nMy graduate courses are still being listed under my undergraduate degree requirements. How can I fix this?\nIn your last semester (earlier if you wish) you will need to specify which graduate courses will be used towards the MA degree. Until that time, the graduate courses will continue to count towards your undergraduate degree requirements. When assessing your degree progress, it is important to keep this in mind so that you can be sure to complete all of your BA requirements and at least a quarter of your Master's degree.\nMy cumulative GPA dipped below a 3.5. Can I stay in the program?\nStudents must have at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA in order to be formally admitted to the Graduate School. If, prior to graduation, your GPA dips below a 3.5 you must pull it back up to this level in order to matriculate into GSAS.\nWhat is the minimum grade I need to earn in my graduate courses for them to count towards the MA?\nStudents must earn at least a B in any MA coursework that they intend to apply towards the MA degree.\nDo the grades earned in graduate coursework taken as a CAS student count towards the 3.5 GPA requirement?\nNo. Graduate courses will not count towards the undergraduate GPA.\u00a0 Students wishing to transition to GSAS should make sure that their GPA is above a 3.5 once graduate courses are set aside.\nI'm on track to finish the requirements for both the BA and the MA in the same semester.\u00a0 Can I graduate from both schools simultaneously?\nNo. In accordance with NY State law the registrar cannot confer two degrees in the same calendar year.\u00a0 Students are encouraged to finish their undergrad degree in a way that would allow them to spend a full academic year in GSAS.\u00a0 While students who complete a significant amount of MA courses while an undergraduate may not need to a full year to complete their remaining requirements, they must be a matriculated student in GSAS for a year before receiving the MA degree.\nTRANSITIONING TO GSAS\nWhen do I need to notify CAS that I intend to continue with the Master's portion of the BA/MA program?\nStudents must notify CAS by March 1st if they plan to matriculate into GSAS the following fall. Students who intend to matriculate in the spring must notify CAS by November 1st. At this time, students must complete a Request for Matriculation form that specifies the semester that they want to enter the Graduate School and the graduate courses that they would like to use towards the Master's degree.\nI intend to graduate this semester but have not completed the necessary graduate coursework (i.e. a quarter of the masters degree). Can I still matriculate into the Graduate School next semester?\nStudents must complete at least a quarter of the graduate program in order to enter GSAS under the terms of the BA/MA program. If possible, students can take graduate courses over the summer to fulfill this requirement, but would need to take these courses as an undergraduate student, thereby delaying their graduation from CAS until September.\nNow that my graduate courses aren\u2019t counting towards my undergraduate degree, I\u2019m short of the necessary requirements for the BA. What do I do?\nStudents in the BA/MA program are required to complete all of the requirements for the BA degree, so you will need to work with your department and CAS advising to come up with a plan to complete your CAS degree.\nI\u2019m a senior who is graduating this semester. How do I register for graduate classes next semester?\nIn order to register for graduate classes as an MA student you must first be formally admitted to GSAS. Once you receive a formal offer of admission, you will be able to register as an MA student. It is important that you do not register for graduate courses as a CAS student \u2013 doing so will affect your graduation. Please note that very often you will not receive your formal acceptance prior to registration week. This generally will not impact your ability to register for your desired classes.\nAFTER MATRICULATING TO GSAS\nWhen will the 50% scholarship appear on my financial aid statement / bursar's account?\nBA/MA awards are posted after a student has registered for courses. The Graduate School awards are typically on student accounts by the end of August. If a student is registered and does not see their award on their bursar account by the end of August, they may send an email, with their name and UID to gsas.admissions@nyu.edu\nWhat is the procedure for transferring graduate credits earned in CAS onto the GSAS transcript?\nStudents must first contact the graduate administrator in the department. The department administrator along with the student needs to complete a Transfer Credit Request Form: http://gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.pdf.transfercreditrequest\n"}, {"score": 2172.9675, "uuid": "59085ccf-9849-54a4-bdc1-2c703ed43763", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-70-21477", "target_hostname": "me.engin.umich.edu", "target_uri": "http://me.engin.umich.edu/academics/ugsh/bachelors", "page_rank": 2.5266045e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "<em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> | UM Department of Mechanical Engineering", "snippet": "The Rackham SGUS allows qualified CoE students to pursue <em>a</em> five-year combined <em>Bachelor&#x27;s</em> and <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em>.

As well, minors through LS&A (see CoE Bulletin) and a Concentration in Manufacturing Systems Design or in Energy Systems is available. Refer to the ME Website or consult with staff in the ASO.\n* There are dual degree programs with other Engineering Departments and Joint (MDDP) degrees with other Schools such as Music and LS&A.\nCandidates for the B.S.E. (ME) - must complete the program listed above. This is just a sample of a schedule that will lead to graduation in eight terms.\nAdditional Academic Options\nConcentrations\nWithin the undergraduate degree, the ME department offers two concentrations: energy and manufacturing systems. Neither of these concentrations are required, however, they allow interested students to focus their technical electives in a specific subject area. If you elect to pursue a concentration in either energy or manufacturing, it is possible to satisfy both the ME technical elective requirements as well as the requirements for the concentration, which are provided below.\nFor students interested in declaring a concentration, please visit the Forms section of the Undergraduate Handbook and complete the Concentration Declaration sheet. You can either submit the completed form via email by sending a scanned pdf copy to me-aso@umich.edu , or by dropping it off in person to the ASO (2206 GGB). After you graduate and the completion of the concentration has been confirmed, you will see the concentration on your official transcript, but not your diploma.\nIf you have already declared a concentration and wish to drop it, please fill out another Concentration Declaration sheet and submit to the ASO again via email or in person.\nEnergy Concentration\nGlobal economic, geopolitical, and environmental factors all suggest that improvements are needed in the way that energy is produced, converted, and utilized in the modern world. Mechanical systems are integral to all three of these activities. The undergraduate concentration in energy, consisting of 12 credit hours, is defined below. For more information, contact the peer or academic advisors in the Academic Services Office or Professor Wooldridge (mswool@umich.edu) .\nStudents must be in good standing to declare the concentration and must pass all classes with satisfactory grades.

This concentration is open to undergraduates pursuing a degree in the Mechanical Engineering department. The MSC focuses on a systems level approach to manufacturing and design for future requirements; it may also increase employment opportunities in the manufacturing sector.\nThe concentration consists of at least 13 credit hours of coursework in manufacturing related areas; specifically, three concentration core courses for 8 hours and two elective courses for 5-6 hours.

Conducting research with a faculty member, through ME490 Independent Study, is an excellent way to gain hands-on experience and earn credit towards your degree at the same time.\nStudents with senior standing can receive technical elective credit for completing ME490 research. ME490 can only count for Category 3C technical elective credit; it will not count as an ME4xx level or higher technical elective (Category 1) or as a core technical elective (Category 2). For students interested in continuing their independent research project over two semesters, they can enroll in ME491. However, ME491 is only available when you have already elected and completed ME490.\nIf you are interested in doing a ME490 independent research project, please visit the ME490/590 Registration and Report Submission web page for complete step by step instructions, expectations, and due dates.\nMinors\nFor students looking to compliment their Mechanical Engineering degree with additional coursework in another area of interest, there are several minors and programs available for you to choose from. In general, the department offering the minor is always the one responsible for establishing requirements for that minor and declaring students into the minor. Therefore, questions related to a specific minor should be directed to the department offering it and not the ME department.\nDepending on the minor chosen and the amount of course overlap with ME degree requirements , some courses may be able to be counted for both the B.S.E. degree and the minor. If a course required for a minor will not fit in any of the categories of requirements for the ME degree, it will likely count as a general elective.\nStudents interested in pursuing a minor should visit the websites listed below. Additionally, the CoE Bulletin offers a broad overview of some of these minors that are offered through the College of Engineering.\nInternational Minor - The International Minor addresses the need for engineers who can combine technical expertise with international understanding. The International Minor requirements include foreign language proficiency, coursework pertaining to non-U.S. countries, intercultural communication skills, and global trends in engineering and business. Students must also pursue practical overseas experience through study, work or volunteer abroad. The minor requires 16-20 credits to complete, depending on the foreign language elected.\nMultidisciplinary Design Minor - This minor allows undergraduate engineering students to obtain practical hands-on experience designing, building, and testing technology systems in collaboration with students from other disciplines both inside and outside of engineering. The minor can be satisfied with 15 credits of coursework associated with specialized multidisciplinary team projects, which may include competitive teams such as Solar Car, Steel Bridge, and Human-Powered Submarines.\nElectrical Engineering (EE) Minor - The EE minor is offered through the EECS Department and is intended to give students the opportunity to pursue one of three paths: Systems: Communications, Control, Signal Processing, Electromagnetics and Optics, or Circuits and Solid State. ME students pursuing the EE minor must take EECS 215, which will count in place of EECS 314. For additional information, visit the EECS Department website.\nEntrepreneurship Program - Undergraduate engineering students are able to study business methods associated with writing business plans, obtaining venture capital and other funding, intellectual property, etc. The Program in Entrepreneurship Certificate requires at least 9 credits of business related courses and seminars.\nLSA Minors - Almost all LSA departments offer a minor available to students in any college at the UM Ann Arbor. If you are interested in pursuing a LSA minor, please contact the applicable department directly. For your convenience, the two most common LSA minors are listed below:\n- Minor in Mathematics : Through the ME degree, students are required to take Math 215, Math 216, and an advanced math course, all of which can be double counted toward the math minor. Consequently, ME students interested in pursuing a math minor only need two additional courses to satisfy the Math Department's minor requirements.\n- Minor in Physics : Similar to the math minor, several courses required for the ME degree will double count for the physics minor, including Physics 140/141 and Physics 240/241. To complete the physics minor two additional courses and a laboratory are required.\nStudy Abroad\nStudents who engage in Study Abroad opportunities gain first-hand knowledge of other cultures and learn to appreciate cultural diversity. In addition, from these experiences, students learn to approach engineering problems with new insight. This experience allows students to more readily adapt to new situations and successfully interact with colleagues from around the world.\nIf you are interested in studying abroad and earning credit internationally, please visit the study abroad section of the International Programs in Engineering website. Keep in mind that it will be difficult to find any of our design or lab courses abroad (i.e. ME 250, ME 350, ME 395, ME 450, and ME 495). Because none of these courses can be taken in the same semester, we recommend that students planning to go abroad do so the winter semester of their sophomore year (e.g. take ME 250 in the fall semester) or go abroad over a summer.\nTo determine if a study abroad course will transfer to the UM, please visit the CoE Transfer Credit Office website to locate the course CoE and LSA course equivalency databases.\nDual and Joint Undergraduate Degrees\nDual Degrees\nDual degrees may be obtained with Mechanical Engineering and other programs in the College of Engineering. These require 142 (minimum) credits hours, and result in the award of two B.S.E. degrees (one in Mechanical Engineering and one in the other program). Since these programs involve a substantial amount of double counting of credit, a dual degree student cannot enter the SGUS program. Transfer credit may also be limited.\nAdmission to a dual degree program requires approval from both departments and is available for any student who has maintained a GPA of 3.0 or higher, both cumulative as well as in \"core\" subjects.\nThese dual-degrees programs currently exist:\nAerospace Engineering\n"}, {"score": 2171.0374, "uuid": "5c7f069e-47a2-561f-944f-c1325a854d8c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0411wb-61-30351", "target_hostname": "www.allpsychologyschools.com", "target_uri": "http://www.allpsychologyschools.com/psychology-careers/community/masters-industrial-organizational-psychology", "page_rank": 1.1727264e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "<em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> in Industrial-Organizational Psychology", "snippet": "Students earning <em>a</em> <em>master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> are expected to acquire knowledge <em>from</em> <em>a</em> broad selection of core subject areas, though individual programs may place special emphasis on <em>different</em> areas.", "explanation": null, "document": "Return to The Doctor Is In | Find Psychology Schools\nBy Sarah Stevenson\nThe growing field of industrial-organizational psychology focuses on applying psychological principles and research to the workplace in areas ranging from management and personnel to sales and marketing.

Thus, this series of articles will review each of the masters programs in forensic psychology and provide information on each program in a similar format so as to assist in comparisons between the various options.\nThe goal of this series of articles is simply to provide information in a consistent format to assist those individuals who are considering an education in forensic psychology and not to convince anyone to attend a particular program. Having been a professor in this field for the last 13 years I am familiar at some level with almost every forensic psychology program available in North America. Many undergraduate students are not familiar with all the possible options and so this series will lay them out in a consistent format for ease of comparison.\nMasters Degree in Forensic Psychology \u2013 Marymount University\nProgram Description\nFrom the website : Marymount University has been a leader in preparing individuals to be part of one of the most sought-after career fields today \u2013 forensic psychology.\nMarymount was the first Washington, DC, area university to offer the Master of Arts in Forensic Psychology. And you can capitalize on the University\u2019s alliances and proximity to key agencies important to study in this field \u2013 organizations such as the FBI, NCIS, the Supreme Court, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice. MU integrates the resources of such agencies through site visits, courtroom observations, field research, internships, and distinguished speakers.\nThe discipline of forensic psychology is concerned with the application of psychological knowledge to the juvenile, civil, and criminal justice systems. Marymount\u2019s Forensic Psychology program is interdisciplinary and combines study in sociology, criminal justice, and public policy, in addition to the many subfields of psychology. It addresses questions of value, such as how best to achieve fairness and justice in the American adversarial legal system, as well as empirical issues such as the origins of criminal behavior, problems with eyewitness testimony, evaluation of threats against public figures, personalities of political leaders, the origins of terrorism, evaluation and treatment of offenders and their victims, and the effectiveness of trial consultation. Each course incorporates an ethics component to encourage you to grapple with the extremely complicated issues involved in a career in forensic psychology.\nSpecializations\nNo concentrations are available. All students take the same series of courses (2 of which are electives for the student to choose).\nCredits\nThe program consists of 39 credits (13 courses, including an internship experience in forensic psychology).\nThesis\nNot required. It does not appear that completing a thesis is an option in this program; however, it appears that there are research opportunities available for those students who desire this experience.\nExternship/Practicum\nRequired. Students must complete a pass/fail internship experience in forensic psychology, which consists of 300 hours (270 hours on site and 30 hours in the classroom).\nAdmission Requirements\nApplicants must have a bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited college or university and must submit their GRE scores.\nTuition & Fees\n"}, {"score": 2163.3079, "uuid": "25d34a34-922c-587e-91b6-1c18965e000e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-34-08303", "target_hostname": "businessmajors.about.com", "target_uri": "http://businessmajors.about.com/od/degreeoptions/a/Should-I-Earn-A-Project-Management-Degree.htm", "page_rank": 1.2054219e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Project Management <em>Degree</em> - Should I Earn <em>a</em> Project Management <em>Degree</em>?", "snippet": "Most project management <em>degree</em> programs at the <em>bachelor&#x27;s</em> level include <em>a</em> combination of general education courses and project management courses. * <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>Degree</em> - <em>Master&#x27;s</em> <em>degree</em> programs usually take one to two years to complete.", "explanation": null, "document": "certifications\nWhat Is a Project Management Degree?\nA project management degree is a type of academic degree awarded to students who have completed a college, university, or business school program that focuses on project management.\nTypes of Project Management Degrees\nThere are four basic types of project management degrees that can be earned from a college, university, or business school. They include:\nAssociate's Degree - An associate's degree in project management takes approximately two years to complete. The bulk of courses will be general education courses. However, there will be some electives that focus on project management.\nBachelor's Degree - A bachelor's degree program in project management takes approximately four years to complete. However, there are some accelerated programs that will award a degree after only three years time. Most project management degree programs at the bachelor's level include a combination of general education courses and project management courses.\nMaster's Degree - Master's degree programs usually take one to two years to complete. Some programs may be MBA programs with a focus on project management. Although some core courses may be required, nearly all of the courses in a master's or MBA program will revolve around project management or closely related topics.\nPh.D. Degree - The length of a Ph.D. program in project management varies from school to school. Students who pursue this degree are generally interested in research or teaching project management at the university level.\nA degree isn't absolutely necessary for a career in project management. However, it can certainly enhance your resume. A degree may increase your chances of getting an entry level position. It may also help you to advance in your career. Most project managers have at least a bachelor's degree--though the degree is not always in project management or even business.\nIf you are interested in earning one of the many project management certifications available from organizations like the Project Management Institute, you will need at least a high school diploma or the equivalent. A bachelor's degree may also be required for some certifications.\nChoosing a Project Management Degree Program\nAn increasing number of colleges, universities, and business schools are offering degree programs, seminars, and individual courses in project management. If you are looking for a project management degree program, you should take time to research all of your available options. You may be able to earn your degree from a campus-based or online program. This means that you may not have to choose a school that is near you, but could choose a school that is a better fit for your academic needs and career goals.\nWhen researching project management degree programs--both campus-based and online--you should take time to find out if the school/program is accredited. Accreditation will improve your chances of getting financial aid, quality education, and post-graduation job opportunities.\nProject Management Certifications\nEarning certifications is not necessary to work in project management . However, a project management certification is a good way to demonstrate your knowledge and experience. It may be helpful when trying to secure new positions or advance in your career.

I can't be in the classroom nightly for coursework - so this program really appealed to me.

My name is Ms. Ebony Valentine and I am a two-time graduate of Capella University. I was one of the first graduates of their School Counseling program in 2009, and my second Masters in education curriculum and instruction in 2010. My journey was very hard, fulfilling and rewarding. Obtaining my degrees online was a wise choice for me to continue raising my son and working two jobs. I worked as an assistant teacher and a GED coordinator for the New York City Department of Education. Capella courses allowed me to study and do research at my own pace. If any one ever asks, learning online is much harder than the traditional classroom setting. The courses were very educational, vigorous and challenging. One of the challenging parts was reading and analyzing what other learners wrote and having to respond with understanding and a question. In a traditional setting the students rarely get to openly analyze each others views. The instructors were great, always available and now CACREP certification! I am proud and honored to be a graduate from Capella University and a New Yorker. Another, great attribute that learning online at Capella University has to offer you get to visit many parts of the world while sitting at your computer. Networking with many different individuals has broadened my people skills to unbelievable heights, which is one of the most important skills needed to be a great school counselor and I thank you Capella for opening that doorway. I am really saddened to see that this program is temporally closed to New York learners because if there is a will there is a way! Remember, I stated I worked as an assistant teacher for New York City department of education; I graduated in 2009 with my masters in human service School-counseling specialization from Capella University. I received my license in 2010 from the New York State Department of Education, and was hired as a school counselor here in New York City. If there is a WILL, there is a WAY!\nSchool Counseling Program at Capella University\nNovember 23, 2010\nJackelyn\nThe masters in school counseling program at Capella is an excellent program for one to complete their master's degree at. This program is CACREP accreditated and highly reccommended. The online school counseling program allows you to work a job, have time for your family, manage recreation time and complete your course work without having to be in a classroom several days a week. In fact, the advising department is extremely helpful and will assist you with any of your needs or concerns. My experience so far has been amazing and I enjoy the online learning environment while networking with many different individuals from various areas within the United States. Most of all, the instructors are great help and very supportive to the students at Capella. More than ever, this learner will never forget this rewarding life experience. Take care, Jackelyn Burgess\nCACREP + NCATE = ideal\nNovember 22, 2010\nKim\nI am in my first year and have had great feedback from the local school district on this program, of which they had never heard. It is clear to them that it is high quality with two major accreditations in the field. Also, I have experienced more support and clarity in progressing throught the program than I ever expected. Faculty are excellent and staff go the extra mile. Syllabi, texts, discussion questions are intregrated very well so that there is no \"fluff\" ... while the pace remains workable. I was worried about taking two courses with a FT job but I have established a routine based on my family adn work schedule and so far so good. I have met some great people that I plan to network with as alumni, too. I love the diversity of learners across the country and the social networking to stay in touch even if you aren't in a class together.\nSchool Counseling Masters Program\nSeptember 1, 2011\nBeth\nI have been at Capella since 2008 and i am finishing up with my masters program. i just have two more classes and the colloquim and internship and practicum.

It is kind of expensive but you pay for what you get and that is a good college, good professors and a flexible schedule.\nPennsylvania\nJanuary 26, 2011\nnichol\nHello, I was wondering if anyone has earned a school counseling degree from Capella and got a job in Pennylvania, if so was there anything extra you had to do?\nThe Light at the End of the Tunnel\nAugust 31, 2011\nSerenity\nI am a school counseling learner at Capella University. I began my journey in the Summer of 2008; and I will graduate in June of 2012. I began taking courses at Capella part time (1 course/quarter); but within the last year, I ramped up to full time (2+/quarter). I am a military wife and stay at home mom; so I needed a program that was flexible. After getting accepted to a few local universities in a few of the locations we were stationed in; I finally realized that if I wanted the degree, I would have to do it \"Capella\" style. Capella University has exceeded my expectations! I have interacted and met (face to face via the 2 required residencies) some amazing people. Not only are you able to learn and grow via the courseroom; but the required fieldwork will ensure that you practice those skills that you have learned in your courses.
