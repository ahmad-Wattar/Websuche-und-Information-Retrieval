We can't believe all the cruel things Blackie and Callie said about us. Therefore, as Paul Harvey says, here's the rest of the story.\nBlackie and Callie are just jealous! Except in our own defense, we would never write a hub like that. It was spiteful and mean-spirited. It just goes to show you how cats think.\nYes, it is true. Katie does frequently wake the cats up. However, what do they expect? I've seen those cats sleep over half their day away. Do you want to know a fact? Only the opossum and bat sleep longer than cats. Obviously, they haven't heard the quote by Homer, \"Even where sleep is concerned, too much is a bad thing.\"\nIf you're sleeping all the time, how can you get anything done? This is part of the problem around here. Callie and Blackie think they don't have to do anything but eat and sleep. They think all they have to do to earn their keep is lie on Mom's lap and allow her to pet them. Have you ever heard of anything so crazy? At least, Katie and I contribute to the household. Day and night, we guard their house and protect everyone from the hidden dangers lurking outside.\nUnbelievably, they can't even a kill a mouse. When they see a mouse, they chase it all around the house. When they finally catch it, do you think they could kill it? Nooooo. They drop it on the floor and bat it all around the room while Mom is screaming, \"Kill it! Kill it! In the end, I have to go break its neck so Mom will settle down. You tell me what kind of heartless animal would maim another animal and let it suffer? Enough said. On to another subject.\nYes, it's true. A skunk sprayed me twice, but I was only trying to protect Mom from being sprayed too. How dare they make seem stupid! Moreover, no, I don't like baths, but how about them? They act even worse when it comes time for their baths. Not only do they fight and splash water all about, but they hurt mom too. I've seen her arms covered with scratches from their antics. Katie and I would never do that!\nThe litter box. This is one concept I don't understand at all! We have to go outside, yet the cats have a litter box inside the house. And talk about stink, what do they think it smells like?\nChewing. No, I'm not going to deny it. I did chew up many things, but I was teething. My gums hurt so much! I still remember how painful it was. Even human babies get teething rings filled with ice. Maybe if Mom had bought me a teething ring, I wouldn't have chewed up all those things either.\nEating. I can't believe they called us pigs! I guess Callie hasn't taken a look at herself lately in the mirror. Even Mom jokingly calls her Fatty Patty or Hefty Hannah. Not to be mean, but her backside is so wide, she's not even graceful anymore. When she tries to jump on something, she misses half the time. When she does make her landing, if there's anything on the table or end tables, she knocks it off.\nBlackie is not any better. No, he's not fat like Callie, but you should see him if his food bowl starts to get empty. Acting like a lunatic, he races throughout the house, jumping on and off the furniture, until someone fills the bowl up to the top. It doesn't even matter if it's 4 AM. On the rare occasion it's empty, he scratches in his bowl as if he's digging a hole in the ground.\nWell, I'm not going to be spiteful like those rascally cats. I could go on all day about their jealousy, their inability to share, their inability to get along with others, and so forth. However, dogs aren't like that. They know how to live and let live. They know how to work for the common good of all. You humans are smart. You tell me. Which makes the better pet?\nSincerely\n"}, {"score": 1637.4204, "uuid": "90483861-a8e2-5b1e-b81c-a81b5b88142e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1907wb-82-12258", "target_hostname": "www.beckyspetcare.com", "target_uri": "http://www.beckyspetcare.com/are-female-dogs-smarter-than-male-dogs/", "page_rank": 1.1814981e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Are</em> Female <em>Dogs</em> Smarter <em>Than</em> Male <em>Dogs</em>?", "snippet": "Female <em>dogs</em> nurture offspring\u2014this could be one possible explanation for cognitive differences in male and female <em>dogs</em>.

They studied 50 dogs, a mix of golden retrievers, poodles, Australian shepherds and mutts, and divided them into two groups\u201425 males and 25 females.\nUsing blue tennis balls attached to a board with strings, four different scenarios were presented to both groups of dogs:\n1. A small tennis ball disappears behind the board and then reappears.\n2. A large tennis ball disappears behind the board and then reappears.\n3. A small tennis ball disappears behind the board but a large ball appears.\n4. A large tennis ball disappears behind the board but a small ball appears.\nConsistently, a different response emerged between sexes and across all breed types.\nFemale Dogs Keep an Eye on the Ball\nWhile male dogs appeared oblivious to any change in the disappearing blue tennis balls, female dogs immediately noticed a difference.\nIn scenarios 3 and 4, female dogs stared at the different sized balls that appeared for an average of 30 seconds\u2014three times longer than they did when the same sized ball reappeared from behind the wooden board.\nResearchers concluded that the female dogs noticed the change and therefore had superior cognitive abilities. So, why do Fidettes have a leg up on Fido when it comes to detecting the unexpected?\nExplaining Behavioral Differences in Dogs\nWhile researchers don\u2019t know why the differences exist between male and female dogs, all signs point to behavioral characteristics.\n\u201cMale and female canines didn\u2019t have very different lifestyles that would\u2019ve led to this cognitive difference,\u201d says Corsin M\u03cbller, one of the lead researchers on the study.\nFemale dogs nurture offspring\u2014this could be one possible explanation for cognitive differences in male and female dogs. Male dogs are genetically wired to be hunters; females are nesters and therefore may be better with spatial reasoning.\nResearchers are also quick to point out that no difference was noted in neutered or non-neutered dogs. This logic suggests that cognitive development in each gender was established early on and is not a result of hormones.\nSounds like man\u2019s best friend has more in common with us after all.

If the chimp or dog retrieved the object -- which is out of reach of the human but within reach of the animals -- they would be rewarded with a tasty food treat.\nThe chimps bombed, ignoring the human gestures, even though they were interested and motivated to get the food rewards. But the dogs aced the test, the researchers said.\nThe chimpanzees did not see the pointing as important to their goal of getting the food, so they simply ignored the people during the study, they said.\nKaminski said: \"We know that chimpanzees have a very flexible understanding of others. They know what others can or cannot see, when others can or cannot see them, etc.\"\nChimps are therefore not clueless, but they have likely not evolved the tendency to pay attention to humans when trying to achieve goals. Kaminski explained that even wolves do not have this skill. \"Wolves, even when raised in a human environment, are not as flexible with human communication as dogs. Dogs can read human gestures from very early ages on,\" she said.\nAs for cats, prior research found that domesticated felines also pay attention to us and can understand human pointing gestures.\nKaminski, however, mentioned that the researchers had to select them out of many hundreds of cats, suggesting that only certain house kitties are on par with dogs when it comes to understanding people.\nResearchers are now puzzled as popular theories about communication hold that certain core abilities can be inherited, Kaminski said.\nChimpanzees are so close to us on the primate family tree, and yet they cannot seem to understand our pointing gestures. This suggests that pointing may be a unique form of human communication, but dogs challenge the hypothesis.\n\"We therefore need to study in more detail the mechanisms behind dogs' understanding of human forms of communication,\" Kaminski added.\n"}, {"score": 1479.073, "uuid": "f2e7a1fb-33cc-5cf7-b5a9-c05ae106741f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0507wb-60-13262", "target_hostname": "www.ignorancedenied.com", "target_uri": "http://www.ignorancedenied.com/threads/6206-Computer-Learns-Dogspeak-Programs-Can-Classify-Dog-Barks-Better-Than-Humans-Study-Shows", "page_rank": 1.1985103e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Computer Learns Dogspeak: Programs Can Classify <em>Dog</em> Barks <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> <em>Humans</em>", "snippet": "The software could reliably discriminate among individual <em>dogs</em> while <em>humans</em> can not, which suggests that there <em>are</em> individual differences in barks of <em>dogs</em> even though <em>humans</em> <em>are</em> not able to recognise them.", "explanation": null, "document": "0\nComputer Learns Dogspeak: Programs Can Classify Dog Barks Better Than Humans, Study Shows\nScienceDaily (Jan. 19, 2008) \u0097 Computer programs may be the most accurate tool for studying acoustic communications amongst animals, according to Csaba Moln\u00e1r from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Hungary and his research team. Their research shows that a new piece of software is able to classify dog barks according to different situations and even identify barks from individual dogs, a task humans find challenging.\nThe aim of Moln\u00e1r and colleagues\u0092 experiments was to test a computer algorithm\u0092s ability to identify and differentiate the acoustic features of dog barks, and classify them according to different contexts and individual dogs. The software analyzed more than 6000 barks from 14 Hungarian sheepdogs (Mudi breed) in six different situations: \u0091stranger\u0092, \u0091fight\u0092, \u0091walk\u0092, \u0091alone\u0092, \u0091ball\u0092 and \u0091play\u0092. The barks were recorded with a tape recorder before being transferred to the computer, where they were digitalized and individual bark sounds were coded, classified and evaluated.\nIn the first experiment looking at classification of barks into different situations, the software correctly classified the barks in 43 percent of cases. The best recognition rates were achieved for \u0091fight\u0092 and \u0091stranger\u0092 contexts, and the poorest rate was achieved when categorizing \u0091play\u0092 barks. These findings suggest that the different motivational states of dogs in aggressive, friendly or submissive contexts may result in acoustically different barks.\nIn the second experiment looking at the recognition of individual dogs, the algorithm correctly classified the barks in 52 percent of cases. The software could reliably discriminate among individual dogs while humans can not, which suggests that there are individual differences in barks of dogs even though humans are not able to recognise them.\nThe authors conclude by highlighting the value of their new methodology: \u0093The use of advanced machine learning algorithms to classify and analyze animal sounds opens new perspectives for the understanding of animal communication\u0085 The promising results obtained strongly suggest that advanced machine learning approaches deserve to be considered as a new relevant tool for ethology*.\u0094\n* Ethology: the study of animal behavior, with a focus on behavioral patterns in natural environments.\nJournal reference: Molnar C et al (2008).

Clayton - Derbyshire\nTwo Ears are better than one\nIt\u2019s a logical thought, but often people don't realise that hearing loss can affect both ears to a similar degree. With age and noise exposure being the most common cause of hearing loss, it's reasonable to expect that both your ears will be affected in the same way. At Hidden Hearing we believe that in many cases, using two hearing devices together can be a huge advantage for many of our customers, and our hearing aid dispensers will be able to demonstrate the difference between using one and two aids using headphones, or during your trial fitting. Nature gave us two ears after all, and we think it's better that way!\nYour local Hidden Hearing specialists will be able to explain why two hearing aids might be the best solution for your individual needs, but as an overview, here are ten reasons why two devices are better than one.\n1. Better understanding of speech\nResearch has shown that when using just one hearing device, some noises and speech can sound alike and create confusion. With two devices, many clients report that the clarity of their hearing when listening to speech is far better than with just one.\n2. Better understanding in a group/noisy situations\nWe've all been in a situation where it's hard to decipher someone's speech due to excessive background noise. We call this selective hearing, and research has shown that wearing two hearing devices rather than one, can help our clients focus on the conversation, rather than trying to hear it.\n3. Directional ability\nWith two devices, customers often find that they are able to more accurately tell which direction sounds are coming from, and even how far away they might be. An important safety aspect, this is a great advantage to users who are routinely in environments with lots of traffic, for instance, or where several people are talking at once.\n4. Better sound quality\nWhen did you last buy a stereo with one speaker? It's the same principle with hearing aids \u2013 a dual speaker system will afford the listener sharper, smoother and more natural sound quality, and also improve reception and provide a better balance of sound.\n5. Greater listening comfort\nWith two hearing devices working in unison, our clients are able to use a lower volume setting on their hearing aids, leading to better comfort levels and reducing the chances of feedback.\n6. A more enjoyable listen\nWearing two hearing aids it often reported to make listening and taking part in conversations a more enjoyable and less stressful experience. With balanced sound through both ears \u2013 the way nature intended \u2013 many of our clients find that not having to strain with the better ear makes for a far more relaxed life.\n7. Preserving speech understanding\nIt's a complicated machine the human body, and research has shown that wearing a hearing aid in one ear can begin to degrade the ability of the other. The auditory deprivation effect, as it\u2019s known, can be avoided by keeping both ears uniformly active with two hearing aids.\n8. Tinnitus masking\nMany of us will experience tinnitus at some point in our lives, and it affects different people in different ways. Around half of those suffering from tinnitus say that the ringing in their ears feels better with a hearing device and, naturally, if wearing only one, tinnitus will still be audiable in the other.\n9. Preference\nAt Hidden Hearing we're all about choice, and our customers can only make an informed decision when they have all the facts.

Top\nExercise is a key factor that causes the most remarkable increase in water loss observed in active dogs. This is due to the increase in evaporation from the mouth and respiratory tract. Depending on the dog's exercise intensity, and the environmental temperature and humidity, evaporative water losses may increase 10-20 fold during exercise, or 85 to 150 grams per hour2,3,4. Dog owners may not recognise how much water their dog is losing because dogs pant to cool rather than sweat through their skin, hence this water loss is not obvious.\nDogs can lose 6% of body weight before stimulated to drink Top\nThe health concern is that there is a time delay from the need to drink water and when the dog experiences the dehydration necessary to stimulate drinking5. O\u2019Connor\u2019s research found that a dog can lose up to 6% of body weight before stimulated to drink6.\nDogs need to drink before and during exercise Top\nDuring this time delay the dog will experience significantly higher body temperature, reduced cardio output, and blood flow7,8,9,10.

Quantity of water lost: Place your hand in front of a heavily panting dog and feel the water content, and/or weigh the dog before & after moderate to heavy exercise.\nb. Prevention: Before exercise give flavoured water. After, see difference in reduced panting & increased energy.

Specifically they study the behavior of domestic dogs.\nOver the last ten years Cs\u00e1nyi\u2019s group has collected data that suggest dogs have far greater mental capabilities than scientists have previously given them credit for. \u201cOur experiments indicate a high level of social understanding in dogs,\u201d he says.\nIn their relationship with humans, dogs have developed remarkable interspecies-communications skills, said Cs\u00e1nyi. \u201cThey easily accept a membership in the family, they can predict social events, they provide and request information, obey rules of conduct, and are able to cooperate and imitate human actions,\u201d he says. His research even suggests that dogs can speculate on what we are thinking.\nUntil recently, dogs were believed to be intellectually inferior to wolves. For example, a 1985 study conducted at the University of Michigan at Flint demonstrated that wolves were typically able unlock a complicated gate mechanism after watching a human do it a just a single time, yet domestic dogs were unable to complete the task even after watching it being opened several times. These results led to the conclusion that dogs\u2019 were less intelligent than wolves.\nCs\u00e1nyi suspected that, rather than being less intelligent than wolves, domestic dogs were simply more inhibited and might seek permission from their masters before doing something as daring as opening a gate. Eight years ago, he and his colleagues conducted a problem-solving experiment of their own. In their study 28 dogs of various ages, breeds, and levels of training had to figure out how to pull on handles of plastic dishes to obtain meat on the other side of a wire fence. The studies were conducted in the presence of the dogs\u2019 owners. In all cases, the dogs with the strongest relationship with their owner scored worst, as they were continually looking to them for permission or assistance in the task. The best results were from outdoor dogs, who obtained the food, on average, in one-third the time as the indoor dogs.\nThen trials were conducted where the owners were allowed to give their dogs permission to do the task, the gap between indoor and outdoor dogs disappeared.\nThe results of these trials led to further studies about how well dogs can solve problems when taking cues from people. Chimpanzees, our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, have the ability to follow a human\u2019s attentional gaze, but do poorly in classic experiments that require them to infer clues by watching a person. In these tests, researchers hide food in one of several containers out of sight of the animal then allow the chimp to choose one container as the experimenter indicates the correct choice by gazing, nodding, pointing, or tapping. Chimps score poorly on these tests even with extensive coaching.\nWhen they were subjected to these test, domestic dogs, exhibited great skills at following human directional and informational cues. Even stray dogs nearly always solved the problem immediately. The dogs consistently outperformed wolves.\nThe results of these studies are controversial.\nMichael J. Owren, assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University, says Mr. Cs\u00e1nyi\u2019s team may be underestimating the flexibility of associative learning, \u201cDogs are supremely sensitive to cues being produced by humans and are able to interact with humans very effectively,\u201d Mr. Owren says. \u201cThe question then becomes to what extent are they showing sophisticated cognitive processing and to what extent is their behavior being molded by this extreme attentiveness to people?\u201d\nWell \u2014 that would be the hundred dollar question. Unfortunately the study of animal behavioral sciences in the United States seems to still be held firmly under the sway of B.F. Skinner who didn\u2019t even believe that human beings were capable of sophisticated cognitive processing. Until researchers in the U.S. break away from the limitations of strict Skinnerian operant conditioning, they don\u2019t stand a snowflake\u2019s chance in Hell of answering these kinds of important questions.\nDr. Raymond Coppinger, from Hampshire College noted, \u201cThe Hungarians are using pet-class dogs who have been socialized in a very unique way, but there is no accounting for that. To be talking about dogs in general when you are only referring to this small population of dogs from the Western world that have been bred for all sorts of specific tasks is going to lead us astray about what dogs can do or how they evolved.\u201d\nMr. Coppinger stated that he is concerned that Csyani\u2019s team failed to consider the \u201c Clever Hans effect .\u201d Scientists ultimately concluded that the horse was picking up inadvertent cues from the person who posed the question; Hans was clever enough to figure out that he would get a treat if he stopped tapping when the human in front of him subtly reacted to the arrival of the \u201ccorrect answer\u201d; the horse didn\u2019t actually know arithmetic.\nWith all due respect to Dr.Coppinger, the vast majority of dogs in the world today are \u201cpet-class dogs\u201d who are socialized to living with humans. Our environment is their environment. Conducting studies on dogs raised in sterile laboratory environments or on the small remaining populations of feral dogs makes about as much sense as basing studies on human psychology on populations living in prisons or on abandoned islands.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 1423.9617, "uuid": "7510b655-3e5b-5684-9aef-8f62a71d23bf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800tw-24-12654", "target_hostname": "motherboard.vice.com", "target_uri": "http://motherboard.vice.com/2012/3/8/humans-are-nicer-than-we-think", "page_rank": 1.6981659e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Humans</em> <em>are</em> Nicer <em>Than</em> We Think | Motherboard", "snippet": "Sarah McLaughlin talking about <em>dog</em> adoption behind sappy music might make you change the channel, but kicking a stray <em>dog</em> in the face will seriously mess with your conscience.

Sure, we\u2019re not cuddly little bunny rabbits, but many lines of evidence over the past few decades have pointed toward some distinctly physical underpinning of basic morality and aversion to violence, implying that humans (and probably many other animals to) have a strong built-in \u201ctry-not-to-punch-that-dude\u201d mechanism.\nA recent study published in the journal Emotion, by psychologists Fiery Cushman, Allison Gaffey, Kurt Gray, and Wendy Mendes, provides some further evidence for the link, as the authors put it, \u201cbetween the body and moral decision-making processes.\u201d\nThis may be the first paper to have experimental subjects simulate murder with a real gun (it\u2019s certainly the first one I\u2019ve ever read). Essentially, the experimenters wanted to show that it is the physical act of potentially doing harm, rather than the viewing or hearing about such acts, that really turns your stomach. Subjects performed three kinds of actions: simulating direct harm (i.e. pulling the trigger of an unloaded gun pointed at one of the scientist\u2019s face), watching someone else simulate direct harm, and performing a neutral motor action (i.e. slicing bread). Subjects\u2019 physical responses were measured via blood pressure and heart rate, which are known to have a central role in reactions of disgust, aversion, and stress.\nOK, I can\u2019t help pasting this image from the paper below showing the harmful vs. non-harmful actions, if for no other reason than to give you a nice peak into the art of \u201cbaby smacking:\u201d\nThe results, as predicted, were that the heart rates and blood pressures of subjects during and after the performance of harmful tasks were the highest by far: \u201cThese simulated harmful actions increased peripheral vasoconstriction significantly more than did witnessing pretend harmful actions or to performing metabolically matched non-harmful actions,\" they wrote. \"This suggests that the aversion to harmful actions extends beyond empathic concern for victim harm.\u201d\nThe implications of this seemingly obvious result are really interesting. The idea of physically harming someone right in front of you is considered to be the most potent moral circumstance. Sarah McLaughlin talking about dog adoption behind sappy music might make you change the channel, but kicking a stray dog in the face will seriously mess with your conscience. How about a better example. Take the following moral dilemma:\nA runaway trolley is about to run over and kill five people, but a bystander who is standing on a footbridge can shove a man in front of the train, saving the five people but killing the man. Is it permissible to shove the man ?\nAcross cultures, genders, ages, and races, the result is essentially the same and has been replicated countless times: over 90% of respondents consider this act impermissible. People just don\u2019t want to have to do the pushing themselves. When a \u201clever\u201d is added to the problem, and the person questioned can now drop the bystander onto the tracks without physically touching him, the result is flipped and 95% of people find it permissible.\nIt makes sense that this is how basic human morality evolved. Our species didn\u2019t evolve with any long range weapons or fancy bystander-killing levers. Decisions about violence were always made face to face. And because our species thrived from cooperation, it\u2019s no wonder that we\u2019re programmed to avoid directly harming others. We\u2019re less \u201cred in tooth and claw,\u201d and more \u201csoft in hands and face.\u201d Of course, humans commit violence all of the time and it is a central part of society. But the fact that we take it so seriously shows how much of a psychological transgression we find it to be. Violence is, and always will be, extreme.\nTo leave you on a dark, disturbing note, Cushman et al wisely mention the connection between modern warfare (where our weapons don\u2019t demand face to face contact) and the quaint physical moral sense described above:\nThe action aversion model also suggests a darker side: When banal or novel actions lack motoric and perceptual properties associated with harm, they may fail to trigger an aversive response. Signing one\u2019s name to a torture order or pressing the button that releases a bomb each have real, known consequences for other people, but as actions they lack salient properties reliably associated with victim distress. A notable parallel is evident in moral judgment: People consider it morally worse to cause harm through direct physical engagement than at a distance.\nSo, for example, is this why people are okay with a Middle Eastern drone war? Well, it\u2019s tough to tell, but with pilots exhausted and suffering post-traumatic stress , perhaps our physical moral sense isn\u2019t totally distance-dependent.\nConnections:\n"}, {"score": 1416.568, "uuid": "e52aeb59-b706-5410-bf6e-776384c2b91f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800tw-19-14555", "target_hostname": "science.slashdot.org", "target_uri": "http://science.slashdot.org/story/12/03/09/0340223/humans-are-nicer-than-we-think", "page_rank": 1.2968757e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Humans</em> <em>Are</em> Nicer <em>Than</em> We Think - Slashdot", "snippet": "Clearly we <em>are</em> <em>better</em> off as a group <em>than</em> as lone wolfs, especially some thousand years back.", "explanation": null, "document": "on Friday March 09, @05:25AM\nfrom the doing-the-right-thing dept.\nderekmead writes \"While everyone's always waxing like Lord Tennyson about nature being 'red in tooth and claw,' neuroscience and psychology are quietly telling us that we may be innately nicer than we think .

The person pointed at a visible object out of reach of the human but within reach of the animal subject. If the chimp or dog retrieved the object, he or she would be rewarded with a tasty food treat. (Chimps received fruit juice or peanuts, while dogs got dry dog food.)\nThe chimps bombed, ignoring the human gestures, even though they were interested and motivated to get the food rewards. The dogs aced the test.\nThe chimpanzees failed to comprehend the referential intention of the human in the task. They did not see the pointing as important to their goal of getting the food, so they simply ignored the people during the study.\n\u201cWe know that chimpanzees have a very flexible understanding of others,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cThey know what others can or cannot see, when others can or cannot see them, etc.\u201d\nChimps are therefore not clueless, but they have likely not evolved the tendency to pay attention to humans when trying to achieve goals.\nKaminski explained that even wolves do not have this skill.\n\u201cWolves, even when raised in a human environment, are not as flexible with human communication as dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cDogs can read human gestures from very early ages on.\u201d\nAs for cats, prior research found that domesticated felines also pay attention to us and can understand human pointing gestures. Kaminski, however, mentioned that \u201cthe researchers had to select them out of many hundreds of cats, \u201c suggesting that only certain house kitties are on par with dogs when it comes to understanding people.\nThe breed of the animal may also factor in, according to M\u00e1rta G\u00e1csi, from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Hungary.

The person pointed at a visible object out of reach of the human but within reach of the animal subject. If the chimp or dog retrieved the object, he or she would be rewarded with a tasty food treat. (Chimps received fruit juice or peanuts, while dogs got dry dog food.)\nThe chimps bombed, ignoring the human gestures, even though they were interested and motivated to get the food rewards. The dogs aced the test.\nThe chimpanzees failed to comprehend the referential intention of the human in the task. They did not see the pointing as important to their goal of getting the food, so they simply ignored the people during the study.\n\u201cWe know that chimpanzees have a very flexible understanding of others,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cThey know what others can or cannot see, when others can or cannot see them, etc.\u201d\nChimps are therefore not clueless, but they have likely not evolved the tendency to pay attention to humans when trying to achieve goals.\nKaminski explained that even wolves do not have this skill.\n\u201cWolves, even when raised in a human environment, are not as flexible with human communication as dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cDogs can read human gestures from very early ages on.\u201d\nAs for cats, prior research found that domesticated felines also pay attention to us and can understand human pointing gestures. Kaminski, however, mentioned that \u201cthe researchers had to select them out of many hundreds of cats, \u201c suggesting that only certain house kitties are on par with dogs when it comes to understanding people.\nThe breed of the animal may also factor in, according to M\u00e1rta G\u00e1csi, from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Hungary.

Kittens are indeed very much like children. Like kids, kittens are curious, and they crave constant attention. Also like children, young cats will fall into trouble when left to entertain themselves. The casualties of this mischief may appear to be the owners' curtains and furniture, but the true victims are the cats themselves who desperately need playmates.\nWhile adopting a kitten is certainly an admirable undertaking, the social side effects of taking a kitten away from his mother and littermates must also be considered. Young cats depend on these fellow species members for essential socialization in the first several months of life. Although it usually isn't feasible to keep a mother and all her kittens together, siblings can often be placed in pairs. A genetic link is not however a necessity; adopting two kittens of similar age should yield the same positive results.\nAs much as you may love your new kitten, one thing you cannot offer him is feline companionship. A human's energy level simply cannot match that of a young cat. Even if you spend a great deal of time at home, you also cannot be available to your new pet at all times. Having a fellow kitten in the household can help occupy your cat while you tend to necessary tasks such as housework and bill paying -- and when you need to leave the house.\nThe benefits of bringing home two cats instead of one extend to the new owners, as well. A single kitten will likely keep an owner up at night, continuing to play long after the lights have been turned off. A pair of young cats, on the other hand, will often entertain each other -- effectively tiring each other out while their owners sleep like babies.\nIf you already own an adult cat, it is especially important that you provide your new kitten with a young playmate. Older pets lack the energy of younger ones, and they usually run short on tolerance, too. Being pounced on repeatedly by the new arrival will likely irritate your adult animal. Your younger cat may also feel frustrated by the adult cat's unwillingness to join him in active play. The result is two animals who will share a home but will unlikely ever share a bond.\nThe most important consideration should always be the welfare of any animal you bring into your home. If you cannot realistically handle the increased responsibility of adopting two kittens instead of one, consider taking home an older cat who will respond better to being an only pet. Our nation's shelters are overflowing with adult cats that desperately need homes.\nIf you are concerned that your new kittens will grow closer to each other than to you, rest assured that nothing can replace the role of a loving owner. Just as children love both their siblings and their parents, cats also value both their fellow felines and the humans in their lives. By providing your new cat with a sibling of his own, you will make him a happier animal, and happy animals make the best pets.\nBookmark/Search this post with:\n"}, {"score": 1399.4303, "uuid": "e10212a7-6384-512e-b1f9-7c9374dbfad8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1608wb-67-04172", "target_hostname": "www.treetopsrescue.org", "target_uri": "http://www.treetopsrescue.org/info/display?PageID=5891", "page_rank": 3.9496117e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Why Two Kittens <em>Are</em> <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> One", "snippet": "<em>Are</em> you planning to adopt a kitten?

Great! Please consider the following reasons why TWO kittens might be the better choice. You're going to have to scoop the litter box anyway, right?\n1) One kitten can become lonely and bored.\nHow many hours are you at work? Kittens need a playmate, especially if their human is gone all day. Like any young animal, they need stimulation to develop properly. Studies show that animals left alone in the house can have brains that weigh up to 25% less than those that live on the street. Two kittens entertain each other and enrich each others environment. Try to get two right from the start, to ensure happy times. Siblings are the best bet, but any two of the same age can form close bonds.\n2) One kitten can just drive an older cat nuts.\nAlthough it might sound contrary, an older, established cat will probably accept two kittens better than one. One kitten will seek out the older cat as a playmate or worse, tease and pester the senior cat, which can cause stress to an older cat. The kitten in return, will be \"rewarded\" for his playful efforts with hisses and swats. Two kittens will expend their energy in play with each other, leaving their older \"uncle\" to relax in peace.\n3) Two kittens will \"self-train.\"\nKittens learn by copying. If one kitten is quick to learn appropriate litter box use, the other will be likely to copy. They also help each other with grooming; washup after meals soon becomes a ritual with two kittens.\n4) Two kittens help each other burn off energy.\nEven the most devoted human caregiver can quickly become exhausted by trying to keep up with the energy of a single kitten. Two kittens will wear each other out, leaving their human parent free to just enjoy watching them. A single kitten will likely keep an owner up at night, continuing to play long after the lights have been turned off. Kittens just don't get that \u201cclock thing\u201d\u00c2\u009d. A pair of young cats, on the other hand, will entertain each other - effectively tiring themselves out while their owners sleep like babies. When they want to play at 2:00AM they have each other - not you.\n5) Fewer behavior problems with two kittens.\nMany people who experience behavior problems with kittens find that some of them go away when they adopt another playmate. What may be perceived as mischief is often just the result of boredom. Much like their human counterparts, kittens sometimes misbehave because \"negative attention is better than no attention.\"\n6) Curiosity overcomes \"food finickyness.\"\nIf one kitten is finicky about food, the belligerence is often overcome by curiosity at what its sibling is eating. (Feed one cat Same Old, the other cat New Stuff, and they both end up tasting the New Stuff.)\"\n7) Photo Opportunities.\nKittens will often play so hard that they simply flop where they are, and more likely than not, they will flop next to (or on top of) each other. There is no sight so endearing as two kittens curled up together for a nap. Their peaceful innocence can soften the heart of even the grumpiest curmudgeon, and the sight of that blissful moment will wash clean the slate of their previous misdoings.\n8) Having two kittens is insanely fun.\nNo doubt kittens are fun, but having two is twice the fun. Watching two kittens play together can be hours of entertainment and laughs \u2014 it\u2019s better than television and no commercials! With only a single kitten, both you and the kitten will miss SO MUCH. Don't let that happen! If you have a chance to get a pair, seize the opportunity.\n9) They will each have a friend for life.\nTwo kittens who grow up together will almost always be lifelong friends. Although they will sometimes have their little squabbles (what friends don't?) you will more often see them engaging in mutual grooming, playing together, and sleeping with their best pal. Your cat will remain more playful and youthful into his/her later years with a companion.\n10) You'll save two lives instead of one.\nNuff said.\n"}, {"score": 1385.0114, "uuid": "8fed93a2-4571-593b-b0e2-e25ccc6b82da", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0203wb-36-07018", "target_hostname": "www.messybeast.com", "target_uri": "http://www.messybeast.com/cat-dog.htm", "page_rank": 1.3599007e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Are</em> <em>Dogs</em> More Faithful <em>Than</em> Cats?", "snippet": "Much of what we consider to be faithfulness <em>are</em> behavioural traits arising from the <em>dogs</em> wild instincts. Cats form attachments to <em>humans</em> but <em>are</em> not submissive and will not tolerate the same amount of abuse that a <em>dog</em> will.", "explanation": null, "document": "ARE DOGS ARE MORE FAITHFUL THAN CATS?\nCopyright 2001, Sarah Hartwell\nDogs and cats behave differently towards humans because they evolved in the wild to have different social structures and different hunting strategies. Dogs live and hunt communally and their survival strategy is a tight-knit pack with a hierarchy where every individual knows who is boss to it and who it can boss around; they catch prey larger than themselves and the catch is shared with others. Dogs need to know their ranking in a pack for the pack to work together efficiently. Cats form loose colonies based on the availability of food in their area, but they usually hunt alone; they hunt prey smaller than themselves and do not share their food with other adult cats. Both species will scavenge; dogs will normally only allow other pack members to scavenge the same place, cats may tolerate other cats being present if there is enough food present.\nDogs are pack animals and are subservient to a pack leader; in the domestic environment, you are the pack leader and your dog does what it is told. What appears to be faithfulness is often the submissive behaviour of an animal evolved to be social. Cats do not form hierarchical packs, but they do form colonies based around related cats. The females form the a loose hierarchy while the males are more solitary and often itinerant, visiting different females in different parts of their territory. Cats initially view you as individuals sharing the same space and their attachment to you depends on your behaviour towards them - a bullied cat leaves or retaliates, a bullied dog all too often comes back for more. Feline aloofness is the indifferent behaviour of an animal which does not live in strictly hierarchical communities and has not needed to develop canine-style social behaviour. For a detailed look at feline social structures see The Unsociable Cat .\nSUBMISSIVE LOVE\nIn cruel experiments, fully conscious dogs have been vivisected by their scientist owners to see how \"faithful\" they remain. Despite the most appalling things being done to them, the dogs licked their owner's hand during the experiments. The most famous experiment was around a century ago and was designed to test a Spaniel's loyalty to its master. Despite the things done to it (including removing its eyes without anaesthetic), the dog continue to trust its master and to lick the hand that was torturing it. Because the owner is considered the pack leader, the dogs remained obedient and submissive in spite of the most appalling mistreatment. In fact the dogs remained \"faithful\" until they had effectively been tortured to death. Thankfully these experiments are no longer performed, but this side of a dog's character can be seen in the classical image of the mistreated pet dog who remains faithful to its abusive owner. Basically it doesn't know what else to do.\nIn wolf packs, there is often a pariah (outcast) who is bullied and tormented by more dominant animals. In spite of this, the pariah stays with the pack as it has a better chance of survival this way. When approaching more dominant dogs, the pariah grovels to show that it knows its place. It also accepts being bullied because it has less chance of surviving alone. Many dogs are undoubtedly attached to their owners, but their innate social behaviour, in particular their submissiveness to a pack leader (the owner) can often be mistaken for faithfulness.\nDogs have been kept as companions or utility animals for centuries. Modern pet dogs have been bred to retain puppy-like looks and behaviour (some guarding and fighting breeds have had aggressiveness deliberately bred into them). For example, barking is a puppy trait. Though nurtured, indulged and played with by the adults, puppies are low down in the pack ranking. The adults in the pack protect the puppies so your dog often sees itself as the puppy with you as a protector. However, adults will also discipline the puppies if they misbehave too much - hence a pet dog can be disciplined to modify its behaviour.\nAnimal trainers know that dogs react well to a reward system, being praised when they do the right thing. In the dog's eyes, this is acceptance and approval from other members of its pack; the alternative is pariahship.\nThough dogs very obviously display affection, joy and altruistic behaviour towards their owners, when you talk about your dog being faithful to you, you must also consider \"is it individual affection or is it canine submissiveness?\" Much of what we consider to be faithfulness are behavioural traits arising from the dogs wild instincts.\nCUPBOARD LOVE\nCats form attachments to humans but are not submissive and will not tolerate the same amount of abuse that a dog will. Cats do not have a sense of their rank in a pack and do not consider that it is your birthright to bully them into faithfulness. A mistreated cat will leave if it can. A mistreated dog will often come back for more because it learns that its place in the human pack is the pariah position.\nWhere several cats live in a confined or isolated colony, there may be a pariah cat. Unlike a pariah dog it will not show appeasement behaviour (begging or grovelling) but will normally isolate itself to avoid being bullied. If possible it will leave the area. If not possible it will avoid its tormentors. Unlike dogs, cats have no vested interest in staying in a pack. If they can't leave the area e.g. they are confined or it is the only available food, they will eat, urinate or defecate when the other cats aren't around.\nCats have not been selectively bred for as long as dogs, so they retain far less infantile (kittenish) behaviour. Traditionally cats were kept to control vermin. This did not require them to be especially faithful to individual humans. Only in the last few decades have cats been bred for appearance or for temperament (some breed standards contain clauses relating to temperament).\nCats which are brought up in a loving household are often faithful to their household or to particular individuals. Because this has to be earned by the owner, it is a far more precious thing than a dog's submissiveness. Cats also look after themselves and will visit neighbours to take advantage of company, food, warmth etc, but most will return to their own household if you are providing a comparable level of care. This is because a cat is a solitary hunter and has evolved to take advantage of a food supply it can exploit alone. Dogs hunt as packs and the pet dog sees you as a companion hunter - its survival prospects are best served by staying with you, however you treat it.\nCats often bring home their hunting trophies as a sign of appreciation. It is their contribution to a food supply - just as they would provide food for their kittens or for communally reared kittens. They also consider your home to be a safe den where food can be eaten without the threat of being stolen. The fact that you do not appreciate the gift, or you release it is possibly viewed as you being a rather wayward and inept kitten though many owners give their cat some cat food to compensate for the lost prey item.\nCats can be trained, but unlike dogs they demand tangible rewards such as food, not just lavish praise. A cat's behaviour is not set up so that praise alone is a sufficient reward. To a cat, getting a food treat after performing a trick is just like having a success hunting and getting some prey at the end of it.\nCats are often faithful to places rather than people, because their survival depends on establishing a territory, not on following a migrating herd of deer.\nCATS ARE OFTEN AS FAITHFUL AS DOGS\nCats are often as faithful to their owners as are dogs, but they display this is different ways because of their different predatory style and different social habits. Their social habits are discussed in depth in The Unsociable Cat . Cats will greet you with a tail quiver, but dogs may fawn, lick and beg as though they are puppies begging an adult to regurgitate food after a hunting trip. Cats greet you as an equal though a really affectionate cat may roll over and present its belly for grooming as though it is a kitten greeting its mother.\nThe biggest difference is that dogs are obedient (faithful) to their pack-leader by nature, but a cat's faithfulness must be earned and can't be bullied into it. Once you have taken time to earn your cat's affection and devotion, you will find it just as faithful, or more so, than a dog.\nBadger (moggy cat) & Boy (whippet dog), Chelmsford, England courtesy of Avril Hodgkins.\nRetreiver & tabby photos courtesy of Ian Calderbank.\n\"Do You Copy?\" (Copyright Libby Cook-Toppan)\nSam the dog with 2 Maine Coon kittens.

I managed to reel them back in and get them calmed down so we could walk back home.\nIt's taken me a lot longer to calm down. That walk back was the longest half-block of my life. I was sure the jerks in the white SUV were going to pull a U-turn and come back for another laugh. I squinted at each car going by, trying to glimpse a few letters or numbers from the license plate, just in case.\nI just can't understand what makes a person think actions like this are fun.

The person pointed at a visible object out of reach of the human but within reach of the animal subject. If the chimp or dog retrieved the object, he or she would be rewarded with a tasty food treat. (Chimps received fruit juice or peanuts, while dogs got dry dog food.)\nThe chimps bombed, ignoring the human gestures, even though they were interested and motivated to get the food rewards. The dogs aced the test.\nThe chimpanzees failed to comprehend the referential intention of the human in the task. They did not see the pointing as important to their goal of getting the food, so they simply ignored the people during the study.\n\u201cWe know that chimpanzees have a very flexible understanding of others,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cThey know what others can or cannot see, when others can or cannot see them, etc.\u201d\nChimps are therefore not clueless, but they have likely not evolved the tendency to pay attention to humans when trying to achieve goals.\nKaminski explained that even wolves do not have this skill.\n\u201cWolves, even when raised in a human environment, are not as flexible with human communication as dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cDogs can read human gestures from very early ages on.\u201d\nAs for cats, prior research found that domesticated felines also pay attention to us and can understand human pointing gestures. Kaminski, however, mentioned that \u201cthe researchers had to select them out of many hundreds of cats, \u201c suggesting that only certain house kitties are on par with dogs when it comes to understanding people.\nThe breed of the animal may also factor in, according to M\u00e1rta G\u00e1csi, from E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University, Hungary. G\u00e1csi worked with a team of researchers to examine the performance of different breeds of dogs in making sense of the human pointing gesture.\nThe scientists found that gun dogs and sheep dogs were better than hunting hounds, earth dogs (dogs used for underground hunting), livestock guard dogs and sled dogs at following a pointing finger.\n\u201cAlthough these results may appear to be unsurprising, there is a common tendency to make assumptions about genetic explanations for differences in comprehension between \u2018dogs\u2019 and wolves,\u201d G\u00e1csi said. \u201cOur results show that researchers must be careful to control for animal breed when carrying out behavioral experiments.\u201d\nWith chimps added to the study mix, researchers are now puzzled, as popular theories about communication hold that certain core abilities can be inherited. Chimpanzees are so close to us on the primate family tree, and yet they cannot seem to understand our pointing gestures. This suggests that pointing may be a unique form of human communication, but dogs challenge the hypothesis.\nKaminski said, \u201cWe therefore need to study in more detail the mechanisms behind dogs\u2019 understanding of human forms of communication.\u201d\nRelated Posts:\nNo related posts found\nP Woolfs\nHate to see ANIMALS dressed up as HUMANS\u2014\u2014\u2013 They are not children, they are animals , and should be given respect, as well as love \u2014\nMar 8, 2012 Comments: 1\nAdvertise On The Dog Files!\n"}, {"score": 1309.1929, "uuid": "b79099ea-6b1b-52e2-b393-8788fb7e9cc2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-01-09234", "target_hostname": "www.oromoctospca.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.oromoctospca.ca/content/246260", "page_rank": 1.3925399e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Oromocto SPCA | Why 2 Kittens <em>are</em> <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> 1", "snippet": "Much like their <em>human</em> counterparts, kittens sometimes misbehave because &quot;negative attention is <em>better</em> <em>than</em> no attention.&quot; Two kittens share everything, including food preferences &quot;If one kitten is finicky about food, the belligerence is often overcome by curiosity at what its sibling is eating.", "explanation": null, "document": "Why 2 Kittens are Better Than 1\nThe hardest task is to pick just two.\n1.You're Saving Two Lives Instead Of One\n\"If it's kitten season, that's one more kitten that will get a home instead of growing into an adult which will decrease its chance of getting adopted.\" It is entirely true that kittens are much easier to place than adult cats, and the 15-month-old cat you see in the shelter today is very likely a holdover from last year's crop of kittens. Another way of looking at it is that it's better to get all the kittens adopted out right away, to give the older cats a better chance at finding homes.\n2.One kitten can become lonely\nA kitten left alone during the day can become very lonely A kitten left alone during the day can become lonely and bored, which sometimes can lead to mischief. Two kittens will never be lonely, especially if they are siblings. In fact, you'll often find situations in shelters and rescue group adoption where a cage will contain two kittens with a sign, \"These kittens may be adopted only as a pair.\" Shelter volunteers recognize that siblings really need to stay together.\n3.One Kitten Can Just Drive An Older Cat Nuts\nOlder cats' patience runs thin when a kitten wants to play Although it might sound contrary, an older, established cat will probably accept two kittens better than one. One kitten will seek out the older cat as a playmate, or worse, tease and pester the senior cat which can cause stress to an older cat. The kitten in return, will be \"rewarded\" for his playful efforts with hisses and swats. Two kittens will expend their energy in play with each other, leaving their older \"uncle\" to relax in peace.\n4.Two Kittens Will \"Self-Train\"\nThese kittens are learning litter box manners together Kittens learn by copying. If one kitten is quick to learn appropriate litter box use, the other will be likely to copy. They also help each other with grooming; washup after meals soon becomes a ritual with two kittens.\n5.They Help Each Other Burn Off Energy\nThese kittens are \"playfighting,\" an essential part of their development Even the most devoted human caregiver can quickly become exhausted by trying to keep up with the energy of a single kitten. Two kittens will wear each other out, leaving their human parent free to just enjoy watching them. The downside to this, of course is sometimes you have double trouble!\n6.Fewer Behavior Problems With 2 Kittens\nMany people who experience behavior problems with kittens find that some of them go away when they adopt another playmate. What may be perceived as mischief is often just the result of boredom. Much like their human counterparts, kittens sometimes misbehave because \"negative attention is better than no attention.\"\n7.Curiosity Overcomes \"Food Finickyness\"\nTwo kittens share everything, including food preferences \"If one kitten is finicky about food, the belligerence is often overcome by curiosity at what its sibling is eating. (Feed one cat Same Old, the other cat New Stuff, and they both end up tasting the new stuff.)\"\n8.They Act As Pillows For One Another\nKittens will often play so hard that they simply flop where they are, and more likely than not, they will flop next to (or on top of) each other. There is no sight so endearing as two kittens curled up together for a nap. Their peaceful innocence can soften the heart of even the grumpiest curmudgeon, and the sight of that blissful moment will wash clean the slate of their previous misdoings.\n9.Having Two Kittens Is Insanely Fun\nThere's no denying it; kittens are insanely fun! \"And last, of course, they're just so much darn fun to watch!\" Having lived through (and survived nicely) the joy of adopting and raising two kittens, I can personally attest to the downright fun of having two kittens.\n10.They Will Each Have A Friend For Life\nTwo kittens who grow up together will almost always be lifelong friends. Although they will sometimes have their little squabbles (what friends don't?) you will more often see them engaging in mutual grooming, playing together, and sleeping with their best pal. If you are considering adopting a kitten, think about your best friend and consider whether you would deprive your kitten of the enrichment a friend brings to life.\nVanilla\n"}, {"score": 1305.2363, "uuid": "aa2daf97-0466-5eef-8807-ea437368c547", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-55-12578", "target_hostname": "www.pictures-of-cats.org", "target_uri": "http://www.pictures-of-cats.org/cat-brains-are-smaller-than-dog-brains-discuss.html", "page_rank": 1.1745886e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Cat brains <em>are</em> smaller <em>than</em> <em>dog</em> brains - discuss!", "snippet": "Cat brains <em>are</em> smaller <em>than</em> <em>dog</em> brains because cats <em>are</em> solitary animals and <em>dogs</em> <em>are</em> social animals.

The social interaction between dogs over millions of years created this difference.\nIt is said that cats have less sophisticated brains than dogs. The research was carried out by scientists at the University of Oxford. They also say that members of the dog family are good at problem solving - better than cats. I have not seen the original research document so the conclusions as written up in newspapers may not be completely accurate. This article is a bit of gossip about the conclusions of this study - my instant and biased thoughts, no more.\nThe study begs some questions. We know that there are different types of intelligence. Pure problem solving is not the only kind. We don't hear of dogs foretelling the death of a hospital patient and then comforting the patient, for example. I am not sure if the study measured intelligence in a complete way and went beyond brain size and problem solving abilities.\nThere is also the intriguing possibility that even if the research is accurate things will change over the next millions of years. The domestic cat is adaptable and now lives with and interacts with his or her human companion. The human is the most intelligent animal on the planet. Surely with millions of years of socialisation between cat and human the cat will become more intelligent.\nIn millions of years time, it is quite possible to imagine human and cat finding a common language and communicating in a more complete and accurate way. If that happened things would dramatically speed up. Of course the dog should also become more intelligent but the dog takes commands unthinkingly. The domestic cat thinks about it and then does what he or she wants to do. Perhaps this attitude will develop into a more questioning approach from the cat and that too will speed up the development of the cat's brain.\nWhat I am saying in defence of the cat is that the study may have got things wrong and even if it is right the cat will catch up in time!\nIt is also worth making the point that there is a fairly wide spectrum of intelligence between the cat breeds. The more active wildcat hybrids are known to be more intelligent than the passive, relatively uninquisitive Persians , for example. Did the study compare the brains of wild cat to wild dog or domestic cat and dog? There would seem to be a difference. The wild cat has to use its brain more than a domestic cat . This is what makes it more intelligent and the wildcat hybrids are more intelligent than the wholly domestic cat breeds and moggies. I would suspect that the wild cat is as intelligent as the wild dog and in any case we have to mention the lion.\nThe lion lives in prides. It socialises with other lions. If, as stated, socialisation creates larger brains over millions of years, surely the lion must have the biggest brain of all the cats as it is the only cat that lives in groups except for feral cats who have adapted to this social way of life when there is a food source that feeds the group. However, I have seen nothing to support the notion that the lion is more intelligent than the solitary tiger. Indeed the general view is that the tiger fights smarter than the lion.\nFor me, the study raises some questions but I suspect that the original research document addresses some of these. It is interesting to speculate nonetheless. One last interesting point, research indicates that intelligent people prefer domestic cats to dogs. A million years of interaction with intelligent people will do the cat no harm in respect of brain size, I say.\n"}, {"score": 1301.378, "uuid": "55f1e527-95bd-55e8-b1b0-a92e3d12317a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1313wb-34-10733", "target_hostname": "www.itchmo.com", "target_uri": "http://www.itchmo.com/is-dog-food-inherently-different-than-human-food-263", "page_rank": 1.2271995e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Than</em> <em>Human</em>", "snippet": "The article, written before the Menu Foods Tragedy by another PetConnection writer Christie Keith asks the question \u201cIs <em>dog</em> food inherently different <em>than</em> <em>human</em> food?\u201d It\u2019s something we have never asked ourselves.", "explanation": null, "document": "I don\u2019t think the question is whether or not pet food is inherently different from human food vs. asking is a canines or felines nutritional needs different from a human?\nThe canine and feline are so complexly different from each other!\nOne illustration - L-lysine given at doses of 500 mg is flying around pet message boards for weepy eyes, herpes and a variety of maladies in cats.\nIn talking with my nutritionist, he was explaining how the amino acid L-lysine will look for another sulphur bonded amino acid and in the average feline diet it won\u2019t find it.

The News reports, \u201cDuring the procedure, described as inhumane by some animal lobbyists, caged cats lose consciousness and die after being placed inside a box filled with carbon dioxide.\u201d Schadenberg says:\nWhereas I share the concern about the ethical treatment of animals, I cannot understand why if we are so concerned about the use of gas to euthanize animals that we as humans do not react to the use of gas by the final exit network to euthanize humans. Some of whom are depressed and all of whom need a caring community not wannabe Jack Kevorkians.\n"}], [{"score": 1245.9186, "uuid": "ea53b327-6327-5898-8b83-4503d80a6d62", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1407wb-31-20838", "target_hostname": "bookdragon01.livejournal.com", "target_uri": "http://bookdragon01.livejournal.com/2632.html?thread=6984", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "BookDragon&#x27;s Lair - Two Heads <em>are</em> <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> One", "snippet": "&quot;Two heads <em>are</em> <em>better</em> then one.&quot; Gaila beamed a sly smile. &quot;With any luck, we&#x27;ll find out.&quot;", "explanation": null, "document": "May. 29th, 2011 at 6:42 PM\nTwo Heads are Better than One\nSummary: Gaila and a classmate ponder an interesting aspect of a new cadet's unique physiology and lay plans to explore further\nFandom: Star Trek XI\nRating: NC-17 (mentions of Gaila/fem!OC and possibility of threesome)\nDisclaimer: I won nothing but a strange imagination\n----------------------------------------\nGaila nodded solemnly, watching her classmate process the implications.\nAn obscenely speculative smile crossed Larissa's face. \"Serial or parallel?\"\nGaila grinned.

But no two online colleges charge the same cost for this degree. One school can charge $50,000 more for what looks like the very same distance degree to me. Is an expensive online college better than a cheap one?\n\u2014Rayette, Boise, Idaho\nAnswer:\nThere is no relationship between cost and quality in online education. Paying more won\u2019t get you \u201cmore\u201d of an education, nor will it necessarily buy you an academically better degree. The cost\u2014and therefore affordability\u2014of any online degree is a function of four factors. It may surprise you to learn that none of these is correlated with educational quality.\n1): Is your online college publicly funded or privately funded?\nPublic online schools charge less because they are subsidized by your tax dollars. When you attend any public college you are attending an institution you have already helped support through your federal and state tax dollars.\nBecause public colleges receive subsidies through tax funds they do not need to charge you, the student, as much in tuition and fees. Publicly funded residential colleges have always cost significantly less than their private counterparts.\nSimilarly, online colleges that are publicly funded are more affordable than private online colleges.\nGet Educated national surveys of online college costs and affordability consistently show that the top-ranked cheapest online degrees across all subject areas, ranging from business to healthcare, come from publicly funded or state universities online.\n2): Where is your online university headquartered?\nIt costs less to live in certain regions of the country. For example, it is much less expensive to live in Wyoming than it is to live in Massachusetts. No surprise, then, that according to GetEducated.com\u2019s National Survey of Online Bachelors in Business, the University of Wyoming offers a business bachelor\u2019s online for about $16,000. On the other hand, the University of Massachusetts, headquartered in high-cost New England, charges almost $58,000.\n3) For-profit vs. non-profit online college?\nTraditionally, all colleges operated as non-profit agencies. But every year more online colleges are being organized as for-profit businesses. The University of Phoenix Online, operated by the Apollo Group, is the largest online college in the United States. It is also a for-profit company.\nNational online college affordability studies by Get Educated show that universities which are chartered as for-profits charge more\u2014often two to three times more\u2014for their services.\n4) Who accredits your distance learning college?\nOn average, colleges that are nationally accredited rather than regionally accredited cost less. One reason is because national accreditation is not as widely accepted or as prestigious as regional accreditation.\nThere is No Relationship Between Cost & Quality in Online Degrees\nPaying less for your distance degree doesn\u2019t mean you will receive less of an education. Compare all your online degree options before you enroll. Your cheapest option will likely come from a local, non-profit, public university.\nExpect to pay two to three times more to attend a private, for-profit college. Be aware that there is no evidence or guarantee that you will receive an academically better online education in exchange for paying the higher cost.\nRelated Resources\n"}, {"score": 1240.3951, "uuid": "b6bf61d8-037f-56ee-901f-32465be4857a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1909wb-36-24300", "target_hostname": "www.terra-bear.com", "target_uri": "http://www.terra-bear.com/archives/category/animals-are-better-than-people/page/2", "page_rank": 1.176633e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Animals <em>Are</em> <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> People | terra-bear.com - Part 2", "snippet": "We covered hot and cold weather injuries, fraternization, how to spot <em>human</em> trafficking and a whole assortment of topics that made my eyes [...] in and some other stuff,Animals <em>are</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> people - A rock star with good hair, cute boots, and the ability to rock harder <em>than</em> you. \u2013 5\u20197\u2033 \u2013 A super secret", "explanation": null, "document": "in Animals are better than people , In the Before Times , When I was a dirty farm kid\nOn Saturday, during the Great Mother-in-Law Visit of \u201909, we went to Maymont.

The basis of their conclusion? I have pretty poor reading comprehension skills, but perhaps that just makes me the target audience for British papers. Let\u2019s see: I think the article\u2019s point is that animals with bigger brains are smarter, and animals that are more social are also smarter. Dogs are usually bigger than cats, and usually are more social. So\u2026\nThey quote Dr. Susanne Shultz, a researcher, saying \u201cDogs have always been regarded as the more social animals while cats like to get on with their own thing alone. But it appears that interaction is good for the brain and extends to other species, like ourselves.\u201d\nYes, interaction is good for the brain, but many dogs don\u2019t get much interaction. And many cats get lots of it. That\u2019s just one of the reasons I don\u2019t buy any of this. When it comes down to it, dogs are better at dog things. Cats are better at cat things. And how do you qualify \u201csmart\u201d anyway? Ants have very little brains but they are smart in ways that I am not.\nThe Telegraph than stoked the fire with a follow up article: Dogs are smatter than cats: Feline friends disagree.\nIn this piece, they quote, Beth Skillings, a Clinical Veterinary Officer of Cats Protection, which means she\u2026 gives out cat condoms? I don\u2019t know. She says: \u201cThe domestic cat is highly intelligent thanks to its wild ancestry. Unlike dogs, they are smart enough to hunt alone and don\u2019t have to depend on others.\u201d\nWha? Don\u2019t cats depend on us? And can\u2019t dogs hunt perfectly well by themselves when they need to? And don\u2019t dogs have wild ancestry as well\u2013ancestry that makes them equally intelligent, but in different ways?\nI could go on, but I find the whole conversation a bit ridiculous. Really, this post was just an excuse to put up the above photo, from a cute series of cats and dogs photo bombing one another . Also, it was a reason for me to be able to share some of the cat vs. dog comments made on these two articles.\nhoinarylup: Why on earth would a cat WANT to round up sheep?

Although Pope John Paul II had said that evolution and the church\u2019s commitment to divine purpose were not incompatible, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn, dismissed John Paul\u2019s comments on the subject in 1996 as \"rather vague and unimportant.\"\nThe same day, the Catholic News Agency followed up on the article with its own assessment of the Cardinal\u2019s pronouncement. Scientists have now asked Pope Benedict XVI to clarify the situation.\nIf people would only understand that the Bible\u2019s descriptions of God\u2019s purpose come to us in metaphorical language, they would not have get involved in these conflicts between science and the church. Nor would they become enamored of such theories as \" intelligent design \". My newest book \u2014 From Literal to Literary, The Essential Reference Book for Biblical Metaphors (to be published by Rising Star Press this coming October) \u2014 has this to say on the subject.\ncreate, verb; creator and creation, nouns The Greek root behind the creation words is ktizo, which means to fabricate or manufacture. The Hebrew root, bara, is rich with other connotations, some of which seem the opposite of create. For example, bara is sometimes translated cut trees or clear the ground or cut down people.\nJoshua said to them, \"If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear ground there for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.\". . . Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, \"You are indeed a numerous people, and have great power; you shall not have one lot only, but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders.\" [Joshua 17:15, 17-18]\nThe assembly shall stone them and with their swords they shall cut them down; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses. [Ezekiel 23:47]\nThe first use of the word bara as a creation metaphor appears at the beginning of the Hebrew Bible. The poem in the first chapter of Genesis reflects the human experience of feeling sustained in the midst of turmoil. It is as if the chaos of existence has been made suitable for human habitation. This theme is picked up later by Isaiah.\nIn the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters. Then God said, \"Let there be light\"; and there was light. [Genesis 1:1-3]\nFor thus says the Lord, who created the heavens (he is God!), who formed the earth and made it (he established it; he did not create it a chaos, he formed it to be inhabited!): I am the Lord, and there is no other. [Isaiah 45:18]\nThe creation metaphor also reflects the experience of awe and wonder that arises in the contemplation of the intricacy and magnitude of nature. Although Albert Einstein did not profess religious beliefs, in reflecting on his work in astrophysics, he sometimes referred to \"the old one\". In much the same fashion, people over the ages have found it helpful to personify nature.\nPraise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his host! Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you shining stars! Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens! Let them praise the name of the Lord, for he commanded and they were created. He established them forever and ever; he fixed their bounds, which cannot be passed. [Psalm 148:4-6]\nLift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these? He who brings out their host and numbers them, calling them all by name; because he is great in strength, mighty in power, not one is missing. [Isaiah 40:26]\nAnother use of the creation metaphor reflects the experience of new possibilities, fresh beginnings.\nI am about to create new heavens and a new earth; the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind. But be glad and rejoice forever in what I am creating; for I am about to create Jerusalem as a joy, and its people as a delight. [Isaiah 65:17-18]\nSo if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything old has passed away; see, everything has become new! [II Corinthians 5:17]\nTaking the creation metaphor literally, that is, as a scientific description of reality, has brought the church into disrepute in many quarters of the industrialized world. In writing to a friend, Charles Darwin stated the problem of accepting literally the claim that a divine creator designed the universe and all that is in it.\n\"I own I cannot see, as plainly as others do, & as I shd. wish to, evidence of design & beneficence on all sides of us. There seems too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent & omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.\"\nAnyone willing to put aside the notion that the creation terms have something to do with natural history, however, can find meaning in their use as religious or spiritual metaphors \u2014 on at least three levels: what it means to find stability in the midst of chaos, as an expression of awe and wonder in the experience of the natural world, and the willingness to look for new possibilities.\nWhen using the creation metaphor, however, a person might keep in mind one meaning of bara, to cut down, a reminder that in any manufacturing or fabrication process the original form of something must be destroyed. Creation always has a dark side.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 07:52 AM in Bible | Permalink | Comments (1)\nJune 24, 2005\nForget about Eternal Life\nPeter Peters, a respeced colleague of mine, and I often find ourselves in disagreement over the appropriate role of the church in the political arena. Arguing in favor of the church having a voice in forming public policy, he asked me what I made of Luke 18:18-25, which reads:\nA certain ruler asked Jesus, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.'\" He replied, \"I have kept all these since my youth.\" When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \"There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.\" But when he heard this, he became sad; for he was very rich. Jesus looked at him and said, \"How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\"\nMy first answer was that I doubt if Jesus spoke the words attributed to him. When he pressed me, I had a second answer, which was that I did my best to ignore the passage. On reflection, I decided that my first response had merit and that my second was inadequate.\nAlthough a majority of scholars believe that Jesus must have said something like the words found in this passage from Luke and in the parallel passages in Mark 10:17-31 and Matthew 19:16-26, others see a reflection of the economic condition of the people drawn to the early church. In writing to the Jesus followers in Corinth, Paul noted that \"not many were powerful, not many of noble birth.\" (I Corinthians 1:26) In addressing another early Christian community, the letter of James raised the questions, \"Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?\" These two comments suggest that a majority of the people first attracted to the Jesus movement came from the lower classes of society, classes habitually suffering from low self esteem. One way that the poor have always dealt with their own self image problem is to hold the rich in contempt. It is not difficult to imagine that the early followers of Jesus read their own disdain for the rich back into the story. They wanted to believe that God cared more for them than for those who enjoyed the privileges of the upper class.\nGiven the possibility that I could be wrong about the origin of the gospel teachings concerning the rich , I decided to stop ignoring the passages and to ask myself what they might mean. The primary clues we have to their meaning are found in the context where the gospel writers or editors placed these particular words they attribute to Jesus. They have Jesus offering his negative comments about rich people in response to a request for guidance made by a wealthy man. He is like the unhappy little dog Jenny in Maurice Sendak\u2019s Higglety Pigglety Pop! She says, \"There must be more to life than having everything.\" The man in the gospel story has wealth, righteousness, and social prominence, but he is not content. He is totally fixated on his desire to have something more than everything. He is completely self-centered. Jesus offers a solution for his unhappiness. Jesus tells the rich man to use all his wealth for the benefit of other people and to join the disreputable band of Jesus\u2019s followers.\nIn another place (Luke 10:25), Luke has lawyer asking for the same advice as the rich man, what he must do to inherit eternal life. Luke does not describe the lawyer as being rich, but the advice Jesus gives is similar. Instead of being focused on himself, the lawyer is to think about what it means to be a neighbor.\nTaken together, the two stories suggest that people concerned about their own eternal life are on the wrong track. People who are seeking personal salvation have missed the point. The key to a satisfying life is keeping a balance between taking care of yourself and paying attention to the people around you.\nThe words attributed to Jesus imply that finding this balance between self and others is more difficult for the rich than it is for ordinary wage earners. I don\u2019t know any rich people, but from what I read in the newspapers about celebrities, I gather that many of them are unhappy. They are not content with having everything. People who have modest incomes or who have very little, however, can be equally unhappy and equally self-centered. The advice Jesus is supposed to have offered was the same for everyone. Forget about eternal life and think about what is going on with other people.\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter if Jesus himself said the words attributed to him in the stories about a rich man seeking eternal life. The stories as we have received them suggest that the followers of Jesus set aside an interest in eternal life in favor of paying attention to their connections with other people. Paying more attention to their connections with other people might well lead Christians to advocate public policies that would use their tax money to benefit people in situations different from their own. Whether in advocating public policies the church should speak as an institution or should exercise its influence through individual Christians is a matter about which my colleague Peter and I will continue to disagree.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 03:32 AM in Bible | Permalink | Comments (2)\nSeptember 2010\n"}, {"score": 1216.9075, "uuid": "d6493a0e-51cf-5ff7-9547-9c594bb8d47a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-65-23337", "target_hostname": "www.sciencedaily.com", "target_uri": "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120306131533.htm", "page_rank": 1.170995e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Two heads <em>are</em> not always <em>better</em> <em>than</em> one", "snippet": "... from universities, journals, and other research organizations 6, 2012) \u0097 From the corporate boardroom to the kitchen table, important decisions <em>are</em> often made in collaboration.

But are two -- or three or five -- heads better than one? Not always, according to new research from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \"People who make judgments by working with someone else are more confident in those judgments. As a result they take less input from other people\" -- and this myopia wipes out any advantage a pair may have over an individual, says psychologist Julia A. Minson, who conducted the study with Jennifer S. Mueller. \"The collaborative process itself is the problem.\"\nSee Also:\nSelf-esteem\nThe findings appear in the journal Psychological Science, published by the Association for Psychological Science.\nTo test the hypothesis that confidence born of collaboration takes a toll on the quality of judgment, Minson and Mueller asked 252 people to estimate nine quantities related to U.S. geography, demographics, and commerce, either individually or in pairs after discussion. They were then offered the estimates of other individuals and pairs and allowed to revise their own; the final estimates therefore could come from the efforts of two to four people. To sweeten the pot, participants earned a $30 bonus for each of two estimation rounds, but lost $1 for each percentage point their answer deviated from correct. Individuals also rated their confidence in their judgments.\nThe results: People working with a partner were more confident in their estimates and significantly less willing to take outside advice. The pairs' guesses were marginally more accurate than those of the individuals at first. But after revision (or lack thereof), that difference was gone. Even the combined judgments of four people yielded no better results than those of two or three. Finally, the researchers found that had the pairs yielded to outside input, their estimates would have been significantly more accurate. Their confidence was costly.\nSo should we toss out teamwork? No, says Minson, but since collaboration is expensive and time consuming, managers should use it efficiently. For one thing, a group of 10 is not 10 times better. \"Mathematically, you get the biggest bang from the buck going from one decision-maker to two. For each additional person, that benefit drops off in a downward sloping curve.\" Most important is awareness of the costs of teamwork. \"If people become aware that collaboration leads to an increase in overconfidence, you can set up ways to mitigate it. Teams could be urged to consider and process each others' inputs more thoroughly.\"\nThe same goes for a couple choosing a mortgage or a car, Minson cautions. \"Just because you make a decision with someone else and you feel good about it, don't be so sure that you've solved the problem and you don't need help from anybody else.\"\nShare this story on Facebook, Twitter, and Google:\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nStory Source:\nThe above story is reprinted from materials provided by Association for Psychological Science .\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

Working in both New York (in the Hamptons) and South Florida means meeting diverse groups of people and being exposed to many different beliefs on how to raise dogs.\nFor starters, there seem to be more people in the north who take pride in the local flora and fauna, as well as the rules of the area. Except for the summer season, dogs are allowed to run free on beaches almost anywhere in the Hamptons, provided they are under voice control and owners pick up after them.\nI must say, I have taken my own dogs to more than 20 different beaches there, as well as many state parks. Almost all stores in the Hamptons welcome dogs as well. Compare that to Miami. South Beach is extremely dog friendly, as are a few other places (such as the Bal Harbour Shops).\nMost beaches, however, are not, and places and times of beaches accepting dogs are limited at best. The reason? In New York, I see people pick up after their pets constantly and even, when necessary, after other people\u2019s dogs.\nThere is rarely any litter of any sort to clean up on New York\u2019s beaches, and when there is, it\u2019s usually the result of out-of-town kids leaving juice cartons, balloons, and plastic cups lying around, which locals also clean up. They want to keep wildlife safe, their beaches beautiful, and their dogs welcome on them.\nMany times in South Florida, I experience the opposite: People looking the other way or pressing their iPhones tighter to their ear when their dogs are doing their business, conveniently \u201cnot noticing\u201d that their pets are making a deposit in a public place, and hence, absolving themselves from having to pick it up.\nThis is especially true when people feel there is nobody watching them. And while both sexes are guilty of this, men down here are the worst, much less likely than women to pick up after their dogs. The same holds true for dog owners allowing their unruly dogs to bother people or other dogs in public places.\nCertainly I\u2019m not making any blanket statements. There are responsible and irresponsible dog owners everywhere. But note how an owner\u2019s behavior influences his or her dog\u2019s chances in life. Because New York dog owners are generally more considerate of others and the environment, their dogs are given more freedom to enjoy running on the beaches off leash, go into town, restaurants, and many other areas they choose.\nThis leads to more exercise options for the dog, precious opportunities for socialization, and a more stimulating life. All of this, in turn, helps owners have a better-behaved pet that is a pleasure to be around. No poop -- no stepping in anything unpleasant or that spreads disease or attracts insects -- and no obnoxious behavior means nobody complains, and more doggy privileges are granted.\nAnd so irresponsible owners\u2019 behavior will determine their dogs\u2019 quality of life. Do you have a pit bull or another maligned breed? Somewhere a few bad apples spoiled it for your pet, and now more of them are in shelters that can ever possibly find homes.\nWhat\u2019s more, your friendly and sweet red-nosed pit is probably pooch non grata in certain places -- even whole towns and cities --providing her with fewer opportunities to exercise and develop social skills, and thus a vicious cycle is born.\nGood dog owners are not just responsible, they also give clear communication to their dogs regarding what they want so their dogs have boundaries and know their limits. You want to meet someone, Fido? You must sit to greet them. Do you want to be free to run loose on the beach? You must come back when I call and listen to other instructions.\nGood dog owners are fun and fair and teach with positive reinforcement so the dogs want to listen, know what is expected of them, and are not afraid of coming when they\u2019re called. They make time for their canine charge daily, and provide them with an interesting life. Training is essential, and training dogs before there is a problem is the best way to prevent a problem. So is building a solid relationship of mutual trust and respect.\nSome of the best-behaved dogs I see in my Hamptons neighborhood belong to local workers: builders, plumbers, and landscapers. Many of them started bringing their dogs to work from the time they were pups. They are very bonded to each other and therefore the dogs generally stick close -- even though all the ones I have seen were off the leash.\nThese dogs know \u201cSit,\u201d \u201cStay,\u201d and \u201cCome.\u201d That may be all they know, but they respond to those commands well and there is no confusion about what they\u2019re supposed to do.\nBy bringing their dogs to work daily, these workers are creating highly social animals, as they get to meet many different people and other animals and are confident around noise from construction and landscaping equipment. In fact, they are such cool customers that I was able to use two of these dogs on a modeling shoot. They did great!\nOn the flip side, while writing my latest book, I found myself working with dogs that don\u2019t even know \u201cSit,\u201d bark uncontrollably, and sometimes get kicked out of restaurants for yowling their heads off. (In such cases, it should be the owner\u2019s task to remove the dog from the establishment so as to not bother other patrons.)\nBetter dogs are made, not born. It\u2019s up to the human member of the team to be responsible for promoting behavior that will allow a dog to partake of beaches, restaurants, and other destinations in their town. If dog owners are unhappy with their pets\u2019 behaviors, the only person anyone has to look after, and possibly change, is themselves.\nLisa Hartman is a dog-friendly trainer, behavior specialist, and author of Dial a Dynamite Dog.

Someone in mainstream media is actually saying drug companies push vaccines on the public!\"\nLocal Vet is in No Hurry to Give Canine Influenza Vaccines\nAccording to a local veterinarian WWLP consulted for their story \u2013 a DVM who services all of western Massachusetts \u2013 there have been no reports of canine influenza at all.\nAnd since canine flu spreads from one dog to another just as human flu spreads among humans, the vet doesn't see doggy flu as a threat.\n\"It's not common enough for me to consider vaccinations here in this area,\" said Dr. Robert Sidorsky of Mobile Veterinarian Services of Western Massachusetts.\nDr. Sidorsky continues:\n\"That isn't to say in six months from now we might find outbreaks and that might be a problem, but right now that doesn't seem to be the issue.\"\nNote Dr. Sidorsky doesn't say if an outbreak occurs, he'll be vaccinating up a storm. He simply says if there are outbreaks of canine influenza down the road, they could present a problem.\nThe piece ends with two more common sense observations:\nCanine influenza can't be spread from dogs to people\nIf your dog does catch the flu, it's treatable and dogs very rarely die from it\nThe Real Price of a Canine Flu Shot\nThe main thrust of the WWLP piece is that local dog owners should save the $25 to $60 for a canine flu shot in western Massachusetts, because it won't be money well spent.\nThe financial cost of the vaccine is certainly a consideration. But more important is the potential cost to your pet's health from unnecessary vaccinations.\nToo many vaccines , in particular non-core vaccines like those for doggy flu, can seriously compromise your pet's immune system, affecting its ability to protect your dog naturally from pathogens like the influenza virus.\nIn addition, non-core vaccines (any canine vaccine other than distemper, parvo, adenovirus or rabies) have proven to be less safe in terms of adverse reactions than core vaccines.\nSome well-known side effects of vaccines 1 include:\nDevelopment of symptoms of the disease being vaccinated against\nIntroduction of foreign genetic material into the body\nDevelopment of localized sarcomas and other cancers\nSuppression of the immune system\nDevelopment of latent viruses\nInterference with diagnostic test results\nHypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis\nWorsening of current disease states\nVaccine contamination\nSystem overload\nAssessing Your Pet's Risk for Canine Influenza\nThe canine influenza virus (CIV) is primarily associated with overcrowded conditions like those found in some shelters, kennels and dog racing facilities.\nIt's unlikely most family dogs will be in a situation to contract CIV, but even if your pet does acquire the virus, chances are she'll recover quite nicely without medical intervention, thanks to a healthy immune system.\nKeep in mind the CIV vaccine doesn't protect against infection. It reduces viral shedding once infection is acquired, and it may lessen the severity of symptoms and their duration.\nTips for Preventing Canine Influenza\nFeed your a balanced, species-appropriate diet .\nKeep your pet's immune system in top shape by avoiding unnecessary vaccinations and overuse of veterinary drugs and chemical parasite and pest preventives .\nReduce the environmental toxins your dog is exposed to, which will in turn lesson his toxic burden and biological stress.\nTalk to your holistic vet about natural immune boosters like turmeric, oregano and fresh garlic, as well as useful herbs and essential oils to support the immune system.\nReferences:\n"}, {"score": 1212.919, "uuid": "0665a456-eb03-54b4-b5d6-8d0d3b613482", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-34-04503", "target_hostname": "charlottebumstead.ca", "target_uri": "http://charlottebumstead.ca/?p=1005", "page_rank": 1.1988958e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Are</em> Two Jobs <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> One? | Charlotte&#x27;s Web", "snippet": "As a freelance writer, many days <em>are</em> spent trapped inside the house, sitting across from my computer (the winter is especially draining).", "explanation": null, "document": "April 04, 2012 carlybumstead 3 Comments\nIn January of this year, I picked up a second job as a server at a nearby restaurant. Although I have many years of previous work experience in both serving and bartending, I hesitated for months when contemplating the idea of making my return to the food and entertainment industry. The list of excuses was long (and not worth reiterating). Most striking though, was the idea that returning to serving meant I was failing to reach my professional goals. Little did I know, this was not the case.\nHere I am, just over two months into the job, and I am realizing how glad I am to have made this decision. So I thought I would share with you some of the reasons why.\nI\u2019m meeting new people\nHaving just moved to a new city at the end of last summer, I knew very few people who lived nearby. It was a bit of a shock to my social life\u2014especially coming from the university regime where there was always somewhere to go and someone to go there with. Not to mention, my job isn\u2019t the most social of jobs. I work from home most days, and most of my communication with other people is by email, social media platforms or over the phone. I started to notice I was missing real human interaction. Most of my friends and family live at least a couple of hours away. Of course, I would still get to see my boyfriend every day, which I love. But I needed something more.\nBy picking up a serving position, I immediately met a large group of people who were my age and going through similar situations as me. And they live in the area, too. I\u2019ve already learned so much about the city I now call home, just from working and socializing with those who have grown up here over the last 20 to 30 years. It\u2019s great to be able to share stories and get to know one another over a drink after work (another bonus to working at a bar).\nI\u2019m making fast cash\nOne of the lessons I learned quickly as I started developing my own business around my writing was how careful I had to be with my money. Paydays don\u2019t come every two weeks. Often I have to wait at least a month for one lump sum to be deposited into my account. It has really taught me to plan ahead with my budget. But now I bring cash home after every shift. And I keep my tips and paychecks separate, as a savings technique. While my tips go toward paying off my student loan, my paychecks land carefully into my bank account where money is divided up between living costs, savings and maybe a new pair of shoes every now and then.\u00a0 It has definitely taken some financial pressure off of my shoulders, allowing me to be more selective about what freelance contracts I take on in my writing career.\nI\u2019m getting out of the house\nMy boyfriend would probably be most thrilled about this point. I\u2019m the kind of person who craves a busy schedule full of diverse and fulfilling activities. As a freelance writer, many days are spent trapped inside the house, sitting across from my computer (the winter is especially draining). This would often mean as soon as my workday was over (and as soon as my boyfriend would arrive home from his workday) I suddenly transformed into the lonely puppy dog who has been confined at home by herself all day and is feeling desperate to get outside and run around at liberty\u2014just to catch a friggen ball or something! But all he wanted to do after \u201ca long day at the office\u201d was relax on the couch and watch the damn Leafs\u2019 game. This was not working out for either of us.\nNow, I actually have reason to put makeup on and do my hair kind of nice. And as much as I might complain about these extra efforts, I actually kind of like the excuse. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy sitting around in yoga pants and a t-shirt all day. But every girl needs a reason to wear a new pair of earrings every now and again.\nI\u2019m finding new sources of inspiration\nBeing a writer is all about putting yourself out there to make discoveries and develop new ideas. It can be easy to find yourself in a bit of a rut, especially if your schedule allows it. By putting myself into a refreshing situation, I have found I am feeling much more creative. Some of your best ideas come from simply conversing with others, and I do this constantly as a server. Every guest who walks in the door could mean a new opportunity. And although most seem to want to eat, drink and leave, it only takes one to make a difference.\nEven the topic of this post goes to prove another benefit\u2014I never would have written it had I not returned to the serving life. That\u2019s not to say that working two jobs is a long-term plan of mine, but it\u2019s definitely working for right now. As for tomorrow, well, I\u2019ll take it as it comes.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 1208.8241, "uuid": "60e655ad-3be1-5cc0-9cde-af0846f302f6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-63-17453", "target_hostname": "tcpc.blogs.com", "target_uri": "http://tcpc.blogs.com/better/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.1849393e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Believing", "snippet": "You scour land and sea to make one convert, and when you do, you make that person more a child of Hell <em>than</em> you <em>are</em>.&quot;", "explanation": null, "document": "The Gospels against the Jews\nAnti-Semitism has been an unfortunate component of Christianity that is rooted in the gospels. To understand the negative attitude toward Judaism that shows up in the Christian gospels, a reader of the Bible must recognize that the Hebrew yehudim and the Greek ioudaioi can carry different meanings.\nThe Hebrew word originally appeared in reference to the tribe descended from the patriarch yehudah, or Judah. The tribe of Judah was briefly united with ten other Hebrew-speaking tribes under David and Solomon. After the death of Solomon in 926 BCE, Judah became a separate kingdom with its political capital and cult center in Jerusalem. Anyone who lived within the realm was known as a Judean. The other tribes, to the north of Judah, formed a kingdom that was the first of the two to be conquered by foreign invaders. Judah held out until 587, when Jerusalem was invaded and the temple destroyed. The Judeans rebuilt their temple in 520.\nSoon after the Maccabean revolt in 165 BCE, the designation yehudim or ioudaioi acquired an additional meaning that was neither territorial nor tribal. People whose worship life centered in the Jerusalem temple also became known as Judeans, even if their ancestors belonged to one of the other tribes. The Romans destroyed the temple in 70 CE, and by the end of the first century, a religion centered on the synagogues and the teachings of the rabbis had evolved from the practice of the Pharisees. Any adherent of this religion was known as a Judean.\nAnother use of the word further complicates an appropriate understanding of Judean. During the first century people in the southern part of Herod\u2019s realm were called Judeans while people in the north were Samaritans or Galileans. Apparently the division was as important for them as the division between the northern and southern parts of Ireland are today. In Angela\u2019s Ashes, Frank McCourt says that living in Limerick he was always suspect because his father, although a Catholic, was from the north. His own grandmother accused him of having \"Presbyterian hair\". According to John\u2019s gospel, the Judeans challenged Jesus with a similar kind of guilt by geographical association:\nThe Jews answered him, \"Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon\"? [John 8:48]\nAccording to the gospels, most of Jesus\u2019s early followers were Galileans so to outsiders, Greeks and Romans, the later followers of Jesus \u2013 even the Gentiles \u2013 were called Galileans to differentiate them from the Jews. When these second and third generation Christians wrote their Jesus stories, they naturally identified themselves with the Galileans, in their minds the good people, while they pictured the Judeans as the bad people. This tendency to show Judeans in the worst possible light is especially noticeable in the Gospel according to John. When a story is set in or around Jerusalem, John consistently identifies the local people who resist the teachings of Jesus as Judeans, in English \"Jews\".\nThe Christian gospels\u2019 negative attitude toward Judeans, however, was certainly based on something more than regional prejudice. The hostility arose in regard to the use of the term Judean meaning an adherent to a participant in a particular religion. At the same time that rabbinic Judaism was taking form, the followers of Jesus under the leadership of Paul began welcoming Gentiles into their communities without insisting that they conform their diet and dress to rabbinic rules. Neither did they require Gentile men to be circumcised. The leaders of the synagogues, however, were not willing to make such concessions for their Gentile converts. In order to preserve their spiritual identity, the rabbis came to the conclusion that they could no longer tolerate the confusion caused by the Jesus followers in their midst. Even the Christians who were born Judeans and followed the rules were no longer accepted. Their rejection from the synagogues left many followers of Jesus feeling hurt and angry, but there was another reason for the hostility that developed between the two groups, Jews and Christians, that emerged from the Pharisee tradition. They found themselves in fierce competition for converts among the Gentiles. The depth of the animosity on the Christian side is reflected in a curse Matthew attributes to Jesus. In The Five Gospels the curse reads:\n\"You scholars and Pharisees, you imposters! Damn you! You scour land and sea to make one convert, and when you do, you make that person more a child of Hell than you are.\" [Matthew 23:15]\nAlthough much of the teaching attributed to Jesus closely parallels what the Pharisees taught, the Christian writers often use the Pharisees as surrogates for Judeans in general when they want to cast aspersions on their competitors. Because of the animosity of the Jesus followers toward the Pharisees and rabbinic Judaism, and because of their ingrained antagonism toward the people of Judah, the early Christian writings have a polemical tone that continues to feed Christian hostility toward the Jews.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 07:40 AM | Permalink | Comments (0)\nJune 24, 2005\nForget about Eternal Life\nPeter Peters, a respeced colleague of mine, and I often find ourselves in disagreement over the appropriate role of the church in the political arena. Arguing in favor of the church having a voice in forming public policy, he asked me what I made of Luke 18:18-25, which reads:\nA certain ruler asked Jesus, \"Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" Jesus said to him, \"Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: 'You shall not commit adultery; You shall not murder; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; Honor your father and mother.'\" He replied, \"I have kept all these since my youth.\" When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \"There is still one thing lacking. Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.\" But when he heard this, he became sad; for he was very rich. Jesus looked at him and said, \"How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\"\nMy first answer was that I doubt if Jesus spoke the words attributed to him. When he pressed me, I had a second answer, which was that I did my best to ignore the passage. On reflection, I decided that my first response had merit and that my second was inadequate.\nAlthough a majority of scholars believe that Jesus must have said something like the words found in this passage from Luke and in the parallel passages in Mark 10:17-31 and Matthew 19:16-26, others see a reflection of the economic condition of the people drawn to the early church. In writing to the Jesus followers in Corinth, Paul noted that \"not many were powerful, not many of noble birth.\" (I Corinthians 1:26) In addressing another early Christian community, the letter of James raised the questions, \"Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?\" These two comments suggest that a majority of the people first attracted to the Jesus movement came from the lower classes of society, classes habitually suffering from low self esteem. One way that the poor have always dealt with their own self image problem is to hold the rich in contempt. It is not difficult to imagine that the early followers of Jesus read their own disdain for the rich back into the story. They wanted to believe that God cared more for them than for those who enjoyed the privileges of the upper class.\nGiven the possibility that I could be wrong about the origin of the gospel teachings concerning the rich , I decided to stop ignoring the passages and to ask myself what they might mean. The primary clues we have to their meaning are found in the context where the gospel writers or editors placed these particular words they attribute to Jesus. They have Jesus offering his negative comments about rich people in response to a request for guidance made by a wealthy man. He is like the unhappy little dog Jenny in Maurice Sendak\u2019s Higglety Pigglety Pop! She says, \"There must be more to life than having everything.\" The man in the gospel story has wealth, righteousness, and social prominence, but he is not content. He is totally fixated on his desire to have something more than everything. He is completely self-centered. Jesus offers a solution for his unhappiness. Jesus tells the rich man to use all his wealth for the benefit of other people and to join the disreputable band of Jesus\u2019s followers.\nIn another place (Luke 10:25), Luke has lawyer asking for the same advice as the rich man, what he must do to inherit eternal life. Luke does not describe the lawyer as being rich, but the advice Jesus gives is similar. Instead of being focused on himself, the lawyer is to think about what it means to be a neighbor.\nTaken together, the two stories suggest that people concerned about their own eternal life are on the wrong track. People who are seeking personal salvation have missed the point. The key to a satisfying life is keeping a balance between taking care of yourself and paying attention to the people around you.\nThe words attributed to Jesus imply that finding this balance between self and others is more difficult for the rich than it is for ordinary wage earners. I don\u2019t know any rich people, but from what I read in the newspapers about celebrities, I gather that many of them are unhappy. They are not content with having everything. People who have modest incomes or who have very little, however, can be equally unhappy and equally self-centered. The advice Jesus is supposed to have offered was the same for everyone. Forget about eternal life and think about what is going on with other people.\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter if Jesus himself said the words attributed to him in the stories about a rich man seeking eternal life. The stories as we have received them suggest that the followers of Jesus set aside an interest in eternal life in favor of paying attention to their connections with other people. Paying more attention to their connections with other people might well lead Christians to advocate public policies that would use their tax money to benefit people in situations different from their own. Whether in advocating public policies the church should speak as an institution or should exercise its influence through individual Christians is a matter about which my colleague Peter and I will continue to disagree.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 03:32 AM in Bible | Permalink | Comments (2)\nJune 16, 2005\nWhy We Stick with \"Christian\"\nMany of the organizations with which we cooperate -- such as the Sea of Faith , the Snow Institute of Religion , and the FaithFutures Foundation -- identify themselves as interfaith rather than Christian. TCPC has taken a different approach and has encouraged the use of the terms Christian and Christianity among progressives.\nFor one thing, I am constantly reminded of what has been the history of unitarian movements in this country and the U.K. First they gave up the trinity and removed Jesus from the godhead. So far, so good. I am with them. Now, however, most of them cannot openly refer to Jesus and many never mention God.\nAnother reason we emphasize our Christian heritage is that we contest the extremists' claim that only they have the right to call themselves Christians. In the minds of most people outside the church, Christianity tends to be identified with evangelicals and fundamentalists. We need to make every possible effort to let them know that other approaches to the Christian faith are available.\nThird, when it comes to interfaith strategy, we have taken an approach that is different from that of our friends who emphasize the interfaith character of their organizations. In my experience, interfaith dialogue works best when each faith group is clear about its identity. I have learned from Jews and Muslims that they don't think that conversations are helpful when liberal Christians attempt to blur the boundaries.\nTo be a constructive voice in the world, I believe that progressive Christians need to stand firmly on the ground of our tradition. We are first and foremost followers of Jesus.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 05:28 AM | Permalink | Comments (1)\nJune 06, 2005\nTheologians Under Hitler\nVital Visions is a project put together by a small band of southerners fighting to stem the rising tide of nationalism in the U.S.\u00a0 One of the most interesting resources they have put together is an hour-long video \"Theologians Under Hitler: Why Religion and Politics Matter\".\u00a0 Three important Protestant professors of theology -- Gerhard Kittel, Emanuel Hirsch, and Paul Althaus -- supported Hitler during the years of the Third Reich. Their scholarship and Christian devotion is unquestioned, yet their political choices set them solidly on the wrong side of history.\nThis workshop can be structured in several different ways ranging from an evening event to a three-day workshop in a retreat setting.\u00a0 You can contact the Vital Visions staff to discuss an appropriate format for your organization.\nThe goal of Vital Visions is to reach evangelical churches, but I doubt that many of them would like to see the movie. Suggesting that they compare themselves with the exuberant Christians who backed Hitler will only make them angry. Although I think that the parallels between Germany in the 30s and the US today are chilling, nothing is particularly unusual about religion being used to promote nationalism. As Jared Diamond pointed out in Guns, Germs and Steel , religion was invented to convince young men to be suicidal in the defense of those with most of the money and all of the power. Although some of us like to think that in the U.S. we have separated church and state, I am sad to say that the truth is otherwise. As long as I can remember, churches in this country have joined in the celebration of military holidays: 4th of July, Veteran's Day, Memorial Day. We provide chaplains for the armed forces. Our clergy offer prayers at political events. We send our sons and daughters off to war with the blessing of the church.\nEven though I deplore the use of religion in promoting patriotism, I don't think that the parallels between religion in Nazi Germany and Christianism in the U.S. are as clear as they seemed at my first viewing of the video. Germany was a fairly homogeneous society in 1933. America in 2005 is incredibly diverse. Germany had had only a brief experience of democracy when Hitler rose to power. We have been governing ourselves for over two centuries. The Christianists are dangerous, and people of faith must expose and oppose them, but I don't think that comparing them to the exuberant Christians of Nazi Germany will help.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 02:06 PM in Church | Permalink | Comments (4)\nMay 28, 2005\nLiving the Questions\nLiving the Questions is a new small-group program designed for Christian invitation, initiation, and spiritual formation. The program provides fourteen lesson plans and a series of video clips to stimulate discussion. In reviewing the course for Christian Century (April 5) , Debra Bendis and Jason Byassee seem to assume that people who sign up for such a discussion group have been living in a cultural and spiritual vacuum. They also appear to think that in a church-sponsored course of study conformity to a particular party line would be a sign of wisdom. Anyone who agrees with these two positions should obviously avoid getting involved with Living the Questions. Neither of these assumptions, however, check out with my experience of reality.\nThe reviewers find fault with LtQ for pitching the course to \"an audience of people involved enough in church to have been wounded by its fundamentalist versions.\" I don\u2019t know on what planet Bendis and Byasee have been living. In my forty years of parish ministry, most of the people who showed up were either refugees from conservative congregations, or they were tentative seekers who had been avoiding religion because of what they had thought was the Christian point of view. The latter come from the fastest growing religiously identifiable group in the country, now about nineteen percent. I have yet to meet one who hadn\u2019t thought that all Christians believed that Jesus got up out of the tomb and that baptism washed away all sin. As a test, I quizzed an eleven-year-old boy on these subjects. He has never been to a church, except for weddings, but he knows all about these beliefs, and he holds them in contempt.\nThe reviewers also complain that the speakers who appear on the video clips are a \"discordant mix of voices\". From such teachers, \"people who are investigating Christianity will have a hard time deriving . . . a coherent introduction to Christianity.\" To me, the wide variety of views presented by LtQ make the course inviting and energizing. This is one of the most brilliant aspects of the series. In telling the Christian story, the course replicates the Bible, which \u2014 as everyone who has ever tried to read it knows \u2014 is as incoherent a mix of voices as you can find between two covers. Without having to be told in so many words, those who participate in the course discover the power that emerges when people are living the questions rather than accepting agreed-upon answers.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 03:16 AM in Disputation | Permalink | Comments (0)\nMay 22, 2005\nSome people who cannot accept church doctrines and dogmas have found other things in Christian congregations that may be better than believing:\nBeing part of an extended family with \"brothers and sisters\" who care about you.\nParticipating in the life of a community where your concerns make a difference.\nLocating companions with whom you can work to help bring to the world a greater measure of social, economic, and environmental justice.\nFinding your roots in the rituals and traditions of a people with a history.\nGrowing in awareness of your personal values and your potential as a human being.\nIncreasing your capacity for open and honest relationships with other people.\nApproaching God directly through disciplined meditation and prayer.\nHaving a place to celebrate the joys of birth, marriage, and success as well as to find support in the tragedies of death, divorce, and failure.\nThe first version of this list appeared in a 1974 flier circulated by St. Mark\u2019s Episcopal Church on Washington, DC\u2019s Capitol Hill, the congregation I served as rector 1966 - 1996.\nJim Adams\nPosted by Jim Adams at 01:41 PM in Church | Permalink | Comments (1)\nMay 18, 2005\nChristianity or Christianism\nChristianity or Christianism\nWilliam Saffire, in his New York Times Magazine On Language column, introduced me to a pair of useful terms: Christianism and Christianist.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first of the two can be traced back to the seventeenth century. In 1674, R. Godfrey wrote of a \"Heathenish Christianism\". In 1855, I. Taylor identified an \"easy, overweening, and egotistic Christianism\". These examples in the OED demonstrate that the term as a long history of derogatory use. Christianist appears to be of more recent coinage.\nI think that both of these terms will be helpful. For a long time I have resented the necessity of adding the modifier \"progressive\" or \"liberal\" to the word \"Christian\" in order to differentiate an approach to Christianity that differs from that propounded by extreme conservatives. Many people have told me that we stand for basic Christianity and shouldn\u2019t have to use an adjective in describing our network. Now we have the opportunity for making a distinction between our understanding of Christianity and that proclaimed by the extremists.\nChristians are people who practice Christianity. They do their best to follow the way taught and lived by Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus stands at the center of the constellation of symbols by which they make sense out of their existence.\nChristianists are devotees of Christianism. They use Christian symbols in propounding an ideology that they want to impose on society. They make sense out of their existence by convincing themselves that they are right and that any who disagree are outside of God\u2019s favor.\nChristianism can appear at either end of the political spectrum. For example, Pat Robertson is a Christianist on the right, while Jim Wallis is a Christianist of the left. Both sides claim to be representing the mind of God, and both want to translate their positions into public policy.\nAlthough using derogatory terms is often a less than admirable strategy in dealing with differences of opinion, such terms can sometimes bring clarity to an argument. In this case, I think it is important to insist on the distinction between Christianity \u2013 a religion, and Christianism \u2013 a political ideology.\nFor more on the subject, see the comments of Ruth Walker for the Christian Science Monitor and Rob Kall on Op-Ed News .\nPosted by Jim Adams at 09:10 AM in Disputation | Permalink | Comments (2)\nApril 19, 2005\nFaith: Another Word Hijacked\nIt was bad enough when the extreme conservatives gave Christianity a bad name (see my first blog), but now they threaten to discredit all religious persuasions. According to a report in The New York Times , the Family Research Council has put out a flier advertising a meeting to be held at a Kentucky megachurch that reads, \"The filibuster was once abused to protect racial bias, and it is now being used against people of faith.\"\nAny person who already holds a dim view of organized religion could read that statement and conclude that all, or maybe most, people of faith want the Democrats in the United States Senate to be deprived of the historic power of the minority to protect the country from the tyranny of the temporary majority. People of faith appear to be those who have been duped into demanding a judiciary that would add to the wealth of the corporate elite, the Texas billionaires, and the Wall Street insiders.\nThe thoughtful citizens of the United States are perfectly aware that the big money people care little or northing about abortion, gay rights, or end of life issues. The big money people give lip service to such issues because there will never be enough of them to control the democratic process. They figured out a long time ago that they needed to forge an alliance with some other sector of society to gain and keep power. They chose the extreme conservatives among the Christians. The federal judges the big money people want to put on the bench are ideologically disposed to supporting the agenda of the extreme conservative Christians, but they would also support the big money agenda.\nTo enhance their political clout, the big money people have decided to claim that the only faith that matters is fundamentalist or evangelical Christianity. Anyone who does not agree with their social agenda is by definition not a person of faith. Like most other adherents to a religious tradition, I object. First, they hijacked the word \"Christian\" and made it unusable without a qualifying adjective, and now they seem bent on seizing and twisting the term \"faith\" in a similar fashion. I wonder, will faith become a term that liberals and progressives will have to abandon in fear of being misunderstood? Or can we add a modifier to separate ourselves from the ranks of Christians with whom we have serious disagreements and identify ourselves as \"people of progressive faith\"?\nWhatever we do, I think we must object to the use of religious language that in the long run will undermine any hope of institutional religion being a respectable and constructive component of a democratic society.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 01:46 PM in Disputation | Permalink | Comments (2)\nApril 13, 2005\nThe Deplorable Legacy of John Paul II\nFrom . . the tyranny of the bishop of Rome and his detestable enormities, Good Lord, deliver us. (The Great Litany, 1544)\nNow that John Paul II is safely in his tomb, perhaps we can relax a little from the old standard, \"Speak no ill of the dead.\" The international fuss made over the death of the pope strikes me as truly inappropriate in the light of his behavior, and I think that it is time for progressive Christians to be forthright in their denunciation of his legacy.\nHe worked consistently against the right of women to control their own bodies and their own destinies. He was rigidly opposed to both birth control and abortion, and he would not even permit an open discussion about the possibility of ordaining women for ministry.\nHe revived the animosity of his church toward gay and lesbian people, insisting that they have no right to form partnerships let alone to marry.\nHe worked to deprive all people of the right to end the artificial prolonging of life even when the personality was long dead.\nHe encouraged an alliance in this country between his church and the protestant fundamentalists in attempting to give their joint religious views the force of law. These age-old antagonists finally realized that they were both cast in the same mold. They differ only on their views about the death penalty, but I have not yet heard of any bishops threatening to excommunicate politicians who advocate executing criminal offenders, a tactic they have employed with the abortion issue.\nHe attempted to remove from Catholic colleges and universities all teachers who failed to follow the party line or even to raise questions about the doctrine or practices of the church.\nHe has concentrated authority in the Vatican at the expense of the national and local manifestations of the church. He clearly mistrusted democracy as far as the Catholic church is concerned.\nHe refused to take seriously the abuse of children by his clergy, preferring to condemn the media for sensationalizing the issue. He promoted known pedophiles and rewarded bishops who tried to cover up the scandal.\nAlthough he is being praised for his openness to other faiths, especially Judaism, he showed his true colors early in the year 2000 when speaking to the cardinals, bishops, and theologians who make up the Congregation of Faith. He warned the group: \"In recent years a mentality has emerged in theological and ecclesial circles which tends to relativize Christ\u2019s revelation and his unique and universal mediation in the order of salvation.\" He declared that the Roman Catholic Church is the \"royal road\" to salvation, unlike the incomplete religions of other Christians and non-Christians. He did not seem to understand that it is this exclusive and arrogant attitude that makes anti-Semitism possible.\nIn the light of John Paul\u2019s destructive legacy, I think it is fair to ask if anything good might be the result of his reign. To that question, I think we can say that the good he produced was the unintended consequence of his attempt to return his church to its pre-Vatican II ways of doing things. The primary good I see is the mobilization of the Catholic laity. In Africa, Catholics are finding ways to worship that are not authorized or are even forbidden by the hierarchy. In Massachusetts, Catholics have taken over some of the parishes that their archbishop attempted to close. In Latin America, Catholics are continuing the tradition of liberation theology in spite opposition by their bishops. Catholics nearly everywhere are practicing birth control and resorting to abortion. Many Catholics have exercised their newly-found self confidence by choosing to worship in other traditions. On this last point, I must say that I consider the migration of Roman Catholics to main line churches to be a fine thing.\nPerhaps another unintended positive legacy of John Paul II is the proof he offered that to build loyalty and enthusiasm, the church must use all the public relations techniques employed by those who market anything from pills to politicians. His appearances on television were as good as Ronald Reagan, often seen as the undisputed master of that medium. Like Reagan, on the small screen John Paul came across as the stern father with the kindly demeanor. It will be interesting to see if the cardinals pick another telegenic personalty to lead the church. Other churches to be successful will have to learn John Paul\u2019s techniques.\nAs I look at the evidence, I think it is a great mistake for Christians of other persuasions to talk about John Paul II as if he were a saint in the universal church. I think that the early Protestants in England were wise to keep reminding themselves to keep aloof from the tyranny of the bishop of Rome and all his destructive tendencies.\nPosted by Jim Adams at 06:06 AM in Church | Permalink | Comments (3)\nApril 02, 2005\nFundamentalism and the Decline of Christianity\nThe cover story in The New York Times Magazine for March 27, 2005, featured an Assembly of God megachurch in Surprise, Arizona, about 45 minutes northwest of downtown Phoenix. The pastor, Lee McFarland, founded Radiant Church in 1996, and now weekend attendance has now reached 5,000 people. Impressive? Yes, until you stop to think what the impact of this kind of Christianity has been on the Christian enterprise as a whole. Many people have failed to realize that the success of fundamentalism in this country has been gained at a terrible price, the loss of respect for Christianity among people who want to think for themselves.\nThe story of Surprise, Arizona, is a good example of what has been happening around the country. The author of the Times story, Jonathan Mahler, notes that Surprise, a town of 80,000 people, has 27 other churches, but he dismisses them with the observation that \"none of them are growing at anything that approaches the pace of Radiant.\" He does not supply statistics \u2013 maybe they are not available \u2013 but we can make some guesses based on national averages. Half of the churches in the United States have fewer than 100 members, and only 10% have more than 400 members, which puts them in the class of \"large churches\". Let us give those 27 churches the benefit of the doubt and assume that on the average they are large churches with a membership of 500, for a total of 13,500. If you add in Radiant\u2019s 5,000 members, you will see that 18,500 church members are the most you are likely to find in Surprise. On the basis of my informed guesses, at least 73% of the Surprise citizens have no church connection at all.\nWould other churches in town have better luck if Radiant were not giving Christianity a reputation for being anti-intellectual, anti-scientific, anti-gay, and anti-choice in medical decisions such as the end of life and the termination of pregnancy? No one can say for sure, but the statistics collected by the National Council of Churches and various polling agencies suggest that while groups such as the Assemblies of God and the Southern Baptists grew rapidly in the latter half of the 20th century, church membership as a whole declined. The so-called main line churches suffered serious losses, but the most significant trend may have been among those who claim no religious affiliation. In 1952, only 2% of the people polled claimed no connection with organized religion. By 1990, the figure had climbed to 10%. According to a survey conducted by the City University of New York , by 2001, 19% of the people in this county did not identify themselves with any particular religion. According to this survey, during the same period, 1990 to 2001, the percentage of Americans identifying themselves as Christians declined from 86% to 77%.\nFrom my college course in logic, I am aware of the weakness in any argument based on post hoc ergo propter hoc, after this therefore because of this, so I will admit that I cannot prove the decline in American Christianity as a whole is entirely the result of fundamentalism\u2019s success in winning converts. I do think, however, that in the minds of most people who read newspapers and magazines the word \"Christian\" has become identified with extreme conservatism. Only a generation ago, according to most dictionaries, you could call someone a Christian and mean a decent, respectable human being. Today, if you identify someone as a Christian, most of the people I know will assume that you mean a narrow-minded, self-righteous bigot.\nThe negative connotation has made considering Christianity as an option unlikely for many well-informed people. To get their attention, churches reaching out to them can never use the word \"Christian\" without a qualifying adjective, such as progressive. Even when we do, we have a hard time convincing the skeptical that we are different from the politically influential right-wing Christians they read about in the news. Is it any wonder that a shrinking number of people in America are willing to call themselves Christians?\n"}, {"score": 1204.8406, "uuid": "38318f4a-91c3-5875-8dcf-40b2af7e78dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1814wb-26-10512", "target_hostname": "www.specialtypetcare.com", "target_uri": "http://www.specialtypetcare.com/graphics/articlepig.html", "page_rank": 1.184226e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Article from Specialty Pet Training - <em>Are</em> pigs smarter <em>than</em> <em>dogs</em>?", "snippet": "<em>Dogs</em> also have a keen sense of smell, but rely more on their sight <em>than</em> pigs do, says Coe. <em>Dogs</em> <em>are</em> also <em>better</em> able to use their mouths to pick up objects.", "explanation": null, "document": "Specialty Pet\u00c2\u00a0Training.com copyright 2008\nInteresting Article from Specialty Pet Training.com\nAre pigs smarter than dogs?\nFlying pigs are still the stuff of fantasy. But talking pigs, like E.B. White's mud-loving runt Wilbur, may not be all that far-fetched.\nBarnyard pigs are clever creatures. They're known to work in pairs to maneuver the latches and gates of their pens. Once they figure out how to open the gates, they'll do so repeatedly, says Ken Kephart, a Penn State professor of animal science who has spent more than 20years working with pigs\nThe smartest swine even open up the rest of the pens to let the others out, he says. On the occasional early morning, a farmer will arrive at his barn to find many of the pigs loose. \"They're very clever, without a doubt,\" says Kephart. \"They can be trained to do many of the same tasks we ask other animals to do.\"\nSome of these useful tasks are instinctual for pigs. For instance, they've long been used to lead people deep into the forests of France to sniff out buried treasure. Truffles, fungi growing beneath the roots of oak trees, can fetch hundreds of dollars, sometimes more than $1,000 per pound on the gourmet food market.\nOther behaviors showcase pigs' ability to learn new behaviors. Using their snouts, pigs can even be taught to maneuver a modified joystick to move a cursor on a video monitor, as proven in research done at Penn State from 1996 to 1998 by Stanley Curtis, then professor of dairy and animal science and now an adjunct animal sciences professor at the University of Illinois.\nFor rewards of M&M's, Skittles or Reese's Pieces, the pigs moved the cursor over to a target, then used the cursor to distinguish among scribbles drawn by Curtis' grandchild. The pigs were shown one scribble, then a few seconds later shown the same scribble along with a second. They used the joystick and cursor to distinguish between the scribble they had seen before and the one they were seeing for the first time.\nThe pigs learned these tasks within 5 to 10 attempts, \"very quickly,\" says Curtis. \"As quickly as chimpanzees.\"\nBut are pigs smarter than dogs?\nBoth pigs and dogs are quite smart, says Brenda Coe, adjunct assistant professor of animal science, who helped Curtis in the initial stages of his work and also teaches dog behavior in a canine management class. But \"intelligence\" in animals is typically defined in a limited way, as the ability to learn what people try to teach them.\nThere is no such thing as an animal IQ or other standard measure for animal intelligence that would allow a straight comparison. \"You can compare two pigs or compare two dogs, but you can't compare species to species,\" says Coe.\nPigs and dogs perform well on different tasks, depending on their motivation and strengths. Food is the motivator for pigs while loyalty and eagerness to please are the primary motivators for dogs.\nPigs can be loyal, but not to the degree that dogs are, Kephart concurs. \"Dogs really like to please the people they're working with. Pigs are much more independently minded in my observation.\"\nThe animals have different physical abilities, too: Pigs tend to be near-sighted and rely on their senses of smell and hearing. Dogs also have a keen sense of smell, but rely more on their sight than pigs do, says Coe. Dogs are also better able to use their mouths to pick up objects.\n\"A dog can learn task A quicker than a pig, but a pig may learn task B faster than a dog,\" Coe adds.\nExcept for those bred to hunt truffles, pigs have not been bred or raised for much besides food, or trained for tasks in the way many breeds of dogs have. The cognitive skills of the two species have evolved differently as a result of their environments and what has been required of them to survive, says Curtis.\n\"Both of those species have spent a lot of time with humans, hundreds of thousands of years with hominids. Their behavior was shaped as they evolved, shaped by their interactions with humans.\"\nCurtis hopes to teach a crude language to pigs by teaching them words for images and building a vocabulary. The objective is simple: build a better hog house. \"If we're going to build a better piggery so that animals' needs and wants are being supported, then we need to know more about what they need and want,\" he says. Designing hog houses this way would be both humane and practical, he argues.\nIf you're thinking by now that it might be nice to have a pig as a pet, think twice. They're as curious as they are clever, and can be destructive as they explore, says Coe. And they need a lot of space. Market hogs are sold at around 250 pounds for slaughter, but can reach 600 to 700 pounds. Though many people are happy owners of potbelly pigs, she adds, these much-smaller animals can sometimes be aggressive.\n\"I don't think a pig is a good pet for everyone,\" warns Coe.\nMaybe they're just too smart for that.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094Lisa Duchene\nKen Kephart, Ph.D., is a professor of animal science and swine specialist in the College of Agricultural Sciences.

I'd been way over the 30-kilometre limit. In a school zone, yet. Okay, it was summer: No kids at school. Still.\n\"You could have killed someone,\" the officer said. He was right.\nMy driving record was otherwise unblemished, I said. He didn't care. \"I'm not even going to check.\"\nFines and demerit points have a way of focusing the mind - mine anyway. So does sitting in your car on a busy street with a cruiser behind you, lights flashing. It's humiliating - people peering into your car and all. It's meant to be.\nI like to think of myself as a courteous, conscientious driver. I signal before turning, am mindful in the car - of cyclists and pedestrians and other vehicles - and I watch the road.\nMe and everyone else. In study after study, it seems, when groups of drivers were asked to compare themselves to the average driver, a majority responded that they were better, Tom Vanderbilt reports in his compelling new book about driving, Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (And What It Says About Us) (Alfred A. Knopf, 402 pp, $29.95). \"This is, of course, statistically quite improbable,\" observes the Brooklyn-based writer.\nIn fact, as he explains, we are way more distracted and distractible than we acknowledge - or even could acknowledge, since one reason we inflate our driving abilities may well be that we can't accurately judge them to begin with. Polls on aggressive driving, for instance, report more people seeing it than doing it. \"Someone is self-enhancing,\" Vanderbilt writes.\nThinking that we're above average helps to explain our initial resistance to such safety measures as cellphone restrictions, he suggests. \"We overestimate the risk to society and we underestimate our own risk,\" he writes. \"It is the other person's behaviour that needs to be controlled, not mine.\"\nBut the truth is that there is a great deal of careless driving and there are many near-misses - and that we are nearly all responsible. \"Human attention, in the best of circumstances, is a fluid but fragile entity,\" as Vanderbilt writes.\nI have rummaged through my purse on occasion while driving and once, while fiddling with the radio dial on a winter night, I came within a hair's breadth of hitting the car in front of me. Not infrequently, I drive in excess of the speed limit - not much, but over it. The July morning I was stopped for speeding, I was so focused on getting to where I was headed I didn't even notice the police cruiser tailing me down the curving mountain road. It was cavalier of me - and stupid.\nBefore the provincial ban on hand-held cellphones was introduced in Quebec in April, I talked on my cellphone while driving way more than I needed to. (Now, I almost always pull over - not because of the spectre of a $115 fine and three demerits if I'm caught but, more important, because I have realized nothing is so crucial that it can't wait for me to stop driving to say or hear it.)\nThe risk of having a traffic accident while using a cellular phone is the same as the risk while driving drunk, according to a Canadian study that appeared in New England Journal of Medicine back in 1997, and hands-free phones appear to be no safer than the hand-held ones. Other studies since have found the same thing.\n\"The impairments aren't because your hands aren't on the wheel. It's because your mind isn't on the road,\" David Strayer, a psychology professor at the University of Utah told Katharine Mieszkowski of Salon.com a couple of weeks ago.\nAnd yet, human nature is such that the longer we go without crashing our cars or hurting someone, the more strongly reinforced our risky behaviour becomes.\n\"As an average driver, you can get away with a lot before it catches up with you,\" John Lee, head of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at the University of Iowa told Vanderbilt. \"You could drive for years with a cellphone and say, 'How can cellphones be dangerous, because I do it every day for two hours and nothing's happened?' Well, that's because you've been lucky.\"\n\"We all get reinforced the wrong way,\" said Bruce Moeller, CEO of Drivecam, a San Diego-based company which installs cameras around the rear-view mirrors of commercial vehicles. When a driver brakes hard or turns suddenly, the camera's record of the 10 seconds before and after the event is sent to company analysts. Crash rates in Drivecam-equipped vehicles have dropped significantly.\nAs he watched footage of crashes, near-crashes and careless driving, Vanderbilt observed that more often than not, it's not that unforeseen things happen for no good reason but that people do things that make crashes more likely or even unpreventible.\nIn one case, a driver looked down to dial a cellphone while driving along a residential street; his eyes were off the road for most of the nine seconds of the recorded event; as his van began to leave the road, he swerved. Less than a dozen feet away was a child on a bicycle; a friend was nearby, just off the road. The distracted driver hadn't seen them.\n\"Not only was the guy unaware of the real hazards he was subjecting himself and others to in the way he was driving,\" Vanderbilt writes, \"he was not even aware that he was unaware.\"\nThe same was true of me the morning I was stopped for speeding, I am afraid - and it is true of too many of us, way too often.\nMontreal Gazette\n"}], [{"score": 1193.3284, "uuid": "40957bde-b01f-543b-a262-a1b44ae2127e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1415wb-50-26701", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.org", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.org/doogieanniversary.html", "page_rank": 1.1800894e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Doogie: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>", "snippet": "Am I really a <em>human</em>?

Sanitizers containing both ethanol and organic acids significantly reduced recovery of the virus from hands and rhinovirus infection up to 4 hours following application.\nSee Also:\nVulvovaginal health\nThe researchers from the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville and Dial Corporation, Scottsdale, Arizona detail their findings in the March 2010 issue of the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.\nRhinovirus is the known cause of approximately 30 to 35% of common cold cases in adults. Hand-to-hand contact is one of the main avenues of transmission contributing to the spread of rhinovirus infections. In the study researchers compared the effects of hand washing with soap and water and an ethanol-based hand sanitizer by contaminating the fingers of healthy volunteers with rhinovirus and then randomly grouping them and administering one of six hand treatments.\nThe experiments ranged from a control group who had no treatment, several groups who washed their hands for differing amounts of time (some with soap, some without), and several who used varying amounts of hand sanitizer. Results showed that the ethanol hand sanitizer removed approximately 80% of detectable rhinovirus from hands and was much more effective than no treatment, water alone, or soap and water. Soap and water removed rhinovirus from 31% of hands.\nFurther, researchers added organic acids to the ethanol-based sanitizer and analyzed its ability to provide persistent antiviral activity against rhinovirus following application. Results showed that the sanitizer containing both organic acids and ethanol inactivated the virus on hands and prevented infection 2 to 4 hours following application.\n\"The ethanol-containing hand disinfectants were significantly more effective than hand washing with water or with soap and water for removal of detectable rhinovirus for the hands in this study,\" say the researchers. \"Furthermore, a formula containing organic acids and ethanol resulted in residual activity that significantly reduced virus recovery from the hands and rhinovirus infection for up to 4 hours after application.\"\nShare this story on Facebook, Twitter, and Google:\nOther social bookmarking and sharing tools:\nStory Source:\nThe above story is reprinted from materials provided by American Society for Microbiology .\nNote: Materials may be edited for content and length.

She introduced herself to me through a letter she left with one of Max's daycare teachers. The letter read:\n16 January 2008\nDear Max's Mom\nPlease allow me to introduce myself, my name is Kathryn and I am Lillie's Mom. Lillie is an intermediate at the daycare. Lillie was born with an extremely rare neurocutaneous disease called Hypomelanosis of Ito. When Lillie first arrived in infant care at the daycare she was 7-months old and barely weighed 9-pounds. Lillie was paralyzed on her right side.\nThrough love and support of the daycare teachers, ErinOakKids and our own private therapists Lillie has made tremendous progress.\nLillie will be 3-years old in March. Over the last few years our family has faced many challenges and struggles in finding support and care for Lillie. I had the pleasure of meeting Max this morning when I dropped off my Lillie and Christopher.\nMax is a delightful little boy with beautiful blue eyes.\nIf there is anything I can do to assist you and Max please do not hesitate to call me anytime day or night.\nWith kindest regards\nKathryn S.\nHome phone/Work phone\nWhat the letter didn't say, was that she met Max for the first time when she witnessed him throwing himself onto the ground when his class came outside to play. That he was wearing a helmet to protect his head. That she offered to help the teachers get him back inside when he refused to walk and had to be carried. That she held him close and stroked his hair to soothe him.\nWe were still fumbling blindly through the maze of clinics, consultants, therapists and wait lists. Doing our best, but feeling completely inadequate to deal with Max's challenges and struggling to understand what was wrong with our little boy. Kathryn saw Max, and somehow knew that whoever this little boy belonged to, they needed help.\nI still carry her letter in my purse with me (it's a bit tattered these days). When I am feeling sad or overwhelmed, I pull it out and read it, reminding myself that I am not alone. Kat and I have become good friends. She is incredibly smart and funny, has a heart that has room to spare, and has the capacity to listen to other people's problems (even the really ugly stuff), when her own problems are often much bigger. Also, she refuses to drink Canadian wine, and would drink only French wine if she had her way. I find this incredibly charming and it makes me like her even more.\nWhile I would never ask to have a child with special needs, and wouldn't wish it on anyone (well, perhaps it would be okay if a few MPPs had Autistic children - then they wouldn't be such condescending jackasses regarding the wait lists for IBI funding), I likely would never have met Kat if it weren't for Max's diagnosis of Autism. We may have passed each other in the cloak room at the kids' daycare, waved politely in the parking lot as we strapped our kids into their car seats, but there would have been no reason for Kat to reach out to me had it not been for Max, and his helmet.\nI am lucky to have met Kat, and to have her in my life. I hope that one day, we will be able to sit, drinking non-Canadian wine, and watch our kids talking each other's ears off, laughing at each other's jokes, and running around in the backyard. Until then, I'll be there for her to lean on when she needs help being strong, and vice versa, I'm sure.\n"}, {"score": 1157.1699, "uuid": "44f8a23b-f7b7-563c-8625-035436d9cffa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1012wb-25-04545", "target_hostname": "juandahlmann.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://juandahlmann.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/why-im-a-much-better-critic-than-a-dog-groomist/", "page_rank": 1.2178683e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "&gt;Why I\u2019m a much <em>better</em> critic <em>than</em> a <em>dog</em> groomist \u00ab Vaguely Borgesian", "snippet": "I think it&#x27;s just senility that&#x27;s mellowed her personality and enables her to deal with <em>humans</em> <em>better</em> Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You <em>are</em> currently reading &gt;Why I\u2019m a much <em>better</em> critic <em>than</em> a <em>dog</em> groomist at Vaguely Borgesian.", "explanation": null, "document": "April 23rd, 2011 \u00a7 3 Comments\nRemember when I posted this picture back in December 2010 of the family\u2019s long-suffering dog, Ally?\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s beginning to be warm around here (already had a temp above 90 earlier this month) and this dog\u2019s coat is extremely thick.\u00a0 Since she\u2019s so skittish around vets, I thought it might be a good idea to buy some electric clippers and shear her myself.\nWell\u2026\nThere\u2019s a fine art of running such through such a thick coat, as I learned to my chagrin\u2026\nThe blade got caught when I was cutting her neck fur and it jumped and got stuck and\u2026\nYou can see the results for yourself:\nYes, I\u2019m SO good that I gave my nearly 14-year old mix a bald spot.\u00a0 Well, she\u2019s nearly 100 in dog years, so maybe she won\u2019t mind it so much.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t even blink when it happened, oddly enough.\u00a0 Well, I guess this is better than taping bacon to a cat, I suppose\u2026\nShare this:\n"}], [{"score": 1146.5901, "uuid": "97536233-59c2-5a1f-93af-91bbe5f174f6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1807wb-14-02477", "target_hostname": "aphasiacorner.com", "target_uri": "http://aphasiacorner.com/blog/living-with-aphasia-2/words-are-more-like-cats-than-dogs-214", "page_rank": 1.2848211e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Words <em>Are</em> More Like Cats <em>Than</em> <em>Dogs</em> \u00ab Aphasia Corner Blog", "snippet": "Due to a medical episode in March, 2009 and the onset of a mild case of aphasia, I have come to the realization that words <em>are</em> more like cats <em>than</em> they <em>are</em> like <em>dogs</em>.

The following essay is my attempt to describe what it\u2019s like trying to work with words and arguments suffering with a mild case of aphasia.\nDue to a medical episode in March, 2009 and the onset of a mild case of aphasia, I have come to the realization that words are more like cats than they are like dogs. Cats are independent and dogs are dependent. One wag put it this way: \u201cDogs think they are people. Cats know they are better than people.\u201d Dogs come to you when you call them. Cats come to you when they want to come to you. That is a perfect description of words to someone who is suffering with aphasia. Words come to you when they want to come. They don\u2019t come to you necessarily when you call them.\nAphasia can be an insidious condition. Neurologists call it a deficit. People suffering from it lack the ability to find or remember the right words on demand. Much of the time the only person that recognizes that you are suffering from it is yourself. You know what you are thinking and trying to say, but you just can\u2019t find the right word to express your thoughts. You go ahead and say something that still makes sense but it is not quite exactly what you wanted to say. Because you are carrying on a rational conversation, the person to whom you are talking has no idea about the battle that is going on in your mind. It is a battle of wills. It is a battle of your will against the will of the words that are locked in the recesses of your mind. Words are acting like cats and are not coming to you when you call them. Hours or days later the right word comes to you, but it is too late to put a perfect end on that argument in which you were engaged.\nArguments are like geometric solids. You should be able to pick them up and look at the various facets of an argument, just like you can pick up a geometric solid and look at the various sides of the solid. The person who is suffering from aphasia has difficulty in doing that, at least that is what I have found in my case. In addition to not being able to find the right word to use in a particular setting, I have had difficulty in understanding how particular words used by others fit into the argument that they are trying to establish.\nThe human brain is a marvelous entity. Now, there is an example of what I have been trying to say. \u201cEntity\u201d is not quite the word that I want to use, but I can\u2019t find the right word so it will have to do. How do words get into the storehouse of the brain? How do we learn new words? That question has been around in one form or another for more than 2500 years. Confucius answered this way: \u201cWhat I read, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand.\u201d Words become part of our usable vocabulary as we use them repeatedly. What is happening in the brain? Every time we use a word, either a new synaptic connection is built, or an existing one is strengthened. What appears to be happening with aphasia is that something is interfering with those synaptic connections. Part of what is marvelous about the brain is that when one route is broken, the brain constructs another route. For dog lovers among the readers of this, \u201cThere is always more than one way to skin a cat.\u201d\nHow am I learning to cope with aphasia? I remember an old joke, the throw-in line from a television commercial, and a piece of advice that my Babe Ruth baseball coach kept repeating and repeating. The old joke is the one about a young musician standing on a street corner in New York City with a violin case in hand. He asks an elderly gentlemen seated in the bus stop pavilion, \u201cExcuse me, sir. How do you get to Carnegie Hall?\u201d The elderly gentlemen seeing the violin case, replies wryly, \u201cPractice, practice, practice.\u201d You may have seen the television commercial in which an amateur softball shortstop makes a few attempts at fielding ground balls and flipping the ball to second base to start a double play. The amateur shortstop gets it right once and an announcer says, \u201cAmateur athletes practice till they get it right.\u201d The scene fades out and in fades the scene of a very recognizable professional shortstop. He is taking ground balls and throwing them toward second base to start a double play. The announcer then says, \u201cProfessionals practice until they can\u2019t get it wrong.\u201d\nIn music, and athletics, it is universally accepted that to succeed, you must practice. In education, there is a debate about how much practice and repetition is good for students. However, research in cognitive science clearly shows that for new skills and knowledge to become second nature, sustained practice beyond the point of mastery is imperative. There are three keys to remember in this statement. The first key is that to obtain mastery in a new skill or knowledge it is necessary that we must learn through practice. One undeniable aspect of practice is time on task. We must spend time doing it. How long does the professional musician spend practicing? How long do the top college basketball teams practice? Coach Izzo, from Michigan State University, is known for his foul shooting prowess and the demands on his players to be able to shoot free throws. Coach Izzo has been known to make more than 100 consecutive foul shots. How did he get to be that proficient? When he was a high school player, he missed a foul shot that could have propelled his team to a state title. He vowed that he would never be in that position again. In his spare time, he began shooting foul shots and would not quit until he made 25 in a row consistently. When he reached that plateau, he upped the number to 50, and so on. When he became a coach, he \u201cchallenged\u201d his players to do the same. Practice, practice, practice!\nSo, practice makes perfect. Not exactly. The second key is that through our practice, we must reach the point of mastery. It is not enough to just practice. I don\u2019t think that I will ever forget my Babe Ruth League baseball coach. We practiced twice a week for several hours each. He would spend the first 30 minutes of each practice session teaching us skills. The next 30 minutes were spent going over skills that we learned in previous practices. The remaining 60 to 90 minutes of practice were spent in batting practice or in running through game situations. However, no matter where we were in the practice, if one of us made either a physical or mental mistake, Coach would stop practice right then. If the mistake was mental, he would ask the involved individual what he did and what should he have done. If the mistake was physical, Coach would stop practice and have us repeat the action. We would repeat it until we got it right several times in a row. I don\u2019t think I can count the number of times that we heard Coach say, \u201cPractice doesn\u2019t make perfect, perfect practice makes perfect.\u201d\nThe third key for new knowledge or skills to become second nature is sustained practice beyond the point of mastery. The concert pianist practices a piece until she can play it without thinking. The fingers just go to the right keys by themselves. She\u2019s done with that piece, right? No! If she wants to maintain that piece in her repertoire, she must continue to practice it. I remember very well a conversation I had with a concert pianist that I had asked to become chair of a music department. After three years in the job, the individual asked to be relieved of the position. This individual was doing a great job as chair, so I asked why give it up. The answer was very quick and to the point. Not enough practice time. Instead of eight hours a day, the pianist could now only find two to four hours per day to practice. That was not enough to maintain perfection in the pianist\u2019s repertoire. Sustained practice beyond the point of mastery is the key to success in the concert arena.\nTime on task! Perfect practice makes perfect! Am I just talking about music or athletics? No. I am also not just talking about those disciplines that are considered practical or skill-oriented. I am talking about learning in general. Richard Light, a Harvard professor, in his book Making the Most of College, asks the question, \u201cWhat is the difference between the typical Harvard student and the typical community college student?\u201d His answer may not agree with your intuition. He said that the primary difference is not innate ability. He suggested that there were two significant differences. The first was the expectation of necessary study time. Most Harvard students come to college expecting to study many hours a week. The second difference was that most Harvard students spent the number of hours studying that they had expected to spend. Learning is important to typical Harvard students. They spend the time necessary to learn.\nIn terms of my aphasia, I must spend time with words. I must use them over and over again. I must find new words or forgotten words and use them correctly. Perfect practice makes perfect! What kind of practice? I find cross-word puzzles helpful. I find reading helpful. However, the most helpful exercise is writing. In writing, I have to find that right word by digging around in the cluttered closets of my mind. I must use words until I am comfortable with them and they are comfortable with me. Just like cats, they must want to come to me and stay with me.\nThis post was originally published on Bayard Baylis blog and then republished on Aphasia Corner Blog with the author\u2019s permission.\nUpdate: Aphasia-friendly version of this post is available here.\nShare this post via email, Facebook, Twitter by clicking on the icons below:\nThis website uses IntenseDebate comments , but they are not currently loaded because either your browser doesn't support JavaScript, or they didn't load fast enough.\n"}, {"score": 1146.0656, "uuid": "2846e64c-9c00-5ee8-bad7-e8a0db268224", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-73-10724", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.com", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.com/doogie.html", "page_rank": 1.6201936e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Doogie: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>", "snippet": "He died peacefully, waiting for her to leave the room before passing, as many <em>dogs</em> (and <em>humans</em>) do.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1139.2505, "uuid": "c9d273dd-d6df-5009-aad5-dcb0eeb1cbcc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0308wb-37-05701", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.org", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.org/vdaywrap2009.html", "page_rank": 1.1917821e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Valentines WrapUp 2009: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>!", "snippet": "A Day Without Chains&quot; goes to <em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Latest News | Send a Letter | How to Rescue | Who has Laws?", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1136.4517, "uuid": "0fd0ea16-7813-5d31-89c4-8e302de672e7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-65-11337", "target_hostname": "georgecouros.ca", "target_uri": "http://georgecouros.ca/blog/archives/2253", "page_rank": 1.2343535e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "More <em>than</em> just a <em>dog</em>", "snippet": "My <em>dog</em> ran away yesterday.

I could read email or tweets from people who showed they cared yet could shut it down when I needed distance. \u00a0I needed what I needed in those moments.\nWhen I first started teaching, I moved to the small town of Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. \u00a0Although I was excited for my first, full-time teaching job, the thought of moving to a small town, away from family and away from my friends, was tough. \u00a0What made it so much easier for me, was that every day, I would come home to a wagging tail and a lot of unconditional love from Kobe. \u00a0If people could love the way that dogs do, the world would be so much better.\nThose years living in small towns and teaching were really lonely, and sometimes, I wonder about my own personal well-being if I did not decide to have Kobe (and eventually Shaq) in my life. \u00a0They felt like life savers and meant so much to me.\nSince Kobe has passed, I decided to open my home to another dog from the Edmonton Humane Society. \u00a0It was \u00a0a hard notion for me at first, but someone on Twitter had said to me, \u201cYou love animals so much that you need to open your home to another one.\u201d \u00a0It stuck out to me and when I was ready, I went back to the SPCA and opened myself to a new friend:\nUnlike some people who have experienced the loss of an animal, I did not believe, even for a moment, that I would never get another. I did know full well that there were just too many\u00a0animals out there in need of homes\u00a0for me to take what I have always regarded as the self-indulgent road of saying the heartbreak of the loss of an animal was too much ever to want to go through with it again. To me, such an admission brought up the far more powerful admission that all the wonderful times you had with your animal were not worth the unhappiness at the end.\u201d ~ Cleveland Amory\nAlthough Odom (my new dog) and Shaq are awesome, each dog has their own personality and it is amazing how you connect in such different ways. \u00a0Sometimes I look at Shaq and see how she has mellowed as she has become older, and I see the influence of Kobe on her. \u00a0Then I look at Odom and will let out this distinct \u201csigh\u201d that was a signature of Kobe. \u00a0It seems like Kobe is saying hi to me through them; it always makes me smile.\nBoth my dogs are amazing and they are like my kids, but Kobe was my best friend.\nSome days when I think of Kobe, I still cry. \u00a0The weird thing is, that I appreciate those moments that I have because it shows me how much I loved him and how he really impacted my life. \u00a0So many great things happened those years that I know I was blessed to have him find me.\nThere were so many people that reached out to me during that time last year, and checked up on me from all over the world, and for that, I will always be grateful. \u00a0I struggled so much on the day that I took him to the vet but the one thing that was said to me that really stuck out was the following:\nDogs spend all of their lives being there for you. \u00a0At the time when they need it most, you need to be there for them.\nI think about Kobe everyday and I know he was so much more than \u201cjust a dog\u201d. \u00a0He was a best friend and I miss him every single day.\nLove you buddy\n"}, {"score": 1135.765, "uuid": "c83c44f2-23de-5b04-9793-5f655417898d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301tw-55-22648", "target_hostname": "www.findavet.us", "target_uri": "http://www.findavet.us/2010/03/treat-me-like-a-dog-do-vets-provide-better-care-than-doctors/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Treat Me Like a <em>Dog</em>: Do Vets Provide <em>Better</em> Care <em>than</em> Doctors?", "snippet": "No matter where you <em>are</em>, search to find a vet close to you!

A large number of different pathogens <em>are</em> transferred from infected ticks to <em>dogs</em> following tick attachment and feeding.", "explanation": null, "document": "Written by Dr Mandar Deshpande\n\u2013Understanding canine vector-borne diseases\nCanine Vector Borne Diseases (CVBD) have become a global issue.Many of the parasite transmitted diseases affect humans as well as animals. The dog as man\u2019s best friend plays an important role being effected by and serving as a host for some of the zoonotic pathogens. Here\u2019s more on the CVBDs.\nThe vulnerable dogs\u2026\nBlood-feeding parasites can transmit a variety of pathogens to dogs. These arthropods including ticks, fleas, flies and mosquitoes can transmit bacteria, protozoa, viruses or helminths to dogs which can lead to infections such as babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, leishmaniasis or heartworm disease. Some vectors such as ticks can transmit more than one pathogen. Besides, different Canine Vector Borne Diseases show similar clinical signs which, ultimately complicate the diagnosis and treatment.\nVarious factors predispose dogs to infections with two or multiple vector transmitted pathogens:\nDogs living in areas that are highly endemic for several vector borne pathogens.\nAnimals living predominantly outdoors thus facilitating enhanced vector transmission.\nIrregular or no use of ectoparasiticides.\nA suppressed immune response (due to old age, underlying infection or immunosuppressive therapy).\nTick-borne pathogens\u2026\nTicks are one of the most important vectors that transmit CVBD as they harbor the largest number of different pathogens. Ticks are especially suitable for pathogen transmission, by attaching securely to their hosts and facilitating effective transmission of infectious pathogens over a couple of days. Many of the diseases caused by these tick-borne pathogens possess a wide variety of clinical features and share non-specific signs such as wasting, weight loss, fever and poor appetite or anorexia all making it a challenge to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.\nIn co-infections with pathogen that have different clinical signs, the extent to which different infections might influence each other\u2019s pathophysiology is not clear.\nThe life-cycle of ticks\u2026\nTick-borne pathogens are a cause of animal and human suffering. A large number of different pathogens are transferred from infected ticks to dogs following tick attachment and feeding. However, transmission of tick-borne disease agents does not appear to occur immediately when the tick begins feeding for the first time in a given life cycle. A reactivation period is required for the pathogens to begin replicating, migrate to or be activated in, the salivary glands and be transmitted to the host when the tick regurgitates excess fluid back into the bite wound.\nIn most tick-borne disease systems, an initial attachment and feeding period of at least 24-48 hours is thought to be required to allow reactivation of tick-borne pathogens and subsequent transmission. Time is required for e.g. the spirochetes to be activated, increase in numbers and migrate for the midgut to the salivary glands. Partially fed ticks will readily reattach to new hosts and resume feeding, similarly if a tick infected as a larva or nymph to one host and then moves on to the second host for next life cycle stage, faster transmission time is likely to occur.\nPathogens are transmitted to dogs by a variety of different species of hard ticks (ixodid) or soft ticks (argasid). The hard ticks, for example, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, commonly known as the brown dog tick, spend all three stages of its life cycle on dogs and require a blood meal prior to sexual maturation and mating. Ixodes spp. are responsible for transmitting Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum to dogs.\nCanine infection occurs when salivary secretions form the tick contaminate the attachment site during ingestion of a blood meal, Adult R. sanguineus are capable of transmitting E. canis for at least 155 days following detachment from the host.\nControl programme\u2026\nThere is a need for a comprehensive control programme for vector borne pathogens, due to the new distribution patterns of vectors.\nPrevention of arthropod bites is mainly achieved by preventing the attachment and thus further blood feeding, if possible. Broad spectrum ectoparasiticides with repellent properties such as the pyrethroid insecticide, are ideal compounds to achieve this goal, as they prevent the biting of different vectors like ticks, flies, fleas and mosquitoes and therefore minimise the host parasite interaction, thus decreasing the risk of disease transmission. A regular treatment with these compounds during the transmission period is crucial for the prevention of single and multiple canine vector borne diseases.\nPrevention: Apart from babesiosis & borreliosis, there are no protective vaccines available to prevent dogs from the above-mentioned infections. To overcome this dilemma, pet animals (especially dogs) should be protected against ectoparasite infections in the first place. Besides husbandry measures, such as keeping dogs indoors in endemic areas, effective prophylaxis may also be provided by regular use of ectoparasiticidal products with a repellent, as well as insecticidal & acaricidal action.\n(Contributed by Dr Mandar Deshpande, Business Manager - Companion Animal Products, Bayer Pharmaceuticals Pvt Limited)\n"}, {"score": 1122.3679, "uuid": "59a21a30-e938-5473-9491-d3fd682a82df", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0212wb-13-12918", "target_hostname": "www.thedogplace.org", "target_uri": "http://www.thedogplace.org/LEGISLATION/PUPS-NursingHomes_Losey-1108.asp", "page_rank": 1.2143602e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "PUPS LAW: <em>BETTER</em> FOR <em>DOGS</em> <em>THAN</em> NURSING HOMES!

Here it is significant to note that if PUPS were enacted, it would set the stage for the HSUS to \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpressure\u201d the USDA to extend coverage of the Animal Welfare Act to hobby breeders as well.\nThe existing standards for dogs, as set out in the implementing Animal Welfare Regulation, are very detailed as to the precise quality of care that must be provided for each and every dog and puppy, as well as exacting requirements that, among other things, include precise \u201ccomfort\u201d limitations on the temperatures maintained for the sheltered housing of dogs.\u00a0 In this regard, Section 3.3 of the Animal Welfare Regulation provides that \u201csheltered housing facilities for dogs . . . must be sufficiently cooled when necessary to protect dogs . . . from temperature or humidity extremes and to provide for their health and well being.\u201d This same provision further provides that the \u201cambient temperature must not . . . rise above 85 (degrees F) for more than 4 hours when . . . dogs are present. The preceding requirements are in addition to, not in place of, all other requirements pertaining to climatic conditions in parts 2 and 3 of this Chapter.\u201d Furthermore, to ensure strict compliance with all provisions of the Animal Welfare Act, and its implementing Regulation, the Department of Agriculture is required to ensure that all Federally Licensed Breeders are in full compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its implementing Regulation through the use of a detailed Federal Inspection Program which includes periodic, no notice inspections by Federal Inspectors of every Federally Licensed Dog Kennel in the entire U.S.\nIn contrast, while the U.S. Congress did enact the Nursing Home Reform Act in 1987, neither that Act nor its implementing Regulation that exists today - - nearly 25 years after Congress enacted the Nursing Home Reform Act - - establish Standards of Care for our Loved Ones, who must spend the twilight of their lives in Nursing Homes, with the same degree of detail as currently exists in the implementing Regulation to the Animal Welfare Act that explicitly establishes the required and detail care for dogs.\u00a0 For example, if the air conditioning breaks down on a Friday Night in a Nursing Home and the ambient room temperature in the rooms of Loved Ones with respiratory problems rises above 85 (degrees F) for more than 4 hours, unlike the mandatory requirements for the care of dogs, there is no requirement for our Loved Ones to be moved to another room where the temperature is below 86 degrees F, or for the air conditioning to be repaired before Monday morning, if ever!\nFurthermore, there is no current Statutory requirement, nor is there any pending legislation being considered by the U.S. Congress that would require the Department of Health and Human Services to use Federal Inspectors to periodically inspect Nursing Homes - - that receive Billions of Dollars in Medicare and Medicaid Payments - - to ensure that our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes are actually receiving the minimum level of care mandated by the Nursing Home Reform Act.\u00a0 \u00a0To many, the absence of an air conditioning standard for Nursing Homes that is comparable to the air conditioning standard for dog kennels, and the absence of a Federal Inspection Program for Nursing Homes suggest that Congress places a higher priority on the care and welfare of dogs than it does for the care and welfare of our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes.\nIf you believe that a Loved One in a Nursing Home should receive at least the same quality of care as is provided to a dog, why don\u2019t you ask your Members of Congress to support such legislation as a backdoor way to \u201cfinesse\u201d and highlight the absurdity of the PUPS Bill without creating the appearance of a parochial interest of dog breeders. That is the essence of the \u201cArt of Finesse!\u201d In this regard, if the Members of Congress, who have co-sponsored the PUPS Bill, were to be made aware of the fact that they have placed \u00a0a higher priority on the care and welfare for dogs than on the care and welfare for our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes, a few may wince and reconsider their decision to co-sponsor PUPS.\u00a0 And to those who are currently being \u201clobbied\u201d by the HSUS to co-sponsor the PUPS Bill, the revelation about a higher priority for the care of dogs than for our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes may stop the momentum for any more Members of Congress to co-sponsor PUPS.\nI truly believe that if the Members of Congress became fully aware of the fact that the Federal Government places a higher priority on the care and welfare of dogs than on the care and welfare of our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes, such an awakening revelation may be the \u201cshowstopper\u201d to derail the on-going momentum to enact the PUPS Bill.\nStop and reflect for a moment\u2026\u2026\u2026. How many Members of Congress do you believe would welcome notoriety associated with the fact that the U.S. Congress apparently has placed a higher priority on the care and welfare of a dog than on the care and welfare of a Loved One in a Nursing Home?\nIf you wish to bring this comparative absurdity of Congressional Priorities to the attention your respective Members of Congress, you may do so by sending an E-Mail to them.\u00a0 To send E-Mails, simply follow the instructions below.\u00a0 It will take you less than 10 Minutes to do so, and it just may derail and stop the HSUS PUPS Freight Train!!!\nTo send an E-Mail to your U.S. Representative, Log onto www.house.gov/writerep/\nFill in your state and ZIP Code on the prompt that appears.\nAdd your name, address and E-Mail address on the E-Mail Form for your U.S. Representative; and on the Subject Line add: PUPS - - MISPLACED CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITIES; and then add the message set out below.\nTo send an E-Mail to your Two Senators, Log onto: www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\nClick onto the E-Mail Address for each of your two U.S. Senators.\nAdd your name, address and E-Mail address on the E-Mail Form for your two U.S. Senators; and on the Subject Line add: PUPS - - MISPLACED CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITIES; and then add the message set out below.\nSuggested Text of E-Mail Message:\n\u201cI was alarmed to learn that the Federal Government has an Inspection Program that requires that all Federally Licensed\u00a0 Breeders receive no notice inspections by Federal Inspectors to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, but that there is no Federal Inspection Program for Nursing Homes where our Loved Ones must\u00a0 spend the twilight of their lives in a Nursing Home.\u00a0 I am equally concerned that the Federal Government has an air conditioning standard for dog kennels, but no such air conditioning standard exists for the Nursing Home Rooms where our Loved Ones reside.\nSince the Federal Standards for the care and welfare of dogs in kennels are already more stringent than the existing Federal Standards for the care and welfare for our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes; and since Nursing Homes are not subject to periodic inspections by Federal Inspectors in the same manner that dog kennels are subject to inspections by Federal Inspectors, would you please tell me why Congress places a higher priority on amending the Animal Welfare Act with the pending PUPS Bill than it does on ensuring that Nursing Home Reform Act is amended so that our Loved Ones in Nursing Homes will receive the same level of care that is currently required by the U.S. Government to be provided for dogs?\"\nArticles and Infromation by Frank Losey\nHandy links for Frank Losey Articles:______________________\nIRS/HSUS - A Day of Reckoning\n"}, {"score": 1121.8314, "uuid": "b8a1ad4a-cf78-5f41-a359-8df2e83ab15e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-42-32441", "target_hostname": "ecologos.org", "target_uri": "http://ecologos.org/mcardle.htm", "page_rank": 1.1790218e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Humans</em> <em>are</em> NOT Omnivores", "snippet": "Without evidence, &quot;could&quot; and &quot;could not&quot; <em>are</em> identical.

Individual anatomical structures can serve one or more functions and similar functions can be served by several forms.\nA little truth has leaked out. \u00a0These 'classifications' are mere conveniences, not strictly defined in a reasonable, rigorous, scientific manner.\nOmnivorism\nJM> \u00a0The key category in the discussion of human diet is omnivores, which are defined as generalized feeders, with neither carnivore nor herbivore specializations for acquiring or processing food, and who are capable of consuming and do consume both animal protein and vegetation. They are basically *opportunistic* feeders (survive by eating what is available) with more generalized anatomical and physiological traits, especially the dentition (teeth).\nNotice, there is NO useful, meaningful, or even vaguely-scientific anatomical/physiological/biochemical definition of \"omnivore\", and JM foolishly ignores the inescapable fact that humans are totally incapable of killing, tearing asunder, and consuming raw their prey with their natural, biological equipment, as ALL natural omnivores do! \u00a0In fact, I have challenged people who adamantly claim that they are \"omnivores\" for over 35 years to prove they are natural \"omnivores\" by simply killing and eating raw a small animal with their natural equipment, and none has ever done so to actually test their irrational belief. \u00a0Not one!\nJM has made the all-to-common and fatal error in his totally unscientific and unsupportable claims by confusing Nature and culture; a grievous error which most grade school children would not make. Humans are clearly not natural \"omnivores\". \u00a0Some are cultural \"omnivores\", and indeed must rely on cultural artifacts to raise, kill, butcher, cook, disguise with seasonings, cut up, and finally consume their animal prey. Again, the false definition rests on the phrase \"capable of consuming\"; however, humans have no natural capability to do so. \u00a0If they did, they would. \u00a0Thus, relying on an absurd false definition, JM inevitably and inescapably comes to a false conclusion.\nAnother insight into the falsity of this concept rests in the mistaken confusion, and proposed false-identity, of the verbs: to be, and to do. \u00a0Being refers to our genetic code and its consequences, while doing is totally unrelated and a consequence of cultural programming.\nLet's examine JM's muddled \"thinking\" a bit to see how completely absurd, and perhaps intentionally-misleading, the \"capable\" definition really is.\nHumans are \"capable\" of flying through the air; that makes us birds or flying insects, right?\nHumans are \"capable\" of traveling under water; that makes us fish or sea worms, right?\nHumans are \"capable\" of tunneling through the earth; that makes us earthworms or moles, right?\nJM> \u00a0All the available evidence indicates that the natural human diet is omnivorous and would include meat. We are not, however, required to consume animal protein. We have a choice.\nAnother unintentional admission that we are not natural omnivores; we have a choice; animals, however, do not have any choices, they rely on their genetically-programmed instincts to kill and eat animal prey. \u00a0Humans have no instincts to do so, in spite of the foolish claims of various Instincto cults. Choices are cultural, not instinctual. \u00a0How can someone with even a trivial education not understand the profound difference between culture and Nature?\nThe Great Apes\nJM> \u00a0There are very few frugivores amongst the mammals in general, and primates in particular.\nTotally irrelevant, we are apes, not \"mammals in general\" nor random primates . \u00a0Actually, we are Pongidae, only the horrendous human ego has chosen to elevate ourselves to another, exclusively ours, thus false classification. \u00a0With a genetic difference of a mere ~1.6% from the chimp, our closest genetic relative, it should be obvious that our diet should be essentially that of the chimp . \u00a0Clearly, the genetic distances from various, scientifically-indefinable natural \"omnivores\" would be much more, thus, again, refuting JM's unsupportable claim of \"humans are omnivores\".\nJM> \u00a0The only apes that are predominantly fruit eaters (gibbons and siamangs) are atypical for apes in many behavioral and ecological respects and eat substantial amounts of vegetation.\nWhoops - chimps are frugivorous , eating mostly fruit when available, and falling back on leaves when sufficient fruit is not, and JM is claimed to be a primatologist.\nJM> Our closest relatives among the apes are the chimpanzees (i.e., anatomically, behaviorally, genetically, and evolutionarily), who frequently kill and eat other mammals (including other primates).\n\"Frequently\" turns out to be a self-serving distortion, apparently for the sake of his pre-conceived and false conclusion, and for a \"primatologist\", it must be intentional. \u00a0Chimp hunting and flesh-eating is rare, ~1.4% of their diet, not practiced among all adults, as would be required by a true nutritional need, and is clearly cultural , since flesh is used to gain sexual favors --humorously-similar to human dating.\nEvidence of Humans as Omnivores\nArcheological Record\nJM> \u00a0As far back as it can be traced, clearly the archeological record indicates an omnivorous diet for humans that included meat. Our ancestry is among the hunter/gatherers from the beginning.\nMore muddled \"thinking\". \u00a0The \"archeological record\" so referenced is purely self-selecting, thus misleading, since that \"evidence\" is only produced by cultural processes, which include tool-marked bones and evidence of fire. \u00a0The true frugivorous, natural, non-tool-using, human would leave NO evidence at all, since all food wastes would be composted into oblivion. \u00a0Tools produce enduring evidence, raw-food eating humans do not; however, that certainly does not mean they did not exist. They exist today, and produce no long-term \"archeological evidence\" of their diet in the local ecosystems.\nJM> \u00a0Once domestication of food sources began, it included both animals and plants.\nWhoops -- once culture is in play, its effects can not be used to assess the natural human. Anthro-apologists like to ignore this critical fact, thus reducing their verbal output to mere exercises in creative writing, certainly not real science.\nJM> Cell Types\nRelative number and distribution of cell types, as well as structural specializations, are more important than overall length of the intestine to determining a typical diet. Dogs are typical carnivores, but their intestinal characteristics have more in common with omnivores. Wolves eat quite a lot of plant material.\nTotally irrelevant to humans. \u00a0But, mindless insertion of irrelevancies that sound correct is a common ploy of anthro-apologists in order to created the illusion of scientific credibility.\nJM> \u00a0Fermenting Vats\nNearly all plant eaters have fermenting vats (enlarged chambers where foods sits and microbes attack it). Ruminants like cattle and deer have forward sacs\nderived from remodeled esophagus and stomach. Horses, rhinos, and colobine monkeys have posterior, hindgut sacs. Humans have no such specializations.\nAgain, factual but totally irrelevant to humans, or the \"omnivore\" issue; this applies to herbivores, not frugivorous humans.\nJM> \u00a0Jaws\nAlthough evidence on the structure and function of human hands and jaws, behavior, and evolutionary history also either support an omnivorous diet or\nfail to support strict vegetarianism, the best evidence comes from our teeth. The short canines in humans are a functional consequence of the enlarged cranium\nand associated reduction of the size of the jaws. In primates, canines function as both defense weapons and visual threat devices. Interestingly, the primates\nwith the largest canines (gorillas and gelada baboons) both have basically vegetarian diets.\nLove that self-contradiction.\nJM> In archeological sites, broken human molars are most often confused with broken premolars and molars of pigs, a classic omnivore. On the other hand, some herbivores have well-developed incisors that are often mistaken for those of human teeth when found in archeological excavations.\nYes, archaeology is confused and mistaken.\nJM> Salivary Glands\nThese indicate we could be omnivores. Saliva and urine data vary, depending on diet, not taxonomic group.\n\"Could\"? \u00a0Where is the evidence? \u00a0Without evidence, \"could\" and \"could not\" are identical.\nJM> \u00a0Intestines\nIntestinal absorption is a surface area, not linear problem. Dogs (which are carnivores) have intestinal specializations more characteristic of omnivores than carnivores such as cats. The relative number of crypts and cell types is a better indication of diet than simple length. We are intermediate between the two groups.\nMore irrelevancies and errors to obfuscate the issue. \u00a0The surface area of a cylinder IS linearly proportional to the length. \u00a0We are \"intermediate\" between a carnivore and another carnivore, so what does that mean?\nConclusion (false)\nJM> \u00a0Humans are classic examples of omnivores in all relevant anatomical traits.\nThis is a blatant lie. \u00a0JM has presented no anatomical definition, or even an attempt to generate a rigorous, testable, anatomical definition of \"omnivore\"; this is not possible, since the anatomies of various natural omnivores is so diverse that no coherent patterns can be found.\nJM> \u00a0There is no basis in anatomy or physiology for the assumption that humans are pre-adapted to the vegetarian diet.\nThe \"vegetarian diet\" is generally cooked, is centered on grains and beans, and may include dairy and eggs; this was not a discussion of a \" vegetarian diet\". \u00a0Another irrelevant dodge and intentional obfuscation.\nJM> \u00a0For that reason, the best arguments in support of a meat-free diet remain ecological, ethical, and health concerns.\nThe \"ethical\" argument is totally bogus, since there is no objective set of ethics to which one can compare to determine what is more, or less, \"ethical\" than what. \u00a0That is, individuals just make up their own ethical standards to suit their purposes of the moment. \u00a0Hitler did what he did, based on his own personal set of ethics; so does JM.\n[Dr. McArdle is a vegetarian and currently Scientific Advisor to The American Anti-Vivisection Society. He is an anatomist and a primatologist.]\nClearly unqualified and hopelessly-confused on very fundamental facts and real science. \u00a0And he has a PhD; that's frightening.\u00a0 Worse, look at some more of his hysterically-emotional nonsense .\nThis article was originally published in the May/June 1991 edition of the Vegetarian Journal, published by:\nThe Vegetarian Resource Group, P.O.

Humans have no such specializations.\nAgain, factual but totally irrelevant to humans, or the \"omnivore\" issue; this applies to herbivores, not frugivorous humans.\nJM> \u00a0Jaws\nAlthough evidence on the structure and function of human hands and jaws, behavior, and evolutionary history also either support an omnivorous diet or\nfail to support strict vegetarianism, the best evidence comes from our teeth. The short canines in humans are a functional consequence of the enlarged cranium\nand associated reduction of the size of the jaws. In primates, canines function as both defense weapons and visual threat devices. Interestingly, the primates\nwith the largest canines (gorillas and gelada baboons) both have basically vegetarian diets.\nLove that self-contradiction.\nJM> In archeological sites, broken human molars are most often confused with broken premolars and molars of pigs, a classic omnivore. On the other hand, some herbivores have well-developed incisors that are often mistaken for those of human teeth when found in archeological excavations.\nYes, archaeology is confused and mistaken.\nJM> Salivary Glands\nThese indicate we could be omnivores. Saliva and urine data vary, depending on diet, not taxonomic group.\n\"Could\"? \u00a0Where is the evidence? \u00a0Without evidence, \"could\" and \"could not\" are identical.\nJM> \u00a0Intestines\nIntestinal absorption is a surface area, not linear problem. Dogs (which are carnivores) have intestinal specializations more characteristic of omnivores than carnivores such as cats. The relative number of crypts and cell types is a better indication of diet than simple length. We are intermediate between the two groups.\nMore irrelevancies and errors to obfuscate the issue. \u00a0The surface area of a cylinder IS linearly proportional to the length. \u00a0We are \"intermediate\" between a carnivore and another carnivore, so what does that mean?\nConclusion (false)\nJM> \u00a0Humans are classic examples of omnivores in all relevant anatomical traits.\nThis is a blatant lie. \u00a0JM has presented no anatomical definition, or even an attempt to generate a rigorous, testable, anatomical definition of \"omnivore\"; this is not possible, since the anatomies of various natural omnivores is so diverse that no coherent patterns can be found.\nJM> \u00a0There is no basis in anatomy or physiology for the assumption that humans are pre-adapted to the vegetarian diet.\nThe \"vegetarian diet\" is generally cooked, is centered on grains and beans, and may include dairy and eggs; this was not a discussion of a \" vegetarian diet\". \u00a0Another irrelevant dodge and intentional obfuscation.\nJM> \u00a0For that reason, the best arguments in support of a meat-free diet remain ecological, ethical, and health concerns.\nThe \"ethical\" argument is totally bogus, since there is no objective set of ethics to which one can compare to determine what is more, or less, \"ethical\" than what. \u00a0That is, individuals just make up their own ethical standards to suit their purposes of the moment. \u00a0Hitler did what he did, based on his own personal set of ethics; so does JM.\n[Dr. McArdle is a vegetarian and currently Scientific Advisor to The American Anti-Vivisection Society.

A large number of different pathogens <em>are</em> transferred from infected ticks to <em>dogs</em> following tick attachment and feeding.", "explanation": null, "document": "Written by Dr Mandar Deshpande\n\u2013Understanding canine vector-borne diseases\nCanine Vector Borne Diseases (CVBD) have become a global issue.Many of the parasite transmitted diseases affect humans as well as animals. The dog as man\u2019s best friend plays an important role being effected by and serving as a host for some of the zoonotic pathogens. Here\u2019s more on the CVBDs.\nThe vulnerable dogs\u2026\nBlood-feeding parasites can transmit a variety of pathogens to dogs. These arthropods including ticks, fleas, flies and mosquitoes can transmit bacteria, protozoa, viruses or helminths to dogs which can lead to infections such as babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, leishmaniasis or heartworm disease. Some vectors such as ticks can transmit more than one pathogen. Besides, different Canine Vector Borne Diseases show similar clinical signs which, ultimately complicate the diagnosis and treatment.\nVarious factors predispose dogs to infections with two or multiple vector transmitted pathogens:\nDogs living in areas that are highly endemic for several vector borne pathogens.\nAnimals living predominantly outdoors thus facilitating enhanced vector transmission.\nIrregular or no use of ectoparasiticides.\nA suppressed immune response (due to old age, underlying infection or immunosuppressive therapy).\nTick-borne pathogens\u2026\nTicks are one of the most important vectors that transmit CVBD as they harbor the largest number of different pathogens. Ticks are especially suitable for pathogen transmission, by attaching securely to their hosts and facilitating effective transmission of infectious pathogens over a couple of days. Many of the diseases caused by these tick-borne pathogens possess a wide variety of clinical features and share non-specific signs such as wasting, weight loss, fever and poor appetite or anorexia all making it a challenge to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.\nIn co-infections with pathogen that have different clinical signs, the extent to which different infections might influence each other\u2019s pathophysiology is not clear.\nThe life-cycle of ticks\u2026\nTick-borne pathogens are a cause of animal and human suffering. A large number of different pathogens are transferred from infected ticks to dogs following tick attachment and feeding. However, transmission of tick-borne disease agents does not appear to occur immediately when the tick begins feeding for the first time in a given life cycle. A reactivation period is required for the pathogens to begin replicating, migrate to or be activated in, the salivary glands and be transmitted to the host when the tick regurgitates excess fluid back into the bite wound.\nIn most tick-borne disease systems, an initial attachment and feeding period of at least 24-48 hours is thought to be required to allow reactivation of tick-borne pathogens and subsequent transmission. Time is required for e.g. the spirochetes to be activated, increase in numbers and migrate for the midgut to the salivary glands. Partially fed ticks will readily reattach to new hosts and resume feeding, similarly if a tick infected as a larva or nymph to one host and then moves on to the second host for next life cycle stage, faster transmission time is likely to occur.\nPathogens are transmitted to dogs by a variety of different species of hard ticks (ixodid) or soft ticks (argasid). The hard ticks, for example, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, commonly known as the brown dog tick, spend all three stages of its life cycle on dogs and require a blood meal prior to sexual maturation and mating. Ixodes spp. are responsible for transmitting Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum to dogs.\nCanine infection occurs when salivary secretions form the tick contaminate the attachment site during ingestion of a blood meal, Adult R. sanguineus are capable of transmitting E. canis for at least 155 days following detachment from the host.\nControl programme\u2026\nThere is a need for a comprehensive control programme for vector borne pathogens, due to the new distribution patterns of vectors.\nPrevention of arthropod bites is mainly achieved by preventing the attachment and thus further blood feeding, if possible. Broad spectrum ectoparasiticides with repellent properties such as the pyrethroid insecticide, are ideal compounds to achieve this goal, as they prevent the biting of different vectors like ticks, flies, fleas and mosquitoes and therefore minimise the host parasite interaction, thus decreasing the risk of disease transmission. A regular treatment with these compounds during the transmission period is crucial for the prevention of single and multiple canine vector borne diseases.\nPrevention: Apart from babesiosis & borreliosis, there are no protective vaccines available to prevent dogs from the above-mentioned infections. To overcome this dilemma, pet animals (especially dogs) should be protected against ectoparasite infections in the first place. Besides husbandry measures, such as keeping dogs indoors in endemic areas, effective prophylaxis may also be provided by regular use of ectoparasiticidal products with a repellent, as well as insecticidal & acaricidal action.\n(Contributed by Dr Mandar Deshpande, Business Manager - Companion Animal Products, Bayer Pharmaceuticals Pvt Limited)\n"}, {"score": 1115.7903, "uuid": "b9910ef6-8a7c-5fca-96c8-0b990b304d86", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1705wb-03-30137", "target_hostname": "www.news.harvard.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/12.08/09-dog.html", "page_rank": 1.1920864e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Harvard Gazette: <em>Dogs</em> teach <em>humans</em> new tricks", "snippet": "Blumberg explains his use of the quote: &quot;In the last couple of years there have been a number of scientific studies ... on certain social problems involving <em>humans</em>, [and] <em>dogs</em> seem to be <em>better</em> able to perform the task <em>than</em> chimpanzees.", "explanation": null, "document": "Gazette headlines delivered to your desktop\nHARVARD GAZETTE ARCHIVES\nIt's not clear whether instructor Bruce Blumberg is researching or relaxing as he hangs out at his Concord home with his dogs Scuppers (foreground) and Katie. (Staff photos Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard News Office)\nDogs teach humans new tricks\nExtension School psych class fetches lots of students\nBy Louise Miller\nSpecial to the Harvard News Office\nWith 82 students registered, \"The Cognitive Dog: Savant or Slacker\" is the second-largest Extension School psychology course this semester. When Bruce Blumberg proposed the course to Assistant Dean of Continuing Education Mary Higgins, her first thought was: \"wacky idea.\" However, upon investigating it further Higgins realized it \"could be a great course\" because it would reach out to students who might not otherwise sign up for a cognitive development course. Despite her early misgivings, Higgins says now that she's not surprised at all by the class's popular success \"because it seemed to have all the right ingredients.\" Higgins adds that the number of dog owners in the area as well as the substance of the class both contribute to this popularity. \"It seemed like a perfect match to me,\" Higgins said, though she admits she personally \"hates dogs.\"\nSuzanne Spreadbury, assistant dean of undergraduate degree programs, is a bit surprised. \"I knew it was going to be popular but I didn't think it would be comparable to 'Intro to Psychology,'\" which has 84 students registered. \"It had all the trappings of an interesting class as far as a narrow subject area,\" she says, adding that \"people could come to the table with their own experiences and engage in the material in their own way and I think that always sets the tone for a great discussion.\"\nThe age range of students - from 19 to 77 - is testimony to the subject's wide appeal. As an academic adviser to students of the A.L.B. program, Spreadbury found \"students were very curious ... . Every semester there's the top three or four courses that people are interested in and want to talk about and ask more questions to the advisers about - this was definitely one of them.\"\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) graduate, teacher Blumberg currently works by day in Waltham at Blue Fang Games, an animation company \"interested in figuring out how you can build animated creatures that have the everyday common sense and ability to learn that animals such as dogs have. So we studied dogs.\" Blumberg has three dogs himself: Katie, a 12-year-old collie; an 8-year-old silky terrier named Sidney; and a border terrier, Scuppers, who is 2 years old.\nInstructor Bruce Blumberg has plenty of real world experience with the animals he studies. Two of his best friends are Sydney (left) and Scuppers.\nBlumberg taught the course last year as a seminar to a small collection of graduate students composed of dog trainers, computer people, and anthropologists at the MIT Media Lab. When Blumberg left MIT to go into industry, he approached Harvard Extension School as a way to continue teaching.\nBlumberg says of his class, \"The first purpose is [to get students] to understand their dogs better. Also, I'm very interested in using dogs as a way of thinking about how you understand ... what's going on in the brains of other creatures. So we're using dogs as models, but often the topics will be general issues - what you need to be thinking about when you're thinking about how other creatures think.\" Among those things you need to think about: genetics, evolution, development, and motivation.\nIn the course description, psychologist Paul Blum predicts that \"for psychologists, dogs may be the next chimpanzees.\" Blumberg explains his use of the quote: \"In the last couple of years there have been a number of scientific studies ... on certain social problems involving humans, [and] dogs seem to be better able to perform the task than chimpanzees. For example, using pointing gestures to find hidden food is something the dogs respond to better than chimps.\" Blumberg adds that, \"A dog has been shown to learn words really, really quickly based on one or two repetitions, they are able to associate a novel word with a novel object. This is something never seen in chimps.\"\nAnother boon companion is the rough coated collie Katie.\nDogs, continues Blumberg, \"in a sense represent a simpler model and live in a human environment; the environment the chimps live in is very, very different from the human environment. Genetically, chimps are close to us, but the kinds of problems chimps have to solve are very different.\"\nHow does Blumberg feel about teaching the diverse crew of Extension School students after working with MIT graduate students? \"It's great! It's an exciting opportunity for me and I'm really enjoying dealing with the wide range of interests and questions. In some ways it's much more challenging to find ways to make it relevant and comprehensible. It's fun for me and I'm appreciative of Harvard Extension School for letting me do this.\"\nTeaching assistant Carolyn Barney, certified pet dog trainer and the owner of five dogs, attended Blumberg's class last year at MIT. Barney, a canine behavior and obedience trainer for more than 20 years, owns a dog training center in Littleton, Mass., and has been competing in canine events for almost 25 years.\nReflecting on last year's class, Barney says, \"It's a fantastic course ... [full] of wonderful information to make you think even more about dogs and show you that you really know even less than you thought you knew; it's amazing.\" Barney's interests lie in how the dog's brain works, specifically how it's hardwired. \"This class,\" she says, \"is helpful in learning a little bit more about that and how it affects the dog and human relationship. Working with people and their dogs helps you understand a little bit more about where dogs are coming from.\"\nThe class is not only a mix of ages but a mix of people, too - dog walkers, trainers, people with therapy dogs who visit the sick and elderly, volunteers at canine shelters, people who want to get some insight into their \"best friend,\" and people who are interested in dogs in general. About three-quarters of the students have dogs, estimates Blumberg.\nAmong them is Polly Ellison, owner of Lobo, a 3-year-old German shepherd. Ellison is taking the class for multiple reasons - to get back into a degree program, to aid her in training her dog, and out of sheer interest. Ellison gives the class high grades: \"I've loved it. It's exciting to learn were the dogs came from, why they're acting the way they do. The reading is fascinating.\"\nBlumberg says that he \"hopes someone coming out of the course will turn around and want to take more psychology classes, because what could be more fascinating than studying about the brain and behavior? If people go into a psychology course and look at it from the perspective of understanding how dogs think and behave ... it will give them a new perspective on psychology.\"\nCopyright 2007 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College\n"}, {"score": 1113.5538, "uuid": "5d9e11c5-5f65-551f-8a2b-604140151834", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-70-09468", "target_hostname": "www.hhd.org", "target_uri": "http://www.hhd.org/resources/story/better-business-better-health", "page_rank": 1.2710156e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "<em>Better</em> Business, <em>Better</em> Health | Health and <em>Human</em> Development", "snippet": "Noticing a growing trend internationally in the <em>dog</em> clothing market, she realized this was a unique niche with very little competition in Bangkok.

She tried several times without success; her most recent venture was a children\u2019s clothing business. Micro-enterprises like hers\u2014small, owner-run businesses with very little start up money\u2014 often lack adequate capital to keep them afloat as they get established.\n\u201cLooking back, I was trying to thrive in a declining children\u2019s clothing industry,\u201d she recalled. \u201cTo make matters worse, I had no assistance from any governmental agencies as they prefer to help the poorest of the poor or bigger enterprises that have better growth potential.\u201d\nBut she did not give up. Noticing a growing trend internationally in the dog clothing market, she realized this was a unique niche with very little competition in Bangkok. She also knew that she needed more than her undergraduate degree this time around to keep her business afloat. To succeed in this economy she had to sharpen her business skills.\nSo when HHD\u2019s Asia office contacted her to apply for the Hewlett Packard Entrepreneurship Learning Program, she readily accepted. The program provides business management training to small, fledgling businesses like hers that have become the backbone of the economy in the region.\nHewlett Packard (HP) turned to EDC\u2019s Health and Human Development division in 2008 to provide workforce development support to micro-enterprises in Asia Pacific. Designated by HP as a Center of Excellence, HHD stepped into the role of managing micro-enterprise development centers throughout the region that are equipped with computers and offer courses in business and technology to help build the skills of entrepreneurs and youth in poor communities. Currently there are 51 Microenterprise Development Centers in Asia Pacific funded by Hewlett Packard.\n\u201cSince economic and social conditions have a profound impact on a person\u2019s health and well-being, workforce development is essential in this region,\u201d explains Angela Chen, Director of HHD\u2019s Asia office. \u201cIn Asia Pacific, micro-enterprises provide significant employment so it is important that we help people create sustainable businesses.\u201d Chen and her colleagues not only oversee all the micro-enterprise development centers in the region, they also directly manage two micro-enterprise development centers in Bangkok which are part of the Thai Ministry of Education.\nSuwanna attended courses at one of the micro-enterprise development centers in Bangkok. She learned how to record her monthly revenues and expenses using Microsoft Excel, how to complete annual tax reports electronically as well as how to create new business plans using computer software. She also took a specialized course in Fashion Design which helped her differentiate her dog clothing products from the current market.\n\u201cI attended a comprehensive one-year program which includes business analysis, seminars, financial and computer trainings, as well as business consultation,\u201d explained Suwanna. The skills she learned through the training allowed Suwanna\u2019s business to function smoother.\nHer dog clothing business is so successful now that she can hardly keep up with the demand. To help her fill the orders, she has hired neighbors and other people in the community. The company produces 3,600 dog clothing items each day\u2014and more during the holidays. In the near future she hopes to be able to export her dog clothing to overseas markets.\nThis project is funded by Hewlett Packard.

It was several years later that she came to know what the cause of her blindness was \u2014 and what the longer term consequences could be. She informed her seven sisters and two brothers of the situation but only a few were prepared to undergo an examination.\nFaced with a serious handicap yet young and with a love of life, Adeline picked herself up and continued her studies in special education. After completing her education, she went to work in a library for the blind and took additional course work in library studies, and later in management.\nShe was promoted to a management position in a production center where books are transcribed into braille, large print and audio format.\nHer career has suffered two serious interruptions for operations for the removal of cysts in her kidneys and brain..\nWhen she got her job with the National Production Center in Brussels, and needed to travel long distances to work, she knew that a guide dog would make it possible for her to travel more rapidly, more independently and more safely than she could with only a cane. She began to look for a guide dog school where she could obtain a dog.\nShe visited guide dog schools in England, Switzerland and France, and her first guide dog was a Labrador Retriever born in England and trained in France. It was difficult to be accepted into the guide dog program, and then to travel the long distance to France, and to train in French, when her native language is Dutch. But it was worth the effort. She found it wonderfully freeing to work with a dog. The dog is trained to watch out for obstacles. Paving stones in the street, curbs, building sites, traffic lights, cars \u2014 all are obstacles to the blind person who ventures into the jungle of towns, armed only with a white cane. Thanks to the dog, all these traps became less threatening. Guided by her companion, Adeline quickly achieved greater mobility and autonomy in her daily life and recovered a great deal of security and confidence.\nIn Belgium, there are narrow streets, unrecognizable sidewalks, and strange traffic patterns. The dog made it much easier to navigate her way across the open squares of Antwerp. In areas where there are crowds of people shopping, and no cars to provide directional clues, the training and memory of the dog become extremely important.\nAdeline felt that Belgium needed its own guide dog school. She and her husband set out to raise money for a location, a trainer, and for the operation of a school in Belgium. They founded The Belgian Centre for Guide Dogs in Belgium in 1990 and still play an active role in the management of the Center.\nNot every dog can become a guide dog. Out of ten dogs tested, only six can become good guides. The process begins with careful breeding. Candidate puppies are then placed in homes where they are reared through puppy-hood. Experience has shown that a dog reared in a family with children is always a better, more sociable and more affectionate guide than a dog that has been raised in a cage or kennel.\nDuring this time the puppies come to \u201cpuppy school\u201d to learn basic commands, discipline, and socialization. They have to learn to circulate in the human world, undistracted by sounds, people, and other animals. They wear special a special jacket identifying them as a guide dogs in training. When they are returned to the Center at the approximate age of 12 months, they need to have essential qualities such as obedience, balance, quietness and self-possession. They then undergo a very demanding training course that lasts for 6 to 8 months. You cannot force the dogs to work; they have to start the training when they feel ready to \u201clearn the job\u201d. The trainer is there only to correct them and to help them develop their intelligence.\nThe initial training takes place at the Center on a set course where the dog learns to deal with a great number of obstacles which it will meet in real life \u2013 open manhole covers, construction detours, overhanging branches, and such. After that, it starts to work in quiet streets where it is immediately confronted with the realities of the outside world.\nAfter six to eight months of intensive training, the dog can be introduced to its future master. The new master comes to the Center for four weeks of residential training with the dog. The dog and its new master begin to venture into town together in order to become familiar with intensive traffic conditions and with the difficulties encountered in a big city.\nBut the dog is much more than simply a guide. It is also, and perhaps especially, an unrelenting friend, a gleam of tenderness, a comforting companion to the person who has to cope with the handicap of blindness.\nAdeline worked for more than 20 years for the National Production Center. During that time she\nassisted in a successful campaign to create a Belgian stamp honoring guide dogs, issued in November 1998. This was the first time in Belgium that the value of the stamp (17 + 4) was marked on the stamp in Braille.\nShe also worked on the team to evaluate the design for the new Euro currency, ensuring that coins and bills can be identified readily by blind people.\nIn the U.S., all bills are green and the same size. Blind people have to depend on the honesty of merchants making change, and fold and store the bills in different ways in order to tell a $20 bill from a $1 bill.\nIn the new Euro currency now in use in most European countries, each bill is a different color and size so that they can be easily identified. The\ncoins are also different sizes, and the edges are milled in distinctive ways to make them easier to identify by touch.\nOur thanks to Chris Hendrickx, Chairman of VHLFA Belgium, and to the Belgian Centre for Guide Dogs, Tongeren, Belgium, for their assistance in preparing this article. Belgium has two official languages: Flemish (which is very like Dutch) and French. Adeline and Chris live in the Flemish part of Belgium. Many Belgians speak multiple languages. Chris speaks Flemish, Dutch, German, French, and English.\nAs printed in the VHL Family Forum 11:5, December 2003.\u00a0 For permission to reprint, please contact VHL Family Alliance, editor@vhl.org .\n"}, {"score": 1112.9171, "uuid": "e1a5f9e5-36e8-584f-954f-59064bd1d19d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0008wb-59-11441", "target_hostname": "vhl.org", "target_uri": "http://vhl.org/newsletter/vhl2003/03eaadeline.php", "page_rank": 1.2139838e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "VHLFA: <em>Dogs</em> do More <em>than</em> Bark", "snippet": "Candidate puppies <em>are</em> then placed in homes where they <em>are</em> reared through puppy-hood.

She found it wonderfully freeing to work with a dog. The dog is trained to watch out for obstacles. Paving stones in the street, curbs, building sites, traffic lights, cars \u2014 all are obstacles to the blind person who ventures into the jungle of towns, armed only with a white cane. Thanks to the dog, all these traps became less threatening. Guided by her companion, Adeline quickly achieved greater mobility and autonomy in her daily life and recovered a great deal of security and confidence.\nIn Belgium, there are narrow streets, unrecognizable sidewalks, and strange traffic patterns. The dog made it much easier to navigate her way across the open squares of Antwerp. In areas where there are crowds of people shopping, and no cars to provide directional clues, the training and memory of the dog become extremely important.\nAdeline felt that Belgium needed its own guide dog school. She and her husband set out to raise money for a location, a trainer, and for the operation of a school in Belgium. They founded The Belgian Centre for Guide Dogs in Belgium in 1990 and still play an active role in the management of the Center.\nNot every dog can become a guide dog. Out of ten dogs tested, only six can become good guides. The process begins with careful breeding. Candidate puppies are then placed in homes where they are reared through puppy-hood. Experience has shown that a dog reared in a family with children is always a better, more sociable and more affectionate guide than a dog that has been raised in a cage or kennel.\nDuring this time the puppies come to \u201cpuppy school\u201d to learn basic commands, discipline, and socialization. They have to learn to circulate in the human world, undistracted by sounds, people, and other animals. They wear special a special jacket identifying them as a guide dogs in training. When they are returned to the Center at the approximate age of 12 months, they need to have essential qualities such as obedience, balance, quietness and self-possession. They then undergo a very demanding training course that lasts for 6 to 8 months. You cannot force the dogs to work; they have to start the training when they feel ready to \u201clearn the job\u201d. The trainer is there only to correct them and to help them develop their intelligence.\nThe initial training takes place at the Center on a set course where the dog learns to deal with a great number of obstacles which it will meet in real life \u2013 open manhole covers, construction detours, overhanging branches, and such. After that, it starts to work in quiet streets where it is immediately confronted with the realities of the outside world.\nAfter six to eight months of intensive training, the dog can be introduced to its future master. The new master comes to the Center for four weeks of residential training with the dog. The dog and its new master begin to venture into town together in order to become familiar with intensive traffic conditions and with the difficulties encountered in a big city.\nBut the dog is much more than simply a guide. It is also, and perhaps especially, an unrelenting friend, a gleam of tenderness, a comforting companion to the person who has to cope with the handicap of blindness.\nAdeline worked for more than 20 years for the National Production Center. During that time she\nassisted in a successful campaign to create a Belgian stamp honoring guide dogs, issued in November 1998. This was the first time in Belgium that the value of the stamp (17 + 4) was marked on the stamp in Braille.\nShe also worked on the team to evaluate the design for the new Euro currency, ensuring that coins and bills can be identified readily by blind people.\nIn the U.S., all bills are green and the same size. Blind people have to depend on the honesty of merchants making change, and fold and store the bills in different ways in order to tell a $20 bill from a $1 bill.\nIn the new Euro currency now in use in most European countries, each bill is a different color and size so that they can be easily identified. The\ncoins are also different sizes, and the edges are milled in distinctive ways to make them easier to identify by touch.\nOur thanks to Chris Hendrickx, Chairman of VHLFA Belgium, and to the Belgian Centre for Guide Dogs, Tongeren, Belgium, for their assistance in preparing this article. Belgium has two official languages: Flemish (which is very like Dutch) and French. Adeline and Chris live in the Flemish part of Belgium. Many Belgians speak multiple languages. Chris speaks Flemish, Dutch, German, French, and English.\nAs printed in the VHL Family Forum 11:5, December 2003.\u00a0 For permission to reprint, please contact VHL Family Alliance, editor@vhl.org .\n"}, {"score": 1110.9153, "uuid": "ea1cc0b7-2b49-5284-80e4-3226513ab029", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1115wb-19-14682", "target_hostname": "www.briankilgore.com", "target_uri": "http://www.briankilgore.com/dogs%20and%20humans%202009.htm", "page_rank": 1.2213774e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> and Their <em>Humans</em> 2009", "snippet": "There <em>are</em> similar assessments for outdoor portraits.

Places they think of as theirs.\nAndie the Dalmatian has three favorite places.\nShe loves Post Park in Oakville.\nA green blanket on the back deck at home, but only when the weather is nice.\nAnd the rolling hills made up of a pink sheet placed over half a dozen cushions, in her living room, where she stays \"on vigil\" when her humans are out.\nEnvironmental portraits show not only the dogs, but some of the area surrounding them. And the dogs may want people in the photographs with them.\nSome dogs have favorite indoor spots; places they may share with humans.\nEnvironmental portraits are quiet and relaxed. If the dogs were running, these would be action portraits.\nSeveral locations can be included in an environmental portrait session, and sessions may easily expand to include either, or both, formal portraits and action portraits.\nPlanning, packaging and pricing information\nThe Formal Portrait\nThe dogs are clearly the stars in the formal portrait, standing out from a background chosen to accent their looks and personalities.\nFormal portraits can be taken indoors or out.\nOutdoors, we have portable backgrounds, or we simply choose some elements of nature. ature provides many beautiful but simple backgrounds.\nIndoors, quality, professional, lighting\u00a0 equipment, or existing daylight patterns in a home, ensures a beautiful portrait, to the same standards appropriate to fine portraiture of other family members.\nPlanning, packaging and pricing information\nThe Action Portrait\nYour dogs, running, jumping, A fast dog can be beautiful, sleek and smooth, and a fast moving puppy can simply be hilarious.\nWe know and understand dogs, and work with them to show their beauty and strength, in action.\nSkill and experience matters, and equipment matters.

Six action shots to be individually framed and hung as a series on the den wall? A set of mix and match shots, with the dog and various family members individually and all together?\nFor indoor pictures, we look at the best locations in your home, paying attention to furniture placement, clear spaces, natural light at different times of day, and how, where and why we would add our own fashion-photo style flash units. We agree on whether we want our backgrounds, or show the dog's home.\nThere are similar assessments for outdoor portraits. In your yard, or elsewhere?. The time of day matters, because of the position of the sun. And, for action, bright sun always is better than a cloudy day.\nFor outdoor action pictures we meet at a safe location, where the dog can run without a leash and harness.\nIf people will be in the pictures, we discuss clothing, and even hairstyles and makeup.\nAnd, of course, we want to meet the dog.\nWhen photography day comes, depending on location, we set up lights, reflectors and other equipment, and chat with the people and the dog.\nThere's often two of us; the photographer and the dog wrangler with the treats, squeeky toys and soft voice that encourages the dog to pose.\nThere's a lot of rolling on the floor by dog and photographer, laughing by owner and wrangler, confusion and fun and clicks and flashes.\nMore often than not, there's one final lick of the photographer's face, and we're done.\nA few days later, the proofs are ready.\nPlanning, packages and prices\nPhotography's hard.\nDigital technology has revolutionized photography in the 21st century.\nCasual snapshots are easier than ever before -- an OK picture of a simple subject is easy for anyone.\nBut, once past the amateur snapshot level,\u00a0 the technology is extraordinarily advanced, and complicated. We understand it, we use it, and we even teach it.\nBut if modern digital photography, especially of dogs, is complicated and difficult, arranging for a picture of your pet, and perhaps some people close to your canine friend, should be simple. Two packages. Two prices. A few extras if you want them.\nPlanning the adventure\nWe meet with the dogs and their people to learn a bit about the personalities -- canine and human -- of those who will be photographed,\nFavorite places, preferred photography style, suggested props, and more, are discussed. We talk about clothes for the people -- and the few dogs who look good in a suit. Olive is very stylish in plaid, and Andie is very sporty in red\nPackages are very flexible.\nClients will receive for review between 15 and 30 proof images. There will be more proofs if all three portrait styles -- Formal, Environmental and Action --\u00a0 are captured.\nPrices\n$750 plus GST for a package\nBoth indoors and outdoors\n$875 plus GST for a package\nAdditional prints from frames ordered with the package, at the same time.\n5x7\u00a0 $3.50\n8x10 or 8 x 12\u00a0 $5\n11 x14 or 12 x 18\u00a0 $10\nSee \"The Fine Print\" below\nWhat's in a package?\nYour choice of some combination of different size prints. Typically, two or three large 11 x 14\u00a0 or 12 x 18 prints, half a dozen medium 8x10 or 8x12 prints, and up to a dozen 4x6 prints, from up to six different frames.\nThe fine print\nWe try to keep this to a minimum.\nDeposits and payment\nOne third upon booking, one third when photos are taken, one third when prints are delivered.\nProofs\nBrian A. Kilgore will normally choose between 15 and 30 photos from among those taken, and will have these printed to 4x6 for the client to select final prints from. If there are many set-ups -- indoors, outdoors, formal and informal -- the number of proofs will increase. Proofs will have minimal editing. Proofs remain the property of the photographer.\nPhotograph sizes and shapes\nPhotographs may be cropped differently depending on what's called the aspect ratio. A full-frame photo, for instance, enlarges to 8x12 inches, requiring some of the image to be cropped off for an 8x10 print.\nStandard print paper sizes are 4x6 inches, 5x7 inches, 8x10 inches, 8x12 inches, 11x14 inches, and 12 x18. Depending on cropping, images can extend to the page edges, or can \"float\" on the sheet. When ordering prints, please discuss your framing plans.\nLongevity\nOur prints are made on premium Fuji, Epson or other long life papers, designated by the manufacturers as providing more than four decades of future life. Because printing is not done by me, print life is not guaranteed by the photographer\nDigital print files\nFrames that are printed as part of the package are also provided to the client in high resolution digital form. See Copyright below.\nReproduction rights and copyright\nClients receive written agreement permitting them to order commercial reproduction of the specific images chosen for the package ordered. A DVD or CD or other digital form of these images is included in the package.\nThe photographer retains rights to use the images for self-promotion and editorial purposes. Any third party advertising or commercial use of the images by client or photographer will be discussed and agreed.\nAdditional prints\nAdditional prints of the images chosen for the package may be purchased by the client from independent labs, or ordered from the photographer. There is a $25 digital post-processing charge for each file that is not part of the original package but that requires computer processing prior to printing. Print charges for package and non-package prints are the same.\nOther issues\nThe fine print above seems to cover legal questions that arise from time to time in Canadian portraiture photography. Please call with any other questions.\nBrian A. Kilgore loves dogs and taking pictures\nBrian A. Kilgore -- that's me --\u00a0 has worked somewhere in the broadly-defined communications business since the summer after grade ten. Back then, while visiting my grandparents in Moncton, N.B., I visited every professional photographer in town, asking if there was any summer work I could do.\nAt the list studio on the list, in an old house just five minutes from my grandparents, I met Stan Comeau who hired me for the same money I could have made baby-sitting. Fifty cents an hour, and that was terrible money, even back then.\nBut the job was great, and Stan let me shoot daily newspaper pictures for The Moncton Times and The Moncton Transcript, and in French for L'Evangeline. I shot weddings, and commercial photos -- remember the Citroen Ds with the up and down suspension?\nMy high school spending money and much of my university expenses were covered by photography. I studied photography at Ryerson for a year, moving to York to become, supposedly, an economist. But really, after university, a newspaper photographer and reporter, a magazine production manager and editor, and then, for three and a half decades, a public relations practitioner and photographer.\nMy professional photos, of people, places and things have included prosciutto in Palo Alto and Bar-B-Q ducks in San Francisco's Chinatown; mustard in New York; a former speaker of the House of Commons photographed on the floor of the House; computers in Whitehorse; and on and on.\nContact Dogs and Their Humans\nWelcome to Dogs and their Humans, a site about dog photography by Brian Kilgore in the Toronto - Oakville - Burlington area.\nThe more time I spend with great dogs, the more I realize how important these pets are to their owners.\nThat's why I've expanded my photography business to include portraits, in several styles, of dogs, including dogs with their humans.\nThe Environmental Portrait\nA structured outdoor or indoor portrait of your dog, in a location that means something to your dog.\nThe Formal Portrait\nUsually indoors, with a simple or elaborate background, carefully lit.\nThe Action Portrait\nFor dogs who love to run and jump.\nAll styles include several packages of various sizes of prints. And humans are welcome in some or all of the photos you select.\nDetails soon. Learn lots more...\nHere are some of my favorite dog photographs\nThe Beagle is my friend Sparky. The white dog is Willow, who is deaf and likes to eat groceries\nright out of the bags as they arrive from the store. Andie, the Dalmatian, is my number one model,\nand she loves to run and tussle with other dogs.\nPallas, in the upper left, has passed on, but this portrait with her owner is a prized family\npossession. Willow, in the top picture, is now the family dog. Andie, with her owner in the\nmiddle photo, is not related to Pallas, even though they come from the same breeder and\nboth have the same black right ear. Beau, with the corkscrew tail, was Andie's first friend\nwhen she moved to the city from the farm where she was raised. And Barley, the biggest\nLab I've ever met, looks like a Sumo wrestler when she and Andie tussle.\nPlease call for information on the packages, and an appointment to see samples of the photographs. 416 879 5771\n"}, {"score": 1110.4967, "uuid": "1b7e1ba2-8669-5ffa-929d-2c5fb03aabed", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0003wb-05-08520", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.org", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.org/articles.html", "page_rank": 6.906192e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Articles&#x2F;Links: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>!", "snippet": "<em>Dogs</em> learn to be protective when they spend time with and <em>are</em> loved by their <em>human</em> family and <em>are</em> &quot;part of the pack.&quot; After having seen several <em>dogs</em> in the Marion area chained, it began to tug on her heart.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1108.8933, "uuid": "5e128c89-f6ca-5f20-afeb-06cc690d7c59", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0309wb-41-25263", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.org", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.org/vdaywrap2007.html", "page_rank": 1.1757493e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Valentines WrapUp 2007: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>!", "snippet": "A Day Without Chains&quot; goes to <em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> <em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Small Stickers, 3rd in the Series Featuring Doogie Latest News | Send a Letter | How to Rescue | Who has Laws?", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1110.4967, "uuid": "c050c1a5-76ce-5b0d-a72c-812e7cae3621", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0004wb-53-06344", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.com", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.com/articles.html", "page_rank": 5.134806e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Articles&#x2F;Links: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>!", "snippet": "<em>Dogs</em> learn to be protective when they spend time with and <em>are</em> loved by their <em>human</em> family and <em>are</em> &quot;part of the pack.&quot; After having seen several <em>dogs</em> in the Marion area chained, it began to tug on her heart.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1110.4143, "uuid": "6dddbd06-294d-5757-a19d-cefbc66b2edd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0608wb-69-23708", "target_hostname": "www.techhairball.com", "target_uri": "http://www.techhairball.com/hi-tech/nano-technology/3462-what-humans-can-do-to-help-hypoallergenic-dogs-human-beings-are-not-the-only-species-that-can-suffer-from-allergies-dogs-can-also-have-allergic-reactions-to-objects-in-the-home-chemicals-and-pollutants-in-the-air-dog-food-and-their-own-hair-and-dande", "page_rank": 1.1723891e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "What <em>Humans</em> Can Do to Help Hypoallergenic <em>Dogs</em> <em>Human</em> beings <em>are</em> not the", "snippet": "Home \\ Hi Tech \\ Nano Technology \\ What <em>Humans</em> Can Do to Help Hypoallergenic <em>Dogs</em> <em>Human</em> beings <em>are</em> not the only species that can suffer from allergies.", "explanation": null, "document": "Nano-Tech\nWhat Humans Can Do to Help Hypoallergenic Dogs Human beings are not the only species that can suffer from allergies. Dogs can also have allergic reactions to objects in the home, chemicals and pollutants in the air, dog food, and their own hair and dander. Finding the source of these allergies can be difficult especially if the dog is allergic to a few things. If you have a dog that suffers from allergies, you may notice that they sneeze when around harmful chemicals, vomit after eating, have skin rashes, patches of fur missing, runny nose and eyes, or they may show signs of fatigue or restlessness. Noticing these signs is the first step to helping your dog lead a normal, healthy life. You should monitor your dog for a month to see how it reacts to its environment, its food, and its own hair and dander. Since dogs need to keep themselves clean, they may be swallowing allergens that can cause an allergic reaction. The best way to combat a hair and dander allergy is to bathe your dog once a month and brushing the dog once a day. If your dog has a thick undercoating, it will trap allergens and dander and keep it from falling off the body. After a while the dander will build up and fall off or be swallowed. If you have allergies, this could be one of the causes. Brushing the undercoating every day will help remove excess hair before it is swallowed or falls on the floor or carpeting. This will reduce your allergy problems as well. Sometimes chemicals in dog food can lead to food allergies. If your dog vomits at least once a day, then they may be allergic to the food they are eating. Hypoallergenic dog food is available. The food contains fewer chemicals while providing your dog with enough nutrition. Try this dog food to see if it will reduce the vomiting. Wet dog food may also help your dog digest their foods easily. If the vomiting does not stop, you should visit the vet to see if your dog has other health problems. Dogs that are allergic to cleaning supplies, mold, and shampoo may be more difficult to treat. You can switch to natural cleaning supplies that do not contain bleach and other harmful chemicals. This may help your dog breathe a little better. You can also have your home tested for mold, which could be causing your own allergies, and you can switch dog shampoos and try one for hypoallergenic dogs. You should not wash your dog more than twice a month as you could make the dog\u2019s skin dry and flaky, which is why they are scratching and pulling more often than usual. Taking care of a dog with allergies is easy once you have identified the problem. Asking a vet for advice is a good idea if you do not know where to begin. They will be able to ask the right questions and help you find the answers so you will be able to administer the proper treatments.\n"}], [{"score": 1107.3091, "uuid": "2dc1bde9-9020-5c12-9e97-5811c393471e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-88-19887", "target_hostname": "www.catherineofsiena.net", "target_uri": "http://www.catherineofsiena.net/about/eugene.asp", "page_rank": 1.4284202e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Are</em> women <em>human</em> beings?", "snippet": "when a <em>dog</em> jumps up and barks on hearing its name, rather <em>than</em> ascribe it to intelligence?", "explanation": null, "document": "When women sin, they don't sin as human beings, but as other animals do.\nFather Eugene:\nSinning (1) is and remains sinning whoever sins. (2) You could as well say this about men that when they sin, they don't sin as human beings but as other animals, that is: they act as and put themselves in the position of non-intelligent animals which do not know God nor keep him before their eyes. I wish to God they would not often, with their beastly behaviour, outdo the wild animals themselves!\n[\u00a718. Women suffer pain at childbearing, like animals. ]\nBrother Andy:\nYou mentioned earlier, quoting the Apostle Paul, that the wife will be saved through childbearing, and from that you want to make women human beings, but you fail miserably. The reply is obvious, namely, animals too give birth with pain but that does not make them human beings.\nFather Eugene:\nOn this you must note: (1) Since this punishment during delivery was imposed by God on the first woman on account of the fall, something which is not said about animals without intelligence, women have drawn this pain on themselves. (2) Women should be considered human beings on account of their childbearing not because they give birth with pain, but rather because they give birth in a human way and they give birth to human beings. (3) If animals too at times give birth with pain, this cannot be compared with the pains of a woman who is a so much more noble and tender creature.\nOn the fear of woman\u0092s bodiliness, read Tina Beattie .\nBrother Andy:\nBefore we start on another argument, I would like to know - as it were by the way - whether your defence of women does not go against your religious Order, the praiseworthy Society [of Jesus], as it goes against my Order. For I have at times reflected: shouldn't we both, to safeguard our concience, be talking against women rather than in favour of them?\nFather Eugene:\n(1) We are talking here confidentially, so that we don't imply more than what we are actually talking about. (2) It is the custom among scholars to argue in favour of both parties in a debate. (3) Who could blame us for being concerned about women when the Lord Christ himself in Scripture often pays attention to them. Yes we should pay attention to them, especially in a philosophical discussion, since we ourselves as much as other people derive from them. We are men and only that.\n[\u00a720. The story of Popess Joan is spurious. ]\nBrother Andy:\nI agree, but what do you say about the slander by heretics that Pope John VIII was a woman? From that it would follow that women are human beings. But I don't accept it.\nFather Eugene:\nOh stop! Please, don't talk about it. By that [story] an indelible stain has been cast on us Catholics. Need we be surprised that even the Baptist historians have not ceased blabbering on about it? For me I find that Bellarmine, Baronius and others have provided sufficient contrary evidence, so why bother about those outsiders?\n[\u00a721. Sin is not reckoned to women because they are not human. ]\nBrother Andy:\nSo far our little discussion on the side. But is it not so that all the evil that women have done according to Scripture is praised in them, and all guilt is put on men, as on the human beings. The shameful incest of Lot\u0092s daughters is justified by their father, Rebecca deceives Isaac to get his blessing for Esau, Thamar is commended for her fornication, the whore Rahab betrays her own people and this is reckoned her to justice. Jael strangles Sisera and is called blessed for it. Finally, even Christ himself has not allowed the woman caught in adultery to be punished. These women have not been penalised for their crimes.\nFather Eugene:\nHold on, dear Andrew, or you'll keel over! For (1) it is wrong that in the Scriptures women are praised for the evil they have done. Also, it\u0092s wrong that all guilt is laid on the men. For even when some of the crimes committed by women have affected men, the women were not excused for whatever evil there was in them, rather they were held accountable as much as if they had been committed by men. For example, Lot\u0092s vice is squarely imputed to the man, that is him as father, because he allowed himself to get drunk and consciously let himself be seduced to incest, but the daughters are not excused for the fact that they so caused the old man to fall. Rebecca deceived Isaac, but not for some evil purpose but showing a praiseworthy prudence, through which divine providence was visibly at work. And what next? Was Thamar praised for her fornication? Not al all. Also, Rahab is applauded (Heb 11) not for having been a whore and traitor, but because of her faith and it was her faith that was reckoned her to justice. Jael is praised because of the heroic deed done to Sisera. Finally, Christ did not want to punish the woman caught in adultery and he would not justify other private persons to punish her. The reason was: it was neither his job nor theirs, but belonged to the secular authorities.\n[\u00a722. Women do not rise on the last day. ]\nBrother Andy:\nYou can say what you like, dear Eugene, I still can\u0092t accept that women are human beings. For if you find the previous argument weak, what do you think of this one? Women and their daughters are not human beings because they do not rise [on the last day]. Why, my friend, will we not marry at the resurrection? Precisely because there will be no women in heaven, since we will all be like God\u0092s angels. And what are the dear angels of God? They are certainly all men and not women!\nFather Eugene:\nYou lay the answer on my tongue! (1) At the resurrection we will not marry, reason - because we will be like God\u0092s angels. The Lord himself gives this reason and he teaches at the same time that this will not stand in the way of the resurrection of either men or women. (2) You are mixing up the condition of our life on earth with the condition of our life after the resurrection, as far as saved married people are concerned. For then neither men nor women will be interested in marrying or other things of the flesh, but they will altogether enjoy themselves in God\u0092s sight, worshipping and praising him. (3) It is ridiculous that you make angels men, that is, in your opinion, they are just ordinary human beings.\nBrother Andy:\nWill women rise? Where is it written? Yes, we read about the daughter of the headmaster (Mt 9) that the Lord Christ raised her up, but this was to earthly life. You must notice that the Lord himself says on that occasion: \"The girl is not dead. She is asleep.\" For if she had been dead, he would not have raised her. Since she was only asleep however, it wasn't strange that she could rise again.\nFather Eugene:\nYou are asking (1) whether it is written in Scripture that women will rise [on the last day]? How can Peter then say (1 Pet 3) that women (with the men) are heirs to the grace of life? They will inherit the grace of life together with the men. Well, then they will rise and not remain in death. (2) But that you, dear Andrew, explain the words of the Lord who calls the death of a girl a sleep in Matthew\u0092s gospel in this way that she had not really been dead, is almost blasphemous and does not become a religious person as you are. Think about it!\n[\u00a723. When a woman dies, she returns to nothingness. ]\nBrother Andy:\nExplain it to me as you like, dear Eugene, for I cannot understand how the Lord would otherwise have raised her up again. That is also what the servant of the headmaster means when he came to his boss and told him that his daughter had died. For he added: \"Why bother the Master any further?\" For he knew that, once a woman has died, it was useless to call on Christ\u0092s assistance.\nFather Eugene:\nPay attention. (1) Don\u0092t you remember at least this much from your being a Christian? The Lord raised her up through his omnipotent power. That was a easy for him as waking her up from sleep. (2) The witness of the servant unnerves your previous contention that the girl was not truly dead, but only asleep. (3) The ground why that servant did not want to bother the Lord any further seems more his politeness, but it arose from the fact that he considered the Lord only a human being. Don\u0092t you think so too?\nBrother Andy:\nI know in that case what to believe. Since we are both gut Roman Catholics, it will hopefully not too far that we also produce some relevant facts from our Church\u0092s legends. We read about the saintly Bishop Germanus that he miraculously raised up a donkey but nobody will conclude from that that the donkey will rise [to eternal life]. Therefore it does not follow from the fact that the little daughter was raised to life, that women will rise again [on the last day].\nFather Eugene:\nFor us Catholics, indeed, (1) that story is indisputable and no one should take exception to it. Unfortunately we experience that heretics do not behave like that, rather they burst out in derision. We should be aware of that. (2) Also, we should notice a dissimilarity between Christ and Germanius. For Germanius did not raise the donkey through his own power, as Christ raised the little girl. (3) When we say that the fact of the girl\u0092s raising by the Lord points to his raising all women at the last day, then we are speaking of an example of the true and final resurrection, namely that of intelligent creatures.\n[\u00a724. Women are illiterate. ]\nBrother Andy:\nWhen we start from the essentials of our Christian Catholic doctrine, who is so blind and brainless that he does not see and understand that women are surely not human beings. For women don\u0092t get involved in words and scriptures, but only in deeds.\nFather Eugene:\nNow you\u0092re really joking, Andrew! For in that case they are good Catholics, don\u0092t you think?\n[\u00a725. It means nothing that the risen Christ appeared first to women. ]\nBrother Andy:\nIt is an article of Christian faith in which women give themselves a lot of credit! In the same way, as far as I know, they appeal to the article of the resurrection of Christ, when they say: \"Are we not human beings since Christ after his glorious resurrection revealed himself first to women?\" To that we need to answer that, when Christ was born, he showed himself first to the ox and the ass, yet the ox and the ass were never human beings.\nFather Eugene:\nThe revelation of the Lord (1) only has meaning for intelligent creatures for whose good he came into the world. (2) It is unbecoming and laughable to say that the new born Saviour, a small child unable to speak, showed himself to the ox and ass. Being seen by an ox and an ass, and showing oneself to them are two different things.\n[\u00a726. Christ knew that women can't keep secrets. ]\nBrother Andy\nAs to laughing, that surely should not be at my expense, especially concerning women. You have overlooked something in your answer, Father Eugene: for you should have indicated the reason why Christ showed himself first to women. Since you did not do so, will I take the trouble to make up for it. It happened especially to ensure that his resurrection would be spread around and communicated as soon and as efficiently as possible. For whatever a woman knows, she passes on immediately not only to neighbours and close friends, but soon the whole community, yes the whole town hears of it.\nFather Eugene:\nThere are many reasons why Christ revealed himself first to women. (1) I myself consider the best reason that it happened because the women were the first to seek the Lord. The men, such as the apostles, had hidden themselves and barred themselves in. They did not have the courage to make such an early start as seeking the Lord on the third day after his prophecy and promise. (2) You ascribe it to the loquacity and feebleness of women. This would certainly have been useful to the Lord if he had lacked other means. (3) You must remember that these were saintly and devout women (whom we Catholics honor so much on that account). They announced the resurrection to the disciples not with noise and fuss, but with the highest devotion and modesty.\nPrejudices like this came from Roman Law , which was accepted later in secular and Church Law .\nBrother Andy:\nRight! They announced the resurrection. Just what I was going to point out. For it is commonly known that women are to be rejected as witnesses and to be counted as useless. Therefore the Lord did not use them as witnesses, but only for propaganda.\nFather Eugene:\nNot for propaganda, (1) that was the task of the Apostles in due course, but only to pass on the message to the disciples so that these could come and see things for themselves, or at least remember the Lord\u0092s promise. (2) But that women are not accepted as witnesses in secular courts, is not relevant here. There is good reason for it, but that does not reduce them to being less than human. The same was indicated earlier, namely why women cannot be appointed to public offices.\n[\u00a728. St Thomas was put off by the testimony of the women. ]\nBrother Andy:\nLook at Thomas, the doubter. Precisely for that reason he did not believe the other disciples and accept that the Lord was risen, because they had heard it only from women and not from men.\nFather Eugene:\nIt contradicts (1) the statement of the disciples who say: \"We have seen the Lord\" (Jn 20). They don\u0092t say: \"The women told us about him and his resurrection.\" (2) Yes, they had heard the same thing earlier from the women, but this time they had seen it for themselves, as they tell Thomas. (3) How can you blame the women, if Thomas did not believe them? It was due to his lack of faith and his distrust of other people.\n[\u00a729. The Apostles rejected the testimony of women. ]\nBrother Andy:\nHow did the Apostle then believe at first that the women were mad when these said that the Lord was risen? Well, it is such a strange and unusual event to hear something from women that is intelligent and true!\nFather Eugene:\nThe Apostles considered the words of the women fools\u0092 talk and monkey business (as Lk 24 shows), but who was to blame for this? The women and their message, or rather the Apostles themselves? For example, when heretics consider everything the Roman Catholic Church commands to be idolatry and us idolators, as their writings and speeches manifest, is that the fault of the Catholic Church, or their own fault? I believe it is their own fault. The same applies here. (2) Notice also that St. Peter (whose see has been inherited by our Father the Pope, as no one will deny) persuaded by their message, dressed and ran quickly to the tomb, and saw for himself that he was not there and risen. We can learn from this that if he had reckoned women foolish and feeble, he would have disregarded their message and omitted a good action. (3) It was mainly due to their lack of faith and fearfulness that the Apostles gave so little credence to the women. That is why, though they held the women otherwise to be trustworthy, they could not so easily agree to them in this case until they themselves had seen and experienced it. And what wonder is it that they did not believe the women, since they did not believe the Lord, their master and the truth itself when he had so often foretold and promised such a resurrection, yes, when he even showed himself to them after he had risen from the dead?\n[\u00a730. Women should not be baptised. ]\nBrother Andy:\nThe women have also no claim on the holy sacraments. If women [in the Old Testament] were not circumcised, they should also not be baptised, for baptism was instituted to replace circumcision. What has been done to them so far, has been purely to avoid upsetting them.\nFather Eugene:\nSuch a thing I have never heard a Catholic religious say, and I don\u0092t believe that even the Holy Father the Pope has such an unfriendly attitude to women as you have! The holy sacraments certainly are meant for women. For (1) just as in the Old Testament they were considered circumcised, through their men as mentioned earlier, so should also in the New Testament baptism not be denied to them. (2) That they themselves are baptised and in their own flesh in the New Testament we owe to a very wise dispensation of God who has a wider view in the New Testament which is not only directed at the Jews but also at the pagans. (3) Your opinion is also contradicted by the fact that in the whole of Christendom women are baptised as much as men, and this not only to avoid upsetting them, as you maintain, but necessarily and on account of God\u0092s command: \"Go and teach all nations and baptise them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.\"\n[\u00a731. Scripture reserves baptism to men. ]\nBrother Andy:\nBut what is the sentence that follows on it? It says: \"Qui baptizatus [= male form in Latin], i.e. the man who believes and is baptised\", and not \"qui fuerit baptizata [= female form in Latin], i.e. the woman who is baptised\". It also does not say: \"salva erit [= female form in Latin], i.e. she will be saved\", but \"salvus erit [= male form in Latin], i.e. he will be saved\". In this place you have to pay attention to the letters that are used.\nFather Eugene:\nI am almost ashamed to reply to that! I wish there was a schoolboy here who could speak for me! (1) As to the pronoun quis, \u0091who\u0092, it means as much as \"a human being whoever he or she may be\", that is: it refers to both genders. It applies without difference to both men and women. Since in Christ there is no longer man or woman, as we have already seen from the Apostle Paul. (2) As to the words baptizatus (baptised) and salvus (saved), these are formulated as masculine in the Latin language. But in the Greek language, as in our own mother tongue [German] this does not apply. (3) Therefore it is utterly ridiculous that you maintain we should pay attention to the letter here, and not to the example and the mind.\nFor the scriptural background, read Tunc and Maguire .\nBrother Andy:\nThe same is true with regard to the holy sacrifice of Mass or the sacrament of the altar, as some call it. Christ celebrated this with his disciples as with men and human beings. He did not allow women to approach the table. Otherwise he would have had to start washing the feet of the women, if he did not want to seem ill-mannered.\nFather Eugene:\nWhat are you saying now?! Andrew, you must have watched all the business of women since you bring out so many things about them. I thought I was the only one who was so interested in them, so that I could take care of them and protect them! Ha, ha, ha! For though the Lord Christ does not invite women to the table at the service of Holy Mass, even less washed their feet beforehand, he has all the more wanted to commend them to us, in order that we nourish them too [through holy communion], and not only the men, as has been the custom for many hundreds of years, and also sprinkle holy water on them, on their heads, and other limbs and also their feet. And why should the abbess not wash the feet of her nuns, and the abbott that of his monks?\nThe Gospels show just the opposite .\nBrother Andy:\nTo make a speedy end of it, my dear Eugene, what must I make of the word in Jn 2 which Christ speaks to his mother: \"Woman, what have I to do with you?\" If he does not want to have anything to do with his mother, how much less with other women.\nFather Eugene:\nIt is quite right, Andrew, that, as is becoming to a Catholic Christian, you ask your question about the worthy mother of God with more circumspection. For she may not be treated as just any ordinary woman. If Christ the Lord did not want to be told what to do, it was not to oppose his mother, but because it was not yet the time to perform a miracle (as he as omniscient Saviour alone knew). Even so he decided to help the young couple concerned and to please his mother.\nRead the scriptural background for this, and how women were considered unclean .\nBrother Andy:\nSt Paul also says that women should be veiled because they are impure. It follows from it that women cannot be saved because nothing impure can enter the Kingdom of God. And if they are not saved, I do not consider them human beings.\nFather Eugene:\nThe reason (1) why the Apostle tells women to be veiled is not really that they are impure, because it is a question here of public worship. He tells them to be veiled for the sake of good order, and to show their obedience, or as the text literally says, because of the angels, who, as Chrysostom explains, are their witnesses of obedience or disobedience. (2) That women are sometimes held to be impure, belongs to the many defects and weaknesses we have to put up with in life. (3) Such defects and shortcomings in women as happens to them in life, do not detract from their salvation, as little as their bearing children as we saw before.\n[\u00a735. To be perfect you have to give up contact with women. ]\nBrother Andy:\nChrist himself said: \"Who wants to be perfect should give up on woman\". That\u0092s why he took no wife, and that\u0092s why the holy Apostles got rid of their wives, and advised other men to do the same.\nFather Eugene:\nIt has to be understood conditionally that Christ tells those who want to be perfect to leave their wife; if, namely, the woman would oppose a man who wants to be perfect. Because he also says that one should equally leave one\u0092s parents (Mt 19 and elsewhere). (2) He did not marry himself because it contradicted his mission and his task in the world. (3) The fact that the Apostles left their wives and so wanted to set an example to others, should not be extended beyond the task they had to accomplish in this world and the context of their own time. We are speaking here about the ordinary life of people, not about the clergy in our own time.\nThis is what Thomas Aquinas taught , and was his main reason for excluding women from ordination.\nBrother Andy:\nI am keeping you too long, Father Eugene. Otherwise I could give you many more arguments by which I can prove that women are no human beings. It\u0092s no use that you contend that every creature gives birth to its own kind, and that is why women must be human beings because, as mentioned earlier, they do give birth to human beings. Also, it\u0092s no use that someone may be so bold as to tell a person to his face: \"What? Was your mother a pig or a dog?\" For then we can reply: \"My mother was a woman, and nothing more.\" And note, when a woman produces a daughter, she gives birth to the same kind, for she has given life to something equal to her a monstrum [= abnormality].\nFather Eugene:\nExperience shows (1) that every creature gives birth to a being according to its own kind. (2) Small wonder that women get impatient when they are taunted as not being human, and then become personal! (3) The giving birth is the same, whether the child is a son or a daughter, because she can only give birth as she conceived from the man.\nAbout this taboo, read Ranke-Heinemann .\nBrother Andy:\nThe giving birth may be the same, but the birth is not. For when, as mentioned, the birth is a girl, it is a monstrum, as the mother herself. And there is nothing new, as far as the sons are concerned, that women also give birth to human beings who are not of the same kind as they are. For from a horse or a mule, only a donkey is born, from horse shit (excuse the expression) beetles, from sweat lice, from dust fleas, and so on. From a philosphical point of view, one knows that a human being has a pure nature. But woman is poisoned. The experience is found in her monthly flow, how harmful it is. I need not say more about this.\nFather Eugene:\nMonstrum is in one word: erratum naturae propter materiae inconstantiam, that is: a defect in nature because of an irregularity of matter, as known from Aristotle. Well, be so cheeky to point out such an erratum, a defect in nature, in women as they are born every day in the unhindered course of nature? Sometimes also monstrosi partus (miscarriages) of female gender are born, but the same happens with those of male gender. (2) As to the unequal birth among cattle or insects, who does not notice that these do not at all fit the birth of women? (3) If a human being has a pure nature, from a philosophical point of view, so has woman. As stated in this connection, also her monthly cleansing.\nRead Sirach .\nBrother Andy:\nMy final summary: however poisonous an animal can be, a woman is more poisonous, yes more devilish and more malicious than the devil himself. That\u0092s why Sirach says: \"It is better to live among lions and dragons than with an evil woman\". Although one can find quite a few of them who politely hide their malice from people under conventional modesty, their inborn character and nature remains in secula seculorum [in all eternity]! For if one is good, a thousand will be against her. But if one is as keen as the others on venomous malice, then no letter or seal of a Lord will be of use, for women do not really want to leave the last word to anyone else. So they will not be able to refrain from asking another question. Namely, if they are no human beings, but beasts, to what animal should they be compared, so that they follow its example?\nEuripides gives them an answer to this. They resemble hyenas, that is they are like: corpse-eaters, gluttons and wolves. If the women desire to know for what reasons they are compared to this, then they should be told: this corpse-eater, glutton, wolf has the head of a cat, the stomach of a wolf, and the tail of a fox.\nFrom cats women have it in their nature to swallow, lick, stick near the stove, purr, prune, scratch and scrape, claw with sharp nails, hiss, spit, seethe, and show a venomous mood.\nFrom their wolf\u0092s stomach women have it in them never to be satisfied, the grabbing, embezzling, pilfering and robbing, growing lazy, greedy, harsh and bitter, having a big mouth and green eyes, being wild till pinned down.\nFrom the fox women draw every ploy, trick and deceit, the nestling in strange nests, the being no good except for the bladder, and that\u0092s why they can neither be cooked nor roasted. And just like the fox which is only useful when skinned, so quite a few women are only of use when they die.\nFather Eugene:\nYou are a Benedictine [= someone who blesses]. OK. Beware that you don\u0092t become for pious women a Maledictine [= someone who curses]. Use that kind of language only about evil women. I myself do not doubt, yes I agree, that evil women should be painted in such or similar colours and be exposed to the whole world.\nBut please, what we have discussed so far in great confidence and for the sake of the spirit, take with you in good trust. And, please, in the future leave out your teasing as if I love women - realise what you are saying! I have done my best to make clear what I find good or evil in this matter. See my right hand, and my trust. Goodbye!\nEnd of this discussion\n"}, {"score": 1101.5598, "uuid": "bcfdf3ed-fb4b-5b91-ba94-b7c2acc7e1d9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0807wb-05-03058", "target_hostname": "www.zombieworkout.com", "target_uri": "http://www.zombieworkout.com/2008/03/day-60-less-hum.html", "page_rank": 1.3883908e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "The Post-Apocalyptic Workout: Day 60: Less <em>Human</em> <em>Than</em> <em>Human</em>?", "snippet": "Posted on March 05, 2008 at 10:15 AM in My Post-Apocalyptic Diary | Permalink Listed below <em>are</em> links to weblogs that reference Day 60: Less <em>Human</em> <em>Than</em> <em>Human</em>?: I don&#x27;t know anything about it other <em>than</em> what I skimmed from the linked article.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Post-Apocalyptic Workout\nHuh?\nWhat use does a post-apocalyptic world have for a television writer who throws amazing cocktail parties?

So the results could have come\nfrom the extra calories, not the protein. This new study adds credence\nto that outlook. When the carbohydrate drink contained as many calories\nas the whey-protein drink, it produced the same performance result.\nConclusion: \"Increasing the energy content of these recovery solutions\nextended run time to exhaustion, irrespective of whether the additional\nenergy originated from sucrose or whey protein isolate.\" Source:\nJournal Of Sports Science. More\nRunners Underestimate Their Fluid Needs, Should Drink More\nThis\nstudy, conducted by the folks at Gatorade, measured how much fluid a\ngroup of runners would consume during a 10-mile run at 69 degrees F.\nEvery 2 miles the runners had an opportunity to drink as much Gatorade\nas they wanted. After the run, they were asked to estimate their total\nsweat losses. From pre- and post-run weigh-ins, the researchers\ndetermined that the runners lost 1.9 percent of their body weight\ndespite the opportunity to drink freely. The runners consumed only only\n30 percent as much fluids as the sweat they lost, and they\nunderestimated their sweating by 42 percent. Conclusion: \"Runners\nshould not depend on self-assessment to maintain adequate hydration,\nwhich underscores the need for runners to enhance their ability to\nself-assess sweat losses, and suggests that a predetermined regimen of\nfluid ingestion might be necessary if they wish to maintain more\noptimal hydration.\" However, there was no report of a performance or a\nmedical outcome; ie, the study apparently didn't measure running speed\nor body temperature of the runners. So we don't know if anything\n\"happened\" to the runners as a result of the 1.9 percent dehydration.\nSource: International Journal Of Sports Nutrition And Exercise\nBecome A Nutrition-Research Subject, Drink Free Red Wine, Get Healthier\nSome\npeople get all the breaks. In this study, 40 subjects were given 400ml\nof free red wine every day for 2 weeks in one part of the experiment.\nIn another, they abstained from all alcohol for 2 weeks. The\nresearchers measured the antioxidant status of their blood during the\nred wine and no alcohol weeks. Result: Red wine \"significantly\nincreases antioxidant status and decreases oxidative stress in the\ncirculation.\" But what we really want to know: Where can we sign up for\nthe next study?

But\nthe authors are claiming that our hair follicles are capable of\nboosting red-blood-cell production through the EPO (erythropoietin)\nsystem. Traditionally, EPO has been thought to be manufactured only by\nthe kidneys. Prescription EPO is a legal, medical drug used to treat\nsevere anemia, but an illegal drug in sports. \"The ultimate hope is\nthat we'll be able to up the production of natural EPO in our hair\nfollicles whenever we need it, safely and at a low cost,\" says Ralf\nPaus, senior author of the study.

I like that idea, but why do you say dogs are smarter?\n-- Alan, Lawton, Okla.\nA: A lot of people were irritated by my statement, Alan. One wiseguy wrote to say that no dog could have solved Fermat's Last Theorem. That may be true, but it took humans 358 years to solve it and then they got it wrong and had to re-do it.\nDogs are smarter in the following ways:\n1. If an apocalyptic event occurs, your dog is more likely to survive than you are.\n2. Dogs don't watch TV.\n3. Dogs live in the present. There is only one instant and it is right now.\n4. A dog evaluates his own health. If he is short on minerals, he just eats some grass or a bush that contains what he needs.\n5. Dogs can smell, hear and read body language better than any human.\n6. Dogs are always positive.\n7. Dogs do not care how many bars there are on a cell phone.\n8. Dogs know when an earthquake is coming.\n9. Dogs tell time without buying a watch.\n10. Dogs are not existentialists. Camus said, \"I do not want to die, and I do not want anyone I know to die, but I am going to die and everyone I know is going to die, so, therefore, life is absurd.\" A dog says, \" ... so therefore, let's all have a good time every minute.\"\nDear Old Trainer: Will you please explain again how to teach the \"hold\" command to my collie, Sam?\n-- Ann, Merced\nA: While walking Sam, say \"hold\" and pull the leash just hard enough to make him stop. If he stops for even an instant, praise and pet him, then tell him \"go.\" Repeat the process every 20 feet for 10 repetitions. Walk half a mile, then do another 10.\nIncorporate the 20 reps in your daily walk and a smart dog like Sam will learn to stop the instant you give the order. Remember, pet and praise Sam each time he stops and keep him in \"hold\" until you give the order to proceed. This is a vital command because it may save his life. Work on it every day, even after he masters it.\nIn a short time you will be able to control Sam on or off the leash, no matter how far away he is when you give the command.\nPuppy Bowl alert! -- Are you ready for some puppies?

The words of your conversation partner are drowned out by the conversation of others and the music. We have to concentrate on the voice of the person we are talking to and separate the relevant sounds from the background noise. Our attention system is therefore highly stressed. This is known as \u201cthe cocktail party phenomenon\u201d.\nGerman researchers have found that men hear better at parties and are more capable of separating relevant sounds from the background noise.\nNatural selection and evolution\nThe researchers from the Neurological Clinic of the University Hospital and the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research (HIH) in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, found that the audio-spatial abilities of men are more highly developed than those of women. The researchers think that men\u2019s ability to hear better at parties may be due to the different evolutionary requirements of the sexes. Over time men have developed these spatial abilities as a result of natural and sexual selection throughout human evolution.\n\u201cMen were the ones who hunted for food. Here, attention performance was extremely important. Thus prey could be localised by noise before it could be seen,\u201d said Ida Z\u00fcndorf and Prof. Hans Otto Karnath from the University Hospital in T\u00fcbingen.\nThe study\nIn the study, the participants were asked to listen to sounds and determine the location of the sound source. In a first test, sounds were presented one at a time and both women and men accomplished the task with great accuracy. In a further test, several sounds were presented at the same time and the participants had to focus on and localise only one sound. The latter was much more difficult for women. In some cases women even thought that the sounds were coming from the opposite direction.\n"}, {"score": 1093.8245, "uuid": "10eff339-6203-55d0-9ba1-535e924b4f4c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0308wb-37-05700", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.org", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.org/vdaywrap2008.html", "page_rank": 1.1918301e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Valentines WrapUp 2008: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>!", "snippet": "A Day Without Chains&quot; goes to <em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> Latest News | Send a Letter | How to Rescue | Who has Laws?", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1084.0985, "uuid": "59eabb2b-caa4-5d05-a1ea-2f382d7c9476", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0307wb-04-10321", "target_hostname": "dogsdeservebetter.org", "target_uri": "http://dogsdeservebetter.org/dogsshouldnotbechained.html", "page_rank": 1.1752909e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> : Fighting for the Bullies: No Chained <em>Dogs</em>", "snippet": "Please remember that <em>Dogs</em> Deserve <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> life on a chain or in a pen and Parents Against <em>Dog</em> Chaining: Protect Our Children...

They are termed soulish because God has endowed each of them with a mind, a will, and the capacity to express and experience emotions. These animals are equipped and motivated to emotionally bond with and to nurture, serve, and please other members of their species and human beings. Moreover, these nephesh species were evidently endowed with this capacity before any human even existed, a characteristic that appears problematic for evolutionary or naturalistic scenarios.\nRecently, a British team of research psychologists has published a paper announcing the discovery of a new bonding feature between humans and nephesh creatures. Their study demonstrates for the first time that human yawns are contagious to domestic dogs. For their experiment they tested twenty-nine dogs from twenty-four different breeds spanning ages two to fifteen .1 Twenty-one of the dogs yawned when they observed a human do so.\nSome dog breeds were better at catching human yawns than others. For example, the Labrador breeds, known to form especially strong bonds with humans, seemed especially adept.\nSuch behavior indicates that dogs possess the capacity for empathy towards humans. However, the yawning response may reveal more. In human-human interactions contagious yawning is known to modulate levels of arousal. Thus, in the words of the researchers, \u201cyawn contagion [between humans and dogs] may help coordinate dog-human interaction and communication.\u201d\nThe study provides yet one more piece of scientific evidence that birds and mammals really were pre-designed before humans even existed to form emotional relationships with human beings in such a manner that they could enhance humanity\u2019s well being. These animals serve and please us. More amazing still, each soulish species appears designed to serve and/or please us in a manner distinct from all others.\nM.

A dog can have more dads. The eggs come down around the 12 day after she starts her period. Then if she breeds to woody on wednesday and then again to mike on wednesday and maybe mike on thursday also. Then she can have 2 daddys. if woodys sperm doesnt get all eggs then mike can get some. www.dogbreedinginfo.com . try looking at that site.
