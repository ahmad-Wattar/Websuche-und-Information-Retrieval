It was hard to find for a while when the new bottle design came out and many local stores discontinued them. I'm glad I could find it online. This product has fortified my hair and I tend to change my hairstyle very often with minimal to no damage thanks to the extra strength and nutrients the Leave in Nourishing Conditioner has helped my hair. My hair is long and wavy/curly and I'm able to blow dry and straiten if I want to as well. I use about a little bit than a quarter size after towel drying and it helps me and my daughter have more ease with detangling as well. It's a must have and I truly recommend it! My mother and sister have used it for years as well and they are happy with it too.\nPros:\nSoftens, Detangles, Helps with curl or straightening hair, Moisturizes and revitalizes hair even after harsh hair treatments\nCons:\nNot all stores carry this product.

But it sure looks like pee, doesn\u2019t it? (That stuff in the bottle on the left, by the way, is baking soda and water, which refuse to interact with one another unless shaken vigorously). Anyway, this is besides the point. The point is: After one failed attempt last year to wash my hair with nothing but vinegar, I decided to give the whole natural approach to hair maintenance another shot.\nReader Melinda over at One Green Generation convinced me that her homemade system would leave my hair shiny and clean without also leaving me with an I\u2019ve-just-spent-all-day-at-a-fish-and-chip-shop smell.\nNeedless to say, I was skeptical. However, as part of my new semi-regular series From the Pantry to the Bathroom , I want to make more of an effort to try new things \u2014 more specifically, new homemade things.\nSo I took a few minutes this morning to assemble the recipe, then followed her directions, which go like this:\n1. Use an old shampoo bottle (well-rinsed) or a squeeze bottle. Mix 1 part aluminum-free baking soda to 3 parts water. Each time you use this solution, shake well to mix.\n2. Squeeze the baking soda solution onto your dry scalp, then massage your scalp for several seconds.\n3. Leave in for 1-3 minutes, and rinse completely.\n4. In an old shampoo bottle (well-rinsed) or a squeeze bottle, mix 1 part organic white vinegar to 4 parts water. You can add essential oils or herbs if you like \u2013 I add 1 cinnamon stick and 1/2 tsp vanilla. This masks the vinegar smell, and leaves your hair smelling spicy and lovely.\n5. Leave on hair for several seconds, then rinse.\nI must say, it\u2019s a bit awkward trying to pour watery liquid onto your head without having it run everywhere. The reason regular shampoos and conditioners tend to come in gel-like consistencies is so that you can squeeze a dollop on your noggin, put it down, then gradually work it into a lather until it disperses evenly. But with these mixtures, you tend to get a lot in one place and very little in others.\nAt least they both felt nice on my scalp, and there weren\u2019t any major problems in terms of rinsing them out in the shower.\nHowever, I do have long hair, so it felt like I required a LOT of this stuff. At least it was cheap.\nBlow-drying my hair, I sensed it was taking longer than usual and got the occasional whiff of vinegar (this might be my fault, though \u2014 Melinda suggests using white vinegar, and I chose to stick with apple cider because I thought it smelled less offensive\u2026 maybe my olfactory senses are messed up). Still, I persevered, then brushed it out.\nThe result? Well, see for yourself:\nNot too shabby, eh? (This is my bedroom, by the way \u2014 I was trying to get some natural light on it.) So far, it doesn\u2019t smell at all, which is a good thing, although it\u2019s not necessarily softer or shinier than it usually is. I think the real test will be how long it lasts \u2014 if it\u2019s greasy by tomorrow morning, I\u2019m definitely docking points.\nOverall, I\u2019m kind of semi-pleased with this Pantry to the Bathroom experiment. It\u2019s obviously a better option than using chemical-heavy brand-name shampoos and conditioners, but considering I already use all-natural stuff and make a point of refilling it from the bulk store, I don\u2019t know that this is really reducing my carbon footprint by that much.\nWhat do you guys think?

On one hand, women\u2019s bodies have more fat, where toxins accumulate, so women are four times more likely to exhibit symptoms of chemical sensitivity than men.\nWomen and Cancer: Toxic Products\nWomen\u2019s lifestyles also put them in frequent contact with toxins, in the following ways:\nCosmetics.\nHair products.\nNail products.\nParenting. (We drive our children on freeways, wait behind idling cars to pick them up after school, and sit for hours on playing fields treated with pesticides and herbicides.)\nDry cleaning.\nShopping.\nHousehold cleaning products.\nJobs. (We work in \u201cpink collar\u201d jobs, such as retail, nail care, and housecleaning, all of which expose us to the toxins described above, as well as office jobs, where we encounter printers and toners.)\nToxins are a major contributing factor to the chronic death of your brain neurons. And since cells in the nervous system can\u2019t regenerate like other cells, we have to protect our neurons by avoiding exposure. Toxins can affect your mental abilities (memory, thinking, concentration, language, attention, and reaction time), physical problems (creating sleep issues, fatigue, headache, sexual dysfunction, developmental delays, and numb hands and feet), emotional issues (including depression, confusion, personality changes), behavior (contributing to irrational, criminal, or violent behavior), and illnesses (including movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, and chemical sensitivity).\nWhat is a Toxin? Skincare & Beauty Products\nAbout half of the personal care products available to us have at least one chemical linked to either reproductive problems or cancer, says the Environmental Working Group (EWG) Look up your brand of personal products at EWG\u2019s Skin Deep website .\nIn cosmetics: Watch for parabens (ethylparaben, propylparaben, and methylparaben ) which have been linked to breast tumors in women and, to a lesser extent, affect the blood-brain barrier and contribute to neurotoxicity (killing or disrupting neurons).\nIn nail polish: Look out for phthalates, a plastic softener and solvent. Health advocates say that this chemical is also associated with potential reproductive problems, IQ issues in children, and possible nerve toxicity. But, companies aren\u2019t always required to list them product labels.\nIn sunscreen: Oxybenzone, an active ingredient in many sunscreen products, has been linked to biological or cellular changes to the skin, which could lead to heart disease, as well as possibly being toxic to the brain, and nervous and organ systems. It is also toxic to wildlife and the environment. Many sunscreens also contain parabens.\nIn hair products: You apply their hazardous toxins, often a combination of oxybenzone and fragrance, close to your brain. Many fragrance chemicals are related to neurotoxicity, allergies, and immunotoxicity.\nFragrances \u2014 included in moisturizer, shampoo, hair color and bleach, conditioner, body wash, facial moisturizer, styling gel, facial cleanser, and anti-aging skin-care products \u2014 can contain neurotoxins and are among the top five allergens ever. EWG has suggestions for safe cosmetics.\nWhat is a Toxin? Cleaning Supplies\nWomen handle and inhale more poisonous cleaning products than men. They\u2019re exposed to dishwashing rinse agents that release chlorine and quarternium 15 (a chemical that releases formaldehyde); bleaches in counter cleaners and mildew remover; and other items that have ammonia, ethers, phosphates, and ethoxylated nonyl phenols.\nCheck out natural cleaning products. But you may want to look for which products actually clean the best by checking out reviews and Consumer Reports before you experiment yourself.\nWhat is a Toxin? Clothes and Textiles\nNew clothes and fabrics typically treated with formaldehyde-based resins include rayon, blended cotton, corduroy, wrinkle-resistant 100% cotton, and synthetic-blended polymer fabrics. Be sure to wash clothes before wearing them, and wash new bedding, towels, and pillows before using them. And wash your hands after shopping.\nWhat is a Toxin? Plastics, Including Athletic Shoes\nStinky plastics are from PVC (polyvinyl chloride), also known as vinyl, made with chlorine, heavy metals, and other toxic plasticizers. Making and incinerating vinyl produces dioxin, a potent carcinogen.\nBeware of out-gassing, which occurs when the volatile toxic chemicals in a plastic evaporate out of the material into the air. If a plastic stinks when you open the package, air it outside. Or better yet, use other types of plastic instead.\nFor more on how to avoid harmful plastics, check out Cancer Schmancer\u2019s plastic dos and don\u2019ts .\nPhthalates are known as endocrine disruptors because they mimic the body\u2019s hormones and have, in laboratory animal tests, been shown to cause reproductive and neurological damage. (California banned the use of phthalates in toys and baby products as of 2009.) Phthalates are in things like car dashboards, steering wheels, and gearshifts and are what give cars that new-car smell. They make fragrances linger longer, help lotions spread, and help keep color in makeup. You\u2019ll find them in lipstick, hairspray, deodorants, aftershave lotions, nail polish, and nail-polish remover.\nWhat can you do to avoid phthalates? Avoid things that have \u201cfragrance\u201d listed in their ingredients lists. Also use plastics with the recycling code 1, 2, or 5, rather than codes 3 and 7, which contain phthalates. Check the Pollution in People\u2019s website and its page \u201c Reading Labels to Avoid Phthalates \u201d for more details.\nWhat Are Toxins? There\u2019s More?\nYou can find these toxins all over: pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals such as lead and mercury, car exhaust, Perc from dry-cleaning solvents, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in electronic equipment, mold in your house, flame retardants (PDBEs, or polybrominated diphenylethers, in children\u2019s pajamas, foam, and television and computer casings), ammonia, carbonless copy paper, printer toner, carbon monoxide, chlorine, formaldehyde, gasoline, glue and adhesives, nicotine, paint, paint remover, radiation, chemotherapy drugs, and wood preservatives.\nBut don\u2019t give up hope. The best way to avoid toxins involves three steps: (1) Decide what you\u2019re going to do to be a less toxic lady with a less toxic home, (2) do it, then (3) relax; too much stress is toxic too. However, you can manage your stress level. When you get panicked about all the possible dangers lurking in every possible nook and cranny, just stop, take a breath, and let your brain rebalance itself. The brain can handle all of life\u2019s threats much better when you\u2019re relaxed.\nThis article was excerpted with permission from the book:\nBrain Fitness for Women: Keeping Your Head Clear & Your Mind Sharp at Any Age\nby Sondra Kornblatt.\nReprinted with permission of Conari Press, and imprint of Red Wheel/Weiser LLC. \u00a92012 by Sondra Kornblatt.

This is an effective yet gentle method, suitable for young children or babies with cradle cap, too.\nDeodorant \u2013 You can use coconut oil by itself as a deodorant that leaves underarms feeling silky soft, or you can add baking soda and cornstarch for advanced odor protection.\nDetoxification \u2013 There are many methods for detoxifying the body, but coconut oil is unique because it can provide energy while cleansing the body. One popular method is to take 1-2 tablespoon of coconut oil seven times per day for one to seven days to cleanse the body from toxins, impurities and candida.\nFungal Infections \u2013 Coconut oil contains strong antifungal agents, and can be used to treat fungal infections like athlete\u2019s foot, ringworm, thrush and vaginal yeast infections. You can use it internally and topically for these conditions.\nHair Conditioner \u2013 Apply a thin layer of coconut oil to your scalp and hair. Allow it to soak for several minutes and then wash as usual. There is no need to use other conditioners with this method, even after washing with shampoo.\nLip Balm \u2013 Lip moisturizers are filled with chemicals , and natural products are often pricey. If you need a moisturizer for your lips, try coconut oil in a commercial lip balm container.\nMake-up Remover \u2013 Coconut oil is a very effective make-up remover, so you can toss out all the chemical-laden products from the drug store. It\u2019s also a natural moisturizer, so it won\u2019t cause dryness or irritation.\nSkin Conditions \u2013 Since coconut oil is moisturizing, antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory, it\u2019s a great natural remedy for all kinds of skin problems ranging from eczema to acne to diaper rash.\nSun screen \u2013 Coconut oil provides effective and natural sun protection without exposing your body to the toxic chemicals and metals in conventional sun block. Coconut oil protects against free radicals, which provides added protection against skin cancer.\nToothpaste \u2013 Mix an equal amount of coconut oil and baking soda for an all-natural, fluoride-free toothpaste . Add spearmint or peppermint oil with stevia for a fresh, sweet flavor.\nAs you can see, there is more to coconut oil that what meets the eye \u2013 or the frying pan!\nCoconut Oil Hair, Skin and Scalp Treatment\nPopular beauty blogger \u201canneorshine\u201d posted this article \u201c Natural Remedy for Dry Skin and Itchy Scalp \u201d about coconut oil with a related video on YouTube below. The beauty experts are more and more discovering and talking about the benefits of coconut oil for healthy and beautiful hair and skin.\nOur skin is the largest organ and it acts as a protective shield on our body. However it also absorbed products that we put on it. There are many skin products out there in stores. Some beauty labels says \u201cnatural\u201d, some says \u201canti-aging\u201d. It sure sounds tempting to buy them all but do we really want to pollute our own body?\n"}, {"score": 1080.3379, "uuid": "08334de7-0985-568b-962d-e45f6de2d027", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1000tw-16-05378", "target_hostname": "www.saferisbetter.com", "target_uri": "http://www.saferisbetter.com/kdm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Safer <em>Is</em> <em>Better</em>", "snippet": "<em>What</em> are the main health challenges that concern you?

As I was rinsing it I could tell it wasn't coming out, and I was right. It left my hair greasy looking and flat, but it did help the frizz a lot which I liked, but not what I wanted still. When I try it again I won't use as much or leave it on as long, maybe 1-3 minutes. I guess to deep condition you're supposed to leave it on 10-15 minutes then shampoo, instead of what I did. Maybe I will try that too.\nThis product is a God send!! My daughter has mixed reac hair which is very curly and beautiful but without proper care it can get dry and unmanageable.

I will use these products forever!\nI love this conditioner!! Smells great! It makes my hair so shiney/smooth. I alternate it with GPB conditioner only because I love them both and I can't decide which one I love more :-) Since I switched to Aubrey Organics shampoos and conditioners my hair stylist said to me: \"what have you been doing, your hair is so much healthier and stronger since I last saw you...and your lowlights look like I just did them, the color hasn't hardly even faded\" I was so excited to tell her the only thing I had changed was to switch to Aubrey Organics products! It has made such a difference. I will use them forever!\nA well kept secret! Why? I've been wondering why there aren't more reviews on this product. Seriously. I decided to stop being lazy and to write my own review because I believe people should know how great this conditioner is. (Call it a public service.) Bottom line: This product works like a very expensive smoothing cream! (And I ought to know because I've tried many!) It really smooths your hair. I relax my hair and my teenage daughter has natural \"kinky\" hair - but it works for both of us. NO MORE FRIZZIES! Tip: it also works well as a leave-in smoothing cream on wet or dry hair. It makes your hair shiny and sleek. I can't live without this conditioner.\nI already posted my review about the Camomile shampoo but I also wanted to post it here. Especially since there are so few reviews yet of this fabulous conditioner! I have fine, wavy hair with a tendency to be a bit frizzy and dry. Almost a year ago I started using natural shampoos and conditioners. I had to get used to the fact that they didn\u00b4t lather so much but they were alright. My hair looked alright. A few months ago, however, I discovered the Aubrey shampoos en conditioners and I could really tell the difference. All Aubrey shampoos en conditioners made my hair more beautiful but the Camomile Volumizing Shampoo en Conditioner are my favourite! The shampoo lathers gently and has a lovely, soft camomile scent. The conditioner has the same lovely scentis It is light ,yet makes my hair very soft without being heavy. My hair shines so much more and it actually has more body. Also, my hair feels very soft, which it never did before. My hairdresser recommends to alternate between shampoos, because it is good for your hair. I alternate with the Honeysuckle Rose shampoo and conditioner which I also love and this works great! I know Aubrey recommends to alternate with the Blue Camomile shampoo and conditioner, but I prefer the Honeysuckle Rose set. This works better for my hair! I love these products. I didn\u00b4t know haircare products could make such a difference!\nI bought this for my daughters before it was even listed on the website - (I called Aubrey and found out about it). So I thought I'd be the first to write a review about it. They've been using it for a while now and I cannot believe the difference it has made in their hair! They use it in conjunction with the Camomile Luxurious Volumizing Shampoo. I really started noticing the difference on our walks together out in the sunshine. They have brown hair and these products have really brought out the gold and copper highlights. But not only is it in the sun that I see this added shine. It's quite obvious indoors as well. They have \"normal\" hair and their hair was already in great shape to begin with, especially since they don't use any heated styling tools on their hair - just wash, condition, comb out and go. But the Camomile products took already healthy hair up another notch with incredible shine, natural highlights and lots of body. Doesn't weigh the hair down in the least.

This facial moisturizer contains a potent micro-radiance complex\u00e2\u00e2\u0080\u009e\u00a2 that diminishes the look of discoloration for translucent, healthy-looking skin. It also contains SPF 15 to help protect from UVA/UVB damage and future hyperpigmentation. Usage: Apply evenly before sun exposure and as needed. For children under six months of age, consult a doctor. Ingredients: Contains four different sunscreens - Avobenzone Ensulizole Ostisalate Octocrylene In addition, Skin Deep, a cosmetic safety database, scores DDF products as being very low for health hazards or toxicity. Appearance: White cream with a light consistency. Scent: Light soft floral scent History: DDF -- Doctor's Dermatologic Formula -- was founded by Dr. Howard Sobel, a dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon, and his sister, a nutritional expert. In 1994, HDS formed a relationship with a leading biochemist and began exploring cell physiology. At the same time, Dr. Sobel co-authored the first of numerous articles on the benefits of growth factors, proteins, and peptides, which are buzz words in the current beauty industry. DDF focuses on anti-aging conditions -- preventative and restorative. Results and Comments: I used DDF Protect and Correct in lieu of my regular anti-aging moisturizer for three weeks. Before applying makeup, I evenly applied the cream to my face, neck, and hands. With ingredients including four sunscreens and a SPF of 15, I felt confident that my skin was adequately protected from the sun. I have stubborn brown spots, so unfortunately, DDF Protect and Correct didn't correct my hyperpigmentation issue. As a reformed sun worshiper who had baby oil and iodine down to a science, I earned many brown badges. I did notice some brightening of my skin with use of this product, which contains a patented micro-radiance complex. In order to assess more accurately, I eliminated Bobbi Brown Tinted Eye Brightener which I add to my tinted moisturizer to brighten my face. With the additional production of melanin as a result of aging, my goal is to prevent any further skin damage by protecting my skin with sunscreen, and with DDF Protect and Correct containing four different sunscreens and being low in toxicity, I would recommend this for women looking for preventative care in their skincare regimen. Compared to similar anti-aging moisturizers on the market, $58 is an average price. \u2014\u00a03 years, 5 months ago\nThis review is: Helpful | Not helpful | Inappropriate |\u00a0\u00a00 of 0 people said helpful\n8\ntismoi (2 reviews)\nI totally agree with you on this product.

But when it comes to what lies beneath, his philosophy is clear: Skin should shine through makeup. To that end, NARS Cosmetics went about creating a tinted moisturizer unlike any other \u2014 a complexion-perfecting fluid with anti-aging and skin-brightening benefits.\nIntroducing Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer SPF30/PA+++.\nInfused with naturally derived ingredients that instantly hydrate and even skin tone, Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer SPF30/PA+++ has been shown to reduce the appearance of discoloration and dark spots with regular use for a clearer and brighter complexion. The luxurious, oil-free formula obscures the appearance of lines, wrinkles, pores and other imperfections while providing a translucent veil of broadspectrum sun protection.\nThe buildable formula can be used as an alternative to foundation \u2014 on weekends, when a more casual look is desired, or in summer, when a lighter consistency is preferred \u2014 or in combination with Powder Foundation for those who want more coverage and added hydration. As a\nresult, skin is soft and smooth to the touch. It looks natural and glowing. Almost bare, but better.\nThe key to its effectiveness lies in ingredients derived from the waters of Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 beloved French Polynesia, where he spends much of his time on his island in the region. These ingredients include Kopara, natural polysaccharides that hydrate, condition and help encourage natural cell renewal; Oceana Saffron, a plant known for its antioxidant and soothing properties; and Galaxaura, a red deep-sea algae found in the islands\u2019 lagoons that is known to be rich in\ncalcium, vitamins A and E, and beta-carotene. Also included in the formula: sea water and Ascorbyl Glucoside, a vitamin-C derivative that brightens and protects the skin against free-radical damage, to revitalize and re-mineralize the skin.\nPure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30/PA+++ boasts a 100% naturally derived fragrance of Peony, Violet and Rose Water. And because sun protection is essential to maintaining the health and youthful appearance of the skin, it includes SPF 30 to protect against UVB rays, and PA+++,\u00a0the highest index level of protection against UVA damage.

I started using Jessicurl products back in Oct. and my hair is so much healthier. Too Shea is great as a rinse out conditioner, it has great slip for detangling my mid back length hair. I originally used it as a leave in conditioner too, but as my hair quality improved, I no longer need a LIC. I use it as a rinse out after shampooing with Hair Cleansing Cream or for co-washing. I use tried the Lavender Citrus scent and it has a light scent that disappears after my hair is dry. I ran out out of this conditioner once before I had time to reorder. I used sulfate free R*dkin products from my hair product stash and my hair was out of control again until I had my Jessicurl order again. I also use Rockin' Ringlets and Confident Coils.

I always leave it on for a few minutes, rinse it out, and then use two or three more pumps as a leave in. It makes my hair so soft and shiny and frizz free!

Would definitely recommend!\nmaryferg\nType 3b\nDec 03, 2011\nI really love this conditioner. I use it every time I wash my hair. I have very thick, somewhat course, 3b curls and my hair just drinks this stuff up. Not only was my hair softer and shinier beginning with the first use but my hair has gotten healthier after several months of been using it. My hairdresser noticed the effects on my hair and when I told her it was Jessicurl Too Shea she investigated the line and now uses it in her salon! I get the liter bottle and use a fair amount, at least 1/2 dollar size. I also tried it as a leave in but that didn't really work for me.\ncgmb84\nvia CurlMart\nDec 02, 2011\nadding to my comment below- it has horrible slip so it was hard to detangle my hair. A lot of my hair came out since the conditioner wasn't slippery at all. It was as if I was detangling only using water. Matter of fact, the water helped more than the conditioner.\ncgmb84\nvia CurlMart\nDec 02, 2011\nI'm a 3b. I bought this along with their cleansing cream. Definitely will not buy this again. Some reviews say its watery...its not. The cleansing cream is watery not this conditioner. It made my hair heavy and greasy feeling which made it look frizzy. I think this conditioner is too heavy for 3b's. The shea butter does not penetrate our type of curls it just weighs it down and makes it greasy. Not happy about the results at all specially since all the other reviews seem great.\ngardenerwithcurls\nvia CurlMart\nNov 11, 2011\nWow! Makes my hair feel like silk!

Performed differently too. Much better. It was my HG for regular conditioner and leave in. I used up what I had and reordered and it wasn't the same. Thought something was wrong with it and got another jar and it was still not the same as before. So it works fine, but not my HG anymore. It doesn't work with any other leave in as well as it does with itself as a leave in (for me). Which is fine. Seems to be ok with any styling product used over it tho.

I just wish the smell wasn't so.... herbal.\n001nikki\nType 3b\nFeb 24, 2011\nAfter much hesitation, I bought this product. For me, a person who has too many products to try another one, and not a cheap one, its hard. This product made my curl flat and straw like. Its listed in this search engine as a low protein conditioner. I thought it might be low enough to be ok, But it made my hair straw-like, bunch together and come out in the comb. It has Hydrolyzed oat protein. It also doesn't go very far. However, I have very porous hair and it is also very fine and medium curly. It is also thinning and I am assuming its from other protein conditioners which are causing it to break. I have gone back to Giovanni deep conditioner cause I think its the best value, and it gives silkiness. And EWG gives it a low rating for toxicity (and I cant say that for many products on this site, especially Suave and stuff) go to COSMETIC SAFETY DATABASE to check out your products and / or ingredients.\nSFNanny\nType 3b\nFeb 24, 2011\nI use this on the ends of my hair daily, and the aloeba on the scalp area.

And I've tried many in my 3 year journey to be naturally curly. It is light enough to let my head breath but heavy enough to keep my curls feeling pampered. I refreshen it daily with a spritz bottle of organic aloe vera juice. Too Shea is my \"go to\" as a leave in.\nemartini04\nA great leave in conditioner. Leaves your hair super soft and moisturized!!!\ngecko\nType 3a\nDec 16, 2010\nMy favorite conditioner! I thought it would weigh down my curls or leave them a little stringy because it is so moisturizing - but, for me, not at all. In my side to side test as a rinse-out on dry-season hair, JCTS left my hair more glossy, less frizzy, more ringlets than waves, and with the same amount of volume as Curl Junkie Curl Rehab. I am so glad it comes in unscented (didn't try scented) - don't have to worry about whether or not I'll like it or if it will make my eyes burn. Unscented does smell a bit like Italian seasoning.\nKelliekellikelly\nType 3a\nDec 13, 2010\nI thought the jar would be bigger, but I really like the herbal smell and they way it rinses out. I never know when I have used enough product because it doesn't offer that conditioner slimy texture feel that Im used to so I just try not to over do it since i condition every day\nchmcurly\nType 2b\nNov 16, 2010\nNice conditioner that doesn't seem to weigh down my fine 2a/2b hair. I would not consider this a deep conditioner, though - better for co-wash use every few days. Wish it was in a bottle - not thick enough to make the jar necessary and it is a pain to use while showering. I like this as a regular co-wash conditioner and the Aloeba as a leave-in (Aloeba is not thick and moisturizing enough as a rinse out conditioner). The citrus lavendar scent is divine - and I like that I can choose that scent for all the Jessicurl products.\nCurlieTop\nType 3a\nSep 10, 2010\nVery moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling very soft. However it is a lot less creamy than most conditioners of this type, and it's not the very best conditioner I've ever used in regards to improved long-term manageability and giving me healthy appearing hair. 4 stars!\nAysha\nType 3c\nSep 07, 2010\nBEST conditioner I've used on my hair - and I've used a lot: natural and not. I don't even need to use a comb when I use this conditioner. It detangles so well that my fingers work just fine. It leaves hair silky and soft without feeling weighted down. I use it as a co-wash and a leave-in. The ONLY reason it gets 4 stars is the packaging. I agree with jacydance. The tub lends itself to waste and water gets in it. It's not really thick enough to work well in a tub and I'm often tempted to put it in a bottle.\njacydance\nType 3b\nAug 28, 2010\nThis product itself was so-so, my hair was indifferent to it. It didn't moisturize that well but it didn't damage either. The worst part however, is the packaging. Tubs like this are made for think, almost solid like liquids. the conditioner is thin, watery, and sloshes around in the packaging. I dropped it after putting on the side of the shower, and lost around $5 of the it. The packaging knocks it down a star.\nMs_Honesty\nType 3c\nAug 08, 2010\nWonderful daily conditioner that not only softens but silks your hair and as time the hair becomes healthy. Doesn't weigh down the hair and is my favorite daily conditioner. Also, great for co-washing which is what I do to keep my curls gorgeous. xoxo Ms_Honesty\nMobettacurls\nType 3a\nJul 08, 2010\nFinally found a moisturizing conditioner for my fine, medium thickness hair that is colored and highlighted. It doesn't weigh down my curls, doesn't build up, and I don't require an after wash moisturizer, either. I sometimes use Aloeba on the top and Too Shea on the bottom half of my shoulder-length mane, depending on how long it has been since a deep conditioning.\njamieaugie\nType 3a\nJun 24, 2010\nI like this conditioner better than any other I've tried. My hair is fine but thick and a bit on the dry side, so this seems to be the perfect daily conditioner for me. It's very moisturizing and I think it's terrific that you can get it without any fragrance (I've tried other products that have a similar effect but couldn't stand to continue using them because of their smells). The only down side is that this comes in a jar rather than a bottle, but I can deal with that because this stuff is a steal--it moisturizes so much better than other expensive conditioners.\nsweetpeacurli\nMay 05, 2010\nThe only product in my arsenal that I've relied on consistently for years. Always leaves my curls shiny, moisturized, bouncy, and frizz-free. A lot in the shower, a little as a leave-in, and my curls are as happy as they can be.\neatyourveggies\nType 2c\nMay 01, 2010\nThis product was okay - but nothing especially exciting. It really did help moisturize my hair, but I've gotten the same results from cheaper conditioners. Likewise, I got absolutely no frizz control from it. But the island fantasy scent was at least nice.\ncurlscurlsaustin2010\nType 2c\nApr 24, 2010\nLove the fact the it contains shea and other natural ingredients! My hair doesn't feel dry after I styled it!\natx_eve\nType 4b\nApr 20, 2010\nrocks my socks! the smell reminded me of aubrey organics honey suckle rose (which i hate) but i gave it a try anyway. GLAD I DID! it's so thick and creamy, provides good slip, and doesn't take the moisture with it when i rinse it out! my hair softer after using (which is what ANY conditioner is supposed to do) i heeeeard that that beautifulbrwnbabydoll (spelling?) on YouTube loves this stuff. SO DO I!\nsmasters467\nType 3a\nMar 02, 2010\nThis is one of my absolute favorite conditioners, it's great for daily use and deep treatments. I love it!!!!\nbubbaloo\nJan 31, 2010\nI have fine, wavy hair, but lots of it. It is not naturally dry at all, and my scalp tends to be more toward the oily side. Too Shea simply didn't do anything good for me at all. It has no deeper moisturizing abilities, and it ended up coating the hair shaft each time I used it and built up badly. Since I use shampoo only about every 3 or 4 days and the other days I do the no-poo method, the days that I didn't use shampoo the Too Shea would just keep building up on top of the previous day's application, and the shampoo didn't clean it away on days I shampooed. I actually had to use either an apple cider vinegar rinse or baking soda each time I wanted to get all the Too Shea cleaned off. Frustrating! This product caused my hair to just look blah without good curl formation at all. Did not have the ability to deeply moisturize, either (I tried it also as a weekly deep conditioner, and my hair felt no different than if I had just briefly conditioned with it after shampooing. I couldn't wait to use this product up and have it gone and finished so I could move to something better and definitely more moisturizing! Avalon Organics Olive & Grape Seed Moisturizing Conditioner, Fragrance Free, is just what my hair needs for excellent lighter daily conditioning without being greasy or weighing it down! By the way, I've used all the Jessicurl products in the unscented versions, and even though each has its own very light natural smell from the ingredients in it, I do appreciate the opportunity to be able to purchase products without strong scent!\njpinilla\nType 3a\nJan 13, 2010\nThis is the perfect conditioner for my 2c/3a curls. Like all other Jessicurl products, I don't need much so I really get a lot of life out of this conditioner (and my hair is long, shoulder blade-length), and even add water with it sometimes if my hair isn't particularly dry. I'm not sure about the other comment about the scent leaving, it's been two days since I washed my hair and it still smells like Island Fantasy goodness. Maybe that's because I use all Jessicurl products from shampoo to styling. Love it.\ngypsygreen\nType 3b\nDec 27, 2009\nThis is a GREAT deep conditioner, as long as you rinse it out completely. Too greasy to leave in. I'm giving it 3 curls because the faint lavender smell (what I was hoping for) fades within minutes, leaving behind only a heavy, greasy, jerry-curl smell. Blegh. At this level of price and performance, I would expect the smell to be more luxurious.\nmabbott09\nType 3a\nDec 13, 2009\nWow I think I'm in love! This is my new favorite conditioner. I have very dry color treated 3/a hair. I've noticed some other curlies with my hair type didn't get good results with this because it was too heavy. I guess it depends on the person. My hair seems to drink it up! Its soo moisturizing for my curls. It creates great slip and has good detangling ability too. I just ordered a full liter of it from Jessicurl.com . I recommend this product to all color treated curlies. I know it really has helped my hair I wont ever be without this conditioner again.\nMissCurlGirl\nType 3a\nNov 21, 2009\nGreat conditioner! Not to heavy for my hair so it didn't weigh it down. My hair was fuller than usual after using this product! I also used a little dab as a leave in.\nAntje\nType 2c\nOct 05, 2009\nThis is an awsome product. I think it is the best of the range. My hair is soft and shiny and I use it every time I wash my hair.\nthefossilchick\nType 2b\nJul 10, 2009\nI adore the conditioner, but the amount I have to use on my long hair to actually get it moisturized makes using this daily not cost effective. I use it as a deep conditioning treatment instead.\nirishalanna\nType 3a\nJun 22, 2009\nAs some other reviewers said, this conditioner is just not heavy enough for me. It washed out almost immediately after I put it in, so I ended up having to repply before I got out of the shower. And even then my hair didn't feel super moisturized, and I had to use a ton of it. This wasn't the product for me, I guess.\ncurlykinkynfrizzy?\nType 4a\nMay 22, 2009\nJust didn't live up to the hype for me. And I wasn't too fond of the scent either. This product has stellar ingredients though, so I would recommend it to other curlies. :)\nAmandaCurl27\nType 3b\nApr 20, 2009\nI love this conditioner. I have type 3B curls and this conditioner makes them so soft and ridiculously manageable. I use it everyday and the jessicurl weekly deep conditioning treatment once a week.\ncurleychurley\nType 4a\nApr 20, 2009\nI tell you, I'm not sure how to begin. It started out well, I used the weekly deep treatment a day ago and it was FANTASTIC! So I decided to use the TOO Shea tonight to maintain moisture! Quite contrary to my expectations... ha! My hair is terribly dry. When I applied it in the wet shower it was soft and lovely and then I towel dried with a t-shirt- and my hair seemed to have shrunk almost immediately and become really tight and dry...drrrryyyy! Wow! Wot a Shocker! Hehe...never again! You know I think too Shea isn't Shea enough, not for my hair at least. I'll use it to experiment maybe I'll add in some more Shea butter. It might be better then :) I still Love the Weekly treatment which has become more of a daily conditioner for me- I hope no terrible effects will be as a result- it\u2019s just nuffin\u2019 leaves my hair as soft after use. Wish me luck and good luck to you. Cheers, thanks.\ncurlyburg\nType 2c\nApr 20, 2009\nThis used to be the best conditioner: thick, rich, and moisturizing. Now it makes my hair stringy, dry, and frizzy. I swear they changed the formula because it doesn't even look the same. Now whenever I use it, I feel like it actually damages my hair. I've been a faithful Jessicurl customer since becoming a curly girl 4 years ago, but no more Jessicurl for me.\ncurlsgirlbrazil\nType 3b\nJan 29, 2009\nA wonderful deep conditioner..my hair so soft,shine and smells it's so great(citrus lavander) and the best is not tested in animals and doesn't have mineral oil or silicons\nlaurabeth33\nType 2b\nDec 29, 2008\nThis is the one conditioner I can count on to make everything better after all the product testing I do.

I started using this conditioner because it was all-natural and specifically made for brittle hair. When I first poured it into my hand, I was thrilled that it was extremely thick and creamy: I wouldn't need an entire handful to adequately moisturize my hair. I also loved the scent. Since I started using it, my hair has been smooth and soft, and hasn't been flat or greasy, even if I go a day without washing my hair. I am hoping that using it regularly will keep my hair from getting to that brittle stage at all but I'll have to wait until I've had a haircut and have a \"clean slate\" of healthy hair ends.\n"}, {"score": 948.53906, "uuid": "cf9b27e7-1da5-542f-a4c0-cfe9e638776a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0918wb-56-26093", "target_hostname": "www.aubrey-organics.com", "target_uri": "http://www.aubrey-organics.com/ProductInfo/084.aspx", "page_rank": 1.2090207e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Blue Camomile Hydrating <em>Conditioner</em> 11oz.", "snippet": "I can use half as much as <em>a</em> regular drug store brand (which <em>is</em> great because Aubrey&#x27;s costs about 3x as much), and it works even <em>better</em>.

I've been looking for a natural shampoo/conditioner combo that actually works, but I have tried many with no avail. They usually don't condition very well, which needs to work for me. When I first tried this conditioner, it almost made me cry. I love it so much, I can't believe how well it works. I can use half as much as a regular drug store brand (which is great because Aubrey's costs about 3x as much), and it works even better. Thank you, Aubrey. You have really outdone yourself with this conditioner. I like the perfume too. Also, people have been talking about the smells of these products, but I really really like it. It's very natural, forest-y, almost. Happy washing! :)\nMy hair is fine/thin and very frizzy/flyaway in the warmer months. My fine, naturally blond hair is also prone to breakage even tho I never use heat styling tools on it. I also have somewhat oily hair and im always hesitant to use any type of \"hydrating\" hair product due to the fact that i might end up looking like a greasy mess after one day. This conditioner is amazing! it smells great and I only have to put a small amount on my hair and my fingers glide right through. after it air dries I have hardly any frizzies and it does not weigh my hair down at all. My hair also tangles so much throughout the day and I always have to brush out tangles....which leads to more breakage and frizzies...this conditioner leaves my hair tangle free all day long. I can always run my fingers thru it!\nthis product is so good\nMy hair is thin and frizzy. This is the best conditioner because it changes the frizz to soft waves. My hair still looks good at the end of the day and I really love the soft fragrance. If the Blue Camomile is unavailable try Swimmer's conditioner which also contains Horsetail Extract and Coltsfoot Extract. It too has an elegant soft fragrance. The shampoo I love to use is Primrose and Lavender....\nmy college roommate swears by aubrey products, and on her advice i started using them. i started with the Island Naturals line, which softened my stripped hair but started weighing it down after a few uses. i consulted the hair matrix and bought the Blue Chamomile line (and the Chamomile Luxurious shampoo for good measure), and the difference is fantastic! every single time i wash my hair i notice how soft and healthy it is, and my red hair is so shiny now that people literally stop and ask what shampoo i use. This is definitely the healthiest my hair has ever been. Thank You Aubrey!!!!\nI called Aubrey and asked about what would be good for my graying hair (which can be coarse and wiry without the right products), plus my oily scalp, combined with the dry desert environment in which I live. The Blue Camomile Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner were the products that were recommended. Not only for the obvious hydrating benefits, without weighing the hair down, but also because of the natural blue camomile color, which counteracts the yellowing that can occur in white (\"gray\") hair. I am so pleased with the results. Before finding Aubrey, I was trying to find an all-natural bluing shampoo. Well, it\u2019s not advertised as such, but I found my natural bluing shampoo! I'm also planning on giving the Swimmer's Normalizing Shampoo and Conditioner a try since they are recommended for gray hair as well. But the Blue Camomile products are working great! Lots of softness and shine, which is incredibly important to my naturally graying hair. It makes the white streaks in my dark hair look like highlights - like I went to a salon and meant to do this to my hair! And it takes care of my oily scalp wonderfully! Plus, I love the smell! I take long deep breaths in through my nose while washing and conditioning my hair just so I can take the most advantage of the wonderful, natural scent. It really relaxes me. (The Blue Camomile Hydrating Shampoo lathers up great too, in spite of no synthetic foaming agents and such.) The Blue Camomile Hydrating Conditioner leaves my freshly cleaned hair so soft and manageable. I\u2019m still in \"experiment mode\" with the Aubrey products since it\u2019s only been a month or so since I found them, but I am seeing great results and get more and more excited about this new find. Count me in as another life-long customer! I see no need to look any further. I\u2019ve found everything that\u2019s important to me -regarding personal care products- in Aubrey. Thank you for being there for those of us who refuse to go along with our chemically-ladened, synthetic society!\n"}, {"score": 950.3341, "uuid": "eaf29f77-19b3-50eb-9314-f056460377fb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-56-13612", "target_hostname": "www.lushusa.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lushusa.com/American-Cream-Conditioner/9999902017,en_US,pd.html", "page_rank": 1.446451e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "American Cream <em>Conditioner</em> - Lush", "snippet": "<em>Conditioner</em> <em>is</em> supposed to put back the moisture that the shampoo removed; it doesn&#x27;t make sense to put sulfates in ANY <em>conditioner</em>.

Like Veganese, the consitancy is light almost like regular conditioner that you mix a little bit of water with. It glides on to your hair and you can literally feel it untangling the ends. If you're like me and you wake up with a tangled mess, this is for you! The smell lingers on for hours, but it's not so strong that you'd get a headache. I'm usually not a \"sweet\" smelling kind of girl, but this is just the right amount of sweetness. What I like most about Lush products is that all the ingredients are just nourishing and I can feel like it's working. When I used ordinary shampoo and conditioner, my tub will be filled with fallen hair - I noticed that I lose only a couple of strands when I started using Lush.\nI guess the only complaint that I have is that it's quite pricey.. but a little does go a long way.\nAlso be very careful of the expiration date.\nVS\nMost Liked Negative Review\nSmells great...\nIt's hard enough to find a shampoo without sulfates.

But why put it in conditioner? Conditioner is supposed to put back the moisture that the shampoo removed; it doesn't make sense to put sulfates in ANY conditioner. And while I see sulfates in a number of traditionally marketed shampoos, I have never seen sulfates in conditioners. What gives? If Lush is looking for an emulsifier, as the shop staff explained to me, then why not use something more gentle, like honey? Honey is a great emulsifier. Sure, it costs more, but isn't getting quality products the reason why we buy Lush in the first place?\nReviewed by 237 customers\n"}, {"score": 939.2852, "uuid": "1ee770bb-44d0-5b7e-9f62-44327e217650", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0811wb-54-10411", "target_hostname": "www.pantene.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pantene.com/en-US/hair-care-products/product/Moisture-Renewal-Conditioner.aspx?UPC=080878042302", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Conditioner</em>", "snippet": "Although this <em>is</em> not <em>a</em> leave-in-<em>conditioner</em>, it works well as <em>a</em> great <em>conditioner</em>, moisterizer, and leave in <em>conditioner</em> for my hair and <em>is</em> also great for styling.

When I took another trip, I went looking for a travel size shaving cream instead of lugging my big can of Barbasol. I found your product. This time I did use it and fell in love with it. What a difference! While there was no address on the shaving cream tube, the Action Moisturizer that was also given out had your address. I found you on the internet and went on your website and just ordered 3 tubes of the stuff (your nearest merchant is 2 hours away). I love your product so much that I'm indulging myself.

It works really well on my usually dry hair made drier by swimming 5 days a week. Also it starts a very long time. The 11oz bottle has lasted me over three months. I also love the swimmers' shampoo and all my other Aubrey Organics products. Keep up the good work! Jin\nI use this conditioner (and the swimmer's shampoo!) religiously after swimming. It's organic, nourishing, AND safe for color-treated hair ... what more could you ask for? I don't fear the chlorine any longer!\nI heard about your products on NaturallyCurly.com and I'm so glad I bought them. I bought this conditioner along with both the Moisturizing Jelly and B-5 Design Gel. My curls are happy. My frizz is almost nonexistent and I'm completely excited about your products. I will be trading in all my Arbonne products (which I thought were good for me until I look at the ingredients) for yours. The price is way better and they just work. Thank you for making such great products.\nMy sister and I both have long, wavy thick hair that we blow dry, iron straight and sometimes dye. When we began water aerobics together I knew our hair couldn't stand much more so I did an internet search for swimmers shampoos and conditioners. Frankly I didn't expect the Aubry Organics shampoo and conditioner to work very well so I ordered liters of another swimmers shampoo. Boy was I wrong; the shampoo has tons of suds that instantly neutralize the chlorine and the conditioner can't properly be described! I can rarely run my fingers through my wet hair in the shower, much less after I have just been swimming, but with this conditioner it's like silk and there are no tangles. The smell is amazing too! I wish I hadn't spent my money on the 2 liters of other product now!\nMy usual supplier of Aubrey Organics products had failed to stock the Island Naturals Creme Rinse (which is what I had been using for some years now)-- And so fortunately enough, I happened upon the Swimmer's Conditioner. This is now my favorite amongst Aubrey's conditioners. Even though I avoid chlorinated water upon my hair at all costs, this is still the product for me! It leaves the hair unbelievably replenished, volumized, and just-- well-- luxurious! It literally smells divine enough to be considered as a dessert to the hair, as well! And in some ways, it is!\nI love using this conditioner as a deep conditioner. After experimenting with many Aubrey conditioners, I found this is one of my favorites. It smell good too.

LLLOOOVEE ITTT!!!!!!!!!!\nIt took me a while to figure out the best way to use this conditioner. The first time I tried it, I attempted to use it like a \"normal\" conditioner - after washing my hair, I applied about a half-dollar sized amount (for my mid-back length hair) and tried to smooth it through to the ends. Something was wrong - it didn't slip through like other products I was used to. Instead my hair seemed to soak it up like a sponge & I kept applying more and more conditioner to try to get all my hair coated. Then I rinsed and rinsed - and yes, rinsed some more - but it didn't seem to come out. I was left with incredibly greasy hair that just hung limply all day. I had to wash my hair twice the next day to get it all out. Undaunted, I tried to use it instead as a night-time moisturizing treatment, rubbing a small dime-sized amount between my hands & smoothing through my dry hair about mid-length through to the ends. This worked better - I didn't need to use much & my hair felt softer, although I still had to shampoo in the morning to keep it from looking greasy & feeling a little tacky. Next I tried mixing about a quarter sized dollup of conditioner with 2 cups of warm water in a plastic squeeze bottle and squirted this on my wet hair after shampooing. This seemed to work well - it was easier to distribute it through my hair when it was diluted and it rinsed out much easier. My hair was soft & didn't look greasy when it dried. Finally, I stumbled upon the perfect application method for me - after washing my hair, I gently squeeze out the excess water with a towel, run a wide-tooth comb through to detangle, then apply my regular styling gel & scrunch my hair (it's naturally curly). Next I section my hair into two sections - right & left side - and take about a half-dime sized amount of conditioner in my hands & add a tiny bit of warm water to dilute a bit. This I scrunch into my wet hair, beginning at the ends & working up about a third of the way towards my head. I repeat this on the opposite side. PERFECTION! The conditioner seems to help with my hair's natural curl formation & dries without any being greasy at all. My hair looks & feels great - very shiny & baby soft. I LOVE IT! The best part is that I don't need to use much at all to have my hair look great so I can make a bottle last a very long time! I will definitely buy again! :-)\namazing.... this makes your hair silky soft and i only used it once!!!!!! i have curly hair and after two days of not shampooing my curls are still in tact and not frizzy! will use this forever and always!!!!!!\n"}, {"score": 879.84015, "uuid": "e3456975-7e49-5cb2-97aa-e29914f4e5c3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0917wb-70-23068", "target_hostname": "usa.loccitane.com", "target_uri": "http://usa.loccitane.com/FO/mini-pure-shea-butter.htm", "page_rank": 1.2183204e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Shea Butter <em>Moisturizer</em> | Shop L&#x27;Occitane Beauty Products", "snippet": "And it&#x27;s <em>a</em> natural for lips and any dry areas.

I tried every prescription drug. I would get his skin under control & a week later dry itchy patches would form again. He loves the water & would cry when we had to limit his water time. Apparently, moisture makes dry patches worse. A friend told me about L'Occitane organic shea butter and it has made my son's dry skin dissapear. I use it religiously every day. Our quality of life is wonderful. We are no longer sleepless in Seattle.\nCaroline N\nCustomer since: 2008\n7/24/2008\nI have always had dry cracked skin and have tried different products with little success, even one recommended by a dermatologist. The day I decided to walk into a L'Occitane boutique and give shea butter a try, has been the best thing I have done for my skin. It moisturizes, heals and softens the skin. There is nothing like it. I don't go a day without it, or the rich shea body cream. Every holiday I know what I want for my present.\nPatricia T\nCustomer since: 2007\n7/22/2008\nI guess I'm one of many who keep one of these nearby at all times. It's great for dry cuticles, lips -- any body part that needs moisturizing. I like the lack of fragrance. This is a spectacular product - I have a big tin at home and little ones 'for the road.'\nLisa N\nCustomer since: 2006\n7/22/2008\nMy daughter was born with eczema. It was so unbearable for us to see her scratching and in constant discomfort. The doctors prescribed medicine with a strong chemical base that I didn't want on my baby's skin. I tried everything to make her comfortable. While shopping, I experienced a wonderful aroma coming from the L'OCCITANE store. Once inside, I explained my daughter's skin condition. The salesperson suggested I try pure shea butter. It worked! L'Occitane is our everyday product!\nSharon S\nCustomer since: 2010\n7/21/2008\nThis is my favorite L'Occitane product. I've had chronically dry feet for many years. Once I discovered the 100% Shea Butter and started applying it nightly the problem was solved.\nTina V\nCustomer since: 2007\n7/21/2008\nI have used L\u2019Occitane since the early 1990\u2019s when I worked as a flight attendant regularly traveling to France. My hands were always dry from the lack of moisture in the cabin and every cream I tried only irritated them, so I tried the 100% shea butter. It was, and is, the only hand product that soothes my dry, cracked hands. Even though I no longer fly the friendly skies, I still use shea buter every day.\nJulie M\n"}, {"score": 875.91425, "uuid": "0b41bf1f-91f3-5592-b700-b820e251973d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1105wb-92-20102", "target_hostname": "www.greatcakessoapworks.com", "target_uri": "http://www.greatcakessoapworks.com/handmade-soap-blog/index.php/tag/making-hair-conditioner/", "page_rank": 1.2032679e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Making Hair <em>Conditioner</em> | Great Cakes Soapworks", "snippet": "So I asked my soapmaking friend April if it\u2019s supposed to have an odor, and she responded, \u201cYes and it <em>is</em> not <em>a</em> good one!\u201d That made me feel <em>a</em> bit <em>better</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "6\nWelcome! If you don't want to miss anything, you may want to subscribe to my RSS feed or get updates via email - sign up in the right sidebar. Thanks for visiting!\nI LOVE the hair conditioner that I made last week! Even though it\u2019s runny and I have to spray it on my hair\u2026 The main thing I\u2019ve noticed is that I am losing less hair every time I wash it. Less hair comes out when I comb it after washing, and there are fewer hairs coming out when I apply mousse. Not a dramatic difference \u2013 I probably used to lose 20-30 hairs every time I washed it (not sure how you would really count them), and now I\u2019m estimating 10-15. I don\u2019t know why it works that way, but it\u2019s enough to be noticeable from using it for less than a week.\nIf you missed my post a couple days ago about how I made the first batch of hair conditioner, you will want to refer to it here \u2013 because I made another batch of hair conditioner yesterday which turned out much better, and I will be referring back to the original methods and recipe to let you know what I think went wrong.\nLast time, I threw all the ingredients (except the preservative, fragrance and color) into a pyrex cup and heated them all together. This time I warmed the water and oil phases separately, then combined. By the way, when the supplier website warns you that the BTMS heats up quickly, they aren\u2019t kidding! My digital thermometer maxed out and just said \u201cHI\u201d \u2013 as in too high to read this temperature, not \u201cHi, how are you doing today?\u201d Because it would just be creepy for a thermometer to talk to you. Anyway, the odd thing about the BTMS is that it also sets up solid again real quick, so even as I poured the oil phase \u2013 which was too high of a temperature to register on my thermometer \u2013 into the water phase, it left quite a bit in the cup. However, the conditioner DID set up and behave the way I would have expected it to the first time.\nSo what went wrong the first time? Obviously, my BTMS hasn\u2019t gone bad. I was really starting to wonder, since I had never smelled BTMS before and it was a bit rank, to be quite honest. So I asked my soapmaking friend April if it\u2019s supposed to have an odor, and she responded, \u201cYes and it is not a good one!\u201d That made me feel a bit better.\nHere\u2019s my conclusion as to why the first batch did not set up: the high percentage of dimethicone (a silicone oil that adds extra lubrication and de-tangling properties) mixed in at the beginning. This time I added the dimethicone and silk extract after the emulsion had cooled a bit, which seemed to work just fine.\nSecond batch is thicker, but still pretty thin for conditioner. No color added.\nI am already planning my next batch. I want to try putting the aloe juice, panthenol, BTMS and extra virgin coconut oil in a cup together to melt, and I\u2019m feeling pretty confident that it will work. As long as I add the dimethicone and silk extract after it has cooled to 120 degrees, then add preservative and fragrance (and perhaps color) after it has cooled under 100 degrees.\nIs anyone else inspired to make their own hair conditioner now?\n"}, {"score": 868.5321, "uuid": "a634b3e2-4ef4-55f1-bbd4-ebd191cd2812", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800tw-26-11093", "target_hostname": "www.goodswithstory.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.goodswithstory.ca/stories/2012/02/07/making-a-better-world-with-noshpockets/", "page_rank": 1.3573677e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Making <em>a</em> <em>Better</em> World with Noshpockets! | Goods with Story", "snippet": "Goods With Story - Online Shopping Destination for Canadian Shoppers Home &gt; Community &gt; Canadian Small Business &gt; Making <em>a</em> <em>Better</em> World with Noshpockets!

Tell us a little bit about yourself.\nTerry: I am passionate about sustainability and believe that each individual has the power and responsibility to make a difference in our world.\u00a0 We are all connected in ways we may never realize. We vote for the kind of world we want with every purchase we make whether it is for locally produced food, minimal packaging or items produced by people under fair labour practices. Our culture is full of busyness but taking the time to be kind or to give someone a smile can make someone\u2019s day.\nGWS: What inspired you to start your business? What was the initial spark?\nTerry: I have a BSC in Home Economics and most of my working life has been spent in the financial sector.\u00a0 I worked many years as an investment advisor and financial planner and later as a debt counsellor.\u00a0 As much as I enjoyed working with my clients, I often felt a pull toward a career that offered more creativity.\u00a0 I was also striving to make environmentally friendly choices within my home. As a mother and an employee who packed a lunch, I had been struggling with finding alternatives to plastic baggies.\u00a0 I was taking reusable containers to work but it was very bulky and with everyone else\u2019s lunches it was hard to find a place in the fridge!\u00a0 That inspired me to make my own reusable fabric sandwich bags.\u00a0 My friends at work thought they were wonderful. It struck me that this was a product that other people would like as well and that it was environmentally friendly and would allow me to be creative.\nGWS: Did you know it\u2019ll be successful or you had your doubts?\nTerry: I think everyone has doubts.\u00a0 That\u2019s only human.\u00a0 I tried to maximize my chances of success by having a business plan and being as clear as possible about my goals.\u00a0 Besides financial goals\u00a0 I also had personal goals.\u00a0 I wanted to enjoy what I was doing , I wanted flexibility in my hours and I wanted to have time for my family and community.\u00a0 So far so good!\nGWS: How did it feel receiving your first order? Do you remember that day?\nTerry: My first order was thrilling!\u00a0 I had no experience in retail and boldly asked to speak to the buyer for Planet Organic in Calgary.\u00a0 She happened to be looking for a local product for carrying sandwiches and snacks. I was very nervous when I went to meet with her but she liked the product and made an order for the store.\u00a0 My husband and I went out for supper to celebrate!\nGWS: What makes your products unique and why do you think our customers will love them?\nTerry: People love noshpockets because they are a practical, easy-to-use, sustainable solution to single-use plastic baggies.\u00a0 Kids and adults alike love the funky colours and designs and noshpockets help parents instill in their children respect for the earth when the send them to school with litter-free lunches.\nGWS: What are your top 3 favourite products at Goods with Story?\nTerry: There are so many inspiring products available at Goods with Story.\u00a0 Currently my favourites are the Ethnic Tribal Earrings , the Mommy Bling Necklaces and the handbags made from recycled juice containers .\nGWS: What do you like to do besides creating your amazing products?\nTerry: I have so many interests that it is sometimes hard to find time for it all.\u00a0 I love to cook healthy meals especially with ingredients I grow myself.\u00a0 I am an urban beekeeper with two hives and I have two beautiful heritage chickens in my backyard that provide me with eggs.\u00a0 My yard is a bit shady but I try to find the sunny spots to grow vegetables in the summer. I also have an interest in fibre arts and learning new skills and techniques.\u00a0 I love to sew and knit for my grandchildren and have signed up for a weaving course.\u00a0 Learning to spin is also on my agenda as is raising Angora rabbits for their fibre.\nGWS: How many hours do you work per day on your business and how do you manage work-life balance?\nTerry: Balance is very important to me and it is a challenge to keep all the balls in the air!\u00a0 I need to be very clear about what my goals are and what is important to me so I spend my time in those areas.\u00a0 Time can slip away on unimportant matters very easily.\u00a0 I currently work half time on my business and spend my other time with family, volunteer work and all my other interests.\nGWS: What is your best advice for those who start their businesses right now?\nTerry: Be prepared for a steep learning curve. You\u2019ll find you are always learning new things and searching for more information.\u00a0 It is both exciting and challenging.\nGWS: Where do you see yourself in 10 years from now?\nTerry: I really like Calgary and see so many positive advancements such as more community gardens, farmers markets, bike transportation and city composting strategies so I will likely still be here.

If you don't want to miss anything, you may want to subscribe to my RSS feed or get updates via email - sign up in the right sidebar. Thanks for visiting!\nI LOVE the hair conditioner that I made last week! Even though it\u2019s runny and I have to spray it on my hair\u2026 The main thing I\u2019ve noticed is that I am losing less hair every time I wash it. Less hair comes out when I comb it after washing, and there are fewer hairs coming out when I apply mousse. Not a dramatic difference \u2013 I probably used to lose 20-30 hairs every time I washed it (not sure how you would really count them), and now I\u2019m estimating 10-15. I don\u2019t know why it works that way, but it\u2019s enough to be noticeable from using it for less than a week.\nIf you missed my post a couple days ago about how I made the first batch of hair conditioner, you will want to refer to it here \u2013 because I made another batch of hair conditioner yesterday which turned out much better, and I will be referring back to the original methods and recipe to let you know what I think went wrong.\nLast time, I threw all the ingredients (except the preservative, fragrance and color) into a pyrex cup and heated them all together. This time I warmed the water and oil phases separately, then combined. By the way, when the supplier website warns you that the BTMS heats up quickly, they aren\u2019t kidding! My digital thermometer maxed out and just said \u201cHI\u201d \u2013 as in too high to read this temperature, not \u201cHi, how are you doing today?\u201d Because it would just be creepy for a thermometer to talk to you. Anyway, the odd thing about the BTMS is that it also sets up solid again real quick, so even as I poured the oil phase \u2013 which was too high of a temperature to register on my thermometer \u2013 into the water phase, it left quite a bit in the cup. However, the conditioner DID set up and behave the way I would have expected it to the first time.\nSo what went wrong the first time? Obviously, my BTMS hasn\u2019t gone bad. I was really starting to wonder, since I had never smelled BTMS before and it was a bit rank, to be quite honest. So I asked my soapmaking friend April if it\u2019s supposed to have an odor, and she responded, \u201cYes and it is not a good one!\u201d That made me feel a bit better.\nHere\u2019s my conclusion as to why the first batch did not set up: the high percentage of dimethicone (a silicone oil that adds extra lubrication and de-tangling properties) mixed in at the beginning. This time I added the dimethicone and silk extract after the emulsion had cooled a bit, which seemed to work just fine.\nSecond batch is thicker, but still pretty thin for conditioner. No color added.\nI am already planning my next batch. I want to try putting the aloe juice, panthenol, BTMS and extra virgin coconut oil in a cup together to melt, and I\u2019m feeling pretty confident that it will work. As long as I add the dimethicone and silk extract after it has cooled to 120 degrees, then add preservative and fragrance (and perhaps color) after it has cooled under 100 degrees.\nIs anyone else inspired to make their own hair conditioner now?\n"}, {"score": 842.18964, "uuid": "bc6657db-bb0b-5db3-baff-3a0bf7b984fc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-75-09512", "target_hostname": "blingingbeauty.com", "target_uri": "http://blingingbeauty.com/?p=24182", "page_rank": 1.20952e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Budget Beauty Tuesday: Best Cold Weather Body <em>Moisturizers</em> | Blinging Beauty", "snippet": "<em>A</em> quality, heavy-duty lotion not only hydrates skin but forms <em>a</em> protective barrier to lock in moisture and shield against the elements.

Living in a humid climate, this is a perfect lightweight moisturizer during the warm months! I use Immortelle Precious Cream in the more dry/cold months. Both work wonders to reduce wrinkles.\nBeata H\nCustomer since: 2009\n4/12/2011\nThis is the miracle cream for oily skin users like me. Never before have I found a facial cream that would not leave a layer of shine on my face. But the Velvet Concentrate did it! my skin feels super supple without shine (used it all winter -- not sure about summer yet). love it.\nHiroko T\nCustomer since: 2010\n4/12/2011\nPlease do not discontinue this item!! This is the only face cream that works for me and I can't find anything like this on the market. As others said, none of the other face products like immortelle work for my skin. So please do not discontinue.\nArlene G\nCustomer since: 2010\n4/6/2011\nVery upset that this item is getting discontinued. None of the other face products (including immortelle) work for my skin. After this line is discontinued I will be moving to another face product provider. You should definitely keep the line or bring out a very similar one!!\nManussawee S\nCustomer since: 2010\n4/1/2011\nI'd been using Shea Butter for my face during the winter, and I ran out. I thought this would be a good transition into Spring, but it doesn't give me enough moisturizer. My face feels really tight, and I need to put additional (thicker) moisturizer on top. I hope it will be decent when weather is warmer, but definitely not enough for my face now.\nEileen M\nCustomer since: 2011\n4/1/2011\nYes L'Occitane! Please change your mind! I love this line and am also sad that it's being discontinued.\nCatherine L\nWhy is this item discontinued if it is so good and the reviews are good?\nCarrol A\nCustomer since: 2005\n3/26/2011\nThis is the first face cream I have not had an allergic reaction to. Have been using for over 4 years and love it.\nJohanna C\nCustomer since: 2011\n3/26/2011\nThis is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. How unfortunate that this line is being discontinued!\nMargee S\nCustomer since: 2010\n3/25/2011\nI started using Almond Apple collection last year (velvet concentrate, eye gel and toner)to start with a not so heavy anti aging skincare regimen. It works really well too bad they are discontinuing it. Hope L'Occitane changes their mind!\nYI SHA F\nCustomer since: 2010\n3/25/2011\nI love this product and so sad to know it's going to leave the boutiques' shelves.\nHillary M\nCustomer since: 2011\n3/15/2011\nThe best moisturizer I have ever used! No sticky or oily residue. Provides lasting moisture, and smells great!!\nCHEN L\nCustomer since: 2011\n2/28/2011\nI really love this product, especially the smell. It makes my skin tighter than before. I use it every morning and night realizing I need it all the time.\nVictoria S\nCustomer since: 2011\n2/1/2011\nI love the scent but not moisturizing enough for very dry skin. I wish I can have body lotion in this scent.\nShih Lin G\nCustomer since: 2009\n1/6/2011\nI have combination skin, and certain areas that tends to get dry in the winter and oily in the summer. This moisturizer was perfect for me, especially in the winter. It is a rich cream, but since a little goes a long way, it leaves my skin nicely moisturized and smooth.\nAndrea M\nCustomer since: 2010\n10/22/2010\nI've started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I'm simply in love with it! I have oily/sensitive skin and I'm almost 40. I found this product to be the ideal one for me before bedtime. It hydrates, absorbs easily, leaves my skin supple and very silky, not oily at all! Also, I've noticed my pores are diminishing. And of course, the wonderful smell is just a plus! Superb product!\nAdeline M\nCustomer since: 2010\n7/13/2010\nI've just started using this for the past month and my husband commented that my skin's looking more radiant lately. It goes on quite well - light and easily absorbed (I have normal skin). Face always feels well hydrated and smells great after I put it on. But it does leave a slight shine to my face for a while. Great for use during warmer months... but not sure how it'll hold up during winter when my skin tends to get very dry.\nSarah H\nCustomer since: 2010\n6/17/2010\nBuy this product!!! I have tried EVERYTHING from Kinerase to Lancome to Dior and the like... I have finally found the perfect face cream for my 29 year old super sensitive skin. Goes on kinda thick, as it is a cream not a lotion, but immediately absorbs into my face leaving a soft finish... Love it! It's a bit thick for daily use under make-up (unless you like a dewey look or have very dry skin) so I use it as a night cream. Very Happy :)\nSarah W\nCustomer since: 2002\n5/14/2010\nTruly a wondrous product! I put this on before bed (and use the Velvet Face Fluid with SPF during the day), and my skin has never felt calmer or clearer. I don't know that L'Occitane will make any claims that this cream soothes redness, but that's what has happened with me. Great for sensitive skin and not oily at all.\nLily C\nCustomer since: 2006\n5/14/2010\nSmells exquisite. Feels wonderful across my face. I live in a very dry city, in a high altitude; so I need something that moisturizes well. So far, I'm liking this product.\nPrabha S\nCustomer since: 2009\n1/14/2010\nThis product is amazing! Consistency is just right, not too thick, not too watery. Readily absorbed onto the skin, and does not leave any residue. Moisturizes very effectively, leaving skin really soft. Smells wonderful!\nCourtney C\nCustomer since: 2009\n9/30/2009\nThis product really is great. When spread on my skin, it is very soft and smooth without the feeling of thickness. My skin Feels hydrated all day long and soft. I love it.\nMei-Ki C\nCustomer since: 2009\n9/21/2009\nGiven that I just turn 30, this moisturizer is the right line for me. The scent is heavenly and the texture is soft and light. Since I have combination skin I want a creamy texture cream rather than the very thin fluid version. I warm the cream between my palm and press in against my skin to apply. I have tried the Immortelle line, which is divine, but not helping with my blackhead situation on my T-zone. Great for Day (just add a separate sunscreen) and Night!\nCara S\nCustomer since: 2009\n6/30/2009\nI am amazed by how excellent this is- you have GOT to try it. Upon turning 30 this year & noticing the fine lines & webbing I am already having on my face, I looked at & tried several different anti-aging lines...among them Caudalie, Lancome, Clinique, etc. I finally started using the Immortelle Very Precious Cream. It may be great for use during our Midwestern winters, but summers in Missouri are as hot & humid as in Houston! Upon trying this a day ago, I am delighted with it.\nGabriel A\nCustomer since: 2009\n5/29/2009\nThis is perhaps my favorite moisturizer of all time. :) It smells delightful and goes on so smoothly. It also absorbs quickly without leaving skin feeling sticky. In regards to the comment about this product not having SPF -- I would recommend the Almond Apple Velvet Face Fluid SPF 40, which goes very well on top of this product or on top of the new Almond Apple Velvet Face Fluid (without SPF).\nDiana K\nCustomer since: 2009\n5/16/2009\nThis moisturizer is very light and gentle, smells great, and it makes my skin look younger and fresher. It makes my skin tone more even and makes the fine lines disappear. I only wish it had some SPF in it - I often end up applying sunblock on top of it when I use it in the morning.\nJustine D\nCustomer since: 2009\n4/30/2009\nEverything about this product relaxes me, from the soft scent to the velvety feeling on my face. I use it as soon as I awake and just before bed. I had my mother over this weekend and let her sample it,she fell in love with it! The next morning her face was already looking more youthful and smoother. I will definitely be buying a new jar, since she took mine home with her!\nAlicia K\nCustomer since: 2009\n4/27/2009\nI received a sample of this in the store. It's wonderful! Moisturizing without being greasy & definitely leaves your skin feeling smooth! As soon as I use up my old moisturizer I'm buying this.\nKristen G\nCustomer since: 2011\n4/25/2009\nI bought a trial size version of this and liked it so much that I went back and got the whole line of almond apple products. This moisturizer is so light that it feels great on my skin and doesn't make my face greasy. If you like the fragrance of the almond skin care products, the almond apple is even better! I'll be using this moisturizer until it's time to switch to Immortelle.\nGabriel A\nCustomer since: 2009\n4/2/2009\nHaving just turned 25 last year I started to take my skin care seriously and purchased this product due to testimonials and the proven results -- well, let me tell you, it is the silkiest moisturizer I've ever used and helps to tighten and minimize pores! I would recommend this wonderful smelling product to ANYONE in their mid to late twenties.\nWilks H\nCustomer since: 2009\n3/6/2009\nI use three L'Occitane products.......the Cade Youth Concentrate, the Velvet Concentrate, and the Immortelle Precious Cream. They all do wonders for my face. They reduce fine lines & make your skin feel nourished and hydrated. As a gentleman that takes care of his face and shaves with a straight razor instead of those horrible, damaging, cartridge 6-blade pieces of junk, I can tell you, these products heal your face better than anything out there. Plus, the Velvet Concentrate smells so damn nice.\nK Y\nCustomer since: 2009\n2/14/2009\nLove this product as it improves my skin condition. L'Occitane carries good products. However, make sure that you try it out in the store before buying online, as they will make you ship the product back to them at your own cost.\nBecky S\nCustomer since: 2008\n1/10/2009\nThis smells divine!! A little goes a long way and my face is so silky smooth after I apply it. I have noticed quite a difference after only a week with the entire Almond Apple line. Now I am not dreading my upcoming 30th birthday too much. Thanks, L'Occitane!!\nJulianne A\nCustomer since: 2008\n12/30/2008\nthe dream cream!!!! I am 25 and found my self to be looking well, 25-27ish. all my life i was used to having such a youthful look about me until i moved from the states to dubai where the water and weather have what i thought destroyed me, but tahhdaaaahh i have found this cream which has brought me back to looking 20 all over again and my now my face is softer brighter and even clearer than before... thank you L'Occitane for helping me get through life with less worries : )\nPauline C\nCustomer since: 2007\n11/17/2008\nWow! I'm so satisfied with this product. Not only does it softens my skin but also gives me that glowing brightness back to my face. I love that it is lightweight and enjoy the ever so sweet almond-apple scent.\nCindy H\nCustomer since: 2008\n9/11/2008\nI love love love this product. I have used another brand which did give me \"hope,\" but this product has amazed me. The smell is wonderful and I just can't wait to use it every day and night. My pores are smaller and my skin is so soft.

I have tried everything but this is the best!\nJennifer G\nCustomer since: 2011\n9/19/2011\nThis is the best hair conditioner I have ever used! I have long hair that needs extra conditioning. This conditioner does the work of a deep conditioner while leaving your hair with a light, not overly conditioned, feeling. You can also use it as a leave-in conditioner. Your hair will feel smooth and silky without feeling weighed down. My greatest discovery is that it works extremely well as a skin lotion. Your skin will feel moisturized and smell great. Definitely one of my all-time favorites!\nAgatha A\nCustomer since: 2011\n7/31/2011\nI am a black female with kinky curly hair and I just used this conditioner on my severely tangled hair and I could not believe how soft it became.

It makes my hair super soft and smooth and helps it to hold its natural wave. The shampoo and conditioner definitely work best when used together, I have found I get less soft results when I use a different shampoo. Holy grail conditioner!\nDianne E\nCustomer since: 2011\n1/15/2011\nI absolutely love this conditioner. I have course thick hair that has lost its natural shine over the years. I have used lots of products to try and get it straight and shiny. This conditioner has been amazing at making my hair soft, shiny, and frizz-free. Because the conditioner works so well, I do not have to use so much of the other products. My hair also smells great!\nStephanie S\nCustomer since: 2010\n12/28/2010\nMy hair is extremely long, probably around 3 feet. I just used the travel size shea butter conditioner, and I have to say that I will be purchasing this in the near future! I also get my hair colored and this has left it so soft. I was a bit worried when I saw that the shampoo was thicker than the conditioner, I was thinking \"No way this is going to go over well!\" But I am pleased to say that it did and I think this is a great product! I like the fact that it IS LIGHT WEIGHT!\nC. Donna L\nCustomer since: 2010\n9/5/2010\nI agree w/hope s. This product is too runny, does nothing for my hair and leaves it knotty, I can't get comb through it; it's dull, like a waxy residue is left on my hair. The shampoo is worse. my hair is thin, fine and dry. I love the repairing shampoo/conditioner. I want a refund/exchange please....They were out of it at the new Honolulu store so was talked into buying this, big mistake...I'm on maui so returning at store is not an option.\nLorraine H\nCustomer since: 2010\n5/20/2010\nI have thick, coarse, multi-racial hair that is extremely dry and knots up if you look at it the wrong way. After using this miracle stuff, my hair has never been easier to detangle! Seriously! I just leave this on for a few minutes while I do my shower thing, detangle while my hair is still saturated, and rinse. It's like butter! I can't wait for sale season when the bigger sizes come in!\nHope S\nCustomer since: 2010\n4/17/2010\nI bought this condition in a boutique in NYC and was soooo excited to get home and try it. However I amm extremely disappointed with this conditioner. It is so thin and runny and does NOTHING for my hair. My hair is extremely knotty and coarse even after I use a lot and leave it in for 15 minutes before rinsing it. I will not use it anymore because it is simply ineffective. This coming from someone likes a very thick daily conditioner and I have very normal hair.\nMeredith L\nCustomer since: 2010\n10/19/2009\nAs an African American I have chemically relaxed hair that I have always had a hard time keeping healthy. I used to have a problem with dryness, breakage and an overall brittle feeling head of hair. But I am AMAZED at this product. I use it with the shampoo and sometimes I cannot believe the difference. There is no breakage at all. My hair feels healthy and even has a bit of body. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.\nRachelle H\nCustomer since: 2010\n7/17/2009\nI used this at a hotel I once stayed at and I only wish I could get a large full-sized 8.4 oz. version of this. I love this stuff.\nPatti H\nCustomer since: 2008\n7/8/2009\nThis is the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is curly/frizzy.

I can't do without it!\nNathalie L\nCustomer since: 2009\n2/21/2009\nI have coarse, relaxed hair. My hairdresser put this conditioner in my hair, then I sat under the dyer for 10 minutes with it. My hair is now soft, silky, light weight and I can run my fingers through. I use the matching shea butter shampoo. Excellent product.\nMarie M\nCustomer since: 2008\n12/24/2008\nMy hair is fine and color-treated. This conditioner, although labeled \"Ultra Rich,\" does not weigh my hair down at all. This is what I struggle with most of the time when I use conditioners formulated for color-treated hair. This one has a thinner consistency than other ones I've used (Pureology, Paul Mitchell, Beadhead products, etc), and it works as soon as it is applied. Rinses off clean, makes hair soft, tangle-free and manageable, without any extra weight. Impressive!\nLaura V\nCustomer since: 2011\n8/31/2008\nI originally left a review for this product. However, after a while I felt like it was not really doing anything--I don't know if it was due to the summer or what. After the initial frustration, I switched to the Olive Daily Conditioner---and I seriously believe L'Occitane is keeping the olive line a secret. The Olive Daily Conditioner is far superior in moisturizing and truly it delivers.\nA K\nCustomer since: 2008\n8/1/2008\nI can't believe I found something that works!! I have very dry hair and from coarse black hair to thin blonde. My hair has looked very dull and felt terrible. No matter what kind of hair products I used, how little or how much I spent on the products, I had no luck. Few months ago, I stayed at a hotel that had L'Occitane products. I used the conditioner and was amazed!! My hair is now silky soft and shinny. I LOVE the way it feels and I keep putting my fingers through!!\nLisa G\nCustomer since: 2008\n7/30/2008\nThis is hands-down the finest hair conditioner I've ever used...and I've used a lot of them.

Don't shy away from this amazing conditioner because it is \"ultra rich\": this is a truly nourishing, yet light-weight conditioner that doesn't weigh down fine hair. You will never want to be without it...ever!\nLisa L\nCustomer since: 2008\n5/29/2008\nI bought a travel size to try this conditioner and I was shocked. My hair has never looked better. I have very long frizzy hair when the weather is humid and Ihave tried so many different products. I thought it might have been a fluke so I waited a few days and tried it again. My hair is soft and managebale and so far not frizzy at all. I love it and want to try the shampoo too.\nLaura V\nCustomer since: 2011\n4/12/2008\nI honestly can not remember when my hair looked this good!

This is thanks to the climate and their diet of rice, fruit and fish. Also many locals think their application of pure coconut oil on their hair as a conditioner helps keep it healthy and black.\nIn our modern society, the cuticles in hair are usually damaged by blow drying, bleaching, coloring, perming, hard brushing or too much water or sun exposure, and this damage shows up as split ends, and coarse, fragile, dry hair that breaks easily. Split ends mean the cuticle has worn away and therefore the inner portion of hair, called the cortex, is exposed, and frayed.\nThe molecular structure of coconut oil is ideal for penetrating within the hair shaft, and works wonderfully with the natural hair proteins, particularly close to the ends, which have a tendency to be the most vulnerable to splitting and fraying.\nUsing coconut oil as a hair conditioner\nApply coconut oil to your hair straight after a shower or bath, when the hair is still wet, not dripping wet, but more than barely damp. The coconut oil can be either liquid or solid (pure coconut oil hardens at less than 76 degrees F ). If solid, it will simply melt in your hand as you use it.\nUse a touch (about a half small spoon for long hair, less for shorter hair) and rub your hands together and begin the application at the ends of your wet hair, using your oily fingers to distribute it evenly and gently.\nUse just enough so the oil will penetrate the hair, without leaving an oily or oily look. Use more at the ends, less in the middle and little, if any at the roots. If you have used an amount that leaves your hair oily, simply leave it on to soak in for 20-30 mins and then re-wash the hair to get rid of the surplus oil. You might experiment a bit until you find the right dose for your particular hair, so you are able to leave the oil in your hair when you have applied it.\nWhy is coconut oil such a good conditioner for hair?\nLauric Acid : Microbial action on the scalp and hair roots is in charge of much hair fall and hair loss. The Lauric Acid in Coconut Oil is a triglyceride which yields a monoglyceride called Monolaurin when acted on by a species of bacteria. This monolaurin has wonderful antimicrobial properties.\nCapric Acid : Another triglyceride present in Coconut oil, that has antimicrobial properties like that of monolaurin.\nVitamin-E : Coconut Oil contains Vitamin E, which keeps scalp and skin healthy and hair rejuvenated.\nMoisture Keeping Capacity : Coconut Oil is very stable and doesn\u2019t let moisture escape simply and so keeps hair moistened and soft, stopping breakage of hair.\nAnti-Dandruff : Coconut oil is a great moisturizer, and is anti-fungal, so it helps dandruff, whether the flakes spring from dry scalp, or a fungal / yeast condition like seborrheic rash. Do scalp treatments when you do not need to go out in public, or try overnite treatments ( be certain to look after your pillow with a bag covered with an old towel ).\nMany users claim that Coconut Oil is a far superior conditioner for hair than any manmade product available in the market and is also better than commercial anti-dandruff products. Be certain to get a pure form of unrefined, organic coconut oil, for example Nutiva, for most impressive results.\u00a0 See Nutiva Coconut Oil for hair .\nDo you have a Recipe you\u2019d like to share with us?\nTagged as: Coconut Oil , dandruff , Hair Care , hair conditioner , hair cuticles , split ends\nVanessa\nWow!

I read some good stuff about the coconut oil as a conditioner for my hair, I received my order to day but quickly grew disappointed when I noticed the consistency of the oil the oil is in liquid form but the ones that I researched seems to be in a white solid\u2026\ncan you tell me what the difference is\nWhat I ordered is called Nutiva Organix Extra Virgin Coconut Oil the bottle reads; a delicious cooking oil 100% less cholesterol than butter, is this the wrong one???\nChris\nHi Rose.\nYou didn\u2019t buy the wrong product. You\u2019ll find that our Coconut Oil liquifies at 76 degrees Fahrenheit. I keep a jar of it in the kitchen and one in the bathroom, as my wife has taken to using it as a skin conditioner. On some days in August and September here, I discover that my coconut oil has liquified, and then I notice that it becomes solid again when it cools down at night. This is perfectly normal for coconut oil.\nIf you need it in liquid form, simply scoop as much as you need into a glass measuring cup. Then heat up some water in a pot, and place the glass measuring cup into the hot water until the coconut oil returns to its liquid form.\nIf you need it to be in solid form, simply put it someplace cooler than 76 degrees!\nI hope this helps.\n"}, {"score": 797.6916, "uuid": "fb8484b6-f5f2-5688-bebd-e6f3629e6a0b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-25-23988", "target_hostname": "nutiva.com", "target_uri": "http://nutiva.com/articles/coconut-oil-hair/", "page_rank": 1.1905957e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Coconut Oil Hair <em>Conditioner</em> | Coconut Oil For Black Hair", "snippet": "Anti-Dandruff : Coconut oil <em>is</em> <em>a</em> great <em>moisturizer</em>, and <em>is</em> anti-fungal, so it helps dandruff, whether the flakes spring from dry scalp, <em>or</em> <em>a</em> fungal &#x2F; yeast condition like seborrheic rash.", "explanation": null, "document": "SUBSCRIBE\nUsing Coconut Oil As A Hair Conditioner\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to the seaside areas of India, like West Bengal, Kerala, Coastal Tamil Nadu etc, you\u2019ll have noticed that many older men and women, in their 70s and 80s, still have thick jet black hair.

If you have used an amount that leaves your hair oily, simply leave it on to soak in for 20-30 mins and then re-wash the hair to get rid of the surplus oil. You might experiment a bit until you find the right dose for your particular hair, so you are able to leave the oil in your hair when you have applied it.\nWhy is coconut oil such a good conditioner for hair?\nLauric Acid : Microbial action on the scalp and hair roots is in charge of much hair fall and hair loss. The Lauric Acid in Coconut Oil is a triglyceride which yields a monoglyceride called Monolaurin when acted on by a species of bacteria. This monolaurin has wonderful antimicrobial properties.\nCapric Acid : Another triglyceride present in Coconut oil, that has antimicrobial properties like that of monolaurin.\nVitamin-E : Coconut Oil contains Vitamin E, which keeps scalp and skin healthy and hair rejuvenated.\nMoisture Keeping Capacity : Coconut Oil is very stable and doesn\u2019t let moisture escape simply and so keeps hair moistened and soft, stopping breakage of hair.\nAnti-Dandruff : Coconut oil is a great moisturizer, and is anti-fungal, so it helps dandruff, whether the flakes spring from dry scalp, or a fungal / yeast condition like seborrheic rash. Do scalp treatments when you do not need to go out in public, or try overnite treatments ( be certain to look after your pillow with a bag covered with an old towel ).\nMany users claim that Coconut Oil is a far superior conditioner for hair than any manmade product available in the market and is also better than commercial anti-dandruff products. Be certain to get a pure form of unrefined, organic coconut oil, for example Nutiva, for most impressive results.\u00a0 See Nutiva Coconut Oil for hair .\nDo you have a Recipe you\u2019d like to share with us?\nSpeak Your Mind!\n"}, {"score": 788.281, "uuid": "c5d9240d-8019-51fd-81c0-51187715da8d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0714wb-75-22632", "target_hostname": "comfydiva.tribe.net", "target_uri": "http://comfydiva.tribe.net/thread/395950a4-c981-4ad6-8db4-06168b6d723e", "page_rank": 1.174181e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Natural oils and butters as <em>moisturizer</em>?", "snippet": "And <em>what</em> about lips?

I am excited! Thanks again for being willing to share your secrets! - Pat Dance\nRacheal\nThank you. I am looking forward to working with you. I have many friends that are all natural, including myself, but your product so far has really surpassed all others I've tried. I'm sure after they see what your product has done for me, they'll be on board. I have very dry, naturally curly, hair. It's hard to get products that let the curl be natural and not weight down the rest.

You have won me for a customer. - Lizzy\nTbones\nYou know that old saying, \"you don't know what you've got until it's gone\"? Well, how true it is! I have been using MM about 3 months now and recently waited too long to re-order. OH MY GOD......I will never do that again! During this week w/o all these products, my hair immediately became dull, flat, thin feeling and very, very dry. I was about to go insane waiting for my shipment. Today, it arrived and not a moment too soon. I shampooed three times (couldn't help myself) and a generous dousing of both conditioning mists. In an instant my hair completely revived! And I'm not exaggerating! For anyone out there who is skeptical of MM, all you need to do is try the products a while and then go without, and just watch what happens to your hair. Anthony, thank you, thank you!! I have finally found something healthy and nourishing for my hair. After all these years, I can't believe it. And I just realized, MM is something I cannot and will not live without. - tbonesrex\nGretta\nThank you for you wonderful products.

Well, not always. Unlike drugs, The FDA doesn't review cosmetic or personal care ingredients for safety before they hit the market. Also, manufacturers routinely do something known as greenwashing: using misleading, vague or even false claims about the eco/health benefits of their products. That leaves us wondering whether our lipstick, skin cream or wrinkle serum is safe. Reports say that many contain chemicals linked to cancer, infertility, hormone imbalances, birth defects, neurological issues and other health problems.\nWhat we put on our skin matters. Our skin is not a barrier... it allows microscopic chemicals to enter our bloodstream which can impact our physiology. What happens inside our bodies when we are exposed to minute amounts of synthetic chemicals every day, for years? No one really knows. So it's best to play it safe and choose natural, nontoxic products. But, there's a lot of confusion when it comes to knowing exactly what to look for on the label. To help you out, I've created my \"Top 10 Greenwashing Watchwords.\" These are words and phrases that will help raise your awareness about the subtle distinctions and nuances being used on ingredient labels on your makeup and personal care products.\nTop 10 Greenwashing Watchwords:\n#10. \"Environmentally Friendly\" and \"Eco-Safe:\" There are currently no specific government or official standards for these terms. Plus, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) considers these phrases to be too vague to be meaningful.\n#9. \"Dermatologist Tested,\" \"Sensitivity Tested\" and \"Hypoallergenic:\" According to FDA, manufacturers are not required to perform any tests or provide evidence that products were actually tested by a doctor. Look for the organization behind these claims other than the company making the product.\n#8. \"Allergy-Friendly Fragrance\" and \"Fragrance-Free:\" A product might be made with essential oils instead of synthetically made fragrance oils (which can be allergy triggers), but also contain questionable chemicals like DEA, SLS and artificial coloring. \"Fragrance-Free\" does not necessarily mean no fragrance. It might contain synthetic fragrances that are used to cover up the chemical smell of other ingredients.\n#7. \"Nontoxic:\" Nontoxic does not mean Not Toxic or Not Harmless. It indicates it's a safer alternative than some other hazardous ingredients, and implies it will not cause adverse health effects. But, there are no specific government or official standards for this term.\n#6. \"Derived From... :\" \"Derived from coconut oil,\" for example, is deceptive, because to create cocamide DEA from coconut oil requires the use of diethanolamine -- DEA -- a carcinogenic synthetic chemical. Therefore, it is no longer natural... or safe.\n#5. \"Free of... :\" Watch for hyping what's NOT in the product. For example, a deodorant claiming \"No CFCs.\" Chloro-fluorocarbons were banned in 1978, so if the product contained CFCs it would be illegal. Or a cream claiming \"No Parabens\" but substituting Phenoxethanol, which, according the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet), if absorbed through the skin (at 100 percent concentration) can cause reproductive damage. Skin creams and baby lotions generally use 1 percent. Does that make it safe?\n#4. \"Certified Green:\" The term \"green\" implies a product has some environmental benefit or causes no harm to the environment, but the FTC and the International Standards Organization (ISO) consider it to be too vague a word to be meaningful. Also, watch out for self-made seals. Certified by whom? Choose neutral third party seals.\n#3. \"Natural:\" This word can give the illusion that the product is \"of nature,\" when it's not. One large, brand name company claims \"100% NATURAL\" on the label of its moisturizers but uses synthetic surfactants, preservatives and fragrance. That's not very natural! However, not all \"natural\" products are bad! Check the NPA (Natural Products Association) Natural Standard for Personal Care Products guidelines .\n#2. \"Organic:\" Some major brands say \"organic\" but contain few or no organic ingredients. One shampoo company claims their product creates a \"truly organic experience\" yet it contains sodium lauryl sulfate, propylene glycol and D&C color, which are synthetic chemicals that pose health risks. A study from the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) found several mislabeled \"organic\" personal care products\n#1. \"Made with... :\" The phrases \"Made with lavender\" or \"Made with real lemon\" for example, might be only contain 1 percent of those ingredients, with the rest being synthetic. Or \"Made with essential oils\" might be only 1or 2 drops of the good stuff. Look for a percentage on the label to be sure. The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) found several mislabeled \"organic\" personal care products.\nMy advice? Read makeup and personal care ingredient labels like you would food labels.

This is hard to find but I usually can find it at WalMart, however, no so often at Target for unknown reasons. I apply it and it does smooth out the texture of my skin, after a few days, my acne blemishes were gone, my face less red, and I noticed my skin glow. Even in the winter where my skin can get pretty dull, it becomes radiant after this use. It can be used as a primer to make pores minimal and it makes makeup look more flawless over this without making it look too built up. This has no benzoyl peroxide or salycilic acid in it so for those who suffer irritation and see no improvement can give this a try and it has been effective for me. It makes my skin look better. \u2014\u00a04 years, 3 months ago\nThis review is: Helpful | Not helpful | Inappropriate |\u00a0\u00a012 of 12 people said helpful\nBuying Guide\n"}, {"score": 783.70514, "uuid": "2e789553-c450-5d7e-b2f5-3b100ee5d86e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1607wb-88-25754", "target_hostname": "www.bellasbeautyspot.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bellasbeautyspot.com/2011/01/padina-eye-lash-conditioner-review.html", "page_rank": 1.1919365e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Bella&#x27;s Beauty Spot: Padina Eye Lash <em>Conditioner</em> Review + Giveaway", "snippet": "Padina Eyelash <em>Conditioner</em> <em>is</em> ranking #2 on my top favorite eyelash <em>conditioners</em>. (See my growing list here) The price of $120 <em>is</em> <em>a</em> little more then other eyelash enhancers, but it&#x27;s not too bad for the quality of <em>what</em> you&#x27;re purchasing.", "explanation": null, "document": "Padina Eye Lash Conditioner Review + Giveaway\nOh how I love reviewing eyelash conditioners. I've found the best and the worst. I think I've tried ALMOST all of them. I'm constantly getting messages about which ones work and which ones don't, and I'm always 100% honest with my readers. So today, yes it's another review, however this one is a bit different.\nPadina Eyelash Conditioner ($120) is a Botanical formulation which will naturally enhance eyelash strength, growth and volume. Unlike other lash enhancers, which are actually just chemical byproducts of glaucoma treatments Padina is made from 23 different herbal extracts blended together. So at least you're rubbing amino acids, ginseng, peptides and calcium on your eyelids, as opposed to chemicals that you probably can't even come close to pronouncing. After lining your eyes with the liquid for 30 days, you should start to see thicker, longer and fuller lashes.\nI was interested in Padina because all the ingredients are 100% natural. Eyelash conditioners can appear scary because they are a new product that hasn't been out on the market that long, and you don't really know what kind of ingredients are making your lashes grow. Padina however is a blend of western and oriental mineral science entitled, \"Botanical Revolution\" The whole story and even the tube it's housed in all seems very exotic and extremely natural. And for me, natural is always better then chemicals when it comes to beauty.\nHere is a pic of my lashes after 20 days of using Padina Eye Lash Conditioner . My lashes are thicker and longer, almost touching my eyebrows! I've had many compliments about how long they are, and tons of questions about where I got such a product.\nThe pic below shows what can happen if you don't put the eyelash conditioner on evenly or put too much mascara on. Padina Cosmetics tells you to put a thin layer on over your lashes right before you sleep until you reach the desired result. After that you can apply every couple days. I recommend using eyelash curlers before you apply mascara and not putting TOO much of the conditioner on in one area, because in the below pic I think I got too much conditioner in one area, and too much mascara can create a crazy spider lash.\nI've had so much bad experience with eyelash conditioners not working, I think I put a little too much on for the first couple of weeks. But now that I know Padina REALLY works, I've changed my routine to once every couple days.\nPadina Eyelash Conditioner is ranking #2 on my top favorite eyelash conditioners. ( See my growing list here ) The price of $120 is a little more then other eyelash enhancers, but it's not too bad for the quality of what you're purchasing. The price for conditioners range from about $50-$400 depending on the brand. If you are searching for a great NATURAL eyelash growth serum, Padina is a good one to start out with. It also didn't create irritation around my eye, which is something I can't say about other brands. If you're hesitant about putting chemical on your lashes, Padina Conditioner is your best bet.\nBuy: You can purchase Padina Eyelash Growth at PadinaCosmetics.com\nThe Giveaway: One winner will win a tube of their own!

Coconut oil won\u2019t make you fat. Coconut oil contains MCT (medium-chain triglycerides), which are an easy fuel for the body to burn, without turning to fat. When you add coconut oil into your diet, you\u2019ll feel more full and eat fewer calories over all.\nStress Relief\nCoconut oil is very soothing so it\u2019s an excellent massage oil for the skin. Applying coconut oil to the head followed with a gentle massage helps in removing mental fatigue. Just the natural aroma of coconuts is extremely soothing thus helping to lower your stress level.\nMakes Your Hair Grow and Repairs Damage\nCoconut oil is one of the best natural remedies for your hair.

Contrary to popular belief, eating well doesn't have to mean a drastic overhaul of how you cook.\nIt also doesn't mean that you have to compromise on taste or texture.\nWith just a few simple additions to your cooking methods and daily diet, you can start eating more healthily while enjoying every last bite. Nutiva is proud to offer an extensive range of healthy, delicious hemp foods and virgin coconut oil products that make it easier than ever to start eating right.\nTry Unrefined Coconut Oil for Better Taste and Better Health\nFor example, Nutiva's extra-virgin coconut oil is not only good for you, but it's an excellent addition to any kitchen. Our virgin coconut oil is unrefined, unbleached and unfermented, giving it a light taste, pleasant aroma and pure white color. Our coconut oil is also unhydrogenated, eliminating the unhealthy fats found in hydrogenated oils. For centuries, people have cherished coconut oil for its beautiful flavor, and it has widely been used in cooking throughout the world.\nLooking for Coconut Butter or Coconut Cream?\nCoconut Manna\u2122 is creamy whole coconut that will delight people looking for coconut butter, coconut cream , coconut oil butter and coconut body butter.

Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.\nWhy Virgin Coconut Oil is Good for You\nUnrefined coconut oil doesn't just taste better, it's better for you. With around 50% lauric acid content (an acid also found in mother's milk), it helps support a healthy metabolism and is being researched for its ability to protect against fungus, bacteria and viruses. The benefits of coconut oil's lauric acid are so strong, it is often added to baby formula to help infants develop strong and healthy systems.\nConsider also the fact that Pacific Islanders long used coconut as a staple of their diets.

I have heard about Bb6, but just what is it and what does it do? go to top\nBb6 is a group of six special botanicals blended exclusively for Lifestyles\u00ae. This unique blend is designed specifically to help everyone, regardless of skin type, achieve better feeling, better looking skin. And here's how...\nDandelion visibly smoothes the skin where scar tissue or stretch marks are present.\nEvening Primrose provides essential fatty acids that the skin needs for its general health.\nDong Quai assists in stimulating circulation and increasing blood flow to help give the skin a more youthful appearance.\nGolden Seal contains ingredients that have been proven to alleviate conditions of problem skin, to help reduce the visible appearance of acne, psoriasis and eczema.\nGotu Kola works in harmony with Golden Seal extract to help increase blood flow and reduce visible appearance of spider veins.\nLiquorice a powerful anti-inflammatory agent which is useful in reducing redness and blotchiness.\nWhen you add this fabulous new botanical blend to the wonderful formulations we already have the total resulting synergy gives your skin the ultimate benefits.\n2. Most skin care products are made specifically for one skin type or another, how is it possible that AHA Skin Smoother can be used by all skin types? go to top\nThe Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA) produce a continuous exfoliation of the dead skin cells on the top layer of the skin, allowing the skin to quickly develop new younger skin cells. This results in a smoother complexion.\nAHA Skin Smoother helps get rid of blemishes and adds needed moisture to oily/blemish-prone skin and reduces flaking and smoothes fine lines in dry or aging skin.\n3. I have started the daily regimen for dry skin, but when should I use AHA Skin Smoother? go to top\nAHA Skin Smoother can be used in the morning before you apply your Daytime Hydration. This amazing product is gentle enough that you can also use it at night before you apply your Night Recovery. This way you get the fabulous benefits of this product around the clock.\n4. Someone has sensitive skin and has begun using all the appropriate Harper products. Their skin is itchy - why? go to top\nOccasionally someone will experience a little itchiness when first using Alpha Hydroxy Acid that is found in our AHA Skin Smoother. This is only a temporary condition that will disappear within a few days or so. Some people also experience flaking when they first use AHA Skin Smoother. This is normal. It means the cream is working, exfoliating the dead skin. Flaking is also a temporary situation.\n5. Does Moisturizing Mist replace a body lotion like the Skin Calming Talcum Lotion? go to top\nNo, either product is a wonderful body moisturizer. It simply depends on your preference for the type of formulation. You may wish to use a combination of the two - Skin Calming Talcum Lotion is a wonderful after shave product - women could use it on legs and bikini areas and men could use it, of course, after shaving. Then use Moisturizing Mist on the rest of the body.\nMoisturizing Mist enables you to moisturize your own back without having to have someone else to massage a moisturizing lotion or cream into the skin for you. It's also great for the hair - just spray on after shampooing. It helps protect the hair from damage from the blow dryer and it stops tangles.\n6. Harper Botanicals has no shaving cream for men. Why not? go to top\nThere are three products that men use for shaving - Cucumber Cleanser, Triple Protein Conditioner and Tea Tree Face Wash. Men are finding that they get a very smooth shave, their razors don't clog and the life of the blade is about a third longer. (Tea Tree Face Wash gives a great lather if you like to use a brush!)\n7. What is the biodegradability of the Harper Botanicals products? go to top\nAll \"wash off\" products, such as shampoos, body wash and facial cleansers contain biodegradable surfactants and the formulations contain nothing harmful to the environment. There are no biodegradability studies on the creams and toners, as biodegradability is not an issue with these products. These products are massaged into the skin, thus very little, if any, would ever enter the environment. In any case, 90% of the molecular structure of the ingredients in these products is biodegradable or inert.\n8. Are there any sunscreens in the moisturizers? go to top\nThere are no sunscreens in the moisturizers and we do not plan to add them. It is not possible for a daytime moisturizer to cover all bases. Daytime moisturizers are applied once a day but SPF's should be reapplied several times a day. The amount of sun protection you require also depends on the activities you are engaged in that day. We suggest that you use a sunscreen containing the correct SPF factor for you on any particular day. The sunscreen should be applied over your moisturizer.\n9. I know Harper doesn't do animal testing, but are any of the ingredients in Harper Botanicals formulations animal-derived? go to top\nNone of our products contain animal-derived ingredients.\n10. My hair is very fine and even combing breaks it. Does Harper Botanicals have anything that will help? go to top\nYes. Shampoo with the Deep Cleansing Shampoo - it contains botanical extracts that will expand the hair. Try to hold the hair straight back just as the hair stylist does to avoid tangling hair when shampooing. Follow with the Triple Protein Conditioner and leave it on for at least thirty seconds. Rinse well. Spray with moisturising mist. Then comb and dry as usual.\nAll trademarks, trade names, logos, product images and product names are Copyright 2002 Lifestyles International Holdings Corporation\nLifestyles Independent Distributor\n"}, {"score": 760.7874, "uuid": "e896e28f-0a55-59a6-870e-deda03666d11", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-00-00266", "target_hostname": "www.allure.com", "target_uri": "http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2011/12/makeup-ideas-using-your-moistu.html", "page_rank": 1.2177251e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Makeup Ideas: Using Your <em>Moisturizer</em> as Makeup : Daily Beauty Reporter:", "snippet": "&quot;It will break up whatever caking <em>or</em> settling has happened.&quot; Get glossy eyes.

I always put on my various creams in the morning and night. But turns out those jars and tubes can come in handy even when you're not trying to hydrate. Backstage, makeup artists have been using moisturizer as makeup for years with glowing results. We rounded up some of our favorite uses that you can easily try yourself.\nCut your foundation Is your liquid foundation feeling a little heavy all of a sudden? Moisturizer is a great way to sheer it out. Start with and equal amounts of each\u2014one pea-sized dot of foundation and one of moisturizer mixed together on your palm. Then, depending on how much coverage you need you can play with the ratio, says makeup artist Troy Surratt. \"If you need more pigmentation, do one third moisturizer and two thirds foundation.\" Mixing the two together has added benefits as well: \"The moisturizer gives your foundation added slip so it blends better and hydrates the skin at the same time. And it will give the appearance of your makeup being one with your skin.\"\nAs a midday touch up. If you find that over the course of the day your foundation is settling into fine lines or you've over-powdered certain parts of your face, Surratt recommends a bit of moisturizer. \"Tap it on to those areas with your ring finger and gently blend,\" he says. \"It will break up whatever caking or settling has happened.\"\nGet glossy eyes. Spreading a thicker moisturizer over you lids, like Elizabeth Aden 8 Hour Cream , is a common makeup-artist trick. It adds a serious dose of shine to eye lids. Just this past season I watched Pat McGrath do it at backstage at the Prada, Lanvin, and Balenciaga shows, and Stephan Marais try it at Haider Ackermann. You can layer it over bare lids, or over your favorite shadow for a high gloss finish that is both futuristic and luxurious. Don't forget to use waterproof mascara when you try this or you might end up with raccoon eyes.\nHighlight your skin. Makeup artist Romy Soleimani recently divulged this secret at an Allure shoot: Shimmery luminizers on mature skin tend to highlight fine lines and wrinkles. To avoid this, dab your moisturizer around the outer corners of your eyes to create the same sheen a pearly cream or powder would. Backstage at Balmain, makeup artist Tom Pecheux used moisturizer in a similar way to highlight the skin. He prepped the models' skin with a mini massage using Est\u00e9e Lauder Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator and DayWear moisturizer. Next, he evened out their skin with foundation and concealer (only where needed\u2014nothing too heavy), and then, to create what he called a \"natural highlight,\" he applied transparent powder to just the T-zone so that the models' cheekbones remained dewy and radiant, but without a hint of shimmer.\nRELATED LINKS:\n"}, {"score": 759.3341, "uuid": "30a41540-74f8-53cc-a554-7b7b85b98477", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1005wb-51-01335", "target_hostname": "usa.loccitane.com", "target_uri": "http://usa.loccitane.com/FO/Almond-Milk-Concentrate,p29LC200A0.htm", "page_rank": 1.2116227e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Almond Milk Concentrate | <em>Moisturizers</em> | 7 fl.oz | L\u2019Occitane USA", "snippet": "the almond milk concentrate <em>is</em> <em>what</em> started my obsession with almost all the almond milk products. as i&#x27;ve said before, if you could bottle the almond milk scent as <em>a</em> perfume (<em>or</em> parfum), i&#x27;d savor it as <em>a</em> finishing touch after <em>a</em> shower with almond paste, almond shower oil and <em>a</em> post shower slathering", "explanation": null, "document": "L'Occitane Almond Milk Concentrate 7 fl.oz [X]\nAlmond Milk Concentrate\nItem # : 163108\n(82 review(s))\nL'OCCITANE blends both tradition (the use of almond proteins to firm the epidermis) and science (soft silicium to help support collagen synthesis) into a silky, concentrated milk that nourishes and smoothes the skin.

You can call it by any name, but &quot;baggy method&quot; <em>is</em> popular and very descriptive of this hair care method. You use plastic caps, baggies <em>or</em> some women opt for plastic wrap.", "explanation": null, "document": "Question: What Is The Baggy Method for Black Hair?\nAnswer:\nYou can call it by any name, but \"baggy method\" is popular and very descriptive of this hair care method. You use plastic caps, baggies or some women opt for plastic wrap. The goal of the baggy method is to keep your hair moisturized and to prevent breakage of those delicate ends; if long hair is your ultimate aim, you may want to try this on a regular basis or at least from time to time. Some ladies who have long tresses swear by it.\nWhile many women only use this method on the ends of their hair, some women apply it to their whole head. Here's how it works:\nOnly on the Ends\nIf you're suffering from extremely dry, crispy ends, it will take a while to notice a difference, but persistence is key in fighting dry hair . The baggy method is a good way to do this. At night, comb or finger comb through your hair, dividing it into several sections. Apply a moisturizing agent on your hair's ends, working it in with your hands or comb so that they're saturated. Good moisturizers include plain olive oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil, shea butter and sweet almond oil. However, if you have a commercial product that works well at keeping your hair soft and supple, use that. You may also want to use a leave-in conditioner first, and apply oil on top of it. After applying your product, place a plastic bag (sandwich size or smaller is suitable) over your ends and secure the bag with a rubber band. Make sure the band is over the bag and not on your hair -- you don't want the elastic tugging at your hair all night. A variation on this is the ponytail method, which you can use if you either don't have time to separate your hair into different sections or just prefer a simpler way to baggy. Pull hair into a loose ponytail and moisturize your ends. Apply a bag to the ends and secure. Cover your hair as you normally would for nighttime protection and remove the bags in the morning.\nOver the Entire Head\nMaybe you need an overall moisturizing treatment. The baggy method works for an entire head, too. Comb or finger comb through your hair well. Apply products listed above, but instead of only focusing on the ends, work them through your entire head of hair. Wrap your hair around your head; it doesn't need to look perfect. Now take a sheet of plastic wrap and place it firmly around your whole head; alternately, use a cheap plastic cap and secure it with a big elastic band. Leave it on overnight. Unlike \"baggying\" the ends, which many women do nightly, you may just want to do the whole-head method once a week or so.\nCautions\nSome women view the baggy method and think, \"Well, if keeping my ends covered and moisturized overnight is so beneficial, then what can be wrong with keeping my hair in plastic for a whole week?\" The answer to that is \"Plenty!\" This method is fine for overnight use, but hair needs to breathe and dry itself out. It's not healthy for hair to be constantly wet or damp. Unfortunately, some women get caught up in \" hair growth challenges\" and walk around with wet ponytails or buns all day long. Don't do it. Let your hair air dry and breathe regularly. It will be much healthier as a result. You'll still reap the protective benefits of the baggy method, even if you don't do it religiously every night. Use it as needed and over time, your hair should feel better and suffer less breakage. As with any routine, persistence is key for making it work and seeing results.\nSuggested Reading\n"}, {"score": 756.41034, "uuid": "c5314ffc-ece8-5ac0-87d9-c9186b94cbb6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1902wb-89-08826", "target_hostname": "www.pinksith.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pinksith.com/2011/06/ojon-damage-reverse-restorative-shampoo.html", "page_rank": 1.2062177e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Pink Sith: Ojon Damage Reverse\u2122 Restorative Shampoo and <em>Conditioner</em>", "snippet": "I let the <em>conditioner</em> sit on my hair while I washed my face and body and then rinsed.

Sure Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren were in it too, but I really just remember River Phoenix.\nimage from IMDB.com\nIt's funny how one little thing leaves a lasting impression.\u00a0 For example. About 7 years ago I received a tub of Ojon Oil for my dry, damaged hair.\u00a0 It was from a friend of a friend and honestly, it came without instructions or even that cool wooden comb.\u00a0 The oil had liquefied in her hot car and I had no idea it was supposed to be solid.\u00a0 I slapped it on my dry hair and the smell was reminiscent of a dirty ashtray and the consistency of olive oil.\u00a0 I let it sit on my hair for what seemed like an eternity and then rinsed it out and washed my hair normally.\u00a0 The end result.\u00a0 Greasy stringy hair that seemed to be lifeless and limp.\u00a0 The Ojon oil went straight into the trash.\u00a0 I then proceeded to shun all Ojon products for years afterwards.\u00a0 Here is what I didn't know.\u00a0 A) The oil the friend of a friend gave me was not supposed to be liquid nor was it supposed to smell like a dirty ashtray.\u00a0 I have no idea what she did to it to make it smell that way, but having since smelled a fresh jar I know that her jar was off.\u00a0 B) I should have waited until it solidified before putting it in my hair and having a wooden comb...or any comb for that matter would have helped me evenly distribute the oil through my hair. C) I applied probably three times what one normally should to their hair so when I attempted to wash it out, it was no wonder why it didn't rinse clean the first time.\u00a0 D) I should have had instructions.\nThe lesson learned. Buy a hair product from the direct source NEW and UNUSED.\u00a0 It's really sad that I didn't follow that incredibly logical and basic advice.\nFlash forward to this year and the loverly people from Ojon contacted me to see if I would be interested in trying some of their products.\u00a0 Specifically the Ojon Damage Reverse\u2122 line .\u00a0 I was hesitant at first but since I knew my past experience was NOT typical and I knew I was going to be coloring my already heat damaged hair, I agreed to try out the shampoo and conditioner.\u00a0 When I received two 2 fl oz bottles from Ojon. (One conditioner and one shampoo.)\u00a0 I immediately opened them up and NEITHER one of them smelled like a dirty ashtray!\u00a0 I was heading in a positive direction.\u00a0 They both smelled slightly herbal but not flowery at all.\u00a0 This was definitely something that both men and women could use without the perfumy after effects.\nBoth Ojon products contain Ojon Oil.\u00a0 What is ojon oil you ask?\u00a0 Well let me tell you.\u00a0 It's oil from the Ojon Palm Tree.\nSee? Simple.\nOK.\u00a0 As a little back story, along the Caribbean coast of Honduras and all of Nicaragua lies the Miskito Coast (AKA Mosquito Coast).\nimage from wikipedia.com\nThe Miskito People, an indigenous tribe to this region of Central America, have inhabited the land for centuries.\u00a0 It was the Miskito people that introduced the founder of Ojon, Denis Simioni,\nto the now celebrated Ojon Oil produced by the nuts of the Ojon tree in Honduras.\u00a0 Once researching the benefits of this oil and seeing the restorative aid it gave to dry damaged hair, Mr. Simioni knew he had unlocked the key to, as Ojon calls it, \"nature's golden elixir\".\nOjon Oil is high in essential lipids similar to those in unprocessed, virgin hair. Found only in the rain forests of Central America and harvested and extracted by hand from the nuts of the fragrant Ojon tree, this oil has been used for centuries to restore perfect health and vitality to hair.\u00a0 Ojon products do not contain Parabens, Phthalates, Propylene Glycol, Mineral Oil, PABA, Petrolatum, Paraffin, DEA, Synthetic Color or Animal Ingredients (except cruelty-free honey & beeswax).\u00a0 So far I was really starting to like the story behind this brand.\u00a0 When I found that the Ojon company uses eco-friendly practices to ensure the purity of the oil as well as the welfare of the land and the people that live there I was extremely pleased.\nSo what about the Ojon Damage Reverse\u2122 Restorative Shampoo and Conditioner?\nimage from Ojon.com\nThe shampoo is pearly and high foaming. It washed my hair well removing every last bit of dirt and oil from my hair.\u00a0 Unfortunately my hair was a tangled mess after using this shampoo. I have very fine hair that does tangle easily so your results may vary. I really had a hard time avoiding tangles when using this shampoo.\u00a0 The shampoo rinsed cleanly from my hair and I did not feel like it left a film or any residue.\nimage from Ojon.com\nThe conditioner is creamy. It spreads easily through my hair and was helpful in combing out the tangles I had from the shampoo.\u00a0 I let the conditioner sit on my hair while I washed my face and body and then rinsed.\u00a0 The conditioner rinsed away easily. It still left some slip to my hair (which is what I prefer when rinsing out a conditoner) and did not cause my hair to tangle at all.\u00a0 It did not leave any strong scent which is also a plus.\nAfter washing and towel drying my hair I used my regular hair styling products (leave in conditioner/defrizzer, and gel at the ends of my hair) and allowed my hair to air dry. I planned to flat iron my hair after it air dried. Once dry my hair felt ever so slightly heavier than normal. It didn't hold my natural curl as well and it seemed straighter than usual.\u00a0 This is NOT\u00a0 a bad thing.\u00a0 When trying to straighten my hair I kind of WANT my natural curl to be relaxed a bit.\u00a0 I would like to note that my hair felt INCREDIBLY soft. I mean. not frizzy soft, but silky soft!\u00a0 In fact, my hair looked SHINY!\u00a0 My curly hair rarely looks shiny...it was amazing that my hair looked shiny before I flat ironed it.\u00a0 This was definitely a plus.\u00a0 But how would my hair look after flat ironing it?\u00a0 EVEN more shiny! Plus my hair did not feel crunchy and dry after flat ironing it like it normally does.\u00a0 My hair was soft, shiny and beautiful!\nDo you NEED this?\u00a0 Well if you do have damaged hair from dyes/chemicals, blow drying/flat ironing, and/or from physical damage from excessive brushing or binding (hair bands) then YES, I think you could benefit from the Ojon Damage Reverse\u2122 Restorative Conditioner.\u00a0 However, the result I had may vary based upon the overall health, texture and type of your own hair.\u00a0 The result was also cumulative. I did not experience immediate results after the first use, but it did look good after the first use.\u00a0 Once I used this product more and more, my hair looked better and better. I did not use this shampoo and conditioner every day. I washed my hair every other day and still used my regular non Ojon styling products after washing. I still encountered the tangling issue when using the shampoo every time I used it so I do not recommend it. But I highly recommend the conditioner. Thank goodness I didn't let one bad experience ruin a whole product line for me!\nOjon damage reverse\u2122 Restorative Shampoo retails for $24 /8.5 fl oz and $10 /2 fl oz. The Ojon damage reverse\u2122 Restorative Conditioner retails for $25 /8.5 fl oz and $10 /2 fl oz.

While a lot of them are very effective, there are a few that could harm your own skin due to the hazardous chemical compounds which these commercial moisturizers contain. In addition to that, they could also be very expensive. To make sure that what you will be applying on your skin is nothing but purely valuable, you might as well create your own whipped moisturizer out of natural ingredients.\n* Prepare the essential items\nThe very first thing you must do is to collect all the essential items in your work space. In this way, you can work in a very organized manner, enjoy making the task much more, and even finish it faster. Be sure to have the following things on hand before you begin creating the whipped moisturizer: African shea butter, jojoba essential oil, pure Argan oil or Moroccan essential oil, coconut oil, natural aloe vera gel, vegetable glycerin, and a blender.\n* Gauge the ingredients\nPrepare 10 ounces of shea butter, two tablespoons of jojoba essential oil, five drops of Moroccan oil, four ounces of coconut oil, two ounces of natural aloe vera gel, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable glycerin.\n* Mix the ingredients together\nGet the mixer and put in all the components. Then, safely put the lid of the blender and turn the blender on to moderate or mid-high speed. Let the mixer work on the ingredients for around three to five minutes, until the mixture has a smooth and also well-blended consistency. The combination should look like a pudding. Turn the blender off, and, if required, clean the sides of the mixer, and also the blades, so none of the combination is under-blended.\n* Put the moisturizer in thoroughly clean containers\nObtain containers which could hold your whipped moisturizer, and make sure to clean them thoroughly. Your containers must be clean, so that your moisturizer will not get contaminated by harmful microorganisms. Be sure to dry these containers thoroughly before utilizing them. Once these containers are set, slowly pour the moisturizer into each container. Close their particular lids firmly, and be sure to keep them inside a cool, dark place.\n* Apply the moisturizer on your skin\nThis kind of home-made whipped moisturizer is quite effective in moisturising your skin. After getting out of the bath, simply scoop a few of this moisturizer utilizing your hand. Then, apply this directly onto your face and body. You may also utilize the moisturizer by massaging the skin to improve its absorption. Massaging is also very beneficial because it increases blood flow, that brings along fresh air and nutrients which can be very beneficial to your skin. Give more focus on the very dry areas of your body, just like your elbows, knees and also heels, to improve their condition.\n* Apply it to your hair\nYou may also get excellent moisturizing effects on your hair if you use this home-made whipped moisturizer on the hair. All that you should do is use the whipped moisturizer like your typical hair conditioner, and wash it completely.\nYou can further enhance the effects of your whipped moisturizer by living a healthy life, such as refraining from smoking, wearing sunscreen, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough rest.\nWritten by Zeta C.

I want to introduce all you Moms AND Dads out there to a great company called TruKid . TruKid products are BPA free, Phthalate free.

I know it may not be the first thing you think about when you go to the store and pick up some shampoo or body wash for your children but it should be. TruKid has created a handy sheet you can print out and take with you to the store so the next time you're shopping you can refer to the guide. So what ingredients are in the \"bad guys\" products?

I know from now on when I shop for my children's skin care products I will be taking the Toxic Bad Guys worksheet with me to the store.\nMy review:\nWe received the Sunny Days SPF 30+ Face and Body Stick and Cool Conditioner to review from TruKid. Both of these products couldn't have come at a better time for us to test out especially the Face & Body stick since we left for the beach the day after it came!\nI was so excited to give them a test out! Every year we go to the beach we are super careful to make sure both kids (and us) have plenty of sunscreen on. I slather them with it and they complain so the stick was great! My 5 year old was able to apply it to his face all by himself and he liked the fact he was able to do it on his own. The stick works well for the face however we tried to use it on the body and it was a litter harder to apply.\nAfter about 4 hours out on the beach TruKid was still working great I noticed no redness on their skin. I even used some myself on my face and it even worked great for myself! Oh and by the way Sunny Day's stick is mineral, non-chemical sunscreen and it's all natural and water resistant!\nBeing I have 2 boys, conditioner is not something we use since they have short hair. My oldest son has super thin hair so its not a\u00a0necessity\u00a0for him. However, within the past few months my youngest son's hair has gotten super thick and I've noticed after we wash his hair it gets\u00a0tangled easily. We gave TruKid's Cool Conditioner a try out on my\u00a0youngest's\u00a0hair. I have to say it worked excellent. It made his hair feel silky soft and\u00a0smooth\u00a0and his hair was easier to comb afterwards. TruKid's Cool Conditioner is\u00a0dermatologist\u00a0and pediatrician tested and free of all the harsh chemicals I mentioned above.\nSo what else is great about TruKid? The smell! I was a little worried at first since we have never tried it before that it would have no smell since it's all natural. I love for my kids to smell clean and fresh after they take a bath and smell fruity :) TruKid smells absolutely amazing especially the Cool Conditioner!\nOverall I am truly\u00a0satisfied\u00a0with TruKid products. I would LOVE to try their shampoo and body wash sometime. Since my oldest son has\u00a0eczema\u00a0I know its a product I can trust and use safely on his skin since, like I mentioned its all natural and free of any funky chemicals!\nTruKid is\u00a0available\u00a0for purchase in their online store . The Sunny Days SPF Stick retails for $9.99 and the Cool Conditioner retails for $8.99! You can use coupon code dancingmom and get a FREE Dancing Detangler with any order of $30 or more, if ordered on TruKid's online store!\nGIVEAWAY ALERT!\nThe folks at TruKid are giving 1 lucky winner the same products I reviewed which, is the Sunny Days SPF 30+ Face Stick and the Cool Conditioner!

It's billed as the first moisturizer to target and measurably reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles and \"help skin behave in a younger way.\"\nEst\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s exclusive Sirtuin EX-1 Technology and Tri-Hyaluronic Complex work in synergy to create an optimal environment to reverse skin\u2019s perceived (visible) age while also optimizing skin\u2019s behavior. So skin not only looks younger, but behaves younger too, according to the company.\nIn order to better understand what causes skin to prematurely age and aim to visibly reverse it, Est \u00e9e Lauder conducted a five year age measurement study on hundreds of different women aged 20-70. The initial research, conducted in New York and Belgium, included the comprehensive evaluation of 77 \u201caging markers \u201d which were then narrowed down to a final list of more significant markers, measured through a combination of visual and non-visual clinical assessments, bioinstrumentation and biological testing.\nThis study allowed Est\u00e9e Lauder scientists to quantitatively evaluate\u2014for the first time with three different approaches\u2014the impact of the factors that affect the way skin looks and behaves. As a result, they were able to not only identify patterns of aging, but also develop new targeted technologies to address the key anti-aging concerns of women.\nThe study identified that the following factors most contribute to the aging of women:\n65% of premature skin aging in the overall age group of 20-70, is made up of visible markers such as lines, wrinkles, age spots, firmness and texture. Within the 30-55 age group, lines and wrinkles contribute to 48% of a woman\u2019s perceived age, making it the single greatest factor in skin aging.\n35% of premature skin aging in the overall age group of 20-70, is due to non-visible changes in the skin\u2019s behavior such as moisturization, impact of glycation and the loss of natural cell renewal capacity.\nApplying these findings, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand developed Time Zone Line and Wrinkle Reducing Moisturizers to target these key markers and allow skin to appear and behave younger.\nWhen cells are damaged by factors such as UV exposure, pollution and glycation, they age before their time and begin to lose optimal function. When these prematurely aged cells accumulate, they impact the behavior and function of the skin and the aging process is accelerated\u2014lines, wrinkles and other visible signs of aging become more apparent. In essence, skin looks and behaves older, faster.\nTime Zone Line and Wrinkle Reducing Moisturizers contain two new and exclusive technologies that reverse this cellular aging process and dramatically reduce the look of lines and wrinkles. By creating an optimum environment, skin not only looks years younger, but acts as it did years ago.\nSirtuin EX-1 Technology: Est\u00e9e Lauder developed the technology to help skin naturally stimulate its proteins, thereby helping skin cells renew their innate ability to withstand daily assaults. The key ingredient in this technology is a patented hydrolyzed anti-aging rice extract, which helps skin behave in a younger way to reverse away the visible years.\nTri-Hyaluronic Acid Complex: An industry first, the complex is said to be a unique blend of three hyaluronic acid technologies that work at multiple levels in the skin to help replenish, rebuild and sustain the ideal moist environment for more lineless, youthful looking skin. This complex differs from traditional hyaluronic acid because it not only replenishes moisture to the skin but also rebuilds and sustains skin\u2019s own natural hyaluronic acid deep within the skin\u2019s surface.\nThe combination of Sirtuin EX-1 Technology and Tri-Hyaluronic Acid Complex is what makes Time Zone Line and Wrinkle Reducing Moisturizers a breakthrough in anti-aging moisturizers. An optimally hydrated environment is created through the Tri-Hyaluronic Acid Complex, while the Sirtuin-EX-1 Technology works to optimize the behavior of the skin. The result is skin that looks and behaves younger.\nAging cells are \u201crevived\u201d while skin feels deeply hydrated, plumped and toned, with a naturally volumized look from deep within. Skin regains the responsiveness of younger days, resisting the daily environmental aggressors that accelerate aging and the formation of lines and wrinkles. In clinical testing, every woman tested showed a reduction in the look of lines and wrinkles, according to Est\u00e9e Lauder.\nNews Calendar\n"}, {"score": 728.27045, "uuid": "c24f42d8-19e4-56c7-87b4-2de5ee113f64", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-58-22226", "target_hostname": "www.adahlshouse.com", "target_uri": "http://www.adahlshouse.com/category/miscellany/", "page_rank": 2.6622025e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>A</em> Dahl&#x27;s House \u00bb Miscellany", "snippet": "For me, it was <em>a</em> time of realizing that \u2014 for <em>better</em> <em>or</em> worse \u2014 certain doors had closed and \u2014 for <em>better</em> <em>or</em> worse \u2014 certain life directions (like being single) weren\u2019t likely to change.

The key is to ensure that the aromatherapy is customized according to the needs and wants of the individual. An aromatherapy practitioner will be able to identify the blend of essential oils that will create the desired results. Whether an individual seeks stress and pain relief, beautification and cleansing, or general relaxation aromatherapy can be a great tool to improve your life\nThe use of aromatherapy to aid in the relaxation of the mind and body is highly recommended when one is under extreme stress. It is important to implement aromatherapy in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle. There are blends that are created to promote happiness, calm and serenity.\nAromatherapy can be used in a number of different ways. It can be applied as relaxing massage oil, added to a soothing bath as a salt or oil, or used in air fresheners or diffusers. Aromatherapy blends can also be created as inhalants or skin applications. The goal of aromatherapy in stress relief is to help create an over-all sense of well-being. The aroma and a good massage can help improve an individual\u2019s sense of well-being.\nEssential oils can also be beneficial in weight loss. The scent of vanilla infused candles has been shown to reduce cravings for sweets. Inhaling patchouli seems to lessen hunger. Both of these methods can lead to weight loss.\nSmell confidence-inducing bergamot and jasmine blend to overcome your weight insecurities. Blend 16 drops of bergamot with 4 drops of jasmine and mix in a diffuser. 4 drops of veviter can be added to kick the mixture up a notch.\nThe older we become, the more various body pains are noticed. You can ease these pains through aromatherapy blends prepared in massage oils, skin creams, or booboo juices. To make your own massage oils, you can mix an ounce of carrier oil of your choice with 10 drops of essential oil. Choose an aromatherapy essential oil that you like. The mixture can be applied to ease away the aches and pains in the specific areas of the body affected.\nIt should come as no surprise that aromatherapy has been used in skin care for years. It is a natural approach to a fresh, youthful look. You can make your own natural skin products from shampoos and conditioners, to facial toners and moisturizers. Mouthwash, lotion, nail care, perfumes, and cologne can all be made using the soothing aroma and benefits of essential oils.\nAbout the Author:\nLooking for a complete guide to aromatherapy?

According to the Advil Nighttime Take Action Audit, 84 percent of Canadians that have a poor night\u2019s sleep due to aches and pains say they are less productive and more easily distracted the next day. Common pain keeping us Canadians awake, says Dr. Moscovitch, include muscle and joint pain, headaches and back pain.\nHere a some strategies to help you snooze more soundly:\nMake your bedroom dark at night. Turn off the lights, pull down your blackout shades and close the bedroom door to create a dark environment in your bedroom. Why? Light will make your body think it\u2019s daytime, which will affect your ability to get a good night\u2019s rest.\nExercise regularly. If you\u2019re tired, how can you be expected to work up a sweat? You might be sluggish at first, but the more you exercise, the easier the workouts will become, and your fitness regime will translate into more sound and longer periods of sweet slumber. Bonus: research has shown that regular exercise will improve how awake you feel in the daytime. Remember, though, if possible, refrain from working out within a couple of hours of bedtime or you may find yourself too revved up to calm down and sleep.\nGet out of bed if you\u2019re tossing and turning. \u201cIf you wake up in the middle of the night and you can\u2019t fall back asleep, don\u2019t stay in bed,\u201d says Dr. Moscovitch. \u201cGet up and go somewhere else,\u201d he says, and do something that relaxes you, whether that\u2019s meditation or just practicing some deep breathing.\nHeat things up.

These things are totally optional but they will help.\nYou want your scalp to begin getting used to the routine you'll follow after to dread your hair. This will make the transition easier and you'll reduce the chances of getting an itchy scalp.\nTip: Some of this is mentioned in Dread Vlog 2B (starting around 5min:50sec) and it's continued in Vlog 2C so if you haven't seen those you can check them out here: Dread Head Dreadlocks Video Page\nThe two changes your scalp will notice will be a change in washing frequency (every day to every 3 days) and a change in stimulation (because you won't be brushing your dreads).\nYou can ease the transition by getting your scalp used to these changes a head of time. Go ahead and adjust your washing routine so you're washing every 3 days. Of course you can wash the rest of you every day but give your hair three days. Rinsing is also fine if you are active and you need to. If there are any issues try every 2 days instead.\u00a0This will make it easier for your scalp to adjust to the new washing schedule when you get your dreads. Your scalp will already be producing less oil and your scalp won't itch from a sudden change.\nWashing frequency is important. Try to be as consistent as possible. If you decide on washing every 3 days don't wait 2 days sometimes and 4 days other times. The most important rule however is not to allow your scalp to be itchy. Itching leads to scratching and irritation. That's complication you don't need. So if your scalp is itchy go ahead and wash. Even if it means breaking a consistent routine. This goes for before and after you have dreads.\nYou need to continue combing/brushing your hair because if random knots form they will make it more difficult to backcomb the hair properly later. Continue brushing and combing but instead of sliding the comb or brush against your scalp like normal, reduce this contact by brushing the hair without touching the scalp as much and let your scalp begin adjusting to less stimulation. We have a specialized hair pick called a head honcho . It allows you to rub and stimulate your scalp after you have dreads without damaging the dreads. By combing less before you dread and using the head honcho after you dread, you can pretty much eliminate transition issues and have a much more enjoyable experience.\nFor the last week or so before you dread it up, stop using conditioners and, if possible, shampoos that contain residues like moisturizers, scents, herbs and oils. If you already have dread soap you can start using it a week or two before you dread. Of course this is optional but it will make backcombing easier and make the transition smoother.\nThe day you dread you should wash your hair really well with the dread soap . Because it's residue free it will \u00a0remove oils and leave your hair truly clean. Before your hair dries, wet it down with the Locking Accelerator and let it dry. When it's totally dry you are ready to get dready. :)\nYou might also be interested in this post about ways to help your hair grow faster .\nIf you have really straight hair you can give it more texture by braiding it for a couple days before you dread. Since you can section it the way you want your dreads to be sectioned you won't have to worry about sectioning on the day you backcomb - just unbraid and backcomb each section as you go. This also allows you to have professional help with the braiding before your dread party day.\nGet a few friends to help. The more the better.... seriously! This will make it a lot easier. Trying to do it yourself or with just one helper is making things harder than they need to be.\nAlways dread dry hair. You can spray Locking Accelerator on the hair before it dries. It will cut the time it takes to dread it and make the knots stay in better.\nIf you are planning to bleach or color your dreads do it at least a week or so before you dread it. Don't use the conditioner that comes with the color. This will actually make it a bit easier to dread. Make sure you follow the bleaching instructions carefully, you don't want to weaken the hair. Keep in mind that bleaching usually requires re-bleaching as the hair grows. You have to be extremely careful not to re-bleach the same areas. You will fry and kill your hair/dreads.\nNote: You can color and bleach it after it's dreaded, it's just a lot easier to do it before, especially the rinsing out part!\nDont forget our Epic Search!\nIf you're looking for something specific try our Epic Dreadlocks Search!\nLoading\n"}, {"score": 669.23676, "uuid": "7992782e-a874-5321-b259-eb70eecff98b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1906wb-25-09945", "target_hostname": "www.pinksith.com", "target_uri": "http://www.pinksith.com/2010/08/yuko-system-repair-through-leave-in.html", "page_rank": 1.2020865e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Pink Sith: Yuko System Repair Through Leave In <em>Conditioner</em>", "snippet": "Well if you have damaged <em>or</em> dry hair <em>or</em> hair that <em>is</em> prone to breakage this <em>is</em> <em>a</em> wonderful light weight leave in <em>conditioner</em>.

We are all familiar with Joeybunny and her amazingly curly hair that is the envy of most people (including me) around the world. I have...well...I have confused hair. My hair is straight in places, curly in others, wavy and frizzy. It is a mousy ash blonde leaning more towards brown and fairly fine. I have a fair amount of hair and sometimes it takes a long time for it to dry, but all in all my hair is bleh. It's neither bouncy or shiny or dry or normal. I am prone the split ends and recently cut off about 5 inches of my hair to get rid of the last of my color and damaged ends. I would now say that my hair is of normal quality and not overly dry or damaged, but had the tendency to break and split easily so I have to baby it often.\nWhy am I telling you soooo much about my hair?\nWell recently I was contacted by a rep from Yuko-USA who asked if I would be interested in trying a product from their home care line. Yuko is a Japanese Hair Straitening system that is apparently very effective for certain kinds and textures of hair. It touts itself as not only hair straightening, but hair repair. The philosophy at Yuko is that healthy hair is the first step to achieving the style you want in your hair. Developed by the beautiful and business savvy Yuko Yamashita, the Yuko Straightening system caught on rapidly in Japan and was patented in the US in 2000. Their main salon is located in Beverly Hills, CA, but they have many independent salons and stylists that have been trained in the Yuko method and are certified to provide the process, nation wide. You can lean more about the Yuko straightening system by reading HERE . To find a salon near you that provides the Yuko Straightening system you can click HERE . This post is not about the straightening system, but about a leave in conditioning product that is part of the Yuko hair care line.\nThat Product Is...\nYuko System Repair Through Leave In Conditioner.\nYuko Repair Through is a liquid spray in product designed to condition and prevent split ends and breakage. It will help protect against heat styling with a blow dryer and flat iron and is supposed to add shine and moisture to the hair.\nI have used a lot of products that claim to add shine tot he hair. I would say that 90% of those products don't do a damn thing for shine in my type of hair....so needless to say I was skeptical that Yuko Repair Through would work for me.\nThe product comes in a generous 6.8 fl oz spray bottle. The liquid is a translucent white and it has no scent at all to it.\nOK. Just an aside. I freakin LOVE that it has no scent. With all the scented shampoos, conditioners and styling products I put in my hair, I'm on fragrance overload by the time I even get to my perfume of the day! I want the perfume to make a statement, not my hair products.\nOK. Back.\nI use about 7 sprays in a sweeping motion in my below the shoulder hair. I comb it through and then apply an anti frizz serum and gel. I blow dry my hair or let it dry naturally and then I flat iron it. I have a flat iron I really like by Sedu. It works very well and I like the results, but until I started using this Yuko Repair Through I had never seen my hair so shiny before. With my hair being light in color and curly/frizzy sometimes it's hard to get that shiny look you see (DIGITALLY ENHANCED) in those Pantene commercials, but I swear to god that after using repair though for about a month, when I flat iron my hair I have that shiny hair I see in commercials!! It's not AS shiny of I blow dry alone, but my hair is left incredibly soft after using Yuko Repair Though. Even if I don't blow dry or iron my hair, when I use the Yuko Repair through my hair feels so wonderfully soft and bouncy.\nOMG!\nI have bouncy hair!\nI could be a Breck Girl ! (1970's reference)\nSeriously though. Not since my discovery of Terax Life Drops have I fallen in love with a hair product. I haven't even used my beloved Terax Life drops for over a month and I don't miss it what so ever. Best of all, the Yuko won't weigh my hair down. Since I have very fine hair, too much product leaves me looking a greasy flat hair mess. Not so with the Yuko Repair Through! The product is very light but still provides enough moisture to my hair to keep it looking healthy. Best of all. I have noticed fewer split ends in the areas of my hair that normally split. Yuko Repair Through could extend the time between hair cuts, saving me much needed money! I am converted!\nThe Yuko Repair Through retails for $24 from the Yuko website, but if you do a google search you can find some other eTailers that sell it. (I have no idea of those other eTailers are reputable. Caveat emptor !)\nI have been using Yuko Repair Through for about a month and I was my hair every other day, but some times it's every day depending on how hot it is outside....And i have the majority of the bottle left. Since I only need a few sprays per use, I expect it to last a long time.\nDo you NEED this? Well if you have damaged or dry hair or hair that is prone to breakage this is a wonderful light weight leave in conditioner. The price per use is very reasonable.

You'll find lots of shampoos with herbs, essential oils,\u00a0 and other \"natural\" additives. Some of these additives supposedly to stop itching, others claim to help with dandruff, most just smell pretty and sound good on the label but they all have one thing in common: The end up as residue left in your dreads.\nSome other dread shampoos now claim low residue or no residue because they realize the advantages and wish they could provide them, but some quick research shows they are totally full of it....residue I mean.\nWe've even seen the \" residue free \" claim on Castile soaps and other home made oil based soaps. Castile soaps can be made from a variety of vegetable oils, often olive oil, or animal fats. Traditional Castile soaps have been used for ages. Prized by those who swear by the silky, soft feeling these soaps leave on the skin. The layer of film they leave behind acts as a conditioner for the skin helping avoid dryness. This film or residue can be seen in the sink or bath tub as a \"soap ring\" after these soaps have been used. This visible precipitate is a by product of the calcium and magnesium ions in our water combining with the soap as it tries to clean.\nIt probably won't surprise you much that this layer of film also acts as a conditioner that helps knots slip apart and dreads loosen. While the residues left behind on the skin provide a benefit, moist skin, the same residues sit inside dreads, and hold moisture there as well, making it tougher and tougher for your dreads to dry and increasing the chance they'll grow mildew and you'll get \"dread rot\". These soaps can be used for dreads but if you plan on keeping your dreads long term you need to have a plan in place that remove residue regularly so build up does not occur and lead to dread rot.\nThe real pity is that \"dread rot\" never occurs early on. It's not until the dreads get tighter that holding moisture becomes an issue. We've heard from too many people that have cut off beautiful, two or three year old dreads that had been healthy for years and then began drying slower and slower due to build up of residues, which eventually led to getting \"the rot\". Man that sux. In addition to using the right soap there are some other things you should know about getting dreads dry after you wash them.

It is time consuming, but I never let my hair hold me back from exercising. My hair is short, and I wear a wet look on occasion and then I wrap it and curl it too! I have to shampoo my hair after I exercise. I\u2019ve heard women say that they can tie it up with a scarf, exercise, and let it dry and comb it out. That never really worked for me. I shampoo it and set it under the dryer at night, because most of my workouts are in the evening. I\u2019ll sit under the dryer for 30 min. and then let it air dry thru the night. I still add a few curls in the morning, and overall my hair is healthy. I exercise 4-5 days a week, and my hair adds about an hour to my evening ritual. It can be done, it just takes a little more time.\nStacy\n17\nI\u2019m natural. My hair is loc\u2019d up and I\u2019m loving it. I was never the type to keep up with a perm anyway. I wash my hair twice a month but do a good maintenance once a month. I do oil my hair like every other day. I know it may seem a lot but it seems to work on my hair.\nI have been locing for almost two years now and I am still trying to figure out different styles to put my hair in. All in all, going natural seems to be working out for the best for me. It\u2019s low maintenance and great work out hair.\nNini\n18\nI have locs and I love the easy maintenance of them. That said, when I did have relaxed hair I didn\u2019t care about sweating it out and doing what I had to do but I love my hair how it is now.\nTo avoid too much frizzing when I\u2019ve re-twisted I just tie something around my hair when I work out and that usually does the trick.\nI wash my hair with Aubrey Organics honeysuckle shampoo and conditioner, keep my hair and scalp moisturised with hair smoothie when I feel it getting dry and that\u2019s it. I like to keep it real simple.\nKimberly\n18.1\nConfession time!!!! I usually wear tightly curled half wigs that match my half natural, half permed hair as much as possible. I wash, condition, and trim my hair every week and a half. If it itches, I spray some dr miracles on my scalp. This is the easiest for me until I grow my perm out and will probably become completely natural. Works well during workouts, because when I perspire, My hair in the front becomes more curly/crinkly\nAmanda\n19\nI have no helpful advice to offer but I love, love, love that picture. The eyeshadow, hair, jewelry, and the top all together? Fantastic. Vintage in feel without being gimmicky. Great look.\nEugenia\n20\nI struggled for years with my hair. In 2000 I noticed that my hair was thinning out in the top. I went to my dermatologist and he told me that if I didnt let the chemicals go I would be bald in a matter of a year. That is when I started my natural journey. I wore a fro for a while and like Erica I do practically nothing to my hear and I barely wash it. I now have sister locs and I love the freedom\u2026 I use jane carter natural products\u2026. So I say free your hair\u2026\u2026.. Wink\nbinks\n21\nI\u2019 am still newly natural so I\u2019 am wearing my hair in a tweeny weeny puff for now but when school starts up for me I\u2019 am just going to get it braided so it is one less thing I have to worry about during the semester and since I usually up my work out for some reason during school time having it out of my way makes it even better. But usually I do a quick co-wash after have my trusty leave in and grapeseed oil on deck and go\nMalpha\n22\nMy hair is relaxed, but I haven\u2019t gotten another one since March, so it\u2019s been five months growing it out now. It was kind of a two-fold decision to do so, one to see what my hair texture looked like (it\u2019s been relaxed since I was around 5) and also because a lot of people say going natural when you\u2019re working out is easiser. And ehhh, it\u2019s kind of on notice right now, honestly! I actually sweat a LOT more with the unrelaxed new growth than I did with keeping the relaxers current, seriously my face will be drenched\u2026.it sucks, cause it dries my hair out and I look a slam mess. :\\\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve been trying different styles than when I had it relaxed\u2026then it was just a wrap at night with the CHI Silk Infusion, comb down in the morning, and mid ponytail during working out. I was actually a low-maintenance relaxer person, I didn\u2019t do styles cause I couldn\u2019t afford them (I do home relaxers, which are cheap and I only got one about every 10-12 weeks). But that doesn\u2019t work anymore, so I\u2019ve been on Youtube trying to find something to do with it (there are so many YT tutorials, it\u2019s crazy!), currently it\u2019s flexirods or bantu knots in it\u2026.with varying success 1) cause it\u2019s humid as crap out and 2) my natural hair is very fine and doesn\u2019t want to hold a style.\nSoooo, idk about long term\u2026the dryness issue and the lack of it holding a style is making me think I\u2019m going to have to settle for braiding my hair in some protective style all the time, which just seems depressing, plus I hate braids and intricate braids are expensive, but on the other hand, I\u2019m hoping as the months go on that it doesn\u2019t turn out to be so bad. So yeah, the hair is on notice. One day I\u2019m hoping to have access to one of those Dominican hair salons and let them deal with it!\nBernadette\n23\nI\u2019m with you on the low maintenance thing! I get my hair straightened maybe 1 or 2 times a year, otherwise it\u2019s either pulled back in a \u201cbun\u201d or out and curly. For workouts I either leave it in my bun or if I had it out I literally tie it up in a ball on the top of my head (the benefit of having long hair) and stick a hair pin in to keep it from falling out. Post workout I rinse it out, put some leave in conditioner on it and sleep with a towel on my pillow. I rarely use shampoo as well, I\u2019m talking, like, quarterly. My parents thinks this is gross, but my hair started growing significantly when I stopped shampooing it all the time so they can say what they want.\nCurlstar\n24\nI have Sisterlocks and my hair is very low maintenance. I love it because I\u2019m lazy \u2013 I mean I\u2019m a busy mom of 2 young boys.\nI do the standard snatchback (ponytail) for my workouts, or 2 ponytails that look like my own tribute to princess leah from star wars, or I keep my hair in the braids or cornrows that I slept in. I work out first thing in the morning. I shampoo weekly and braid or cornrow my locs at night (when I don\u2019t crash in the bed). I use witch hazel between shampoos to freshen up. I sleep on a \u201csatin\u201d pillowcase or I use a bonnet.\nMost of the time I do what is called a freestyle, where I just shake and go or I take the time to curl my hair at night \u2013 if I am that lucky.\nPerkisha\n25\nI\u2019ve been natural for about 4 years. If my hair is out (I have a fluffy, coily fro), I wear a bonnet/stocking cap to sleep and fluff on the morning before tying a bandana in the front and hitting the gym. Otherwise it\u2019s twisted up, and I wear the twists in two cornrows with a bandana. I rinse about every other day, and fluff and refresh with gel/water/rose water, style and go to work. Easy as pie! Only thing, I can\u2019t really do attested styles (like braid outs or twist outs) without planning, because once sweat/moisture hits my hair it\u2019s coily automatically. But the trade off of health and a hot body is worth it!\nDominique\n26\nLet\u2019s see.. I guess if you had to call it anything, it\u2019d be known as \u2018natural..ish\u2019. I\u2019ve mentally told myself that I would give up relaxers, since I\u2019d merely sweat them out anyway in a matter of days/weeks. Still, after 3 months or so of going cold turkey, the new growth is piling back on, and things are becoming pretty hectic. Braids have been taken into consideration and all, but in the end I\u2019ll probably keep it as is, wash and condition often, flat-iron only when I\u2019m actually going somewhere, and let it dangle in a half-arsed mess of a ponytail. Otherwise, I\u2019ll just use a clip to hold the hair from blocking my view and keep the back down.\nMissyD\n27\nMy hair is natural and has been for about 7 years now. This year I had to shave it a few times (long story) so right now I rock a short haircut. It\u2019s great because it\u2019s also low maitenance. But due to my hair sometimes being kinda dry and me dying my hair red, I moisturize like crazy. I co-wash everyday for moisture and due to the fact that I workout everyday and I\u2019m in the military, so my hair gets pretty filthy. So co-wash, spray with some oils, and leave in condtioner then I brush my hair and I\u2019m done. I use Shea Moisture Brand products. Once I grow my hair out longer my routine will probably change but we\u2019ll see. I do enjoy not having to do much to my hair.\nsydney\n28\nRunning 4 miles every morning was my reason for going natural. Plus my body looked awesome in a swim suit and I wanted to swim, not sit around pool side looking cute! lol. I just couldn\u2019t deal with having to pin my hair up and the sweat and craziness. You know the transition period was the worst-2 hours a day. One day I had enough and cut off all of the relaxed hair. I\u2019ve never looked back. Now, I\u2019ve put on weight since then so I\u2019m back to square one but now I don\u2019t have an excuse not to work out. I don\u2019t know how folks stay active (or swim) with a relaxer but hey, whatever floats your boat.\nsydney\n28.1\nI forgot to add a routine. Laziest hair routine ever: Clean with apple cider vinegar once a week and Dr. Bronner\u2019s every other week. If I\u2019m not being too lazy I will steep herbs with the ACV for a week. A little jojoba oil the morning after I clean it. I need to start making some concoctions with herbs and oil, though.\nCoCo\n29\nMy hair has been natural for years. It\u2019s finally long enough to do something besides wear a wash \u2018n go, but I\u2019m not super confident with doing the other styles I see online so I usually just wear my \u2018fro with a headband.\nI cowash almost daily. I deep condition a lot and I moisturize with shea butter. When I get fed up with how thin my hair is and how easily it knots, etc. I get braid extensions.\nRenee\n30\nI\u2019ve just joined the ranks of the napturals. I\u2019ve always wanted to do it since relaxers were stealing my hair with impunity. I have balding edges and a nice vacant spot dead in the center of my crowning glory. It\u2019s been abused, so it had no choice but to fight back. I\u2019m now using a nightly mix of jojoba oil, emu oil, sweet almond and lavender oil to massage in my hair.\nI wash twice weekly with conditioner\u2026.no shampoos\u2026.too harsh. I used to use Suave coconut conditioner, now I swear by Herbal Essence\u2019s hello hydration\u2026.it really hydrates and cleans. There is a really expensive product called Wen that is a great product, but I found one that is very similar and only cost 4.99 that I picked up at Ross\u2026.so I use that to cleanse my hair because its not harsh.\nThe Organic Root Stimulator Olive Oil Smooth-n-Hold Pudding is a godsend for 4.00+. If you use twist or otherwise\u2026.this is great. I like to roll my hair on satin rollers (they actually exist), so when I use the pudding it takes a while to dry. I will only use it on Saturday night and unroll for work on Monday. Otherwise, I will use Eco Styler Olive Oil Styling Gel currently on sale for 2.99 at Sallys. It works miracles without the alcohol. It will hold a curl and keep your hair soft.\nWhen I wash, I will use a shea butter/jojoba/sweet almond/grapeseed oil mixture. I make sure that I get my ends really well, but avoid the scalp because the shea will coat it.\nKiana\n30.1\nYes! I love Smooth and Hold pudding! It\u2019s the perfect moisturizing gel. It holds well without making your hair crunchy and hard and with almost no buildup.\nKiana\n31\nI\u2019m fairly low maintenance with my hair as well. I wash it weekly, moisturize every other day. I may relax it every 2-3 months just to be able to glide a comb through it. My hair is dense, but like my mom its also fine, so neither of us need to straighten very often. For styling, I just pin it back and wear a \u201cquick weave\u201d or \u201chalf wig\u201d. These are the hair pieces that have combs in the front and back and you can choose to comb your hair over on top of it, or to avoid too much styling like me, just wear a small headband to cover the edge of the hair piece. These allow me to switch my hair style up without having to pay a lot for it or without heavy styling. I have a high stress career and my hair tends to break in certain areas when the stress is really high, so intense daily styling it out for me.\nAjali\n32\nI am natural. I workout 5 to 6 days a week so i wear my hair braided or twisted to keep my hair stretched to avoid knots and tangles when time to wash for the week. right now I am on a hair journey so I just wear protective styles 99% of the time. for working out I tie my hair with a satin scarf to keep my hair from frizzing due to the excessive sweating in my head. If my hair starts to develop an odor from sweating i rinse it during the week. im not pressed on afros and styles right now my number 1 objective is good health holistically.\n"}, {"score": 650.0145, "uuid": "b689f8f6-c1bc-5cc8-a44c-e9e63775ba7c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0717wb-23-06225", "target_hostname": "greenasathistle.com", "target_uri": "http://greenasathistle.com/category/shampoo/", "page_rank": 1.1740081e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "shampoo \u00ab Green as <em>a</em> Thistle", "snippet": "You can read more about <em>what</em> I learned in my book, Sleeping Naked <em>is</em> Green, <em>or</em> just keep reading this here blog.

But it sure looks like pee, doesn\u2019t it? (That stuff in the bottle on the left, by the way, is baking soda and water, which refuse to interact with one another unless shaken vigorously). Anyway, this is besides the point. The point is: After one failed attempt last year to wash my hair with nothing but vinegar, I decided to give the whole natural approach to hair maintenance another shot.\nReader Melinda over at One Green Generation convinced me that her homemade system would leave my hair shiny and clean without also leaving me with an I\u2019ve-just-spent-all-day-at-a-fish-and-chip-shop smell.\nNeedless to say, I was skeptical. However, as part of my new semi-regular series From the Pantry to the Bathroom , I want to make more of an effort to try new things \u2014 more specifically, new homemade things.\nSo I took a few minutes this morning to assemble the recipe, then followed her directions, which go like this:\n1. Use an old shampoo bottle (well-rinsed) or a squeeze bottle. Mix 1 part aluminum-free baking soda to 3 parts water. Each time you use this solution, shake well to mix.\n2. Squeeze the baking soda solution onto your dry scalp, then massage your scalp for several seconds.\n3. Leave in for 1-3 minutes, and rinse completely.\n4.

Eight daily glasses of water is a rule of thumb, Gerken says, and switching out dehydrating coffee and sodas for water can help.\nHot, hot \u2026 not!\n\u201cHot water removes your natural skin oils more quickly. Warm water is best for bathing,\u201d according to a tip sheet prepared by the American Academy of Dermatology. The academy also recommends limiting time in the shower or tub to five to 10 minutes a day and moisturizing right after bathing when skin is still moist and before shaving.\nLimit sanitizers\nHealth authorities recommend the use of hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of germs, but many contain a high percentage of alcohol, which can dry skin, according to the dermatology academy. Frequent use can chap and crack skin, which can allow germs to enter. Use sanitizers sparingly when soap and water is not available, or switch to less-drying formulas that dermatologists can recommend.\nLearn to love gloves\nExposed extremities tend to take the brunt of the elements, dermatologists say, so cover your hands outdoors. Also protect your hands with rubber or latex gloves when doing dishes or laundry by hand. And that old remedy of soaking hands for a few minutes in warm water, putting on a salve or rich lotion and then wearing light cotton gloves to bed can soothe dryness.\nCheck the label\nSodium lauryl sulfate, a degreaser, acts as a sudsing agent in shampoos and soaps and can be harsh and drying. The dermatology academy recommends gentle hair and body cleansers. Gerken says switching to less-sudsy products with botanical oils or other moisturizing ingredients may be an option.\nBrush your scalp\nFlakiness and flyaway hair are common winter problems that have their roots in the scalp, says Latasha Peden, cosmetologist with Ravenscroft Beauty College. Brushing might seem to lead to more static, she says, but it\u2019s actually good for removing dry, and dead skin cells from the scalp. Natural hair oils also are more evenly distributed if you brush, she adds.\nSwitch products\nTry a shampoo or conditioner product with tea tree oil for flakiness or a slightly heavier conditioner or leave-in spray oil to add shine for winter dryness, Peden says. And, don\u2019t neglect a trim, she says. Hair dries out at its older ends and will look better with them removed.\nUse moisturizers\nGerken says it\u2019s a good idea to carry a moisturizing lotion to combat the effects of frequent handwashing. Also keep a moisturizer by the sink and tub, and don\u2019t forget to use moisturizing lip balm. With scores of products on the market, what you use is largely a matter of personal preference, she adds, noting a higher cost doesn\u2019t mean a product is better.\n"}, {"score": 618.26965, "uuid": "5b332364-4d81-5c14-b9bb-bc9ea2b8b772", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1600wb-74-24734", "target_hostname": "www.brudirect.com", "target_uri": "http://www.brudirect.com/index.php/Style/7-ways-to-wake-up-to-better-skin.html", "page_rank": 1.182334e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "7 Ways To Wake Up To <em>Better</em> Skin | Style", "snippet": "While you should apply <em>a</em> facial <em>moisturizer</em> (preferably one with SPF) in the morning, make it <em>a</em> point to apply <em>a</em> night cream&#x2F;<em>moisturizer</em> before hitting the sack.

Unless you like camping out in the woods at night, snooze time is the only time of the day when our skin is protected from harmful elements, such as the sun, wind, and pollution.\nAlso, our body repairs and restores itself whenever we're at rest-which means our skin uses that R&R to repair all that damage it underwent during the day.\nSo get in those eight hours of sleep to put the \"shine\" in \"rise and shine\"! Get the most out of your beauty sleep with these following tips:\nRemove all traces of makeup. Removing makeup can be just as tedious as putting it on. But never skip it! Makeup can clog your pores, keeping your skin cells from \"breathing\" or \"turning over.\" What's more, clogged pores can cause blackheads, whiteheads, and acne! You can use moist facial towelettes to gently swipe the makeup off your face.\nFollow with a non-comedogenic cleanser formulated for your skin type, then tone. Relying on soap and water to simply wash it off often still leaves traces of makeup and dirt.\n'Feed' your face with antioxidants. While you should apply a facial moisturizer (preferably one with SPF) in the morning, make it a point to apply a night cream/moisturizer before hitting the sack. Pick one that's rich in antioxidants, to better fight off free radicals. Our body temperature is higher at night, thanks to our muscular activity during the day, coupled with all the food we ate. This means our skin gets to absorb skin care products better, so take advantage of the change in temp by feeding your skin well!\nTake advantage of your skin's detox times. Studies have shown that skin cells regenerate, collagen is boosted, and harmful free radicals are destroyed between 11 in the evening and 4 in the morning-which means those are your skin's peak detox times. This is the best time to prevent fine lines and wrinkles by slathering on those Vitamin A/retinol-enriched night creams and serums! Vitamin A encourages faster turnover of skin cells, pushing newer cells to the surface. Retinol makes your skin sensitive to the sun, so what better time to apply it than at night?\nTake care of your hands. If your hands get so much work done during the day, apply hand lotion on them before slipping on a pair of gloves. This helps trap moisture and makes sure the lotion penetrates well into the skin. Got extra rough hands? Put foot lotion on them! Foot lotions tend to be heavier and have more moisturizing properties.\nZap those zits. Since bacteria and oil can clog your pores during the day (and worse, do more damage to already-existing zits), treat acne with pimple meds while you sleep. You'll be less likely to swipe them off with your hands, or dilute them with makeup. Dab a bit of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid on the spot to dry the pimple out.\nMake your lips kissable. Lip balm while you sleep? Why not! Just because you're not out and about doesn't mean you shouldn't pamper your perfect pout. Your lips can get dry while you sleep, especially if you sleep in an air conditioned room or tend to breathe through your mouth. Gently scrub your lips with a soft-bristled toothbrush twice a week (this helps slough off dead skin cells). Before going to bed, apply a coat of your favorite lip balm, or even just plain petroleum jelly-then wake up to more luscious lips.\nIncrease humidity. You're drying out your skin even further if you sleep in an air conditioned room. That's because air conditioners reduce humidity-which also means a reduction in skin moisture. Create a makeshift humidifier by placing a bowl of clean water next to your bed at night. This increases moisture in the air.\n--Courtesy of yahoo.com\n"}, {"score": 613.4023, "uuid": "2cdc14dd-8187-533d-8cad-d8a6ca67ec25", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0503wb-54-24079", "target_hostname": "www.getridofthings.com", "target_uri": "http://www.getridofthings.com/glossary/almonds.htm", "page_rank": 1.1734765e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Benefits of Almonds - <em>A</em> Healthy Choice", "snippet": "Hair and skin are often the first place one notices poor health <em>or</em> inadequate nutrition.

This is the good kind of fat that your body needs. Multiple studies have found that diets containing almonds and other nuts containing monosatured fats helped to lower the bad cholesterol levels in the body. Lowering the bad cholesterol in your body reduces the risk of heart disease that you may face, with some studies claiming it reduces your risk of a heart attack up to 30%.\nBenefits of almonds include their ability to help you lose weight. Almonds are high in fat, so it may seem counter-intuitive that almonds will help you lose weight. They will though. Why? The fats in almonds are considered \u201cgood\u201d fat: monosaturated fat. This type of fat has many benefits (including cardiovascular and heart health) and is essential for a healthy body. What\u2019s more is that this type of fat, as well as the high amount of fiber and protein found in almonds, help you to feel fuller longer. The nut-rition (get it?) combined with the full-feeling will keep you from snacking late into the night and give you energy to get through your day.\nAlmond benefits include energy. Whether it\u2019s mid-semester malaise or that two hour block of wasteland before leaving the office, everyone hits a slump. Instead of sucking down another gut-wrenching pop (or the non-Midwestern \u201csoda\u201d) or shaking down the coffee pot for another dose of caffeine, consider having some almonds, instead. The nutritional punch of almonds includes lots of protein, fiber, monosaturated fats, and multiple vitamins and minerals. All of these add to your energy cache for the day. What\u2019s better is that almonds don\u2019t pack on \u201cempty\u201d calories like sugar, so you won\u2019t have another crash in twenty minutes, but feel feel and more energized for hours.\nAlmonds benefit your skin and hair. Almonds are an excellent source of many nutritional goodies (see the sidebar for a partial list). One of these goodies is vitamin E. Many people are familiar with vitamin E as a skin-friendly vitamin. It is. Also, almonds contain high levels of protein, niacin, folic acid and more. All of these help to keep you and your skin and hair healthy. Hair and skin are often the first place one notices poor health or inadequate nutrition. If you don\u2019t like to eat almonds, almond oil makes an excellent skin moisturizer and hair conditioner; make your own or buy a commercial almond moisturizer or conditioner.\nAlmonds can be used to get rid of dull, flaky skin. Store-purchased face and body scrubs are not only expensive, but they often contain many chemicals that aren\u2019t so good for your skin and body. Crushed raw almonds make a wonderful natural face scrub or natural body scrub. Be sure to use raw almonds (flavors won\u2019t do anything for your skin nor will roasting). Crush them and add them whatever else you\u2019d like to have in the scrub. Honey is a natural skin remedy that I prefer, but you can use olive oil, vitamin E oil, or many other ingredients. Gently scrub the mixture on and rinse off for exfoliated, fresher skin.\n\u201cEat as close to the earth as possible.\u201d\nA nutritionist once told me this, and it stands as one of the most important health tips I\u2019ve ever received. Not to sound too hippy-dippy here, but the earth provides everything we need, nutritionally speaking (iPods are another matter). Most of the human \u201cimprovements\u201d to food are not really improvements at all. Additives, dyes, preservatives, and flavor \u201cenhancers\u201d are almost always bad for you and get in the way of the real nutritional benefit of foods. Raw almonds are going to be far healthier for you than roasted, salted, and lime-flavored almonds. If you want to lose weight, feel fuller, have more energy, and have clearer skin, you\u2019re not going to find it in a pill; eating natural foods will do it for you. Ditch the Doritos; almonds are a great way to add many health benefits to your life, simply and easily.\nAlmond Nutrition\n"}, {"score": 605.86633, "uuid": "70d36966-ca73-52d4-a09a-3b2352f34e64", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1602wb-43-26735", "target_hostname": "www.drrons.com", "target_uri": "http://www.drrons.com/beware-additives.htm", "page_rank": 1.1847191e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Magnesium Stearate - <em>What</em> <em>is</em> it doing in your supplements?", "snippet": "But whether <em>or</em> not the contaminants found in the magnesium stearate are benign <em>or</em> harmful <em>is</em> not the issue. The issue <em>is</em> that it was contaminated at all.", "explanation": null, "document": "(page 1 of 1) Articles Home\nMagnesium Stearate - What is it?\nMagnesium Stearate in supplements\nMagnesium stearate is a white substance, solid at room temperature, used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and supplement tablets and capsules. It is composed of magnesium and stearic acid, and oftentimes, palmitic acid as well.\nWhy do so Many Companies add it to Their Supplements?\nThe primary role of magnesium stearate in supplements is to act as a lubricant to prevent tablet and capsule contents from sticking to the machinery that processes them. This ensures that production machinery can operate at maximum speeds and profit targets can be met. In other words, it is primarily used for financial reasons. Read a detailed explanation of magnesium stearate\u2019s role as a lubricant in manufacturing facilities.\nWhat are the Pros and Cons of Magnesium Stearate?\nPros\nThe pros are for manufacturers that want to improve profit margins. It is far more costly and time-intensive to produce supplements without magnesium stearate.\nCons\nBrand X With Stearates - Will Not Dissolve\nDr. Ron\u2019s Dissolves Easily\nIt is commonly noted in medical literature that magnesium stearate increases the time it takes for tablets and capsules to dissolve due to the film it forms on capsule or tablet ingredients. Magnesium stearate coats a good portion of the molecules in a tablet or capsule, requiring digestive enzymes to break down the magnesium stearate coating before being able to access the nutrients it envelops.\nIn a study published in the journal Pharmaceutical Technology (April, 1985), the percent dissolution for capsules after 20 minutes in solution went from 90% without stearates to 25% with stearates. In other words, stearates reduced the rate the capsule dissolved by 65%! This may result in the nutrients not dissolving in the appropriate section of the intestines as intended. We are particularly concerned about individuals with impaired digestion who may have more difficulty absorbing nutrients coated with magnesium stearate.\nAre there metal catalysts in your supplement?\nHydrogenated oils are a common source for the magnesium stearate used in pharmaceuticals and supplements. The stearates are made by hydrogenating cottonseed or palm oil. Cottonseed oil has the highest content of pesticide residues of all commercial oils; cotton crops are heavily sprayed. In the hydrogenation process, the oil is subjected to high heat and pressure in the presence of a metal catalyst for several hours, creating a hydrogenated saturated fat. Hydrogenated vegetable fats contain altered molecules derived from fatty acids. According to Udo Erasmus in Fats and Oils, the metal catalyst used in the hydrogenation process may also contaminate the stearates produced.\nThe #1 supplement that\nDr. Ron recommends for those 50 and older\n\u201cLive to be 150\u2026Can You Do It?\u201d was a recent ABC News/Barbara Walters special that featured scientists talking about stunning new research on this supplement\u2019s amazing effect on longevity. Read more\nSource Country\nThe vast majority of magnesium stearate in supplements comes from China. At Dr. Ron\u2019s Ultra-Pure we have a policy of not using any ingredients from China due to the long list of contaminated ingredients and products coming from China in recent decades, including melamine-tainted baby formula which resulted in hundreds of babies being hospitalized and melamine-tainted pet foods in which thousands of pets were reported to have died, among other tainted items. In 2007, product safety institutions in the U.S., the European Union and several other countries, imposed import bans on many products produced in mainland China due to a confidence crisis. We prefer to work with manufacturers in countries with an excellent history of product safety. We are not saying that every supplement containing magnesium stearate sources this lubricant from China, but China just happens to be a major source of the ingredient. And this does not meet our quality standards for Dr. Ron\u2019s nutritional supplements. We would certainly be happy to consider ingredients from China (although not additives!) if and when the manufacturing industry in that country develops a history of safety and quality.\nContamination\nIs your supplement contaminated?\nIn December 2011 The World Health Organization reported that several batches of magnesium stearate were cross-contaminated with zeolite (sodium aluminium silicate), calcium hydroxide, dibenzoylmethane, bisphenol A and Irganox 1010. While some of these substances may not be harmful, as is the case with zeolite, others are known to be harmful, such as bisphenol A (BPA). The industrial chemical BPA is an endocrine disruptor and has been found to have other harmful effects. The European Union has banned its use in baby bottles and several consumer groups in the U.S. have petitioned the FDA to ban its use in food containers. But whether or not the contaminants found in the magnesium stearate are benign or harmful is not the issue. The issue is that it was contaminated at all.\nWhile we don\u2019t know the percentage of supplements in the U.S. that are contaminated, according to a New York Times article \u201cNearly all of the herbal dietary supplements tested in a Congressional investigation contained trace amounts of lead and other contaminants\u2026\u201d There have also been news stories over the years about contaminated supplements, such as heavy metals in 20 percent of Ayurvedic herbal products tested in the Boston area in 2004. Clearly, contamination is an issue of concern.\nDo you know what you\u2019re putting into your mouth?\nWhile magnesium stearate is certainly not the only supplement ingredient ever found to be contaminated, the potential for contamination is just one more reason to avoid it. If you do wish to consume supplements containing magnesium stearate, it would be a good idea to ask the manufacturer if they batch-test the supplement for purity. If not, then you really don\u2019t know what you are putting into your mouth.\nWhile we believe that contamination is a concern, we do not support stricter government regulations on dietary supplements due to contamination issues. These issues could be much better addressed in the way that we here, at Dr. Ron\u2019s Ultra-Pure, address it: batch testing.\nAlthough we have a great deal of trust in our ingredient suppliers, which are mainly in the U.S., Europe and New Zealand, we nonetheless have the raw materials that go into our supplements independently analyzed. Our certificates of analysis demonstrate the purity of our products. Here are a few sample assays:\nAlpha LipoPotasic Acid: Assay: 99.72%; Loss on Drying: 0.25%. Purity thus tested at 99.97%.\nGlucosamine Sulfate Potassium: Assay: 99.88%; Loss on Drying: 0.072%. Purity thus tested at 99.952%.\nWhy Buy Dr. Ron\u2019s Ultra-Pure Additive-Free Supplements?\nGrassfed New Zealand cattle are the primary source of Dr. Ron's Ultra-Pure organs and glands\nWhat is on the label is what you get\nRaw materials are independently analyzed for purity\nQuality, quality and quality!\nDr. Ron has formulated our supplements since 2000 based on his experience treating patients as a naturopathic doctor since 1981\nMany of our supplements are based on Dr. Weston Price\u2019s studies of the foods that made robustly healthy native peoples disease-resistant, including our organs and glands, fermented cod liver oil and\nX-Factor butter oil\nRemember, the sole purpose of using magnesium stearate is to make the machines go faster.

Microcrystalline hydroxyapatite concentrate (MCHC) is the best source of calcium, with the full spectrum of trace minerals that comprise healthy bone. Our MCHC is cold processed to preserve the protein matrix and organic factors, and its crystalline structure is verified by x-ray diffraction studies.\nOrgan Delight - The Ultimate Traditional Superfood\nAnimal organs and glands were considered the most essential foods in traditional cultures everywhere. In modern times, scientists have shown that proteins specific to individual organs selectively travel to the corresponding organs of the person consuming the animal organs. Our Organ Delight contains 9 raw-processed organs and glands, considered the most essential foods in traditional cultures.\nDoc\u2019s Friendly Flora - Enhanced Microbial Probiotics\nIn both liquid or capsules, Doc's Friendly Flora contains a wide variety of probiotic species, including SBO's. The synergy and interdependence between species is responsible for its powerful beneficial effects. These organisms work together to help each other digest a wide range of materials and to produce a wide variety of antioxidants and nutrients. They have a profound antioxidant effect in regulating biochemical processes, which strongly discourages the growth and proliferation of harmful species and markedly enhances health.\nKrill Oil\nScientists and physicians have discovered that krill oil is helpful for a host of conditions. Krill oil enhances mood, strengthens the heart, and improves cognitive function, while reducing inflammation, pain and stiffness. It is rich in DHA, the fatty acid that makes up some sixty percent of brain tissue. This is why krill helps brain function - studies have shown significant improvement in concentration, mental function and memory after ninety days of taking krill oil supplements.\nThe Super Nutrient\nthat\u2019s Getting a lot of Attention\nThis amazing fat-soluble antioxidant, richly supplied in salmon and a few other species of wild seafood, has been reported in clinical trials to:\nReduce the appearance of wrinkles, dry skin, age spots, and freckles\nBoost the brain and nervous system and provide protection from free radicals\nHelp reduce the visible signs of aging\nIncrease strength, stamina and endurance\n"}, {"score": 604.8342, "uuid": "ec7754bc-076e-5608-b6e2-5f596bd1ed29", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0915wb-08-19399", "target_hostname": "islamicinsights.com", "target_uri": "http://islamicinsights.com/features/fashion/visiting-a-masoom-this-winter-what-to-wear.html", "page_rank": 1.2033129e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Visiting <em>a</em> Masoom this Winter? <em>What</em> to Wear!", "snippet": "Perfume for women <em>is</em> not forbidden, <em>what</em> <em>is</em> forbidden <em>is</em> wearing HEAVY <em>or</em> ALLURING perfume in front of men who are unrelated.

And definitely for going to Friday prayer at the local mosque, correct? So why not take care of your appearance when you go to visit a Masoom?\nIn the coming winter months, many people will be blessed with an invitation to go for Hajj and Ziyarat. If you're one of those lucky sisters, then you'll need to start preparing for the trip on multiple levels. From spiritual preparations to packing, there are many things to be done as you get ready to be one of Allah's guests.\nPresenting yourself well is a sign of respect and a form of devotion to the Holy Masoomeen (peace be upon them), and just because someone is modest doesn't mean it is acceptable to wear wrinkled clothing and be in an un-groomed state if one can help it. Apart from your arrival in Karbala and while you are wearing Ehram during Hajj, Islam always recommends taking care of one's appearance when visiting holy places.\nLet Style Watch help you out with packing clothes for these visits! For our special Hajj packing list, click here . By packing the things that are right for you to be comfortable, presentable and modest during Ziyarat in winter, you will be freer to focus on the main purpose of the trip while you're actually there: getting closer to Allah through your devotion to His loved ones. Even the act of packing at home for the Ziyarat of Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) brings blessings, so come on, get out your suitcase! Here's what you'll need:\nOuterwear\nModest black abayas : preferably closed-front ones as they look neater. It is a good idea to bring two, and you can buy more on the trip if desired.\nAdditional black covering to wear over the abaya: required for entry into almost all the shrines except perhaps in Madina during Hajj season. To make it easier to handle, you should secure it to your headscarf with a straight black pin, black plastic oval hijab pin, or small black safety pins. You can use a large opaque rectangular black cloth (dupatta) pinned to the headscarf, which is the easiest option as it doesn't reach the floor but is still accepted as sufficient extra covering by the staff at almost all the shrines. The alternatives are a full-length Iranian chador or Iraqi abaya, which also should be pinned to your headscarf for ease of handling.\nWinter coat: if taking a woolen one, consider packing a lint brush so you can tidy it up regularly; except in Karbala, you don't want to arrive at a shrine looking all dusty!\nGloves: will likely be needed in Syria, Iraq and Iran at this time of year.\nInnerwear\nTrousers: three pairs \u2013 regular-weight or winter-weight; if you have a choice, black ones look best with black abayas.\nThermal leggings: two pairs to wear underneath regular-weight trousers.\nSweaters or cardigans: Optional if you are bringing a coat and thermal tops already.\nThermal tops: two pairs; great if you want warmth without the heavy bulk of sweaters and sweatshirts. Optional depending upon the warmth level of the shirts you bring.\nLong-sleeved shirts: four or five of them; can consider turtlenecks, or long-sleeved tees will work if combined with thermal tops underneath. Don't bother bringing short-sleeved tops as it will be too cold and you don't want to be bothered with hijab sleeves at Wudhu time while traveling (if you want to buy some sleeves to take home though, you'll find them easily at shops around the shrines). A long-sleeved top will take care of warmth as well as loose abaya sleeves that slip back and expose the wrist and arm.\nUnderclothes: bring enough to last for the entire trip, plus extra sets, so you don't have to worry about laundry for these items.\nFootwear\nWalking shoes: women's feet need to be covered according to almost all the religious authorities (even during Hajj), so pack shoes you can wear comfortably with thick winter socks. Flip-flops won't work with socks in crowds as they will slip off, and you can also trip on them. It's also best not to take something with laces that you'll have to spend time tying as shoe areas will be crowded; wear something you can slip on and off easily, that will stand up to wet public washroom floors when you need to do\u00a0Wudhu\u00a0somewhere and also the occasional winter rainfall in that part of the world. If you are taking black shoes, pack a shoe-shine sponge/cleaning cloth as they will get very dusty and you will want to clean them before heading off to a shrine (except in Karbala), so that you arrive in a clean state.\nBathroom slippers: bring plastic ones that dry fast and can be cleaned easily; keep plastic bags to dump them in as you pack up to check out of your hotel, as there will be times you only stay at a hotel one night, and they may still be wet when you have to depart.\nSocks: buy a big pack of thick/sports socks, preferably in dark colors if you can find them. Bring enough to last the entire trip as they will get dirty fast and you don't want to worry about doing laundry for these. Wudhu socks are usually great for traveling, but in the winter they will not be warm enough, especially when walking on the cold tiled courtyard floors of shrines; however, Wudhu socks can be purchased in these countries if you want to stock up before going back home.\nHair Control\nUnder-scarf caps : take one or two of your own with you if you have a preference for a certain style and material, because you won't necessarily be able to find the exact type upon arrival at your destination. If you want to stock up you can buy more as you come across them during the trip. Definitely wear these as they will keep your hair under control and provide a neat and tidy appearance for your scarf, which is important since you generally would not want to visit a shrine looking disheveled and also with hair sticking out of your scarf messily as can happen during travel, thereby compromising your hijab.\nScarves: choose dark muted colors like black or brown, not pastels and bright colors that will attract negative attention in places where everyone else is dressed head-to-toe in black. Bring two black ones from home, and you can easily stock up on more scarves during the trip if desired.\nBags\nMain bag: tote bag, messenger/crossover bag, backpack or large handbag. Backpacks are great for keeping your things in, but their straps can expose the outline of the chest when worn over a hijab, so if you use one, make sure to drape your scarf in such a way that your chest is covered properly. You can also wear a crossover/messenger bag whose strap you can keep under the hijab, which will be more convenient for getting things out of since the bag will be more in front of you. For security reasons, this main bag will have to be kept on the group bus or at your hotel while you visit a shrine.\nBag for taking inside shrines: should be a smaller bag with secure closure (zip, Velcro, fold-over flap) that can hold basics like prayer books, tissues, hand sanitizer wipes and so on. Due to security issues, phones, cameras and mp3 players will not be allowed inside, and in places in Iraq, liquids including water and hand sanitizer bottles may not be allowed either. Don't forget to keep a list in this bag of specific prayers and names of people you want to pray for. Bear in mind this bag will be checked thoroughly at security checkpoints, of which there are many in Iraq.\nPlastic bag for storing walking shoes: you may prefer to bring your shoes into a shrine with you due to different reasons, such as having to leave from a different gate or excessive crowds at the shoe counters. If so, keep them in a separate plastic bag to keep them apart from your other things. For security reasons, extra shoe bags like this will not permitted in Iraq though, you will have to check shoes in at the special counters at the shrines.\nSecret travel pouch: optional for storing things like emergency money. Also keep in mind that this will be searched at checkpoints too; consider securing it with jumbo safety pins to your inner clothing for added security in case the string breaks in a crowd.\nGrooming Items\nPerfume: It is highly recommended to apply some before visiting each shrine, except in Karbala, where you should be in a state of mourning and where you should not even eat sweets and meats (consult a book like this one for more information); pack a travel-size bottle, or buy a perfume from the stores around the shrines where you can find many reasonably priced fragrances, from Arab attars to surprisingly good knock-offs of western scents.\nRings: For a lover of the Ahlul Bayt it is recommended to wear a ring on the right hand, and this goes during Ziyarat too, especially when it comes to a ring with a special stone like turquoise. Besides a ring or two and a watch, it's best not to bring any jewelry while doing so much traveling though. Be very careful when doing Wudhu in public places as you don't want to lose a ring down a drain or have it fall out of your pocket while you bend to wipe your feet; consider keeping the rings on and just shifting them around on the finger during Wudhu to be extra cautious. If you don't own any rings with stones of religious significance, consider buying one on the trip as a souvenir and to enhance your acts of worship; you can even make sure to try and touch a specific ring you're wearing (or a piece of cloth or a Tasbih) to every shrine you get to visit.\nChapstick and Moisturizer: Even if you don't normally use these items, you will need them in the winter weather. Also don't forget your personal grooming tools like nail trimmers, tweezers, etc.\nStain Remover Wipes: Buy ones that are individually wrapped. Besides using these for obvious stains and spills, use them on-the-go to touch up the bottoms of your black abayas and chadors which will often get dusty within minutes of stepping outside. Since it won't be feasible to always change or wash your clothes right away, you will want to appear as clean as possible when visiting a shrine, so such wipes will come in handy throughout the day.\nMini Sewing Kit: Including lots of safety pins too, use this kit to take care of a ripped hem, shorten a new abaya, reinforce buttons, etc.\nTravel-size Iron: You wouldn't show up for a job interview in a wrinkled shirt, and a visit to an Imam (peace be upon him) is much more important than any interview, so ensure your scarves and clothes are ironed, and even get wrinkle-free items if you can. Don't depend on hotels to provide irons (or hair dryers either), and remember to pack an electronic converter for these items if you are bringing them.\nHygiene Aids\nTravel-size body soaps and a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner:\u00a0It is highly recommended to do ghusl before visiting each Masoom's shrine. However, in Karbala there is an exception. For Karbala, Imam Sadiq (peace be upon him) has advised that one should go directly for Ziyarat in a saddened, grief-stricken, disheveled state, covered with dust from one's trip and hungry and thirsty, since Imam Hussain was killed while he was in such a state. But one may also do the ghusl and it is considered one of the best acts, especially when done with water from the Euphrates River, which Islamic Insights has been told all the hotels in the area use.\nTravel-size laundry clothesline with clips: can be hung in hotel washrooms for washing clothes by hand. Bring a few hangers too to hang bigger articles of clothing on hooks as they dry, like abayas, and don't forget to pack a small amount of laundry detergent powder in a re-sealable plastic sandwich bag.\nFor public restrooms: while most groups will try their best to ensure that hotel rooms are equipped with western toilets, sometimes there is no choice, especially when you will be on the road traveling in between cities where you may have to use an eastern toilet. Be prepared by keeping a packet of tissues and hand sanitizer wipes (not liquid bottles since those are banned by security in some shrines, such as in Iraq) in your bag at all times, in case there is no toilet paper in the stalls or hand soap at the sinks. If you have never used an eastern toilet before, here are some tips ; taking off your trousers entirely is the safest bet to avoid getting any najasat on them. You need to be extra cautious since you'll be entering shrines on-the-go and will need to be ritually pure; try and leave your bag, abaya, and outer covering with a trusted group member outside the stall as you don't want your stuff to fall onto the wet floors and possibly get impure!\nThe Most Important Thing to \"Pack\": the Right Mindset\nWhether you are visiting Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or a combination of these places, don't forget to keep in mind the status of the holy beings you will be visiting, and behave accordingly. While we can all do Ziyarat from afar, it is a very different feeling to make a visit in person. Where performing the a'amal of Arafah, Ashura, or Arbaeen days in Karbala once seemed like a faraway dream, such trips are now becoming feasible for a number of people, and we should make the most of these visits.\nNote: Don't forget to put one set of all your clothes \u2013 from thermals to underclothes to an abaya \u2013 in your carry-on bag so that you have something to change into upon arrival in case the checked luggage is delayed or lost.\nYou may also want to check out packing suggestions for non-clothing items at these websites (note that Islamic Insights does not necessarily endorse any of these sources; consult your own Ziyarat group for complete packing details):\n"}], [{"score": 600.42096, "uuid": "87960212-5c0b-50c1-b31b-9025b689ebb7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1005wb-54-14673", "target_hostname": "usa.loccitane.com", "target_uri": "http://usa.loccitane.com/FO/rose-pearlescent-body-cream.htm", "page_rank": 1.1782899e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Rose 4 Reines Pearlescent Body Cream | <em>Moisturizers</em> | 7 oz | L\u2019Occitane", "snippet": "Its iridescent properties make it the perfect cream to apply before going out <em>or</em> during summertime.

Sometimes other lotions or creams smell funky after time.\nKimberly P\nCustomer since: 2010\n11/16/2010\nThis was the first time i tried this product while at the airport boutique in Fort Worth.

Now, I&#x27;m mostly writing about whatever the heck pops into my head (isn&#x27;t that <em>a</em> novel concept for <em>a</em> blog?).", "explanation": null, "document": "From the Pantry to the Bathroom: NOTHING! (Or, Listen to Your\u00a0Boyfriend)\nJune 7, 2009\nOK, so this doesn\u2019t exactly conform to the format of FTPTTB in that I\u2019m not about to reveal a moisturizer recipe that calls for olive oil and honey (although I\u2019m sure you could use those ingredients for moistening purposes). Instead, my skin care tip of the day is: Nothing!\nRemember, a few months ago, when I was complaining of that weird rash I had under my eyes after I stupidly used my diluted-vinegar-and-cinnamon concoction \u2014 originally intended as a hair conditioner \u2014 in place of toner? Yeah, a word for the novices out there trying to tackle homemade beauty products: cinnamon and delicate regions of the epidermis do NOT go together. Anyway, I was trying a bunch of different remedies to bring my under-eye area back to normal, including almond oil (nope), safflower oil (nope), vitamin A and E (nope), jojoba oil (nope) and my ever-beloved coconut oil (nope), and while most of these would kind of work temporarily, all it took was one shower or face wash (with or without any soap) for my skin to freak out again.\nNow, my approach when it comes to health or skin problems is to try a natural remedy first; if that doesn\u2019t work, I come crawling to my mother for some good ol\u2019 Western medicine. Of course, I could have tried reconfiguring my diet \u2014 eliminating coffee, alcohol, yeast; introducing more antioxidants, lycopene and whatnot \u2014 but to be honest, I\u2019d rather have rashy eyes and a glass of shiraz in my hands than a flawless complexion and nothing but water after an eight-hour day of work.\nSo my mom gave me some Cortate cream she had lying around the bathroom. Actually, it was lying around my sister\u2019s bathroom, because she apparently applies this stuff liberally for no medicinal reason other than it gives off a nice \u201cglow\u201d (if you\u2019ve read my book, you\u2019ll know this is par for the course in terms of her logic \u2026 and, actually, it does leave a healthy-looking sheen, regardless of how fake it may be).\nNow, although cortisone can be kind of sketchy in high doses, this stuff was only 0.5%, so I figured a few short-term applications of it wouldn\u2019t kill me. And the result: It worked! Well, sort of.\nIt worked temporarily \u2014 I applied it at night and the next morning my skin looked great; even washing and towel-drying my face didn\u2019t seem to hamper its efficacy. But the problem was, as soon as I tried to wean myself off the cortisone, the rash came back within days. Now, technically, I could keep using this cream on a daily basis for the rest of my life, but my gut kept saying, \u201cYour eyes were fine six months ago and they didn\u2019t require any drugs!\u201d This was driving me crazy.\nThe funny thing was, every time I complained about this rash and went about applying yet another new oil or ointment, Jacob would say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just leave it alone? If you didn\u2019t put anything under your eyes before, why are you doing all of this now?\u201d\nHe had a point, but I was sure that if I went to bed at night with rashy under-eyes and didn\u2019t do anything about it, I\u2019d wake up the next morning looking as though I\u2019d contracted some horrible disease.\nBut the other day, out of exasperation, I decided to give it a shot. I had no plans to go out the following morning and, even if that changed, I had some concealer that would at least hide the redness.\nWell, guess what? The boy was right. My eyes felt a little dry, but otherwise looked fine other than a few spots. Another few days of this, and they\u2019re practically back to normal. See for yourself:\n(This is right after I woke up, so I don\u2019t have any makeup on and look kinda tired, but still \u2014 no rash!)\nMoral of the story: Our bodies don\u2019t NEED lotions, potions, creams and exfoliants. Sure, applying some type of oil every now and then (especially in the winter) helps against dryness, as does drinking plenty of water; and of course, if you have psoriasis or eczema , that will probably require some treatment, whether drug-based, food-based or both. But on the whole, it\u2019s always better to opt for a minimalist hygiene routine \u2014 this benefits both yourself and the environment.\n"}, {"score": 593.7701, "uuid": "b52b34df-87de-5a8a-ae68-a04aa35fca27", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1702wb-28-09030", "target_hostname": "thegirlwho.squarespace.com", "target_uri": "http://thegirlwho.squarespace.com/journal/2012/1/27/help-a-scraggly-sister-out.html", "page_rank": 1.1781178e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "- Daily - Help <em>a</em> Scraggly Sister Out", "snippet": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> the must-have product in your beauty arsenal?

She's won a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her role in The Help, not to mention dominated the red carpets of both events in pitch-perfect Tadashi Shoji gowns. I think it\u2019s refreshing to see someone in Hollywood who\u2019s not a size-zero top the best-dressed lists, and I know plenty of other people agree. So can she please stop talking about her weight?\nSpencer mentions the topic so frequently and in such detail that she\u2019s beginning to overshare. On a recent episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the actress told Ellen about a private conversation she had with Melissa McCarthy at a post-SAG celebration. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my god Melissa, I\u2019m about to die, my Spanx are killing me ,\u2019\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd she [McCarthy] said, \u2018I just went to the bathroom and took mine off.\u2019\u201d \u201cI could not party that night because I was being pinched in places I didn\u2019t know it was possible,\u201d Spencer added.\nTo a certain extent, it\u2019s endearing to hear about celebrities and their relate-able struggles. But really, I never wanted to know about (or picture) anyone being \u201cpinched\u201d by Spanx. And thanks to the plethora of interviews with Spencer on her favorite subject, we know how many pairs of Spanx she wore to the SAG Awards (three), where she carries her weight ( her middle ), and her favorite part about being curvy ( showing off her cleavage ). It goes on and on.\nWe often get upset when other people dissect celebrities\u2019 weight (heavy or thin), but to me this type of navel-gazing is no more productive. Of course, there's a good chance it's the fault of the journalists who are interviewing her. (What's she supposed to do, take the fifth any time the topic comes up?) But by the time the Academy Awards roll around, I hope we\u2014and Spencer\u2014can focus on something else.\nRELATED LINKS:\n"}, {"score": 589.8073, "uuid": "f85f4cc1-1337-5920-98ab-3bdc1bc6f699", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-14-13347", "target_hostname": "www.blendedbeauty.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.blendedbeauty.ca/testimonials.html?page=11", "page_rank": 1.1953842e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Best Natural Curly Hair Products, Leave in <em>Conditioner</em>, shampoo, for Biracial", "snippet": "They are moisturizing without being too heavy <em>or</em> oily, and they smell wonderfull!

Click here for the article . I agree that the whole incident has been blown out of proportions.\nBut honestly, can we really blame the mass for being so anti-Sun Xu or anti-foreigner for the matter? And when this is further fueled by our own *AHEM* MP who insists that we should do some reflection because of Sun Xu\u2019s words?\nWhile Sun Xu has ever right to rant and bitch about whoever he wants to. It\u2019s certainly not very smart of him to do it publicly online after coming to our country, live and study on our tax payers\u2019 money and then return it with ungratefulness.\nAnd strange how Sun Xu is annoyed with Singaporean old men who stare at him when he (accidentally?) bumps into them. So now we\u2019re lacking manners?\nBut isn\u2019t this a norm in China? Even in so-called modern cities like Shanghai, the green man traffic light is just for show. Cars still cross over and honk even though pedestrians have the right of way. China folks push and shove whenever they have a chance. Cutting a queue here is a common daily hobby of many. Don\u2019t even get me started on the spitting and littering.\nBesides, how can Singaporeans not be pissed off after learning that S$36 million is spent on scholarships annually over 2 thousand students. While our elderly continue to roam bus stops, picking up cardboard boxes and drink cans to make ends meet. Or other equally bright local students who are denied a scholarship and are slogging just to pay off their hefty tuition fees?\u00a0I believe that Singaporeans won\u2019t be so unfavorable of foreigners in not for the \u201cGahmen\u201d.

We are not a chinese state for your information and we certainly do not need whatever dignity your so-called Big China has to give.\nHonestly, if we are dogs then youmust know that we are very territorial creatures. So sorry, we really do like sharing our land with outsiders. Trespassers are usually torn into pieces and fed upon. If you detest Singapore so much then please refrain from setting foot here.
