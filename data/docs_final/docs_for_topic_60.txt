I'm in some head-to-head basketball leagues and the whole category thing is just kind of dull.\u00a0 Hey, I won 5-to-3-to-1 this week!\u00a0 In football, you have one team to beat in points and you can spend all day Sunday watching your match-up.\u00a0 In basketball, you \"lose\" in turnovers even when you pull ahead in other categories.\u00a0 And with all those games (including late games), most of which aren't on t.v., it's less fun to \"watch\" your games.\u00a0 You just don't have the time.\nThe big play can turn your week around. When Kobe Bryant makes a steal and runs down the court for a thundering dunk, you can smile and say \"I got credit for a steal, two points, and my field goal percentage went up slightly.\"\u00a0 That's nice and all, but what happens when your running back explodes for a 50-yard TD?\u00a0 When your defense returns an interception for a touchdown?\u00a0 When your quarterback and receiver happen to be teammates and hook up for score?\u00a0 You can gain big points in a hurry.\nInjury Reports. What started as a nice piece of information for regular gamblers has become invaluable to fantasy players as well.\u00a0 You can find out easily if a player is out, doubtful, questionable, or probable, and usually a few days before Sunday.\u00a0 In basketball, you often find out about injuries after the game has started, when it's too late to do anything about.\u00a0 Additionally, a basketball player is far more likely to sit out a game with minor injuries or \"flu-like symptoms.\"\u00a0 That's what happens when you have 82 games instead of 16.\nAnyone can play. If you're in just one football league, it's so easy to keep track of it.\u00a0 All you have to remember is what day(s) you can pick up free agents, and you can then spend about five minutes making your moves for the week.\u00a0 You can win a league without doing much more than that.\u00a0 Even better, you can set up a football league very easily.\u00a0 We have one up and running in my office.\u00a0 I guarantee if I tried to do fantasy basketball in my office, I wouldn't get any more than three or four players.\nBye weeks. Ok, I hate bye weeks, but they do add a little strategy.\u00a0 I have a key week 10 battle against a rival, but my QB is on a bye.\u00a0 I had to make a trade to pick up a second quarterback just because I can't let Damian beat me.\u00a0 The closest fantasy basketball comes to this is when a player is playing only one or two games.\u00a0 Still, you wouldn't bench Chris Paul if he only had two games this week, would you?\nThe views expressed by RotoWire.com represent only the views of\u00a0 the writers; they do not represent the views of the NBA or any NBA\u00a0 team.\n"}, {"score": 2120.2666, "uuid": "50fb7fec-e189-5fb4-ad3f-afd643b17df4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1204wb-18-15329", "target_hostname": "www.stonescryout.org", "target_uri": "http://www.stonescryout.org/archives/2005/02/why_baseball_is.html", "page_rank": 1.1871497e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Stones Cry Out: <em>Why</em> Baseball <em>is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> <em>Football</em>", "snippet": "Listed below are links to weblogs that reference <em>Why</em> Baseball <em>is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> <em>Football</em>: \u00bb Baseball: Proof that God loves us and wants us to from The Anchoress This <em>is</em> my passion.

having him as an alumnus ---but there is no issue facing college football about which we disagree more than the subject of a Division I-A playoff. He strongly favors one. I strongly oppose one.\nIn his latest posting upon the topic, Hinton addresses the debate over the Boise St. Broncos \u2019 worthiness, vel non, for inclusion in the national championship picture, and he concludes that we should reject the premises entirely :\nThe real debate should be about why college football has a championship structure that forces us into the unnecessary debate over the merits of a wildly successful upstart at all, when every question could be settled beyond a doubt with actual football instead of conjuring up make-beieve scenarios.\nI have two quarrels with that passage, but in those two points of contention are contained the summation of all that divides us upon this question. These are they:\nI reject the concept of \"unnecessary debate.\" Dude, I\u2019m all about unnecessary debate ! Heck, Matt and I have had this very debate before , and, as he says of the BlogPoll , \" it\u2019s fun .\" I thoroughly enjoy the Boise State debate , which is part of what makes college football so much fun. As seriously as I take sports, I don\u2019t take them so seriously as to think getting the right answer is in any sense mission critical; this is entertainment, not surgery or public policy. Attaining an objectively correct result (assuming there is one, which there isn\u2019t) is of secondary importance in an endeavor we\u2019re supposed to enjoy. Because opinions have an influence, college football games played in August carry more weighty consequences than NFL games played in October. The debate allows us to enjoy what is intended to be a spectacle; this is a strength of the sport, not a weakness, and we should not be so swift to be such killjoys about a game we love, in part, because these discussions matter more than they do in other athletic exhibitions. There\u2019s a reason why they call it the \"No Fun League,\" and that has partly to do with the fact that regular season games more or less are meaningless in the NFL.\nSettling such questions \"beyond a doubt with actual football\" will produce results which demonstrably are wrong. The fundamental problem with all playoffs is that they compel us to accept outcomes which obviously are erroneous, because those results, while fallacious, were attained with finality. The 2006 St. Louis Cardinals went 83-78 during the regular season, but they won the World Series, so they were the champions of major league baseball, despite having the worst record ever by a World Series champion. Five games in October trumped 161 games played over the preceding six months, and we were forced to accept the incongruous result because the question was settled beyond a doubt with actual baseball. The 2007 New York Giants were a six-loss wild-card team, but they beat the previously undefeated New England Patriots in the Super Bowl, so they were the champions of the National Football League, despite being the first NFC wild-card team to win a Super Bowl. Sixteen games during the regular season were rendered meaningless, and we were forced to give credence to this absurdity because the question was settled beyond a doubt with actual football.\nThe premise underlying all playoffs is that certainty matters more than accuracy. Playoff proponents are like advocates of the Bohr model of the atom, an outdated and simplistic depiction which shows electrons as fixed dots on the perimeter. The more scientifically sound electron cloud model of the atom gives us shaded grey areas, indicating that there is a higher probability of finding an electron in one area than in another, yet providing no absolute answers because electrons are tiny and move very quickly. There are grey areas in reality, and Division I-A college football is the only sport whose championship structure acknowledges this, which is why Division I-A college football is the only sport that can point to every champion it has ever crowned after the postseason and argue with a straight face that its No. 1 team was deserving of that honor every year. (Yes, sometimes, you can argue for other teams, too, but that takes us back to the fun of the debate, doesn\u2019t it?)\nI know I\u2019m stirring up a hornet\u2019s nest, but Matt Hinton is respected for a reason and right almost invariably, so folks understandably are inclined to heed what he has to say. At least nine times out of ten, that is exactly the right attitude, but, upon this point, our positions could not be more diametrically opposed. Matt wishes to end unnecessary debate and have unassailable finality. I consider both such propositions dubious, and, as Hinton himself says, \"When in doubt, reject the premises.\"\nGo \u2018Dawgs!\n"}, {"score": 1569.5138, "uuid": "bf2c0d1d-87ac-5c0d-94c1-35a058f92a22", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1602wb-28-18885", "target_hostname": "www.bloguin.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bloguin.com/articles/football/is-robert-griffin-a-better-prospect-than-andrew-luck-ten-reasons-why-hes-not.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "<em>Is</em> Robert Griffin a <em>Better</em> Prospect <em>than</em> Andrew Luck?", "snippet": "Optimum Scouting <em>is</em> a <em>football</em> site loaded with all your <em>football</em> scouting needs.

Ten Reasons Why He's NOT\nWritten by Eric Galko on 02 April 2012.\nFrom last May until December, there was little debate who the top quarterback prospect in the 2012 NFL Draft was. Andrew Luck was the apple of every team's eye, and chants/twitter hash-tags/street signs gladly displayed \"Suck for Luck\" in hopes of their team getting that first pick.\nOptimum Scouting is a football site loaded with all your football scouting needs. We have originial, in-depth articles for College and Pro Football that go deeper than the average sports article. We also boast one of the best Scouting Departments on the web,. We have 11 highly trained and experienced scouts across the country that scout, rank, and detail these prospects.\nVisit Optimum Scouting\nBut now, since Griffin has become a mixture of a Cam Newton hyped athlete with a media darling, it has become a debate as to which path the Colts should take. To me, the answer is easy: pick Andrew Luck. Here's why.\n1. Coaching Around Him\nI'll first say that Art Briles of Baylor is a heck of a coach, and his offense combined with he and his staff's development of Robert Griffin has been remarkable. But Andrew Luck has had the pleasure and rare benefit of having a former NFL offensive coach in Greg Roman and former NFL Pro Bowl quarterback Jim Harbaugh showing him the ropes as a quarterback. His knowledge of the game based purely on the experience in working with those two now very successful NFL coaches gives him a leg up on most quarterbacks coming out of college ever.\n2. Pro Style-Scheme\nComing out of college, they're are obvious benefits to hailing from a Pro Style offense. For one, it gives the quarterback that instant confidence of consistently utilizing both the drop back and the shotgun formations to his advantage. Also, it gives a better understanding to how each position on the field is used, where as the spread based offense, in which Griffin mostly played in, is more about match-ups and limiting responsibilities.\n3. Better NFL Built Body Type\nThis may seem like a small aspect to evaluating a quarterback, but being able to take a hit without a consistent risk of injury has become a valuable asset for a team looking at quarterbacks. We've seen how Sam Bradford and Christian Ponder being \"injury-prone\" in college has translated to consistent NFL injuries. While neither Luck nor Griffin are considered \"injury-prone\", Griffin is a bit more fragilely built, and based on his style of play, he'll be taking a lot more hits as a scramble-heavy quarterback, especially early on.\n4. Mental Preparedness\nBased on all I've heard from Griffin and people around the program, I have no question about his work ethic, devotion to the film room, and he wanting to improve himself. It's one thing to want to develop based on the film room and understanding scheme. But Andrew Luck has a much better understanding of now only how to improve himself, but how defenses are planning on attacking him based on his experience and\u00a0 football IQ. It's rare to see a prospect like Luck who as soon as he gets into the league, he has \"coach on the field\" capability.\n5. Pre-Snap Ability\nOne of Griffin's biggest progressions this year was his ability to initially come off the snap and realize where he should go with the ball on a fairly consistent basis. While it's an important skill set, it's not nearly as impressive as Andrew Luck. Luck had the responsibility to go to the line of scrimmage with three plays in one formation, and pick the play that best fit the defensive alignment. I'd wager that some current NFL quarterbacks would struggle with that. That's a skill set and a defensive recognition ability that Robert Griffin likely will never be able to attain at the level Luck has, and is crucial for being able to consistently pick apart defenses from the pocket.\n6. Consistent Mechanics/Footwork\nIt's obvious that Robert Griffin will need fine tuning in his game-action mechanics and footwork. His arm slot in his release isn't consistent on all throws, his feet in the pocket get too wide and unbalanced, and he struggles to reset his feet properly under pressure. Luck isn't perfect mechanically and does have a tendency to sling the ball without proper mechanics if he anticipates his second read too quickly, and he doesn't always use his legs to drive the ball down the field. With Luck, however, his mechanics are consistent and easily coachable, while Griffin's at times are a bit erratic and will take a near overhaul in his footwork for him to develop sound in-pocket ability as well as downfield passing outside the pocket without running.\n7. Read Progression Confidence\nAlong with his pre-snap ability, Griffin developed more second and even third read concepts into his game, which has turned him into more than just an athlete, high velocity passer into a quarterback who can make some NFL reads. However, my main concern with Griffin is that he doesn't have the confidence to consistently release the ball on his second reads, and tends to either be delayed or hesitates long enough for the opening to be gone. That hesitation is an issue with many quarterbacks that have struggled early in the NFL. As for Luck, he has a great feel for how the play is developing, shifts his eyes very well across the field to the second and third reads, and anticipates the routes very well with consistently well timed balls.\n8. Decisiveness as a Passer\nAgain, going back to that second read release, Griffin's hesitation and his lack of decisiveness will continue to be an issue in the NFL. In the pocket, he struggles to trust that not only the second read receiver's route will be where he envisions, but also seems to not have a great grasp for how the defense is reacting to the routes after that initial read. Outside the pocket, he does sling the ball well, but often it's not the correct read when he does deliver downfield. As for Luck, he has complete faith in his pre-snap reads and anticipates routes so well. Generally, his interceptions or poorly timed passes were due to poor routes by the receiver, unexpected/right-place-right-time reactions by defenders, or just poorly released balls, all of which are hard to correct and not a major issue as a passer.\n9. Poise, Confidence in the Pocket\nAs many respected evaluators outside of the NFL as well as NFL team personnel will agree, being a successful quarterback starts from the pocket. In short, Griffin struggles to pick teams apart in the pocket, and after the initial read, Griffin looks consistently flustered and either uses poor footwork and mechanics, or tries to escape the pocket and make a play with his feet. While that brings excitement and maybe some big plays, it's not a consistent way to win the NFL. Luck stands tall in the pocket, keeping fundamental mechanics and footwork, and doesn't rely on escaping the pocket, though he is able to with his under-rated athleticism.\n10. Touch Between Levels\nThis may be the most indicative characteristic of initial and, without developmental time, long term success of an NFL quarterback, especially in long term, playoff hopes. Quarterbacks in the NFL need to not only be able to read the levels of a defense (first level is the defensive line, second is the linebackers and short-zoning corners, third is the safeties or deep-zoning corners) but also be able to place the ball in this areas. Griffin, like many young, developing quarterbacks, try to rely on arm strength or anticipation of openings too much, something more athletic linebackers and more creative defensive coordinators will take advantage of in the NFL (see Mark Sanchez's abilities). Luck has displayed an elite combination of anticipation of the defense and arm strength control in between these levels, and can both throw around and above man coverage as well as between and overtop-underneath these levels consistently.\nRead more great Football Scouting content at Optimum Scouting\n"}, {"score": 1369.9697, "uuid": "c6f5197a-ff99-5cd2-bfd3-9780b34dcdbd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0409wb-97-18443", "target_hostname": "www.blocku.com", "target_uri": "http://www.blocku.com/2008/11/14/661762/is-utah-better-than-usc", "page_rank": 1.1706084e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Is</em> Utah <em>better</em> <em>than</em> USC? - Block U", "snippet": "Question: As to the latest top 25 rankings, which I know in some respects <em>is</em> meant to be humorous, in ranking Utah ahead of USC I ask this: do you really think Utah <em>is</em> a <em>better</em> team <em>than</em> USC and could beat them?

What if your team shot 10% better from the line? How many more games would you win? How many more points would you score? Better Free Throws can lead you there.\nChapter 1 \u2013 Introduction\nBetter Basketball\u2019s Better Free Throws is broken down into 3 sections:\nFirst, there are 4 prerequisites to cover before the actual free throw shooting begins. Some are more in-depth than the others, but all of them are important. The prerequisites are Motivation, Realistic Expectations, Shooting Mechanics, and Alignment.\nSecond, with those 4 prerequisites under your belt, you\u2019re ready to be fouled. Now, once you\u2019re fouled, the 3 steps to actually making the FT begin. They are: Your Attitude After the Whistle, Finding the Groove, and The Pre-Shot-Ritual.\nAnd third, the DVD finishes with Practice Drills and some miscellaneous thoughts. If you put in the time and put in the effort working with the techniques outlined in Better Free Throws, you\u2019ll be well on your way to 90% from the line.\nChapter 2 \u2013 Ingredients for Success\nSuccess at the Free Throw line comes at the end of a chain of events. If any of the links of the chain are weak or faulty, the probability of a successful shot is reduced dramatically. But, piece these links together cleanly and efficiently and you can become a game changer. How many more points would you average each game if you knocked down 90% of your FTs?\nIn Chapter 2, Coach Torbett describes all the ingredients (and their corresponding chapters) that need to come together for consistent success at the line.\nChapter 3 \u2013 Motivation\nHere are some thoughts straight out of Chapter 3:\nHow many games has your team lost by 1 to 5 points? Let\u2019s face it; if your team shot only 10-20% better from the free-throw line, how many of those games would you have won? Think about it, you did everything that was needed to win those games and then lost them on the free-throw line where no one\u2019s guarding you!\nWho gets to play the most at the end of a tight game? Great free throw shooters or poor free throw shooters? What a compliment from the coach and your teammates when they want the ball in your hands at the end of a tight game! Great free throw shooters get to finish games. Poor free throw shooters get to watch from the bench.\nMore wins AND more playing time. Do you need more motivation that that?\nChapter 4 \u2013 Realistic Expectations\nYou can\u2019t go from shooting 50% from the line to 90% overnight. Free Throw shooting is a skill just like any other basketball skill \u2013 it takes time and practice for your mind and body to improve. Think back to all the time you spent in the gym shooting lay-ups or jump shots. Think back to all those dribbling drills. Now, in comparison, think back on how little time you spent practicing Free Throws. It hurts a little, doesn\u2019t it? Hours in the gym; minutes (seconds?) on Free Throws.\nMOST PLAYERS QUIT TOO SOON! And they quit because they have unrealistic expectations about how fast their free throw shooting is supposed to improve. They might practice for a few days or a few weeks and see little to no improvement at all. You must set realistic goals and expectations for your improvement.\nIt may take months or years to see any significant improvement. But here lies an unexpected reward: Once you begin to see improvement, it becomes addictive; it becomes a matter of pride, and you\u2019ll become even more motivated to keep on practicing.\nChapter 5 \u2013 Shooting Mechanics\nWhy mechanics? Because if you can\u2019t control the flight of the ball in terms of proper arch, the right distance and keeping the ball straight, then getting the rest of the Free Throw chain correct won\u2019t help very much! Chapter 5 examines the best mechanics for shooting FTs.\nBy the way, on this same video, Rick Barry who shot 90% from the line in his NBA career, gives a very different lesson on mechanics. He achieved Free Throw greatness (2nd all time in FT%) by shooting underhanded. Check out his section to draw your own conclusions. Maybe you are the perfect player to keep the Underhanded Free Throw alive.\nChapter 6 \u2013 Alignment\nThere are 3 components to a made shot: keep it straight (alignment); proper arc; the right distance. If the FT is not properly aligned, then you must have all 3 components correct to make the shot. You must keep it straight instinctively AND have the proper arc and the right distance.\nOn the other hand, if you can properly align your shot-line with the dead center, then you can \u201cmiss\u201d a little with your arc and your distance and the FT still has a high percentage chance of going in. Chapter 6 of Better Free Throws describes just how to do that.\nChapter 7 \u2013 After-the-Whistle Attitude\nThere are hundreds of distractions when you are standing at the Free Throw line; the game situation (down by 1 with no time left on the clock and 2 shots); the fans cheering for or against you; your coach yelling instructions.\nIf any one of those potential distractions causes you to lose focus, the Free Throw mechanics you worked so hard to develop will quickly deteriorate. In a way that is different from shooting within the flow of the game, Free Throws require precise target shooting and thus require precise mental preparation.\nChapter 7 gives you the tools to block out the distractions, maintain a strong mental position, and allow your trained mechanics and muscle memory to take control.\nChapter 8 \u2013 Finding the Groove\nBaseball players are allowed to take practice swings when they are on the deck. Golfers will find their groove with several practice swings whether it\u2019s a drive or a putt or anything in between. Football field goal kickers are allowed to practice using a net on the sideline before taking the field. But basketball players step up to the Free Throw line and have to take their FTs cold, without a single practice shot!\nIn Chapter 8, Coach Torbett details exactly how great Free Throw shooters get around this problem, getting into the grove of their shot in the toughest situations so that they can knock down even their very first FT every time.\nChapter 9 \u2013 Why a Pre-shot Ritual?\nWhy bother with a ritual? Because a ritual will make you feel like you\u2019ve made the shot before you take the shot. And this infusion of confidence, relaxation, and feeling of preparedness is crucial for success.\nImagine the ritual as the combination to a combination lock; there are an exact number of steps in a pre-defined order that will ultimately lead to successfully opening the lock. If Free Throw shooting is the lock and the ritual is the combination, then Chapter 9 is that little piece of paper that you wrote the combination on. It tells you exactly how to build your ritual, step by step, effectively and precisely. Granted, that was a complex analogy, but it works.\nChapter 10 \u2013 The Ritual Free Throw\nChapter 10 is where all the pieces from the previous 9 chapters fit together to create the perfect Free Throw shooting progression. Coach Torbett demonstrates this progression from mental development to mechanics with a variety of players so that it is easy to understand and thus, easy to learn.\nWith the Free Throw chain fully realized, all that is left is to move on to the third section of Better Free Throws, putting it into practice.\nChapter 11 \u2013 Practice Comments\nGreat free throw shooters are built in the off-season on their own time. If you expect your coach to take out a huge chunk of practice time for your free throws, then you\u2019re being irresponsible. Do you expect your coach to make you a great shooter or great ball-handler during the season? The coach can afford a little time during practice for basketball skill development, enough to serve as a reminder, but that\u2019s about it and that\u2019s not enough to become a great free throw shooter.\nIf you truly want to be on the floor in end game scenarios, increase your overall value to the team, and ultimately win more games, then take what you\u2019ve learned in Chapters 1-10, get in the gym, grab a basketball, and practice. Chapter 12 will show you how.\nChapter 12 \u2013 Drills and Reasons Why\nThere are tons of Free Throw shooting drills available to choose from: Chapter 12 gives you 8 effective drills as well as the WHY behind how these drills directly transfer to in-game success.\nMeasure the free throw line distance along the baseline and create a free throw angle where there is no backboard. Why shoot from this angle? Because without a backboard, you are forced to concentrate on the target. It seems as though judging the distance properly becomes your central focus without a backboard behind the rim.\nChapter 13 \u2013 Conclusion\nIf you play basketball, you\u2019re going to get fouled. It\u2019s just part of the game. So don\u2019t go to the free throw line hoping to make a shot; go there prepared. Follow the steps in this video and with time and repetition, you\u2019ll not only become a better FT shooter, you may become the best. Records are made to be broken and this one\u2019s waiting on you.\nAbout Rick Barry\nRick Barry\u2019s list of basketball accomplishments cannot be summed up in a concise list, but below are a few of his highlights as they relate to Free Throws:\nNBA career Free Throw percentage: 90%.\nFinal 6 years in the NBA, he averaged 92.5% from the line.\nThe only man to lead the NBA, the NCAA, and the ABA in scoring. Think about how many of those points came from Free Throws.\nInducted into the Hall of Fame in 1987.\nIn his interview with Coach Torbett, he explains how he achieved all of his Free Throw records, while shooting underhanded. Following his interview, Rick Barry takes to the court to teach the mechanics of his underhanded method. He even details how to break the shot down so that even youth players can learn it.\nBetter Shooting\nTestimonials\nSee what people are saying!\n\u2018Rick\u2019s attention to detail, knowledge of the game, and his encouragement played an important part in my son earning a scholarship to Kansas State University.\u2019\nLaird Canby\n\u2018I just have to tell you, I love the Read & React.

Chapter 12 will show you how.\nChapter 12 \u2013 Drills and Reasons Why\nThere are tons of Free Throw shooting drills available to choose from: Chapter 12 gives you 8 effective drills as well as the WHY behind how these drills directly transfer to in-game success.\nMeasure the free throw line distance along the baseline and create a free throw angle where there is no backboard. Why shoot from this angle? Because without a backboard, you are forced to concentrate on the target. It seems as though judging the distance properly becomes your central focus without a backboard behind the rim.\nChapter 13 \u2013 Conclusion\nIf you play basketball, you\u2019re going to get fouled. It\u2019s just part of the game. So don\u2019t go to the free throw line hoping to make a shot; go there prepared. Follow the steps in this video and with time and repetition, you\u2019ll not only become a better FT shooter, you may become the best. Records are made to be broken and this one\u2019s waiting on you.\nAbout Rick Barry\nRick Barry\u2019s list of basketball accomplishments cannot be summed up in a concise list, but below are a few of his highlights as they relate to Free Throws:\nNBA career Free Throw percentage: 90%.\nFinal 6 years in the NBA, he averaged 92.5% from the line.\nThe only man to lead the NBA, the NCAA, and the ABA in scoring. Think about how many of those points came from Free Throws.\nInducted into the Hall of Fame in 1987.\nIn his interview with Coach Torbett, he explains how he achieved all of his Free Throw records, while shooting underhanded. Following his interview, Rick Barry takes to the court to teach the mechanics of his underhanded method. He even details how to break the shot down so that even youth players can learn it.\nBetter Shooting\nTestimonials\nSee what people are saying!\n\u2018Rick\u2019s attention to detail, knowledge of the game, and his encouragement played an important part in my son earning a scholarship to Kansas State University.\u2019\nLaird Canby\n\u2018I just have to tell you, I love the Read & React. One layer was enough to raise offensive performance of the 7th graders I coach to a new level.\u2019\nChristopher S. Ciaccio\n\u2018I just wanted to give you guys a lot of praise.

No hysterics, no histrionics -- just history.\u00a0 We have been too faithful for too long and\u00a0heard too many promises of our program\u00a0\"turning the corner\" and \"getting better\" to settle for this.\u00a0 What is painfully obvious to anyone who has even remotely cared enough to follow Bruin football through too many winters of Bowl-less discontent is that there are numerous reasons why Seto must NOT be UCLA Football's next DC:\n(1)\u00a0 Experience. After a season filled with plays where opposing offenses snapped the ball while our defense was still making substitutions... where our D-line would jump before the snap multiple times on the same 4-down series... where our linebackers were schemed several YARDS out of position... we are going to resort to THIS?\u00a0 A DC who spent only one year purportedly calling D-schemes while working an unabashedly defensive-minded head coach?\u00a0 One who only coached under two coaches his entire post-graduate life -- Pete Carroll and the wonderfully-inept Paul Hackett?\nPrior to taking the DC job, Bullough had already filled assistant positions at 3 colleges and for multiple years in the NFL with the Chicago Bears -- and his defenses were still laughably unprepared.\nDoesn't UCLA football deserve someone with MORE EXPERIENCE than THIS?\n(2)\u00a0 Recruiting. There have been stories that Seto \"should\" be a benefit to our recruiting, especially given his youth and \"energy.\"\u00a0 However, Seto's days as an assistant were spent learning the recruiting ropes as part of the staff which ran utterly amok under the most reckless and under-utilized compliance office since the days of SMU.\u00a0 Dan Guerrero had to weigh the pros and cons of bringing in one of our own, Neuheisel, due to his purported past with the NCAA.\u00a0 And now we're looking at someone whose entire professional life was spent at the feet of the most crooked coaches in decades?\nDoesn't UCLA football deserve a MORE RELIABLE recruiter than THIS?\n(3)\u00a0 Style. In Seto's narrow range of coaching apprenticeship, he has basically worked for one defensive guru -- Carroll.\u00a0 A coach who reaped the benefits of lower admission standards, players of questionable character (as evidenced by a ridiculous rap sheet of arrests and offenses), and\u00a0unethical recruiting practices in molding an NFL-style, 4-3 defense.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, after CRN reportedly terminated Bullough's services in favor of a DC who could be more versatile and more\u00a0capable of\u00a0utilizing our young speed to adapt to spread offenses and other formations and overcome our relative lack of D-line depth... he is considering a DC with nothing but 4-3 experience on his resume?\nDoesn't UCLA Football deserve a MORE QUALIFIED coordinator than THIS?\n(4) Discipline. At 34 years of age, Seto is barely old enough to be the brother of most of our players.\u00a0 Nearly all of his 11-year \"career\" has been under Carroll, where rappers, comedians, and sports agents roamed freely on sidelines, in locker rooms, and athletic offices, with no regard for rules or regulations, or the consequences that would result from breaking them.\u00a0 That kind of carefree and careless leadership bought U$C several well-earned years of lost bowl game revenue, lost scholarships, and lost victories.\nDoesn't UCLA Football deserve someone MORE CAPABLE than THIS?\n(5)\u00a0 Money. Donors, season ticket holders, alums, and casual fans have come to the Rose Bowl year after year to see one of our own return UCLA Football to its rightful place as a competitive football power.\u00a0 We don't expect a BCS Bowl every year... but it's been, what, OVER A DECADE since the last one?\u00a0 For THIRTEEN YEARS, we have been buying tickets, contributing to the program... and all we have to show for it is the free T-shirt from CRN's first year.\nWe deserve to have our loyalty, our commitment -- our FAITH -- rewarded.\nIn an age when a successful football team generates tens of millions of dollars not only for its own football program, but also for other athletic teams at the same school, and also stimulates goodwill and fundraising that benefits the entire academic institution, are we willing to give up the success both on and off the field that a proven coordinator can help generate?\nAre we willing to bet the future of UCLA Football on an inexperienced, unreliably-trained, ill-fitting, unproven novice coordinator?\nDoesn't UCLA Football deserve BETTER than THIS?\nYES, WE DO.\nM\nPoll\nDo you approve Rick Neuheisel's possible hiring of Rocky Seto - a Pete Carroll disciple with no previous credible experience as a defensive coordinator - as UCLA's new DC?\n17%\n"}, {"score": 1320.9941, "uuid": "12bc68c5-9f54-5c46-8972-7351cb3bd3ae", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1501tw-09-07864", "target_hostname": "www.lipstickalley.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lipstickalley.com/f4/why-do-people-think-they-better-than-you-387392/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>Why</em> Do People Think They Are <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> You...", "snippet": "\u00bb <em>Why</em> Do People Think They Are <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> You...

In that time, his videos have amassed millions of views, and countless fans around the world. But as impressive as those numbers are, like so many Canadian acts before him (Nickelback, Celine Dion) the number of Justin's haters almost rivals his legion of his fans.\nWhile I never particularly disliked Justin Bieber, I am neither a fan of his music (which is fine; it's not meant for me). Many people, myself included, dismissed him as a one-hit wonder, but surprisingly Justin has proven to be anything but. On top of showing that he's capable of releasing albums that continue to sell big, I've noticed lately that this 17-year-old continues to use his mega-power for the greater good.\nHe's more charitable than you:\nThe Justin Bieber seal of approval is now worth millions, and while he is the spokesman for big companies like Proactiv and G-Star Raw, he also devotes much of his pull to helping those less fortunate, particularly here in Canada. Recently, a series of his tweets about the importance of organ donations in Ontario saw the number of people who signed up to donate for the Trillium Gift of Life Network nearly quadruple . He also recently signed a car that was then auctioned off for $40,000 -- funds that will go to restore a skate park in his hometown.\nThis past Valentine's Day, instead of spending the day with his movie star girlfriend, Selena Gomez, Justin spent it with a six-year-old fan who is battling cancer . It was a selfless gesture that Avalanna Routh and other fans will never forget. In a world of publicist-enforced staged appearances, Justin seems to devote as much time to giving back to his fans and charitable organizations as he does to driving his luxury cars.\nHe loves Canadian music more than you:\nFor a few years, former Canadian Idol contestant Carly Rae Jepsen has been making the best of being a singer-songwriter. She has a small (but loyal) fan base. She has one full album under her belt, a Juno nomination, and a few bumps on the music charts.

The part about being boring.\nNobody around here, with the possible exception of local sportswriters who\u2019d give $20 \u2014 OK, maybe $5 \u2014 to hear the UNLV basketball coach say something interesting, is complaining.\nRemember Bill Bayno? He was far from boring. He also was far from being an outstanding basketball coach.\nAs I said, nobody\u2019s complaining.\nLon Kruger was born and raised in Kansas. Well, there you have it.\nIf he were a baseball player \u2014 and he almost was \u2014 he\u2019d be a middle reliever.\nIf he were a classroom project, he\u2019d be a term paper on photosynthesis.\nIf he were a president, he\u2019d be Millard Fillmore.\nThe other day, I received a copy of Kruger\u2019s book \u201cThe Xs & Os of Success: A Playbook for Leaders in Business and Life.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like I was on the mailing list of preferred customers. I just happened to bump into one of the authors \u2014 D.J. Allen, not Kruger \u2014 at the Thomas & Mack Center on the day the book came out.\nA couple of other media types were there. They received free copies of the book (I don\u2019t know what they will do with theirs, but the Sun\u2019s will be sold in our annual Christmas auction to benefit the Sun Camp Fund). D.J. Allen is familiar with the local press. He knows we\u2019d never cough up the $19.95, unless the book also came with a 12-pack of beer and a cheap cigar.\nAnyway, I started flipping through the book, because although I have never been a leader in business or in life, you never know when the bottom\u2019s gonna fall out of the newspaper business and then what would I do?\nI flipped right to page 140 \u2014 the chapter called \u201cIf You Don\u2019t Have Anything Nice to Say.\u201d It was so considerate of coach to dedicate an entire chapter to guys like me.\nActually, it was more like three pages. Because any more than that, and he\u2019d lose us like a set of car keys after a long night of playing poker at a buddy\u2019s house when his wife was away visiting her parents. Kruger knew this.\n\u201cI like speaking with members of the media and I have a great amount of respect for what they do ...\u201d\nThat\u2019s how the chapter begins.\nSee, I told you the man was a genius.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the interest from the media, which represents the general public\u2019s interest, we would not be blessed to enjoy the lifestyle that we have. That being said, I\u2019m sure I drive some members of the press a little insane. Why? Because they view me as boring. As just a good ol\u2019 boy from Silver Lake, Kansas, shooting out nothing but vanilla quote after vanilla quote making their job a little more difficult.\u201d\nA little more difficult? Coach, if it wasn\u2019t for your postgame press conferences, I would have never split those atoms.\nKruger then rehashes one of his more riveting quotes from the 2006-07 Sweet 16 season.\n\u201cObviously, we need to get better. We have to keep working hard every day in practice to improve as a team. We\u2019re playing solidly on defense most of the time; however, we have to be aggressive and get after it the entire 40 minutes.\u201d\nWhere\u2019s my atom splitter?\n\u201cOK, I will admit most readers probably begin to gloss over those types of statements in the morning paper after a while ...\u201d\nBut Kruger goes on to explain his wing-tip-shoes approach to public speaking.\nFirst, he said he truly believes what he says \u2014 that the Rebels have to be more aggressive on defense, or at least work hard in practice every day.\nSecond, he said he believes in protecting his players, their families and the university.\nThat\u2019s why he is careful about what he says and sprinkles every quote with vanilla extract. He says you\u2019d be surprised how hard players work on their defense when they\u2019re not gossiping about what coach said about them in the morning paper.\nIn the book, Kruger says he enjoys colorful quotes and sound bites as much as the next guy. Who knew?\n\u201cHowever, Dad taught us the important thing about humor. It usually comes at someone else\u2019s expense.\u201d\nIt\u2019s official: Lon Kruger is actually Ward Cleaver. The coaching gig is just a disguise to protect his true identity.\nKruger goes on to say there are young, impressionable people who read the papers. (But not enough of them. Most young, impressionable people who could be reading newspapers are playing video games, listening to Metallica MP3s on their iPods or texting their friends.)\nFor the record, Kruger didn\u2019t say the part in parentheses. You probably figured that out.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the media, I will gladly take the public wrath of a journalist who is frustrated with my blandness before ever coming close to insulting or embarrassing one of our players through a media outlet. It\u2019s a simple guideline. We want to treat our players as I would want my own son to be treated. That\u2019s just the way Dad taught us to do it.\u201d\nMy dad was like that, too. That\u2019s why I chose not to have kids.\nIn all seriousness, after reading those three pages in his book, I think I have a better understanding of Kruger and why he says the things he does. And why he keeps the other ones to himself. Likewise, I have a new appreciation for middle relief pitchers, the way plants use energy from sunlight to make sugar, and chief executives with names like accountants.\nIn fact, just as soon as I\u2019m done writing, I\u2019m going to start working on my defense.\nDiscussion: 2 comments so far\u2026\nComments are moderated by Las Vegas Sun editors.

As a result, one medical expert has now claimed there is a very strong case for an all-female cosmonaut crew on the first mission to put humans on Mars.\nWilliam Rowe, a professor of medicine at the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo, in the United States, said: \"A manned trip to the Red Planet should, in fact, be womanned.\"\nProf Rowe has published new research in the journal Mens Health and Gender, which focused on the hormonal and physical make-up of women under 30 years of age, and concludes that they are far better suited to long-term, long-distance travel than men.\nIn particular, men in their thirties and forties are much more likely to develop the first signs of heart disease, a condition exacerbated by space travel. Women are protected from this by their comparatively high levels of oestrogen.\nDrug treatments during space flight are not recommended because they are not readily absorbed in weightless conditions, the liver and the kidneys do not function at their best and the drug compounds deteriorate more quickly owing to the higher levels of radiation experienced in space.\nMen are also disadvantaged because they retain much higher levels of iron in the body than women, particularly in space, and this can reach toxic levels. Women\u2019s reduced body mass, which requires fewer calories and produces less waste, also makes them yet more suitable as long-term astronauts.\nThere is one drawback to having an all-female crew, said Prof Rowe. They should avoid space walks during menstruation because of the increased risk at that time of decompression sickness, resulting from lower total blood volume.\nRegardless of that risk, however, Prof Rowe remained adamant that women would be much better placed than men to take a trip to Mars, a mission with an expected duration of two years. He said: \"The cards are stacked against man in space.\"\nBritain\u2019s first woman in space was Helen Sharman, who became an astronaut after responding to an advertisement which said: \"Astronaut wanted - no experience necessary.\"\nAt the time she was a scientist researching into the chemical and physical properties of chocolate for Mars confectionery in Slough. In May 1991, after intensive training, she joined a crew of male Soviet cosmonauts on an eight-day Anglo-Soviet Juno space mission. Her job on the Mir space station was to carry out 20 scientific experiments dealing with biology, Earth observation, the growth of crystals and the effects of space on the body.\nThe first female leader of a space mission was Eileen Collins, a US Air Force colonel, who commanded the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1999.\nDr Didier Schmitt, the head of life sciences at the European Space Agency, said: \"From documented experiences on the Russian Mir Space Station, it is correct that for long-term missions with an all female crew, astronauts do perform extremely well. Having females in a group is very positive because it breaks down the competition within the male group.\n\"We have now shifted from research on men over to women for the next year. We are conducting experiments on human physiology under conditions of 60 days bed rest at minus six degrees, and now we have finished the tests on men we are about to carry out the same research on women to see if they react the same way.\n\"It will provide either further evidence to corroborate this story, or it could even reveal results which are completely at odds with it.\"\n"}], [{"score": 1296.7146, "uuid": "ed37c246-9bd3-5d9b-849a-b747cfa0c613", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-21-02412", "target_hostname": "gotsportsblog.com", "target_uri": "http://gotsportsblog.com/deron-williams-rajon-rondo-russell-westbrook/", "page_rank": 1.331909e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Why</em> Deron Williams <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Rajon Rondo and Russell Westbrook | Got", "snippet": "o Fayne\u2019s Overtime Winner Sends Devils Home in Control of 4th Seed * <em>Why</em> Deron Williams <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Rajon Rondo and Russell Westbrook <em>Why</em> Deron Williams <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Rajon Rondo and Russell Westbrook A common point of discussion that always seems to appear <em>is</em> the fight for the top point guards in", "explanation": null, "document": "More articles by Blake Zitman \u00bb\nWritten by: Blake Zitman\nTags: slider\nA common point of discussion that always seems to appear is the fight for the top point guards in the NBA. While there is no doubt that Chris Paul and Derrick Rose hold the top two when ranking point guards, the next three players have not been as clear. These three guards are Deron Williams, Russell Westbrook, and Rajon Rondo.\nUp to this point, Deron Williams is averaging 21.9 PPG, 3.3 RPG, and 8.2 APG.\nRussell Westbrook is averaging 24 PPG, 4.5 RPG, and 5.4 APG.\nRajon Rondo is averaging 12.7 PPG, 4.7 RPG, and 10.7 APG.\nCurrently the New Jersey Nets sit tied with the Raptors for last in the Atlantic division with just a mere 16 wins.\u00a0 However, Deron Williams has still found a way to dish out 8.2 APG.\nThroughout the season, the Nets have been dealing with multiple injury problems. The biggest one is the loss of big man, Brook Lopez. Brook was the Nets best scoring option last year as he averaged a stellar 20 PPG. As a result to the injury, Deron was forced to find other options in order to keep his assist total high.\nEven though the Nets do have a minimal amount of wins, Deron has successfully made other players better with his passing ability.\nNets rookie MarShon Brooks is averaging 12.8 PPG, big man Kris Humphries is averaging 13.5 PPG, and guard Anthony Morrow is averaging 12.6 PPG. As you can see, Deron\u2019s great passing capability has made everyone around him look better. On top of that he is averaging a very respectable 22 PPG.\nRondo (Photo by Gary Dineen/NBAE via Getty Images)\nMany say that Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics easily is the third best point guard in the league behind Rose and Paul. However, looking at his stats, they can\u2019t be saying that because of his scoring ability; as it is average at best with 12.7ppg.\nThe number that pops out is his assist total which is 10.7. While this is a very high number, there are some key factors that need to be considered.\nUnlike Deron Williams, Rondo is playing amongst three arguable future hall of famers in Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett. All of which are extremely talented scorers. This makes Rondo\u2019s job a lot easier.\nOur last victim is Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook.\nWhile Westbrook outscores Williams, he has nowhere close to the amount of assists. One would think that out of all of them, he would have the most. This is because he is playing besides arguably one of the best players in the NBA in Kevin Durant. Also, turnovers have proven to be a very big problem for Westbrook thus far.\nMany people are looking forward to seeing these guards clash for the rest of the season.\n(Photo by Chris Chambers/Getty Images)\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 1283.1531, "uuid": "e629e200-e658-5c6b-b0b0-842bc56e511b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-05-11252", "target_hostname": "www.huffingtonpost.ca", "target_uri": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/meghan-telpner/apple-yogurt-breakfast-parfait-recipe_b_1339013.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.ca%2Fmeghan-telpner%2Fapple-yogurt-breakfast-parfait-recipe_b_1339013.html&format=json", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Meghan Telpner: Apple Yogurt Breakfast Parfait: <em>Why</em> THIS Breakfast <em>Is</em> <em>Better</em>", "snippet": "Gerard Meghan Telpner Nutritionista at MeghanTelpner.com GET UPDATES FROM Meghan Telpner Like 4 Apple Yogurt Breakfast Parfait: <em>Why</em> THIS Breakfast <em>Is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> THAT Posted: 03&#x2F;12&#x2F;2012 12:59 pm React HPFacebookVoteV2.init(1339013, &#x27;Apple Yogurt Breakfast Parfait: <em>Why</em> THIS Breakfast <em>Is</em> <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> THAT", "explanation": null, "document": "digg reddit stumble\nI do my best to steer clear from the peeps who call themselves \"nutrition experts\" and then promote processed crap.

On that day, it was possible to make an RRSP contribution not just for the 2011 tax year just finished, but also for the 2012 tax year that had just commenced.\nThis strategy results in even more tax-free compounding than monthly pre-authorized payments, particularly in rising markets like those we've experienced this year. Of course, in volatile markets, you may regret making a large early-bird lump-sum contribution if markets fall after you make that single contribution.\nIn that case, you may be happier to \"dollar-cost average\" your way in with monthly or weekly pre-authorized arrangements.\nAs CIBC Wealth's managing director of tax Jamie Golombek notes, you could lump-sum contribute into a money market fund and subsequently reinvest it gradually into equity funds.\nMathematically, your money is invested the longest if tax-sheltered with the early-bird lump-sum strategy, assuming you have the money to contribute in the first place. Those who don't can borrow money to take out an RRSP top-up or catch-up loan. But then you'll be paying interest charges that can't be deducted for tax purposes. And if markets fall, you'll feel regret watching the value of your RRSP drop after it was purchased with borrowed money. It's a lot easier to bear volatility investing with money you're already earned.\nSo here's my hierarchy of five options, starting with the best and working down:\n1 Early-bird lump-sum RRSP contribution with money you've already earned.\n2 Regular PAC arrangements funded with money as you earn it.\n3 Last-minute lump-sum contribution with money you've already earned.\n4 Early-bird lump-sum contribution with borrowed money. (As Golombek notes, this can be risky because your tax refund won't occur for another 14 to 16 months.)\n5 Last-minute lump-sum contribution with borrowed money.\nSome of these are better than others, but any of them is better than nothing.\n\"Think about putting money into your RSP like exercising,\" says TD vice-president and portfolio manager Cynthia Caskey, noting 44% said they couldn'tafford regular contributions. \"Maybe you're not ready to participate in an hour-long, high-intensity class, but if you walk for 20 minutes, you're making a positive difference. The same goes for investing in your RSP - even just a few dollars a week is worth contributing.\"\njchevreau@nationalpost.com\n"}, {"score": 1256.6758, "uuid": "d134e0e0-43ac-5f23-9cfc-d9e82e7cb190", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1710wb-88-11275", "target_hostname": "dave-richard.blogs.cbssports.com", "target_uri": "http://dave-richard.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/messages/chrono/36028675/0/0/36035415", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Melo <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Griffin ?

Never mind Barkley was being honest, saying what he believes. Or that he\u2019s right.\nOregon is very good, but the Ducks were better last year.\nYeah, the truth hurts, and no one wants to hear it. Not while Oregon is headed for its third straight conference championship, and still chasing a berth, however unlikely, in the BCS title game. Not when the fallback plan is a trip to the Rose Bowl.\nBut it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to admit the Ducks haven\u2019t reached last season\u2019s level, and probably won\u2019t. Also, it won\u2019t matter Saturday.\nOdds-makers have installed Oregon as a heavy favorite. It\u2019s a reaction to the whipping of Stanford, but also a reflection of the recent series results with USC, when the Ducks shoved the Trojans\u2019 defense \u2014 and the program\u2019s aura \u2014 into a shredder.\nThe forecast is for cold, wet weather Saturday evening. Autzen Stadium will be rocking, and as inhospitable as ever for the visitors. The setup seems right for another rout. Could be that\u2019s what will happen, a replay of 2009, or last year at the Coliseum.\nBut maybe not.\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing SC 2011,\u201d LaMichael James said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re playing us 2011.\u201d\nIn 2011, USC is better than it has been in a while. The supposedly inevitable demise because of NCAA sanctions has been delayed, at least. And this won\u2019t come easy for many folks, but it\u2019s time to give some credit to Lane Kiffin.\nHe was an iffy choice to replace Pete Carroll, and it remains unclear whether he can successfully steer the Pac-12\u2019s marquee program through probation and back to prominence. The full effect of the penalties hasn\u2019t been felt yet.\nBut so far, Kiffin has done pretty well, and much better than many expected.\nSo has Barkley. As a third-year starter, his numbers \u2014 29 touchdown passes, six interceptions, completing 67 percent of his attempts \u2014 compare well with Andrew Luck\u2019s, not that anyone seems to notice.\nThe Trojans are ranked No. 18 in the AP poll, and this ought to be seen as another big showdown. Somehow, it isn\u2019t. Tuesday morning, Kiffin\u2019s turn on the Pac-12\u2019s weekly teleconference with reporters was exceptionally brief. One question, one answer, and no one else had anything for him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re 18-point underdogs,\u201d Kiffin said before hanging up. \u201cNobody cares about you. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\nProbably it\u2019s more that the Trojans are ineligible for the Pac-12 championship or bowl games. And also, because they tossed a clunker in a September loss at Arizona State.\nOtherwise, well, the Trojans lost in three overtimes to Stanford. They\u2019ve been rolling recently, and they\u2019re atop the Pac-12 South \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t count \u2014 with a confident quarterback who leads a talented team.\nBarkley has developed as a quarterback, sure, but also as a leader. Which is why, as you knew he would, he clarified those comments from Saturday.\n\u201cI just said they were well deserving of their ranking,\u201d Barkley told the Los Angeles Daily News on Tuesday. \u201cThat was just based on scores I\u2019ve seen. After watching tape, they are one of the top defenses we\u2019ll face this year.\u201d\nSee? All the right things. But then Barkley called Oregon\u2019s defense \u201cvulnerable,\u201d and pointed to \u201cweaknesses and holes we have to exploit.\u201d\nAgain, he\u2019s just calling it like he sees it. Oregon\u2019s defense has played very well, but it hasn\u2019t faced an offense this dangerous. The difference between Luck and Barkley, at least as it should matter to Oregon, is Barkley has more and better weapons available.\nStanford\u2019s receivers could not get open against Oregon last weekend. The Cardinal are slow.\nThe Trojans are not. Robert Woods and Marqise Lee are home-run threats, and USC\u2019s offense has grown during the season into a reasonable facsimile of Trojans past.\nNah, this USC isn\u2019t that USC. And if Oregon isn\u2019t quite as good as the 2010 BCS runner-up squad, it\u2019s not very far off. Kiffin called Oregon \u201cthe hottest team in the country.\u201d Chip Kelly said of USC, \u201cThey\u2019re better.\u201d And although it\u2019s coachspeak, they\u2019re both correct.\nSo was Barkley, whose only sin was honesty, and maybe too much accuracy. It won\u2019t matter Saturday.\nOregon isn\u2019t quite as good as it has been. But the Ducks are still a lot better than USC.\nThe truth won\u2019t hurt.\nE-mail george.schroeder@registerguard.com.\n"}, {"score": 1202.7335, "uuid": "49bf7564-6ac8-5fde-b4db-ac8850e483e6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-83-23413", "target_hostname": "www.cornnation.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cornnation.com/2012/2/9/2786439/why-minnesota-never-be-good-at-football-and-husker-basketball", "page_rank": 5.797246e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Why</em> Minnesota May Never Be Good At <em>Football</em> (And How That Relates to Nebraska", "snippet": "I spent the <em>better</em> part, lol, of 3 years in lincoln and in my experience the answer <em>is</em>, other <em>than</em> the athlethes of other sports and their friends, no. by Conspiracy* on Feb 9, 2012 3:47 PM CST reply actions I guess what i\u2019m saying <em>is</em> that if men\u2019s <em>basketball</em> <em>is</em> to change, that attitude has to change", "explanation": null, "document": "Print\nIf there was one good thing that happened regarding Nebraska's game against Minnesota last Sunday, it was that Minnesota's staff came away from Lincoln, Nebraska blown away by their tour of the Hendricks Training Complex .

I guess it's nice that they were impressed with the facilities because they sure weren't with the Husker basketball team.\nI suppose it's a fair trade with Minnesota. It's not like there are a lot of Husker football fans that would be impressed with Golden Gopher football. The football team has been bad for years, seeing some success under Glen Mason, but dropping below ground in the Tim Brewster era.\nIf you ask, Minnesota would say they've made a commitment to having a good football team. Facilities are no longer the excuse they once were. Minnesota just built itself a shiny new stadium, and if you went to the Nebraska game this year, you know it's a pretty nice place to watch football.

He wasn't a name coach, a big money \"splash\" hire, but he worked his way through his first year despite suffering health issues and made some improvement along the way. Time will tell if he can turn their program around.\nSo why didn't Minnesota spend the money on a big name hire? It may because they don't have it, but it may also be that nagging excuse that Minnesota is just a stop on the way to somewhere else, so what's the point with hiring a big name that's going to build something then leave in three or four years?\nI'd say the biggest obstacle facing Minnesota is lack of fan support. Gopher football fans aren't hard to find, but getting them to admit they're Gopher football fans is another story altogether. Minnesota has to get people into the mode that they're going to have some patience and let things work, but mostly, they're going to have to get over the fickle nature of \"I'll go when they're good enough\". The real question is - \"What is good enough?\". Is it good enough to be average, finishing in the middle of the conference all of the time, or do you expect to build a program that contends for conference titles? If you're goal is to be average, then, really, what's the point?\nFan support is key. If you don't' support the team you're not going to sway the recruits you need to consistently have a winner. Look at Nebraska - the Huskers stole Lydon Murtha and Nate Swift from Minnesota largely because of the Lincoln Game Day environment. There is NOTHING like fan support. Minnesota doesn't have that, and compared to Nebraska, probably never will.\nIf you made it this far, you're probably wondering why I'm spending all this time talking about Gopher football. Take everything I've just said about Minnesota football and apply it to Husker men's basketball.\nNow tell me, what is Nebraska going to do to build a winning men's basketball team?\n"}, {"score": 1199.0691, "uuid": "1e2ee370-ccca-5954-b033-94466e018994", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1806wb-22-12692", "target_hostname": "www.wvillustrated.com", "target_uri": "http://www.wvillustrated.com/category/217089/wvu-football", "page_rank": 3.7544847e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "West Virginia University <em>Football</em> - WVU Mountaineer Sports: <em>Basketball</em>", "snippet": "The West Virginia defensive end told anyone who would listen that he did not feel there were 32 other players <em>better</em> <em>than</em> him in the nation, and NFL <em>football</em> fans everywhere are preparing for the first of three big days regarding their respective teams.", "explanation": null, "document": "West Virginia had its second player go off the board in the NFL Draft Saturday when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers picked linebacker Najee Goode.

It wasn't done to demand more out of No.21 Wisconsin, but to simply serve as a needed reminder of what it takes to continue its success.\nMADISON - Nobody would rightly accuse Wisconsin basketball of being average when it comes to coach Bo Ryan and the Big Ten regular season.\nSince taking over the program in 2001, Wisconsin has finished in a tie for fourth place or better in the Big Ten each season, a run of success that has included three conference championships. That doesn\u2019t mean Ryan can\u2019t remind his players from time to time.\nStumbling on a Thomas Friedman article about being \u00e2\u0080\u0098better than average\u2019 when it comes to education, Ryan handed the piece out to his players prior to the Penn State game \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but he applied it in a different way.\n\u201cAverage is no longer good enough,\u201d Ryan said Monday. \u201cA lot of people could survive on average the past couple of generations. You can\u2019t survive on average now.\u201d\nWisconsin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which dropped two spots to No.21 in the Associated Press poll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 continues to show it\u2019s better than the norm. Sitting in a tie for third place in the Big Ten, 1.5 games behind front runner Ohio State , Wisconsin (18-6, 7-4 Big Ten) has won six of seven heading into Thursday\u2019s tilt at Minnesota , which has won five of seven.\nRyan has always been big on pushing academics, especially with the sport he coaches playing in two semesters that typically involves plenty of midweek travel. According to the UW school of admissions, the typical unweighted, academic GPAs among incoming freshmen are between a 3.5 and a 3.9, a class rank in the 85\u00e2\u0080\u009396 percentile and a typical score between 27\u00e2\u0080\u009329 on the ACT.\nFar from average numbers, but the Badgers continue to push their academic envelope, having at least five Academic All-Big Ten selections for the last five seasons.\n\u201cBeing average in athletics, is that going to get you a scholarship?\u201d Ryan questioned. \u201cIs that going to give you a chance to pick what school you\u2019d like to go to? If you have better grades and you become a better player, you have more options to choose for your education.\n\u201cParents, more and more that have children who are of high school age that are looking at colleges, when they come here and see us and they see the academic requirements to get in, parents always go, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I got into Wisconsin 25 years ago and I didn\u2019t have those kinds of grades.\u2019 Average isn\u2019t good enough anymore if you want certain things in life.\u201d\nAverage won\u2019t cut it either against the Gophers. Despite seeing star forward Trevor Mbakwe tear his right ACL seven games into the season, the Gophers have gotten replacement production in the form of junior guard Rodney Williams , who Wisconsin recruited out of Robbinsdale Cooper (MN). Williams leads the team in scoring with 10.5 points a game.\n\"They've got some good players,\" Ryan said. \"They've got some guys who aren't trying to do too much ... defensively they can get after you because of how athletic they are, and they've got some depth worked into the lineup. It hasn't surprised any of us that they're doing well, especially in a league you just don\u2019t know.\"\nDisparity home vs. road\nAnother notch in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098just don\u2019t know\u2019 category in the Badgers shooting disparity between the road and the Kohl Center, especially behind the arc.\nIn 15 home games, Wisconsin is shooting 43.5 percent from the floor and 32.9 percent from three-point range, numbers that have caused the Badgers to lose four home games in a season for the first time under Ryan.\nIn seven true road games, the Badgers are shooting 42.0 percent from the floor but 40.0 percent from three-point range, a reason why UW is 7-2 on the road and 5-2 in true road games.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy and if there was an answer that was easily obtainable, I think we would have had it by now, as slow as I am,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cJunior high, high school, Division III, UWM, here, I\u2019ve never had a team get into those kinds of phases. You just keep working on your shooting drills in practice.\u201d\nThe Barn\nWith 18 games in the Big Ten and the Big Ten Tournament, Ryan doesn\u2019t compare one game in the basketball season to a conference football game, meaning he doesn\u2019t hype Wisconsin\u2019s border battle any more or less than its matchup with Ohio State on Saturday.\nEven so, Ryan appreciates playing in a venue like Minnesota\u2019s Williams Arena, which opened in 1928, because it reminds him of the Palestra, which opened in 1927, where he grew up going to games.\n\u201c(The fans) can all tell you, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I remember Kevin McHale\u2019 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I remember Lou Hudson,\u2019\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt has memories for everybody. For fans up there, (the building) has been spruced up but the floor hasn\u2019t changed. It just something you have to be aware of. College atmosphere is pretty good, pretty exciting.\u201d\nJoin the Badger conversation on Facebook!

He is the co-host of the afternoon and evening show on 99.9 FM The Fan ESPN Radio.\nThat's why there's nothing better than North Carolina vs. Duke\nPOST VIEW\nAnd you thought the Super Bowl had a great finish.\nMidway through the second half, with North Carolina massaging a double-digit lead over Duke, it was obvious that the difference between the Tar Heels and Blue Devils was up front. Roy Williams sends three future NBA players \u2013 maybe even lottery picks \u2013 out to start the game, while Mike Krzyzewski counters with a pair of nice college guys. Oh, don\u2019t misread my meaning, Mason Plumlee and Ryan Kelly are good players, but for 30-plus minutes, the Tar Heels rode Tyler Zeller (23 points, 11 rebounds), Harrison Barnes (25 points, 23 in the 2nd half) and John Henson (12 points, 17 rebounds) and were seemingly toying with Duke and appeared poised for a comfortable win and the conference lead at the halfway pole.\nBut, with 2:17 left, and the Blue Devils trailing by 10, the rivalry showed up.\nTyler Thornton, who had missed all five of his field goal attempts to that point \u2013 why he had taken five shots is a mystery best left to forensic science \u2013 knocked down a 3-pointer. From there, it all seemed to move in slow motion. A missed traveling call followed by a Seth Curry three pointer, an accidental tip-in of a Duke jumper by Zeller, a couple of Tar Heel turnovers and a pair of missed free throws later and suddenly, inexplicably, the Blue Devils were bringing the ball up the court with a chance to send the game into overtime \u2013 or, if you\u2019re a Carolina fan, worse.\nThat\u2019s what this rivalry does, I guess.\nDuke vs. Carolina is mostly about basketball, but the rivalry is about magic. It\u2019s about Walter Davis banking one in to finish off an 8-point rally in 17 seconds \u2013 before the shot clock AND the 3-pointer \u2013 to force an overtime the Tar Heels would win. It\u2019s about Jeff Capel burying a mid-court runner to force a second overtime that an undermanned Duke team would eventually lose. And, tonight -- tonight -- it was about an 11-point comeback, a fortunate bounce, and a runny nosed, freshman who rose to the biggest occasion of his college career, with his NBA coach father watching from the stands and carried his teammates to the most improbable of victories. What's even better is that the freshman, future NBAer Austin Rivers, seemed totally at home under the whitest of lights.\u00a0 \"That's just what he's been put on this planet to do,\" is what Coach K would later say about the player who gave him one of his biggest wins in this storied series.\nIn the end, you feel bad for the kids at North Carolina. Both teams made their share of mistakes. Both teams missed more than their share of free throws, open shots and golden opportunities. Both teams easily did enough to win. After getting back to their feet after an early Duke surge, North Carolina imposed their will and their size on the Blue Devils and as the minutes and seconds melted off the clock, it appeared that North Carolina was well on their way to a sixth consecutive win and sole possession of 1st place in the ACC with just four weekends left in the regular season.\nThen the rivalry kicked in, Rivers' 25-footer fell from the sky and went through the net in almost complete silence, and that rivalry kicked North Carolina in the teeth. It was a magical night; one that started as a basketball game and finished up a story to be told to generations of Rivers to come. Welcome to the rivalry, kid.\u00a0 For ever more, you'll be the punctuation on one of the greatest finishes in the greatest rivalry in college sports.\nMost Recent Comments\nPosted Feb 11, 1:20 p.m.\nRank: Sports Legend\n"}, {"score": 1162.7043, "uuid": "4e06498d-afca-5fec-99c0-76e3415b9e96", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000tw-04-16041", "target_hostname": "www.wralsportsfan.com", "target_uri": "http://www.wralsportsfan.com/", "page_rank": 3.277553e-08, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "WRALSportsFan.com - UNC <em>basketball</em>, Duke <em>basketball</em>, NC State <em>football</em>,", "snippet": "UNC That&#x27;s <em>why</em> there&#x27;s nothing <em>better</em> <em>than</em> North Carolina vs.", "explanation": null, "document": "joeovies : @MandyWRAL @joshwgoodson you're just figuring that out?\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 7:04 PM\nhighschoolot : Fedora's enthusiasm drew Hillside duo to commit http://t.co/McjN4Jya\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 6:55 PM\nMandyWRAL : Future Tar Heel---&gt;&gt;&gt;@Korrin_Wiggins: S/o to @MandyWRAL for the interview and also to @Highschoolot ...\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 6:54 PM\nuncsportsfan : Fedora's enthusiasm drew Hillside duo to commit http://t.co/3jp3vue6\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 6:51 PM\nWRALSportsFan : New story: Fedora's enthusiasm drew Hillside duo to commit http://t.co/GclRjNbB\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 6:30 PM\njoeovies : .@JohnForslund: \"Did you even know who the Whalers were in high school?\" Me: \"Yes, they were goal fodder in NHL '93.\" #dorksportstalk\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 5:59 PM\njoeovies : Halo and Community references\u2026this is a sports show for dorks.\n\u2014\u00a0Friday, February 10, 2012 5:38 PM\nMandyWRAL : Trying to cut video of the ram for the 6pm.

While recovering from a serious injury suffered in a game with the Calgary Stampeders, Lumsden says he made up his mind to become a one-sport athlete.\nAnd bobsled won.\n\u201cI love football. I played it all my life and I\u2019ll always love it,\u201d said the 28-year-old Burlington native. \u201cBut representing Canada, there\u2019s nothing that can beat that experience.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else that gave me more of a sense of pride and accomplishment and just the passion for the country and the people of Canada.\n\u201cThat trumped everything for me.\u201d\nOlympic hero Clara Hughes is another multi-sport athlete who got to write her own script. Prior to the Vancouver Olympics, she announced she was retiring from speed skating to focus on cycling \u2014 a decision she says she made because she longed for the challenge provided by two wheels and felt she had accomplished as much as she could on two blades.\nBut there\u2019s a fairly long list of multi-sport athletes who don\u2019t get to decide when they cut back. Usually others make the decision for them.\nBO JACKSON\nOne of the most impressive of the two-sport stars, Jackson was dominant in both football and baseball. While juggling two seasons in one, he was one of the most feared hitters in Major League Baseball and one of the most dominant running backs in the National Football League. But the decision was made for him in his fourth year of double duty when a hip injury ended his football career in 1990.\nDEION SANDERS\nSanders duplicated Jackson\u2019s feat to an extent, starring as a kick returner and defensive back in the NFL while helping take the Atlanta Braves to the World Series in 1992. Sanders did get to call his own shots in leaving baseball after a solid season in 1997, but his attempted comeback four years later ended badly.\nBRIAN JORDAN\nAnother football-baseball guy, Jordan was a defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons while spending his summers in the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 minor-league chain. But after three years of doing both, the Cardinals offered him a $1.7 million bonus in 1992 on one condition: that he give up football. He complied and went on to have a solid major league career.\nDANNY AINGE\nA multi-sport athlete at college, Ainge was considered a pro prospect in both baseball and basketball. The Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in 1977 and he skyrocketed to the majors in 1979 while still taking college classes. But Ainge\u2019s bat was the main reason he chose to try the NBA in 1981. In parts of three seasons, he averaged .220 with two homers and 37 RBIs.\nMARK HENDRICKSON\nAfter starring in both baseball and basketball at university, Hendrickson chose the latter and signed with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1996. But he was let go following the \u201998 season and bounced around the NBA for two more seasons, getting little playing time. Frustrated, he moved to baseball and is still pitching with the Baltimore Orioles.\nMICHAEL JORDAN\nThe sporting world was shocked, and a tad skeptical, when Jordan announced his retirement from the NBA in 1993 while at the top of his game. More shock followed when he announced he was going to play baseball. He signed a minor-league deal and, going up against players 10 years his junior, demonstrated quickly that his deft touch with the basketball didn\u2019t translate to baseball. His .202 average in AA spelled the end of his baseball career in 1994.\nPAT WHITE\nThe University of West Virginia standout was drafted by both the Anaheim Angels and Miami Dolphins. He chose the latter, but was released after one season as a quarterback, taking with him a $2.4 million guaranteed contract. After drawing no NFL interest, he signed to pitch with the Kansas City Royals last fall. But before his first spring training, he announced his retirement from baseball.\n"}, {"score": 1181.9257, "uuid": "2cb8b008-d008-5592-bd97-8fe1cecf6d99", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1715wb-31-30433", "target_hostname": "bretdougherty.com", "target_uri": "http://bretdougherty.com/2007/02/05/better-than-that/", "page_rank": 1.1753607e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> That\u2026", "snippet": "The Colts have the worst run \u2018D\u2019 in the league, we need him when TJ <em>is</em> tired. * <em>Is</em> it me\u2026?", "explanation": null, "document": "February 5th, 2007 \u00b7 No Comments\nThe only thing that I can say about last night\u2019s Super Bowl Sunday game is\u2026\nThe Bears are better than that.\nAnd no\u2026That\u2019s not a bitter reply to the great play of the Indianapolis Colts and their ability to maintain long drives.

Makuach Teny, has caused a lot of resentment and unending or heated debates among the youth about whether or not it was within his area of jurisdiction to do so. Some quarters of the youth society argued that the caretaker minister didn\u2019t have much power to make major decisions such as forming South Sudan national youth union and appointing its president since he had only minimal or limited powers. They also argued that he couldn\u2019t have done that without consulting with the youth whether it was the right choice or the kind of person they would want to see representing their interests in different government institutions and or other for a regionally and internationally or not. Others jumped to the conclusion that he appointed the guy based on tribal line or interest.\nWell, whatever the case is, I think some of those voices also argued from a tribal viewpoint-----given the fact that the minister didn\u2019t appoint a Dinka to that position, and that didn\u2019t augur well with some Dinka youth who thought/ felt that they are capable to occupy every key position at the expense of others. That was a cause of major concern for some as well! I think if the one appointed by the minister was a Dinka, there wouldn\u2019t have been such an upheaval or uproar from some quarters of the youth. All would have served its very purpose, since in their view/opinion, effective or capable leaders must always emerge from amongst them; thus, the in-born kinds of leaders. They condemned the former minister for having made such a decision.\nBut the fundamental question remains: was the former minister wrong by trying to organize a central youth body? Was he also wrong or condemned when he formed four other committees, like football, volleyball, athletic, basketball etc? The answers to two questions amongst others could be in the silence. I don\u2019t think he was wrong in his efforts to organize the youths in South Sudan by forming a central body so that they can be able to defend and protect their collective interests and fight for their rights together with one unified voice. I am also of the opinion that it was his prerogative to organize the youth and appoint its president if the youth themselves have failed to do it on their own. I could be wrong but I am afraid I am justly right!! Firstly, the youth have never made any attempts in the past to try to organize themselves in order to have a \u2018South Sudan National Youth Union\u2019 (SSNYU). It\u2019s for their own benefits and interests, not Makuach\u2019s!\nSecondly, if the ex-minister appointed people tothe above mentioned national committees through a ministerial order, why not acentral youth body? We believe he consulted with the president of the republic firstbefore making it public. But did anyone ever complain as to why certain personalities were made the heads or chairpersons of the said committees? The answer to this question is a resounding BIG NO! But what\u2019s the crown about the appointment of Mr. Stephen Puoch Riek? Is he being pre-judged on the basis of his abilities and capability or on the basis of his ethnicity? And for those questioning the legitimacy of this decision, could it have been legitimate if only Mr. Akol Paul or any other person was to be made a president of this national youth body?\u00a0I think it\u2019s high time we stop prejudging others before assuming duties and seeing them as incapable to provide sound and good leadership.\nSouth Sudan is for all the people of South Sudan and not for Dinka or Nuer alone. Therefore, every South Sudanese who is capable to do a national duty should not be discriminated on the basis of his/her ethnicity. The Honourable ex-minister was not wrong to have organized a central youth body to defend and protect the interests of youth in South Sudan. At least, it\u2019s better than always running after our uncles to give us everything instead of being independent. We line up behind them and pat their backs even when they are wrong.\u00a0I think we need to start challenging them to retire from certain duties which require youth with energies and innovative ideas; they need to give room for the youth to takeover. We need them around us to give us some good advices and to guide us. We also need them to share with us from their experiences of the past and how we might be able to pick the best lessons. Above all, we needed a non-partisan youth body to work for all, and we\u2019ve got it now. Please, hide your political colours and put the interest of youths above any party\u2019s or individual interest.\nI urge all the youth to refrain from negative or tribalistic thinking. I also appeal to all the youth to rally behind the recently appointed leadership in order to move forward as one. Those who said that the ministerial order appointing the current national youth leadership should be reversed or nullified by the newly appointed national minister of Youth and sports were not right and justified. It cannot be reversed or nullified because it was a government\u2019s decision through Hon. Makuach Teny, and not his own decision. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Let us also acknowledge and appreciate the great work done by the former minister Makuach Teny in the ministry. He did countless and numerous good things in the interest of youth! He knew what he was doing and whose interest he was representing. He was very active and always with the youth. I don\u2019t think the reason that made him not come back to the new cabinet was a question of performance; it wasn\u2019t about poor performance, for could that be the case, there were those who performed poorly and corruptly in the previous cabinet but still made it back to this recent one.

Naturally, as a Georgia fan, I have a vested interest in the Big East's success, inasmuch as the league's watershed moment came against my team . In their first trio of games during the 2005 postseason, Big East squads were 0-3 in bowls; after winning the Sugar Bowl in January 2006, the league went 5-0 in postseason play last season.\nWhile we all expected the Big East to decline in the absence of Miami and Virginia Tech, it now appears that the league improved precisely because the Hokies and the Hurricanes departed .\nPreviously, it had been understood universally that the road to the conference championship almost invariably ran through Blacksburg and Coral Gables; in the 13 seasons between 1991 and 2003, Miami finished first or second in Big East play a dozen times and V.P.I. finished in the top two seven times, so the rest of the league typically was relegated to battling over the silver medal or, oftentimes, the bronze.\n\" If you ain't first, you're last! \"\nEven when teams other than the 'Canes and the Hokies made it into the limelight, their performance on the grand stage seldom reflected favorably upon the Big East as a whole. More often than not, the league's other member institutions fell flat on their faces in major bowl games, as was the case with West Virginia's 41-7 loss to Florida in the 1994 Sugar Bowl, Syracuse's 35-18 loss to Kansas State in the 1997 Fiesta Bowl and the Orangemen's 31-10 loss to Florida in the 1999 Orange Bowl, and Pitt's 35-7 loss to Utah in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl.\nWhen the Big East's marquee programs bolted for the A.C.C., a power vacuum was created and there no longer was any reason why several programs could not aspire realistically to becoming the league's new alpha male. West Virginia stepped to the forefront. Louisville entered the league and staked its claim. Rutgers rose to the ranks of the contenders. Pittsburgh and Syracuse have considerable potential based on tradition. Cincinnati and South Florida have tremendous potential based on demographics . Even U.Conn. has shown flashes of competitiveness from time to time.\nWell, O.K., maybe not \"competitiveness,\" exactly, but the Huskies are pretty tough, at least by Connecticut standards.\nIn 2005, West Virginia handed Louisville a 46-44 setback in Morgantown; a year later, the Cardinals returned the favor in the Bluegrass State . U. of L. came up three points short against Rutgers , then the Scarlet Knights fell to the Mountaineers in overtime . Toss in the occasional upset by Cincinnati or South Florida and it becomes clear that the Big East is a competitive conference.\nA little over a year ago, college football fans were debating seriously whether the Big East deserved an automatic B.C.S. bid. Not only is that argument now over, but the Big East's seat at the table today appears both more legitimate and more secure than that of the conference that Miami and Virginia Tech currently call home.\nThe Big East's top teams are better than their A.C.C. counterparts and the younger of the two leagues also is the deeper conference. If I were Mike Tranghese, I'd be arguing publicly that the Atlantic Coast Conference's status as an automatic B.C.S. qualifier ought to be reconsidered. Hey, that wouldn't be the dumbest thing said by a major conference commissioner lately . . . .\nGo 'Dawgs!\n"}, {"score": 1152.2467, "uuid": "0bbf86d8-295e-5691-be30-ee197c2526b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-70-23461", "target_hostname": "www.burntorangenation.com", "target_uri": "http://www.burntorangenation.com/2012/2/9/2786535/jackson-jeffcoat-is-better-than-alex-okafor", "page_rank": 1.3630961e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Jackson Jeffcoat <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Alex Okafor - Burnt Orange Nation", "snippet": "Tre\u2019 Newton\u2019s father was in the NFL as well, but would it make sense to have used that as part of an argument that Tre was <em>better</em> <em>than</em>, say, Chris Ogbonnaya?", "explanation": null, "document": "Jackson Jeffcoat is better than Alex\u00a0Okafor\nAm I crazy for thinking this?

Most frequently, though, they\u2019re either hired by a larger university or they\u2019re fired. Very few arrive on a small college campus in their mid-30s and stay until retirement.\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that Elon University announced Sunday that Pete Lembo would be leaving his post as head coach of the Phoenix after five successful years at the helm of a previously struggling program. Lembo, who posted a 35-22 record at Elon \u2014 including a stellar 9-3 NCAA Football Championship Subdivision playoff campaign in 2009 \u2014 officially took over at Ball State during a news conference Monday in Muncie, Ind.\nIt\u2019s a great opportunity and a logical career progression for someone who got his first head coaching job at Lehigh before moving up to Elon and the highly competitive Southern Conference.

It\u2019s a stepping stone to perhaps an even larger university and a spot on the national stage if Lembo is able to replicate his Elon achievements at his new position.\n\u201cThese FBS jobs are incredibly hard to get,\u201d Lembo told the Times-News on Sunday night. \u201cThis is something you just can\u2019t say no to.\u201d\nAgreed. And while we\u2019re hardly shocked to see him go and wish him all the best, it\u2019s still a sad day.\nBefore Lembo arrived at Elon, the school\u2019s college football fortunes had fallen on hard times. Life in the NCAA had flattened a program that regularly dominated opponents in the 1970s and 1980s at the NAIA level. Back in the day, Elon regularly made the playoffs and competed for and won national titles.\nBut after opening a new stadium, the five-year record for Elon before Lembo arrived was a dismal 14-42.\nIn Lembo\u2019s first season, the Phoenix showed promise with a 5-6 mark. Anticipation and expectations grew after a 7-4 record in 2007. Lembo was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year.\u00a0 With talented quarterback Scott Riddle of Ramseur leading the way, Elon posted winning records the next three years and contended for or gained playoff berths. About the only major obstacle Elon couldn\u2019t overcome was Appalachian State University, the perennial Southern Conference champions. But games between the two teams became tantalizingly close for the Phoenix and their supporters and a rivalry between the two schools was born. Twice the Mountaineers and Phoenix clawed it out before capacity crowds at Rhodes Stadium.\nIt\u2019s a testament to Lembo\u2019s accomplishments that this past season\u2019s 6-5 mark was considered disappointing in some corners.\nWins and losses aside, what set Lembo apart from many in his profession was his commitment to the Elon community. He regularly contacted supporters or appeared at public functions to talk about the team and its fortunes. Lembo even designed a class to teach those who didn\u2019t know much about football the finer points of the game.\nNow, Elon begins the search for a new football coach. Lembo has given the athletic department a blueprint of what to look for in its next hire and a successful football program to hand off to his successor.\nCan\u2019t ask for a better legacy than that.\nPosted in: Let's talk sports\nADVERTISEMENT\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.

They focused on last season's preseason Top 25, and found that Nebraska ranked in a tie for 19th place in terms of players with a police record with four. That's actually on the low end. Leading the list are the Pitt Panthers with 22 players having had some sort of police issues.\u00a0 Iowa tied with Arkansas for second with 18.\u00a0 Boise State and Penn State tied for fourth with 16.\nWorking off a quick Google search and my own recollection, I believe Nebraska's claim to infamy on this list is primarily DUI offenses by Niles Paul , Rickey Thenarse , and Baker Steinkuhler .\u00a0 The fourth may be Ben Cotton 's minor-in-possession charge (later dropped) from 2009. Not to excuse those offenses, but Nebraska's record actually looks good in comparison. I do believe that Bo Pelini takes these issues seriously and has improved Nebraska's off-the-field record during his tenure.\u00a0 Not resolved the problem, obviously, but the number and seriousness of incidents has decreased as of late.\nThe team report was led by SI's Jeff Benedict, Andy Staples, and Armen Keteyian of CBS News. You may remember Keteyian, who has bounced from sideline reporter for NFL games to \"Chief Investigative Reporter\" for CBS News, as the author of \"Big Red Confidential\", an attempt to portray Tom Osborne as operating a shady program back in the 80's. The story never went anywhere, especially once Osborne discredited Keteyian's investigation .\nI couldn't help but be amused by the name of the school that led the list , and the man who's been in charge of that athletic department for the last three-plus years. (Heck, they had to fire their new head coach after only two weeks after he had been charged with assault himself.)\u00a0 Nebraska's \"Enemy of the State\" told reporters today that the situation was \"unacceptable\" and he'll \"get this fixed.\"\n\"Certainly, this was an unusual year because we had so many high-profile incidents in such a short period of time.\"\nOf course, he's referring to four incidents from last season...ignoring the other eighteen that the investigation reported on. And considering his track record on \"getting things fixed\", Pitt fans should be very confident in his ability to do just that. (Is your sarcasm alarm going off the charts?)\nOur neighbors to the east and newest rivals, the Iowa Hawkeyes certainly have had their share of issues as of late. A quick search of Black Heart, Gold Pants finds 159 hits for \"arrest\" , though many deal with other Hawkeye teams. (A comparable CornNation search only returns 42, most of which actually discuss the legal issues of our opponents.)\nMore from this investigation is likely to emerge in the coming days, including a call for schools to perform background checks on potential recruits. One problem with that approach is that in many cases, records for these players prior to college are locked up and confidential in juvenile court. Also, in many cases, a college football program can give players a final opportunity to straighten their life out and become a better citizen. Certainly that was the argument that Tom Osborne used when he suspended Lawrence Phillips for half of the 1995 season rather than kicking him off the team. Phillips didn't learn his lesson , and continued to run afoul of the law, cutting his professional career short and now facing spending many, many years in prison.\nThe question I pose is this: should football programs perform background checks on incoming players and revoke scholarship offers if they have a record?\u00a0 Do football programs need to be held accountable for the legal issues that players find themselves in?\u00a0 Or is this one of those things that will make noise for a few days, then disappear as everybody focuses back on spring football and whether the NFL is going to play this fall?\n"}, {"score": 1124.1838, "uuid": "e6bef546-a6c8-5fb3-8ab2-fb218bbaa904", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0903wb-65-07235", "target_hostname": "posseincitatus.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://posseincitatus.typepad.com/posse_incitatus/2011/08/better-than-nothing.html", "page_rank": 1.1832181e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Posse Incitatus: <em>Better</em> <em>than</em> Nothing", "snippet": "And what just transpired <em>is</em> a battle, not the entire war.

They were muddling along at 7-7 when the 13th-ranked Florida Gators came knocking on their door Saturday morning.\nBut when the Gators knocked, the Vols rocked.\nUT's 67-56 victory will resonate beyond basketball. It took new coach\nCuonzo Martin one SEC game to register a bigger victory than two different Tennessee football coaches have managed in the last three seasons.\nSure, it's apples and big oranges.

All they know is they attended a sporting event on the UT campus and didn't return home with their stomachs churning.\nMartin probably didn't notice or care, but his Ten\nnessee fan club was growing by the basket Saturday. He was too busy plying his trade at court-side. In fact, he was still barking commands in the last two minutes, although the victory had been tucked away.\nHis presence contrasted sharply with that of Florida coach Billy Donovan, who sat through the last five minutes as lifeless as a weary commercial-airlines traveler waiting on an overdue jet. To his credit, Donovan didn't attribute the outcome solely to his team's inadequate play. He said more than once in his postgame analysis that when you don't execute, the opponent often has a big hand in it.\n\"You have to give the other team credit when you don't necessarily do the things that you want to do,\" he said.\nFlorida forward Erik Murphy dismissed another possible excuse by saying UT's early-season struggles didn't burden the Gators with overconfidence.\n\"We play Tennessee every year,\" he said. \"We know how good they are. I think they're better than their record shows. They played well today and deserved to win.\"\nThe Vols were all over the Gators before the end of the first half, leading by four before pulling away in the last 20 minutes. They shot better, defended harder and seemed vastly more interested in the outcome. Their superiority was so apparent in upping the lead to 16 points, I wondered if Martin would be accused of running up the score.\nThe Vols didn't just beat the Gators. They hurt them. Florida's Casey Prather actually fell to the floor and injured his ankle as UT's Cam Tatum changed directions on the dribble.\nThe Gators sometimes looked as helpless in the second half as UT's football team once did trying to defend Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin, reminding you that Tennessee's basketball rivalry with Florida has become the antithesis of the Vols vs. Gators in football.\nIn football, the Vols have lost seven consecutive games to Florida. In basketball, they have won 12 of the last 19 meetings.\nRelated videos\nCuonzo Martin on UT's win over Florida\nThe UT basketball program doesn't just prop up its football buddies against Florida.

In the 2009-10 season, less than a couple of weeks after the Vols were waylaid by Virginia Tech in the Chick-fil-A Bowl, their basketball team upset No. 1 Kansas.\nNow, as the Vols sit out another bowl season, the basketball team has managed to do two things in one day that the football program can't: beat a nationally ranked team and beat Florida.\nThe Vols will have a couple of chances to enhance their reputation for upsets in the next week. They will play at Mississippi State on Thursday before taking on Kentucky at Thompson-Boling two days later.\nMaybe UT's football team will have a new defensive coordinator by then.\nJohn Adams is a senior columnist.

Dr. Atul Gawande, asserts that coaching can play a valuable role in a variety of life\u2019s stages and environments.\u00a0 He tells of his experience working as a surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital inBoston,MA.\u00a0 Though very accomplished, he sought out the help of a former medical school instructor for coaching.\u00a0 Ironically, this doctor was already at the top of his game and teaching surgery atHarvardMedicalSchool.\u00a0 He thinks he needs a coach?\u00a0 Exactly!\u00a0 He explains that world-class tennis players, golfers and other athletes and performers rely on coaches to help them continue to improve, why not surgeons?\u00a0 Coaching is applicable in disciplines even outside the athletic world.\u00a0 Further, coaching is a method for continuous improvement, and we all have the capacity to improve in any endeavor in which we dedicate ourselves.\nTo become proficient in a sport, occupation or pastime one must acquire aptitude and faculty.\u00a0 Dr. Gawande describes this continuous-improvement process as moving from (\u201cUnconscious Incompetence\u201d) or not knowing the barrier preventing improved performance, to a state in which the barrier impeding improvement is identified (\u201cConscious Incompetence\u201d) and then eliminated (\u201cConscious Competence\u201d).\u00a0 At this point, improved performance is achieved \u2013 at least for the moment.\u00a0 However, to become elite and experience a longer-term successful state, those acquired abilities must be put to practice and turned into habit.\u00a0 The new aptitude must become habitual (\u201cUnconscious Competence\u201d).\u00a0 According to Dr. Gawande, a coach is the essential stimulus for experiencing improvement and creating habits because he/she adds an outside perspective whereby flaws in performance unknown previously are corrected, eliminated and the improved skill is practiced and eventually becomes habit.\nHow does an organization go from unconscious safety incompetence to unconscious safety competence?\u00a0 With proper coaching of course!\u00a0 Before I describe safety coaching approaches consider this scenario in a factory I visited this past year.\u00a0 On this particular tour, my guide and I came across a roped-off area of the production floor where two workers were in a crane doing overhead work.\u00a0 We looked for a path around the guarded area and an employee of this organization tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou can cross the rope and enter at your own risk.\u201d\u00a0 He pointed to some people that were lifting up the rope and walking right under the bucket with the workers in it.\u00a0 Sensing my trepidation, my guide found an alternative route around the roped off area.\u00a0 This organization felt that an at-your-own-risk approach to safety management was acceptable; hence, subjecting exposure to risk in the factory to one\u2019s own personal view point.\u00a0 Not good for reducing risk, in my opinion\u2026This organization needed safety coaching!\nSo there are three types of safety coaching.\u00a0 The first and most common is supervisor coaching.\u00a0 In other words, a manager or trainer of some sort observes employees on the operations floor doing work.\u00a0 When that manager sees somebody inching toward being unsafe he/she stops that employee and coaches them how to do it safely.\u00a0 This approach is better than not doing any safety coaching at all but I believe is not enough.\u00a0 Commonplace supervisor safety coaching may foster improvement but here are two additional methods that cover a wider organizational area and can help achieve \u201cUnconscious Safety Competence.\u201d\u00a0 Safety Leadership Strategy Coaching (SLSC) and Peer Assessment Coaching (PAC).\u00a0 The first targets an organization\u2019s management cultural approach to safety and the second targets an organization\u2019s method for promoting employee involvement with safety.\nHave you ever talked to a teenager with big dreams but no plans?\u00a0 Like that well-intentioned teenager, some organizations have lofty-safety-performance dreams but no plan or strategy to achieve them.\u00a0 \u201cOur safety goal is to be world class\u201d may be printed on a banner in the lobby of that organization but really there is not a substantial plan to achieve that world-class standard.\u00a0 Failure to have a plan or following a misguided plan is ultimately management\u2019s responsibility.\u00a0 SLSC is an often-times humbling process where you invite knowledgeable and respected safety professionals from outside your organization to examine your safety philosophy, goals, plan, systems and tools -- the things that management creates to achieve safety in an organization.\u00a0 These trusted safety coaches identify possible shortfalls and opportunities for better alignment within your organization\u2019s safety goals.\u00a0 To make this type of coaching work, you must be willing to fully expose your weaknesses and be prepared to address them.\u00a0 You may learn that amazing safety programs you implemented recently may not be so spectacular after all.\u00a0 Keep in mind, thorough coaching points out all potential flaws without regard for preserving ego that may impede improvement.\u00a0 SLSC works best if it sincerely challenges management\u2019s commitment to safety improvement and leadership stands ready to adjust accordingly.\nTruth be told, coaching from management or an outside consultant is often less impactful than peer-to-peer coaching, orPAC.\u00a0 To illustrate, consider this personal example with my nine-year-old son.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been trying to teach him to throw a football for months now and his friend from next door got through to him in a couple of minutes.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy he improved but where did I go wrong in my coaching?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t!\u00a0 His friend captured his attention in a way that I don\u2019t.\u00a0 Peer teaching and learning is often effective because of the social and team building aspect peers possess by virtue of the relationship dynamics inherent with peer relationships.\u00a0 This goes for children and adults alike.\u00a0 PAC is a non-intimidating method of providing coaching between peers that captures attention better than management often is able.\u00a0 Behavior-based observation is a popular peer coaching method that employs peers as safety coaches.\u00a0 It typically works like this: One employee observes another employee performing a task and evaluates the observed employee based upon a set of criteria and, afterwards, provides coaching based on identified risks observed.\u00a0 Sometimes it feels better to learn how you can improve from a friend working along side you rather than from a manager.\nI believe there is a place for all three methods of safety coaching; however, you miss the mark if your organization utilizes only one or two of these methods.\u00a0 Employing all three will get you closer to unconscious safety competence or a culture where everyone is seamlessly guided by being safe.\u00a0 It\u2019s true, coaches hold a warm place in my heart and I do have a fond appreciation for the role they play in society.\u00a0 I firmly believe that safety can be coached in an organization effectively leading to world class achievement.\u00a0 However, the safety coaching must not be delivered at a management to subordinate level only but also challenge the safety cultural focus of organizational leaders and empower the good people at the shop-floor level as safety coaches as well.\u00a0 Special thanks to the great coaches that have provided the example for us all.\u00a0 May we model our safety coaching after them and be safer because of it!\nAbout the Author, Rob Loose, MAU Safety Manager:\nSafety Professional with Manufacturing, HR and Health Care management experience, Rob has worked for MAU since 2006 supporting both HR and operations functions.

A decision for Delvon not to play was reached by Izzo, Hollis and Roe and no NCAA waiver was requested. This is possible, the decision for Delvon to leave basketball didn't appear to be easy, he might just not want to reopen old wounds or a host of many other reasons(loss of focus on the game, sacrificing a valuable Roe minute in what will be a tightly contested game, etc).\nOR\nIzzo loves his kids, Hollis is a showman, I won't call him a PT Barnum of Athletic Directors, but the thought crossed my mind.

Needing a strong finish, the Falcons picked up wins in four of those decisions in order to win the requisite number of games to be considered bowl eligible, given the fact that they picked up a couple of victories against members of the Football Championship Subdivision early on.\nAs for the Rockets, they had great success during their Mid-American Conference schedule in 2011, winning all but one (Northern Illinois, 63-60) of their league bouts to finish 7-1 in MAC play in back-to-back seasons for the first time in program history. The team showed great resolve as it bounced back from three straight losses to Ohio State, Boise State and Syracuse in the month of September in order to win seven of the final eight outings and become co-champs of the MAC's West Division. However, because NIU won the one meeting between the two teams during the regular season, it was the Huskies who represented the division in the MAC title game versus Ohio University and eventually won the championship outright.\nSo successful was Toledo that bigger BCS programs took notice, particularly Illinois which named Tim Beckman its new head coach the second week of December. As a result of Beckman leaving the Rockets, the program made offensive coordinator Matt Campbell its new leader. As the youngest head coach at the Football Bowl Subdivision level at 32 years of age, Campbell will be the one on the sidelines leading the Rockets in this contest.\nEven though he won't be involved in the postseason for the Rockets, Beckman was still proud of the way his team performed this season.\n\"I think the Military Bowl will provide our student-athletes with an outstanding bowl experience in Washington D.C., as well as the opportunity to play against a very tough Air Force team,\" said Tim Beckman. \"I'm very proud of this team. This is an excellent reward for all the hard work put in by our players, coaches and everyone involved in our team's success.\"\nAir Force enters the contest with a record of 10-10-1 all-time in bowl appearances and that includes a mark of 2-2 under head coach Troy Calhoun who is in his fifth season with The Academy. Last year, the Falcons took part in the Independence Bowl and slipped by Georgia Tech in a 14-7 final thanks to a three-yard rushing touchdown by Jared Tew in the fourth quarter.\nAs for the Rockets, they're postseason pedigree ranges back to 1969 when they demolished Davidson in the Tangerine Bowl, 56-33. Last year, the team clashed with FIU in the Little Caesars Bowl and came up short in a 34-32 final to drop them to 8-3 in bowl games all-time, although some Toledo historians also take into consideration four postseason bouts the school hosted between 1946-49 at the Glass Bowl, the team putting up a mark of 3-1 in those contests as well.\nThis particular bowl started in 2008 when it was known as the Congressional Bowl and then took on the name of the Eagle Bank Bowl after picking up major sponsorship from a financial institution. Last year local favorites, the Maryland Terrapins, crushed East Carolina in a 51-20 final.\nThe Toledo offense begins with the exploits of Eric Page, who was not only named All-MAC First Team as a wide receiver after he caught a school-record 112 passes in 2011, he was also named All-MAC First Team as both a punt returner and kickoff returner as well, making him one of only three players in league history to earn a spot on the first team at three different positions in the same year.\nFeeding the ball to Page this season on offense were quarterbacks Terrance Owens and Austin Dantin, who combined to throw for 30 touchdowns and just six interceptions as they often shared time under center. Owens, who appeared in 11 of the team's 12 games, completed a staggering 71.4 percent of his attempts, although Dantin wasn't far behind with his 64.9 percent accuracy.\nRunning backs Adonis Thomas (963 yards, 11 TDs) and Morgan Williams (671 yards, 11 TDs) helped supply the offense with much-needed ground production as they guided the squad to an average of 221.2 ypg and better than five yards per attempt.\nWith more than three times as many receptions as anyone else on the squad, Page garnered plenty of attention when lining up out on the wing and ended up averaging about 10 yards per catch and landing in the end zone 10 times on receptions and once more on a punt return. Always a threat to break a big play, Page is constantly involved in the action for the Rockets and that's why he was named a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award, which recognizes the nation's most versatile player.\nThe run defense for the Rockets during the regular season was rather strong, giving up just 123.2 ypg to rank first in the MAC and 26th nationally, but much of that had to do with the fact that many opponents opted to test Toledo through the air where the team was much more vulnerable while permitting 277.9 ypg to rank last in the conference and 109th in the country. In fact, three times this season the pass defense, which earned a rating of 145.5, allowed at least five passing scores.\nWhile the Rockets were having a tough time slowing down opposing passing attacks, Air Force was being beaten up by other programs who ran the ball as much as it did. The Falcons ended up being second in the nation on offense with 320.3 ypg on the ground, but at the same time the team was giving up 227.8 ypg by way of the run and that placed the squad fifth in the Mountain West and 113th in the country.\nThe pass defense for the Falcons was much stronger, at least as far as the stats were concerned, because the program was permitting just 162.7 ypg and that not only had The Academy ranked first in the conference, it also placed it sixth in the country overall. Seven different players recorded interceptions for the Falcons, but it was Jon Davis that made it more of a habit with his four picks.\nWorking closer to the line of scrimmage, Alex Means led the Falcons with nine tackles for loss and six sacks, adding three forced fumbles, a couple of recoveries and a pair of blocked kicks. Brady Amack placed first on the team with a whopping 125 tackles, his 10.4 stops per game placing him second in the league and 15th in the nation.\nOver on the other side of the ball, the Air Force offense continued to evolve and incorporate even more passing into the attack this season, thanks to the growth and development of quarterback Tim Jefferson. The winningest signal caller in school history with 28 victories, Jefferson converted 98-of-161 passes for a career-high 1,478 yards on the season with 12 touchdowns and six interceptions. His 60.9 completion percentage was fourth-best for a single season at Air Force\nOperating the triple-option at full capacity, Jefferson also tied for the team lead in rushing touchdowns with 10, matching Mike DeWitt as both players combined to generate more than 1,000 rushing yards. Getting the job done all on his own was Asher Clark who carried the ball 151 times and finished with 1,096 yards and six TDs for a program that had a total of 11 players credited with at least one rushing score as they tallied 39 total TDs on the ground.\nGiving the Air Force offense another dimension altogether was Zack Kauth who reeled in 27 passes for a team-best 543 yards and four touchdowns, while Jonathan Warzeka caught a team-high 28 balls which he turned into 392 yards and three scores as well.\nNot only is playing in the postseason an important feat for the Falcons, coach Calhoun also recognizes the significance of playing in this particular bowl game and is proud to be a part of it.\n\"We're ecstatic,\" Calhoun says of the opportunity. \"The Military Bowl in Washington, D.C. is us. It's who we are. When the door opened we thought this was a perfect fit. You just don't know how many times you're going to get this opportunity because of the tie-ins you have with your conference. We're lucky to be able to get this and to go to Washington, D.C. This is another remarkable accomplishment by our team members and our administration.\"\nBoth teams might be a little shaky opening up, but once they find a comfort zone things should start to loosen up. As long as the pass defense for the Falcons can remain solid, The Academy should be in prime position to pull off the win.\n"}, {"score": 1093.9725, "uuid": "3b7c810f-3625-58ad-8bc9-0a8a642322bf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1712wb-81-20409", "target_hostname": "blog.zistle.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.zistle.com/2011/05/11/why-zistle-is-different-than-beckett/", "page_rank": 1.18634e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "<em>Why</em> Zistle <em>is</em> different <em>than</em> Beckett | The Zistle Blog", "snippet": "We at Zistle want to take this opportunity to explain <em>why</em> we are different <em>than</em> Beckett and what we are doing to make Zistle the new BEST online tool for collectors.

We at Zistle, along with many collectors, were pretty surprised by this announcement. In particular, the short time frame for their members to find another option (5 days according to the email that went out earlier this week). True to Beckett form, they have also banned any of members who have publicly protested the new policy.\nMy Organize has struggled as a product for several years now but it is difficult to complain too loudly about a free product without many alternative options. Well that is about to change. We at Zistle want to take this opportunity to explain why we are different than Beckett and what we are doing to make Zistle the new BEST online tool for collectors.\nZistle will ALWAYS be free\nWhen we mean always, we mean always. Everything that is on Zistle will remain free, forever. No fine print, exceptions, surprises, ambushes or other trickery. We are passionate that connecting with other collectors should be free and not merely a tool to sell price guides.\nWe do have plans to add a commercial version of Zistle for sports card shops and dealers and that will include paid features. We are excited about this because this will mean a strong future for Zistle and its members. Zistle is committed to being free for collectors now and in the future.\nYou can ALWAYS export your data\nYou shouldn\u2019t be a member of a site just because they are holding your information hostage. \u00a0We are completely dedicated to allowing 100% full access to your collection and trading information at all times by allowing you to export your data.\nZistle will NEVER ban its members for disagreeing with our policies\nAt Zistle, members are free to speak their mind, even if it means *gasp* you don\u2019t agree with us. Yep, it\u2019s crazy we know. We think it is important to listen to our members even if it isn\u2019t what we want to hear. Burying the criticism doesn\u2019t make it go away\nSpammers and trolls \u2013 We will ban you though, so don\u2019t bother.\nWhat we are doing to make Zistle better\nZistle has been around as a hobby site for the past 3 years. We have proven that we aren\u2019t going anywhere but we know there are a lot of features needed to be an adequate replacement for Beckett. We are completely dedicated to providing collectors a better online community \u2013 you deserve it.\nBetter Content\nBeckett claims to have over 6 million cards on their website and frankly Zistle doesn\u2019t have quite that many. Over the next few months, we will be bringing on some additional staff that will be in charge of adding cleaning up the fleshing out the Zistle library. We will also be adding some fun features related to contribution points including contests, bounties, and giveaways related to contribution points.\nForums\nWe have resisted added a forum for many years mostly because there are already some great forums for collectors. However, our members have asked for us to add a forum and other social features to help you connect with other Zistlers. We are going to put our special Zistle touch on the forum to fully integrate the forum functionality into the site.\nTrading that works\u2026. really works\nOur top priority has been to have a great organizational tool and trading has been neglected. We are working on a really powerful trading tool that will offer the best trading experience available.\nEasier to switch\nWe are actively working on some advanced features to help you import your data from Beckett to Zistle. While we already have a collection import tool that allows you to import cards with a CSV file, Beckett doesn\u2019t allow you to export your collection details. We are making it easier to add cards to your collection with an Add All button as well\nMore Members\nIt goes without saying that the more members we have on Zistle, the better the community will be. Zistle is still a non-commercial venture and we don\u2019t have a lot of money for marketing, but we know that we can do a better job of getting the word out with your help. Immediately after our next release, Zistle is going to host a new member drive which will reward current members for referring new users.

And, like Kentucky, almost every other school in any major sport at the college level, has the opportunity to win a title through a playoff system.\nNEW 2012 Nike NFL Team Gear\nSo why don\u2019t we have one in NCAA FBS (formerly Division I-A) football?\nIt might seem like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s not as simple as one might think. Consider the college football regular season spans 15 weeks with teams permitted to schedule 12 regular season games. Teams in conferences with championship games might play a 13th game, all of this prior to the annual bowl season. With the season beginning in early August when players report to camp and then ending in December or early January, we\u2019re talking about a seriously long season that encompasses the student-athlete\u2019s entire fall semester and, for some, a portion of their winter/spring semester as well.\nA major hurdle in the implementation of a playoff system will be college presidents and their respective universities\u2019 academic schedules. Not to mention, coaching and training staffs may not like the idea of playing more games in a playoff system which could potentially lead to more injuries.\nShop by College Abbreviation\nBut, the bigger hurdle, CASH. And lots of it. Before 1998 when the BCS system was instituted, college football bowl revenue was shared only by the conferences that had teams playing in major bowl games. The current BCS system shares revenue with every conference. Going to a playoff system would eliminate that revenue, which at schools in say the Sun Belt Conference, is a huge help to their struggling athletic budgets.\nThe BCS and the bowl system is popular and profitable. Why should it change? Well, a playoff system negates the subjectivity of human and computer polls and replaces it with the more objective measure of winning or losing the game on the field. A recent Gallup poll showed that 85% of college football fans would support a playoff. The big question is how to do it. Should it be a 4-team playoff or should there be more teams involved? At the FCS level, the road to the championship starts with 20 teams with the championship game now played during the first week of January. The NCAA Division II and Division III football playoffs feature 24 and 32 teams, respectively, with championship games in mid-December.\nFor lovers of the BCS (if there really are any), a playoff does not necessarily mean the end of the BCS. A ranking system would be needed to determine which teams make the playoffs. So, going to a playoff could feature the best of the BCS while determining a true champion on the field, where it deserves to be won.\n"}, {"score": 1083.5299, "uuid": "1c26307b-8a99-5841-a64b-9b8dc93da8c5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-85-07329", "target_hostname": "www.aseaofblue.com", "target_uri": "http://www.aseaofblue.com/2011/11/7/2515779/why-kentucky-will-again-be-better-than-unc-part-2-of-2", "page_rank": 1.5619867e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Why</em> Kentucky will again be <em>better</em> <em>than</em> UNC (Part 2 of 2) - A Sea Of Blue", "snippet": "* Secondary Sidebar: Links to Recent Stories, FanPosts and FanShots Around SBN: PHOTOS: Mike Moser&#x27;s Dunk Face <em>Is</em> Spectacular Online Home of the Big Blue Nation: U of Kentucky Wildcats Sports for the Discerning Fan <em>Why</em> Kentucky will again be <em>better</em> <em>than</em> UNC (Part 2 of 2) While it&#x27;s typically bad form", "explanation": null, "document": "Print\nWhile it's typically bad form for one to pronounce their favorite team as being better than one that the consensus crowd have already crowned as \"odds-on favorite to win it all\", (a team that one irrationally exuberant blog-spert suggested could be UNC'S \"best\" ever), form isn't what I'm after here.\nI also understand that the so-called experts, most of conventional wisdom, and the gasified pundits of any group, are almost always wrong. That is a fact, based on a number of recent scientific studies and books detailing those startling results.\nAnd so, since I have always thought to call it like I see it after taking in all the information available to me despite a chorus of boos, nay-sayers, bombastic homer-screamers and the like; these ideas are my own objective/subjective viewpoint.\nWith all homer-ism aside, and with an honest almost-certainty, I believe Kentucky will be better than North Carolina once again this year, and most particularly by this season's end (that is in College Basketball of course).\nTAKE SPECIAL NOTE that I am not so arrogant to say that \"Kentucky will beat UNC this year\". God only knows, but we can all agree that the best TEAM does not always win the National Championship (as my mind drifts to counting out a stack of Benjamins after a certain 1995 Cats vs.UNC NCAA game).When these titans lock horns, both teams and fans KNOW that each are CAPABLE of winning or losing it all, (as my mind now drifts to a bar in Hilton-Head, SC in 1984, as I'm counting out even more Benjamins after a second half meltdown in a UK-Georgetown NCAA tilt)\nNo, here I am talking about which team is/will be better by season's end, this year.\nJust for fun, pretend you're the Captain in a pickup game vs. Roy Williams, with all of the 2011-12 Carolina and Kentucky rosters standing around, waiting to be chosen for some 5-on-5 pickup basketball.\nRoy picks first: Harrison Barnes , so you counter with Anthony Davis. Roy grabs Tyler Zeller so you give a nod to Terrence Jones. OK, Ole' Roy says he'll take John Henson . With some hesitation you decide on Michael Kidd-Gilchrest next, leaving Darius Miller and Doron Lamb on the table with Teague and Wiltjer, along with Marshall and, uh...Strickland, Mcadoo, Bullock and P.J.Hairston.\nWho should Roy take next? In my mind he has to take either Miller or Lamb, as they appear to be the two best players left on the table. He tabs Lamb and you gladly grab Darius, leaving Marshall for Roy and you are \"stuck\" with Marquis Teague . Stuck with Marquis Teague? Wow, what a game huh?\nWell, the point is that when it comes down to it, I think Kentucky is holding the edge in talent, at least through the first five or six players, wouldn't you agree?\nCAVEAT: Blindly patriotic as many fans are, these choices might go differently with folks in Chapel Hill. It's ALSO at the crux of my argument.\nIn part ONE, I mistakenly used statistics to try and prove that Kentucky was the better team last year as well. I mistakenly assumed \"possession basketball\" (some say \"offensive efficiency\") was WELL understood as meaning: As long as you have the ball the other team cannot score, and your team can. If you turn it over, you no longer have possession. If you fail to get a rebound, you no longer have possession. It's ALL about offensive efficiency. That is: did you score when you had the ball?\nBut then, AS we all know... liars figure, and figures lie.\nWhat surprised me most was that even many Kentucky fans were unwilling to buy these facts, laid out clearly before them, which argued/showed/proved with rationale and reason that the Cats were better than the Heels during the last season, especially when it counted most: On the court in their final head-to-head game.\nYet my reasoning was maligned, my arguments mangled, and my integrity insofar as basketball knowledge laid open to serious doubt. Somewhat astoundingly, I was vehemently accused of posting an over-gratuitous self-promotion by one writer, of whom I know to be an excellent writer himself, and whose mantle is surely safe and secure without embarrassing and lambasting me as a common nit-wit.\nTo wit:\nLemme' jus' say that I don't write about Kentucky basketball to win awards, or get free tickets, to keep an erection during sex, or even for money or it's ensuing imaginary PRESTIGE.\nFor me, an occasional atta-boy if justified will suffice. Yet in my mind, this \"BBN feel good\" piece garnered an unusual barrage of over-the-top questioning and unreasonable ridicule, the likes of which I haven't felt since third grade. And from BIG BLUE fans to boot! Oh my?\nI simply love the Cats and I like to write. I won't apologize for these perversions, because I'm not too dumb to enjoy either of these endeavors. On the other hand I love honest criticism, and so it was my error in judgment to have touted my previous posts. But shameful it was not. It was merely an effort to get some real feedback (and maybe an atta-boy!).\nThat said... my insufferable ego is still intact, and I'm recovering nicely. No, permanent damage has been done.\nThis is Part 2, which many readers begged for with a curious but devilish delight?\nPart Two relies on reason and fact, but isn't entirely based on undeniable empirical evidence as was Part One; rather something a bit more insipid.\nGrowing up as I did the son of a gambler, I believe I have acquired some knowledge/wisdom through which observation-experience-feeling and gut are involved, though not exactly quantifiable. And some of that could be wrong.\nBut again the numbers, via the statistics, point to Kentucky's dominance over Carolina again, in so far as that can be measured this early in a season. And as I'm reminded each day, the game is not played on paper.\nYet some reasons, while rooted in fact are hard to pin-down.\nI mean, why is it that sometimes late in a game we are happy when a certain player is fouled, when the statistical evidence would suggest that another one would have been a better choice? Call it gut feeling.\n3 PT. SHOOTING-CAROLINA (and) 3 PT. DEFENSE\nWhere has anyone read or even heard that UNC has finally figured out how to shoot the three? Couple that with having an opponent that will guard the three better than we have yet seen at Kentucky, there should be some metal-clanking on Franklin St. this year. Roy still does not have a reliable 3 pt shooter in his entire arsenal, unless one of the vaunted freshmen steps up now and takes over quickly. OH yeah, Roy Williams loathes to play freshmen..? The Heels do not shoot free throws very well either, as good FT shooting teams go. Once again, they had better get lots of layups, dunks, and chippys. Uncontested ones.\n3PT. SHOOTING - KENTUCKY (and) 3 PT. DEFENSE\nSimply put, our TWO best 3 pt. bombers are back and as Cawood would say, playing \"string music in Lexington K-Y\". Miller and Lamb (move over Mr. Ford and Delk), Lamb may well end up as the best EVER (%-3 pt.) shooter at Kentucky. And, one year older, wiser, sharper, and more confident. Some other guys can step out and knock it down (Anthony Davis for one), and did so last year just for shits and giggles (Terrence Jones). They say Wiltjer can really shoot the three, and perhaps better than Lamb. As it's also hard to teach six foot ten, guarding him should prove especially difficult by players known to usually camp near the painted area and close to the exits (Henson, Zeller). And UNC has yet to show that it can stop a good 3 pt. shooting team.\nYet, Kentucky is primarily a DEFENSIVE TEAM, mind you. One of the best last year (9th), still a bit quicker a foot this year. John Calipari is known for coaching tenacious defensive intensity. Free Throws are a question here too, though the guys who stayed (Miller, Lamb) were two of our better free throw shooters last year and we already shoot FT better than do the Heels. All said, we both should shoot Free Throws tad higher percentage-wise this season. But in all this could be a big UK advantage.\nDEPTH, TALENT\nCarolina is talented big and deep. Kentucky is talented big and deep. How deep must a team go? Only ten guys can play at any given moment. The buses that carry teams are huge. It's true, UNC could field three strong starting lineups. Who cares? While it might come in handy sometimes, probably not when these two juggernauts meet. Both teams have a long talented pine forest on their sidelines, and enough players-in-waiting to interchange parts and re-tool during games if needed. Toss-up, with UNC a slight edge, but only if hacking Armageddon breaks out.\nINSIDE GAME\nLast year Carolina held the distinct advantage in the paint on paper (the actual game looked different). This year, the advantage is not so much, if any. Carolina loves to rebound and run-out. Kentucky will love to rebound and run-out just as much this year. We'll be a tad quicker than Carolina's vaunted front line when Zeller holds down the middle, and Gilchrist Davis, and Jones are all but blurs of light, like Friday night coeds heading toward Two Keys. No more advantage UNC. Inside advantage... Even.\nTHE POINT?\nAs in guard. Carolina (last year) had some minor turnover issues but Kendall Marshal ought to change that with a year under his belt. He can run, handle the ball, make the correct pass, and... blow the easy shot. With Marquis Teague, Kentucky will see it's bigs become more involved than ever, since he doesn't love to shoot except when finishing. But, the truth is he CAN shoot. He sees the court well much like Marshal, makes the right pass and finishes well on the break (better than Marshal). His test will be in the half-court D-D... can he run the offense without making unforced errors, over committed dribble-drives, or drill the shot when the defense steps back and begs him to fire? If you have watched his brother Jeff play, you'll see how Marquis might progress.... Jeff steadily progressed as a knock-down shoot,r and now he can actually knock down the shot, play fierce D, and will stand toe-to-toe with any NBA Point Guard. By seasons end as he becomes a better shooter and sees the court better to make good decisions, Marquis will soon follow Jeff to The League. Point guard matchup...Even.\nSUPERSTARS\nHarrison Barnes is no doubt SUPER, but can be erratic. Anthony Davis, for sure is not for sure but is definitely a most likely future NBA All-Star. Mike-Gilchrist, is absolutely positively a player any coach would cherish. Doron Lamb... well, like Anthony Hopkins, he will not be silenced. John Henson , a rebounding muppet show who has gained upper body strength, will be tough to control. Tyler Zeller, sometimes plays like either the Scarecrow or the Tin-Man, but hardly ever the Wizard. Terrence Jones, with early maturity, higher yield, compounded interest...should be UK's most bankable note. To my eyes, UK holds a slight Super Star advantage.\nTHE INTANGIBLE FACTOR, THE COACHING EDGE\nCoaches. They deny, but then they lie. Roy Williams was for a long time the guy who couldn't win the BIG ONE, but over-and over, \"he didn't care\". He handled it well, but you must know it hurt him to understand that he needed to leave Kansas to finally get it done. Carolina was the right FIT for Roy and everyone knew it. In his element, he got it done quickly, though he claimed it hadn't entered his mind. Now, it's as if those years never happened. They don't pencil him in, they ink him in, they now expect him to win it all again and again. But is he as hungry as he was in 2003? I don't think so. Listen to him speak. He now knows his place is secure, he's a Hall-of-Famer already. He wants to win for his team, not for the Carolina faithful. He is sad, but not destroyed when he loses, and he always loses with a certain class. But hungry, he is not.\nIn contrast, John Calipari didn't shine Adoph Rupp's shoes for 20 years, just waiting for his day to inevitably happen. He's been making it happen every day for years, and with much longer odds than Roy Williams ever knew existed. He doesn't care about Championships he says, only his players individual successes. Nice copy. I believe him, but only to a degree. The degree that he wants to win one so bad he can taste it. And now, he will if he stays at Kentucky, if only because it's the right FIT. He understood that to get it done he must leave Memphis.\nVindication is one step away, though he suspects no matter what he does, the questions will follow him, and sour it's sweet taste. Calipari had some great mentors, safe to say, and one is Rick Pitino. He followed his every move, he even perfected his moves. It's true that most mentors eventually become resented by those chose to imitate them, and this is no exception. He wants to step out of that man's long shadow once and for all, and he understands how close he is to feeling that bright warm sunshine.\nCalipari has softened through the years, and for the better I think, while Williams it seems has hardened. He's become harder to reach and feels the power of being adored, and he knows the bitter pain of fan betrayal. Being at the top of the heap can make a man feel an invincible power at times. Williams is wary of who gets too close and then slams his door shut, where he once was an open book with an open door, and a genuine guy... until early last year when the betrayals began.\nCalipari wants to feel that invincible power too, but I think he'll act the opposite... become kinder and gentler, and more approachable once he finally wins it all.\nWhich one is hungrier, we ask? Who needs it, wants it the most? Which Coach has to have it for his own personal vindication? Who would like more than anyone on the planet to look his nay-sayers in the eye... with just a wink and a smile? Calipari understands that every cut, every bruise, every unkind and untrue word, every slap to the face will be his to own to relish and savor.\nIt's remarkable how he has played the coaching game with such focus on class, devotion, dedication, and the will to succeed. Who else could have weathered John Calipari's own storms? He's a man to emulate, not vilify. Of course he's made mistakes, and he's paid heavily their unending price. But he has stayed his course with dignity, just waiting for the last laugh.\nHe has slayed the dragon, saved the Princess from ruin, and now he will not trade the white horse for anything that resembles a CHANCE TO FAIL. Rest assured Nation of Blue... your time and his have met... fatefully at that crucial moment: when we both needed each other the most. No matter what (like his once mentor Pitino), he has saved Kentucky Basketball for Kentuckians and will forever be deified in the hearts and minds of those who understand the thing that is Kentucky Basketball.\nCoaching edge: John Calipari.\nCHEMISTRY. BIOCHEMISTRY. SYNERGY of systems.\nThough Carolina has had a year to jell as a team, the sting of their last loss has had time heal. Yes, they do play together well, and they get along well. Roy Williams personally likes this team, always a plus. They are committed, not arrogant... just his style. But don't forget, this UNC bunch is much the same team that suffered Carolina's worst EVER ACC road thumping last year at Georgia Tech, who at the time was a true Rambling Wreck. Some of these UNC guys played in the NIT just one year before, leading to questions of will to win and talent enough to do so. Those who compare this team to UNC 2009 are blind or ignorant, an insult to that great team. There is zero to compare, especially once they suit up and step on the Dome's golden floor. Actually, I see Duke as ACC champs in March 2012. Advantage to UK in Chemistry by season's end, with UNC advantage in November..\nTHE all- BLUE PLAN\nUnlike any team before, this Kentucky TEAM was built with the word Chemistry in mind considering the individual talents involved. These Freshmen chose one another (along with Cal) based on each one's unique ability to provide a major contribution to a Championship team without talent duplicity. This has been in the making for 2-3 years. Each player, selected by hand based on their ability to mesh and provide a single cog in this well-oiled, precision instrument.\nEven Doron Lamb, as his special talents became clearer, helped recruit them to play around him. Darius Miller is the anchor, the heart, the foundation (think Chuck Hayes , Pat Patterson ). These recruits choices, their high school all-star playing decisions, their signing with UK and timing all speak to a grand plan. A plan from a Championship plan book. NOW is fruition time.\nFittingly, in the end, it may have been Rick Pitino who demonstrated this lesson to John Calipari back in the mid-90\u2018s...\nThat is: Leave NO STONES un-turned. The rest? It will all take care of itself.\nTHIS KENTUCKY TEAM MAY BE THE ULTIMATE COLLEGE BASKETBALL TEAM, THE BEST EVER TO PLAY THE GAME.\n(many thanks to Glenn and Ken for their formatting help)\n"}, {"score": 1082.9508, "uuid": "9bcb1fc8-c518-57d6-b3bc-c5b93e83ddde", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1400tw-36-23645", "target_hostname": "csnbbs.com", "target_uri": "http://csnbbs.com/showthread.php?tid=564947", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Revisiting Kings and Barons both <em>Football</em> and <em>Basketball</em>", "snippet": "Without that, we&#x27;re no <em>better</em> <em>than</em> the Big East, who will have a regular top ten program among their ranks soon.", "explanation": null, "document": "Post: #1\nRevisiting Kings and Barons both Football and Basketball\nEvery once in a while I like to re-visit the topic of Kings and Barons (as Mandel calls them) in football.

The B1G did flirt with Texas but rejected any tag-alongs that would tarnish their academic image (OU, TTech, and/or OSU).\nWhile I agree the Barons are more fluid than the Kings, I think it's still relatively stable as well. As with the Kings, it is easier for a former Baron to be elevated back to Baron status than it is to become a Baron for the first time.\nSo Georgia, if it were to go on a hot streak for 5-7 years and win another NC they would quickly be elevated back to King (if they aren't a King already), but Oregon would need probably two decades or more at their current level with at least 2 NCs to reach King level.\nPitt could easily be elevated from what is the Knight level back up to Baron status if they were to have a good 5-7 year run. While a Louisville would need to go two decades of consistently getting to 9-10 wins a year for them to go to the next level.\nI think the SEC going into Texas was a natural western extension of their geography since that state borders both Arkansas and Louisiana. I see Missouri as more Big Ten country than SEC, but then it took the SEC some time to decide upon #14 after they couldn't persuade two other logical geographical extensions as takers (a team from Virginia or a team from North Carolina).\nI think the Pac-12 desperately wants to extend beyond their current geography to get into both Texas and Oklahoma, moreso the former than the latter. It's just that the feeling isn't mutual, especially by Texas. And the ACC supposedly tested the waters with both Texas and Notre Dame, showing a willingness to go beyond their perceived geography.\nToday's landscape pretty much ensures conferences will be looking to extend beyond their supposed geography of yesteryear.\nAs for expansion targets, I left the SEC and BiG out of it since they don't 'need' to expand. With one league having three Kings and four Barons and the other having four Kings, one Baron, and two Knights that could rise to Baron status in Michigan State and Iowa, they may choose to do so, but they don't need to.\nThe Pac-12, despite it's great TV contracts knows that it needs to expand at some point since they only have 1 football King. And unless UCLA finds their Pete Carroll that isn't changing in a hurry.\nThe ACC and Big 12 are in similar situations, although the latter's two Kings are more stable than the ACC's, the ACC's Barons are more plentiful. It's why the FSU and Clemson to the Big 12 is intriguing (even though I don't think it will happen). Both schools have to at least be listening.\nCheers,\n"}, {"score": 1080.604, "uuid": "846dcb93-a2d3-593c-be4c-119ff1d0263e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-81-15261", "target_hostname": "www.standard.net", "target_uri": "http://www.standard.net/stories/2012/02/01/new-wsu-recruiting-class-better-expected", "page_rank": 1.1817795e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "New WSU recruiting class &#x27;<em>better</em> <em>than</em> expected&#x27;", "snippet": "&quot;I&#x27;m usually not over the top on recruiting classes -- I&#x27;ve never known a coach that would say he had a bad recruiting class on signing day -- (it was) <em>better</em> <em>than</em> I expected.", "explanation": null, "document": "OGDEN -- College coaches say recruiting is a year-round process.\nJohn L.

Rick Snyder's subdivision last month. The protesters rallied against the state's emergency manager law.\nMelanie Maxwell I AnnArbor.com\nWhen a city files for Chapter 9 bankruptcy \u2014 which is entirely possible for the city of Detroit and other essentially insolvent municipalities \u2014 \u201ceverything is thrown into uncertainty,\u201d said John Pottow, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of Michigan .\n\u201cIf you go into bankruptcy court, you lose an incredible amount of control,\u201d Pottow said. \u201cIt\u2019s true that you\u2019re going to be granted some deference on the part of a judge, but you still have to convince the judge to allow you to do everything you want to do.\u201d\nIndeed, bankruptcy should be frightening for cities \u2014 but many seem to be so focused on opposing the installation of an emergency manager that they\u2019re losing perspective. A bankruptcy judge could be much worse.\nRepublican Gov. Rick Snyder has championed Michigan\u2019s strengthened emergency manager law as a way to prevent cities from slipping into financial disasters, including bankruptcy.\nSigned into law in March, the legislation, Public Act No. 4, gave emergency managers controversial powers such as the right to slash union contracts, replace elected officials and sell off assets in an effort to return governmental entities to financial sustainability.\nDemocrats have slammed the law, saying it undermines the democratic process.\nWhether emergency managers should be allowed to strip elected officials of their powers is certainly a legitimate debate. That debate should continue.\nBut let\u2019s not make the mistake of forgetting that they might lose most of their powers anyway.\nTo be sure, Chapter 9 bankruptcy does not allow judges to unilaterally axe collective bargaining agreements or approve a \u201ccram-down\u201d option of forcing creditors to reduce debt, Pottow said. Chapter 9 bankruptcy was designed to force parties to negotiate sustainable solutions to the cities' financial emergencies.\nBut you can safely assume a federal bankruptcy judge won\u2019t allow cities to sign new union contracts that maintain the status quo \u2014 or anything close to it.\nWithin Chapter 9 bankruptcy, \u201cburdensome labor contracts can be rejected for cause,\" unfunded pension liabilities could be eliminated and there's \"no priority for wages, vacation, pension or healthcare,\u201d according to a November 2010 presentation by New York law firm Chapman and Cutler LLP . City contractors don\u2019t fare well under Chapter 9 bankruptcy, either.\nGrand Rapids-based law firm Varnum said that to reject union contracts under Chapter 9 bankruptcy court, municipalities have to prove the contracts are substantially detrimental to their financial viability and prove they've made a reasonable attempt to renegotiate deals, among a few other obligations.\n\"These are not very onerous standards for a public entity to meet if it truly is in a financial crisis,\" Varnum says on its website .\nBankruptcy judges are generally not swayed by emotional pleas and political rhetoric. After all, they\u2019re appointed \u2014 not elected. They don\u2019t answer to the ballot box, so it\u2019s much easier for them to sign off on unpopular decisions.\nA bankruptcy judge, seeking simply to balance a city\u2019s budget, will readily condone recommendations to sell off treasured community assets, Pottow said.\nHoward Ryan, director of legislative affairs for the Michigan Department of Treasury , said bankruptcy must be avoided at all costs. Ryan, who helped author the emergency manager legislation, said an emergency manager is a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d way of helping governmental entities address their problems.\n\u201cThat bankruptcy process is completely eviscerating in terms of the democratic process,\u201d Ryan said last week at a panel in Ann Arbor. \u201cYou have a federal judge who may or may not care about anything about your community, and it\u2019s just a drastic, drastic process.\u201d\nBankruptcy is a mess for cities and it would be a mess for the state, too. Economists fear that if the city of Detroit files for bankruptcy, Michigan\u2019s credit ratings will fall, boosting interest rates on state debt \u2014 which would lead to higher taxes or reduced spending.\nAnd, of course, if the city of Detroit files for bankruptcy, it would be a public relations disaster.\n\u201c Imported from Detroit \u201d is a nice message we can all believe in \u2014 unless Detroit goes bankrupt.\nNonetheless, there\u2019s a temptation to wonder whether bankruptcy may not be so bad. It worked for General Motors and Chrysler, right?\nWrong. That was Chapter 11 bankruptcy , which gives the court greater authority to help companies reduce debt and return to profitability. Also, GM and Chrysler entered bankruptcy with $50 billion in financing from the U.S. government.\nChapter 9 bankruptcy is \u201cnot like the corporate world, where it\u2019s happened often enough and there\u2019s a whole litany of legal precedent, professional precedent,\u201d Snyder told AnnArbor.com in January . \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more uncertainty\u201d in Chapter 9.\nNonetheless, bankruptcy may be the ultimate destination for Michigan\u2019s distressed cities \u2014 particularly Detroit, which is expected to run out of cash this spring, according to an external audit by Ernst & Young.\nLooming over the debate about Michigan\u2019s emergency manager law is a petition drive organized by a Detroit-based nonprofit called Michigan Forward , which has said it\u2019s close to delivering enough petitions to immediately suspend the law and place it on the ballot for voters to decide in November.\nWithout an emergency manager to implement austerity measures or a consent decree between financially strapped cities and the state, we\u2019re left to simply hope that cities, unions, bondholders and creditors decide to work together to shore up cities\u2019 finances. We\u2019ve been hoping for years \u2014 with little luck.\nBrandon Jessup, a 2005 Eastern Michigan University graduate who founded Michigan Forward, said cities can fix their own problems.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of in democracy.

When You Can Customize?\nThat has been our official slogan for about two years.\u00a0 However, in 1995 when we began to design the second generation of our scoreboards, we decided to purposely make all of our hardware and software modular so that we could easily create scoreboards that were exactly what our customers wanted.\nWhy do we call our scoreboards, \"Maintenance Free\"?\nBefore 1988, Santech repaired other companies scoreboards.\u00a0 We found that they were not very reliable.\u00a0 That was good for us since we made our money by repairing scoreboards.\u00a0 The company president realized that if we could make a product that was very reliable we would have a big advantage.\u00a0 Since then we have carefully kept track of the reasons why our products have required repair and tried to eliminate those problems in the next generation.\u00a0 We are currently on our seventh generation of scoreboard hardware and software.\nHow are Santech Scoreboards Built?\u00a0 Why are they better?\nWe don't cut corners with quality.\u00a0 The scoreboard frame is a lattice of continuously welded aluminum box tubing.\u00a0 This makes the scoreboard frame very strong, yet does not require as much depth and associated weight.\u00a0 The frame is then powder coated.\u00a0 Powder coat is a very tough baked on plastic resin with pigment.\u00a0 It is one of the most durable coatings available.\nOur displays are one piece for reliability and use LEDs from a top tier manufacturer.\u00a0 We build them in-house to ensure quality.\u00a0 We drive them using a proprietary method which required years of research to develop.\u00a0 We typically get 100,000 hours of life out of our displays.\u00a0 Compare this to our competitors.\u00a0 Since LEDs are the most expensive component in an LED scoreboard, be skeptical if you are getting too good of a price on your LED scoreboard.\u00a0 Years ago we tried using lower cost LEDs, but soon realized that was a mistake.\u00a0 The article link below helps explain why we buy the best LEDs and why buying a super bargain scoreboard is a bad idea.\nClick this link: http://www.electronicproducts.com/ShowPage.asp?FileName=ddp.jun2006.html\nWe protect our displays with polycarbonate plastic.\u00a0 Polycarbonate is extremely impact resistant.\u00a0 Our scoreboards do not require protective netting or metal bars over the displays.\nOur electronics are state of the art.\u00a0 We revise our electronics continuously to keep up with advances, make our product more reliable and add features.\nOur sales people are sports people.\nWhen you call to order your scoreboard, you will be talking to someone who is more than a telephone salesperson.\u00a0 They give good advice because they know sports and their goal is to help you find the best product for your application.\nWe follow through, from the initial quotation that includes a rendering of the finished scoreboard, to providing any needed assistance after the sale.\u00a0 When you buy a Santech Scoreboard we make sure that you remain happy long after the sale.\u00a0 Referrals from former customers are a major part of our sales.\n"}, {"score": 1055.7313, "uuid": "fd3aa00a-20f4-57b8-8c98-8ba57c85b7c1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0813wb-94-12687", "target_hostname": "www.nunesmagician.com", "target_uri": "http://www.nunesmagician.com/2009/3/27/812559/this-town-deserves-a-bette", "page_rank": 1.1847883e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "This Town Deserves A <em>Better</em> Class Of <em>Basketball</em> Team - Troy Nunes <em>Is</em> An", "snippet": "That would explain <em>why</em> he can only be found analyzing in internet videos and webcast halftime shows. by K-Gun on Mar 27, 2009 5:44 PM EDT reply actions I feel like he <em>is</em> a boxing analyst rather <em>than</em> a <em>basketball</em> one.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1050.5035, "uuid": "6921c71d-cc84-5f56-8ea2-e75fccab3af9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1904wb-81-01268", "target_hostname": "www.combine360.com", "target_uri": "http://www.combine360.com/Blogs/Post/154", "page_rank": 1.2175163e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> A New Years Resolution :: Combine360", "snippet": "Baseball <em>Basketball</em> Certification Challenge Combine Training Combine360 Communication COTW Durkin <em>Football</em> Golf Hess IMG IPI Lax Mental Moawad Mohr Mugford Nutrition Shenbaum Soccer Tennis Training Under Armour Vision Youth Create your My Combine360 account and get started today.", "explanation": null, "document": "Trevor (T.A.) Anderson\n1/11/2012\nA monumental year in our industry has finally come to an end for the Combine360 family.\u00a0 During 2011, we were able to certify hundreds of phenomenal trainers and Master Trainers from all over the world, develop a culture that defines \u201cCombine360 Training\u201d and performance, and inspire our clients and athletes like never before! And just like that\u2026 we are back on the grind again, like the holidays never even happened! \u00a0Whether we are ready for it or not, 2012 is here, and with it, the opportunity to change the lives of trainees everywhere with Combine360 Training.\u00a0 One of the most secure financial times for our businesses come during this time of year, when everyone is making their New Year\u2019s Resolutions.\u00a0 Utilizing the open-architecture of Combine360\u2019s training methodology, we have the opportunity to find the perfect program for our clients and athletes.\u00a0 However, are \u201cresolutions\u201d what we really want to invest in, or do we truly want ourselves and our trainees to get BETTER EVERY DAY through proper goal setting, instruction, and motivation?\nLet\u2019s look at some statistics about \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\u201d:\nAccording to Wikipedia, Recent research shows that while 52% of participants in a New Year\u2019s Resolution study were confident of success with their goals, only 12% actually achieved their goals\nA separate study in 2007 by British psychologist Richard Wisemen from the University of Bristol showed that 88% of those who set New Year\u2019s Resolutions fail\nMen achieved their goal 22% more often when they engaged in goal setting (a system where small measurable goals are being set; such as, a pound a week, instead of saying \"lose weight\")\nWomen succeeded 10% more when they made their goals public and got support from their friends.\nTaking these statistics into consideration, we can either attempt to be in that 12% that achieves their goals, or increase the odds by engaging in goal setting and getting support from friends (or a Combine360 Certified Trainer!).\u00a0 We can also educate ourselves about how the brain actually works to allow us to achieve such goals.\u00a0 The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the brain region that has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behaviors; personality expression, decision-making and moderating correct social behavior. The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals. The PFC must be adequately nourished through proper nutrition and hydration to maintain the will-power and self control that it is designed to accomplish.\u00a0 This is why many \u201cdiets\u201d as a part of a New Year\u2019s Resolution are not only challenging to stick to, but also frequently sabotage any additional resolutions we want to accomplish, because starving the brain can adversely impact behavior.\nSo do we really want to create all of these \u201cresolutions\u201d, or just focus on getting BETTER EVERY DAY?\u00a0 My friend, and Combine360 Ambassador, Todd Durkin, often speaks about getting \u201c1% BETTER EVERY DAY\u201d. With this mentality, progress becomes exponential.\u00a0 You may see it written that if you get 1% BETTER EVERY DAY, then after one year, you are 365% better. This is actually incorrect\u2026 As a matter of fact, if you are able to get 1% better every single day starting today (January 1, 2012), then at the end of the year, you will be over 3700% better on December 31, 2012!!!\u00a0 Can you imagine that?!\u00a0 If you are relating this to your business, think about it like this:\nIf you start out with $100 at the beginning of the year and you were able to increase what you have by 1% every single day, at the end of the year, you would have $3,778.34 = $100 * (1 + 1%) ^ 365. That is 37.78x what you had at the beginning of the year!\nWhether we have goals to grow our business as trainers and business owners, or to improve the fitness and performance of our clients and ourselves, we must find the formula that works for us.\u00a0 If you are one of the 12% that can make a list of New Year\u2019s Resolutions, and keep them, then keep up the great work!\u00a0 For those others that find that to be more challenging, try committing to getting a little bit BETTER EVERY DAY. \u00a0Once we begin to look at our long term \u201cresolutions\u201d as small daily opportunities to improve, we can begin to relentlessly pursue excellence through these daily opportunities.\u00a0 If we will endeavor to achieve the simple idea of getting 1% BETTER EVERY DAY as trainers and coaches, as parents and teachers, and as athletes ourselves with our own training, then we are truly achieving exponential progress.\n2 CLAPS,\n"}, {"score": 1050.287, "uuid": "580d6c90-2b3e-57b1-8570-03a8f1e56e86", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-87-00069", "target_hostname": "www.footballforum.com", "target_uri": "http://www.footballforum.com/mountain-west-mwc/122933-nutshell-why-bsu-devil.html", "page_rank": 1.199662e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "In a Nutshell or <em>Why</em> BSU <em>is</em> the Devil - <em>Football</em> Forum - NFL, CFL &amp; College", "snippet": "So, <em>why</em> was it such a shock they won?

Before that the reply could have easily been...does Boise State really have a football team?\nMost people that have jumped on this bandwagon don\u0092t really know why or understand how it works. The best argument is the feel-good story behind the little guy.\nThe ranking system in college football has apparently become lost in translation or hallucination. Since when does a No. 3 team play a No. 10 team and unexpectedly beat them? The last definition of the ranking system would expect that to happen, right? So, why was it such a shock they won? If that really is the case in point, then why were the numbers not the other way? Seems pretty cut and dry.\nWhy all the hype for a team going in and doing what they should have done? I mean, is it not reasonable to expect that the outcome was exactly the way the rankings indicated the outcome should be?\nBoise justifies its argument and earns its respect for a shot at the BCS, right? Well, no. If you look at the games that Boise State has left to play, there is not another top-25 team left on their slate.\nThe following games for Boise State are (rankings based on CBS rankings on all 120 teams in the division) Wyoming No. 62, Oregon State No. 26, New Mexico State No. 112, San Jose State No. 110, La Tech No. 85, Hawaii No. 90, Idaho No. 65, Fresno State No. 40, Nevada No. 39, and Utah State No. 89. Not very impressive considering that Boise State does not play anyone who is currently ranked in the top 25 in the AP poll or the coaches' poll.\nHowever, the Harris Poll lists Oregon State at No. 19. Based on last year's BCS final rankings Boise and Oregon State were the only two to make the cut into the top 25.\nThere is no comparison to a team like Alabama who still has to play LSU, Arkansas, Florida, Penn State, and Auburn, who all currently fall in the top 25. How can you even begin to compare that level of football to the high school teams that Boise still has to play?\nThe way I see it for Boise State is like this: If they really want to play BCS football, then I would suggest that in the future they should try to lower the teams they play that have state (with the exception of a few teams) tacked on to their name. Why not play Oregon instead of Oregon State, LSU instead of La Tech, Ohio State instead of Toledo, and add teams like Nebraska, Alabama, Florida, Texas, or Ohio State?\nMaybe at the point they raise the bar and go head to head with the competition we will rehash this...but I think the reason to keep them out of the BCS is just as legitimate as their reason to be included.\nFacts are facts in that...if you want to be a BCS big boy...you need to play accordingly.\nVarious definitions state the Antichrist will self-ascend himself to greatness, people will rise up and follow his word and have total adoration, the adoration and following will be for reasons not justified or the ability to see past the reasons will be clouded by false interpretation, and lastly someone who will resemble the part but only in a deceptive way.\nCompare that to all Boise State's hype, the self-proclamation of their claim to the BCS, and their own justified idea that they are a football team that carries the right to be a BCS player because they go 13-0 (without any regard to how weak their schedule is comparatively).\nIn closing, as far as I see it, Boise State went into the game last week a solid seven places above VA Tech and did their job. As a matter of fact, in all honesty they did not outplay anyone in the end. Actually, they just did what people expect in college football.\nI am not impressed, and until they put some meat behind their schedule, they simply are the Antichrist of football...and I ain\u0092t buying into it.\nBoise State is the Devil\nI couldn't have said it better myself... It really is a farce and the thing is, people will take this as a Boise bash. But in my eyes, a bash is lies and smoke and mirrors more so then fact... I, like the author of this article, really don't hate Boise so much as want to see them put up or shut up. Something which they've gone out of their way to avoid... Which is fact based on the rediculous demands they gave Nebraska, a pretty meatty team... Can't say as I blame them though as they already had one \"real\" team this season, which they beat easily enough. But as with most things sports, so you can bench press 300lbs once, it doesn't mean that you're as strong as someone that works with 300lbs for three sets of 8.\nP.S.

They're cheating the people of Vero Beach out of one last, feel-good spring at Dodgertown and the chance to give what was a unique, 60-year relationship a proper sendoff. They're stealing the final two weeks of the team's spring-training finale on the Treasure Coast.\nFor that, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.\nBut they're not.\nThey don't care enough about you or Vero Beach to do what's right. They have no respect for history or the special bond that was forged between the team and the town. As far as they're concerned, they owe you nothing.\nAll they care about is money.\nThat's why the Dodgers are moving their spring-training headquarters to Glendale, Ariz., where they'll break ground Monday.\nThat's why they're going to China in mid-March, even though they know the trip will leave their final spring in Vero Beach in shambles and leave a bitter taste in the mouths of everyone here.\nOh, they'd like you to believe they don't have any real choice \u2014 that the commissioner's office is pressuring them to go to China and the players association won't let them fly all the way back to Florida. But that's baloney.\nThe Dodgers are going to China because they WANT TO. And they're not coming back to Dodgertown because they DON'T WANT TO, because it's cheaper and more convenient to finish in Arizona.\nIf the Dodgers had any class, they wouldn't leave Vero Beach early. They'd say no to China and Taiwan and wherever else they might stop along the way. They wouldn't schedule a three-game exhibition series against the Boston Red Sox at Dodger Stadium the last weekend in March.\nAt the very least, they would've made sure local officials were aware of their plan \u2014 before it appeared in the newspaper.\nInstead, there was no consulting, no notice, no common courtesy. They've done all this on the sly, showing no respect or regard for the county, city and people here.\nAnd, now, they're trying to make it sound as if they've done nothing wrong.\n\"With our spring-training schedule,\" Dodgers spokesperson Camille Johnston said, \"we will absolutely honor all of our obligations in Vero Beach.\"\nThat's a hoot.\nThe Dodgers might abide by the letter of the lease agreement, which requires them to play at least 10 games at Dodgertown, but they have no intention of honoring the spirit of the agreement after they depart for China and leave behind a bunch of no-names.\nThe past 60 years mean nothing to them.

The \u2018Dawgs and the Irish were tied with 65 points apiece in football, but Notre Dame\u2019s eight straight N.C.A.A. tournament appearances from 1999 to 2006 boosted the Golden Domers to 28 points in men\u2019s basketball, whereas the Red and Black\u2019s 25-year-old Final Four berth got Georgia only as far as 12 points. The Classic City Canines made up the difference with 32.5 points in baseball, far more than the 17 the Irish received on the strength of their 2002 trip to Omaha.\nIn the three biggest sports in the B.C.S. era, Florida finished third, Louisiana State fourth, Tennessee eighth, Georgia Tech eleventh, Alabama twelfth, Auburn 13th, and Arkansas 20th, but Georgia did not make the top 20 since 1998.\nIt is not hard to see where the deficiency lies. On the gridiron, the Bulldogs are tied for eleventh since 1974 and tied for ninth since 1998 . On the diamond, the Red and Black are the country\u2019s twelfth-best team over the last decade . On the hardwood, however, the Classic City Canines are nowhere to be found .\nI believe my position on basketball has been made abundantly clear: it is an important sport and I understand why fans of it enjoy it as much as they do, but I personally regard it with something approximating indifference.\nSurveys like this one, however, explain why it matters to me to see Georgia improve at men\u2019s basketball. As I wrote last March :\nIt was one thing when S.E.C. basketball was Kentucky, occasionally Vanderbilt, and not much of anyone else; then, there was no shame in not being very good at something no one outside of the Bluegrass State seemed terribly interested in being good at doing.\nIndeed, there was, in no small sense, rather a manly satisfaction to be derived from deriding the neighboring A.C.C. as \"a basketball conference\"---by which was meant, of course, only a basketball conference, a league that had to settle for being good at hoops because it lacked the masculine fortitude to excel on the gridiron. If the only way to be good at basketball was to be lousy at football---and, if Kentucky, Vanderbilt, and the Atlantic Coast Conference were any indication, that certainly seemed to be the case---then who cared about basketball?\nThat began to change around the time Arkansas changed conference allegiances. . . .\nIn short, the S.E.C. has gotten good at basketball, too, without sacrificing its commitment to quality football. . . .\nAn athletics program as prominent as Georgia's, and with as many natural and institutional advantages, ought to be good consistently at multiple sports, and certainly at the second-most important sport, in terms of money and prestige, in intercollegiate competition. My fear is that Dennis's Dogs, motivated by the desire to save their coach's imperiled job, played above their heads during a whirlwind four-day period in which they didn't have the time to think about the impossibility of what they were doing . . . but my hope is that this was the breakthrough that will put Georgia basketball on the road to respectability, significance, and, ultimately, success at the highest level.\nIf, instead of collecting an anemic 12 points in basketball since 1974, the Classic City Canines had amassed 25.5 points---equal to the totals earned by Alabama and Oklahoma State in that same span---Georgia would have finished with a cumulative 123 points in the three sports combined. That would have been good enough to boost the Bulldogs from 17th overall since 1974 to 13th. If Georgia had matched Florida\u2019s 42 points in basketball during that period, it would have put the Bulldogs in the top ten.\nEven this crude calculation by Rivals.com, however, offers meaningful insights into the state of what otherwise is as strong an athletics program as any in the conference . The Georgia football program is on top of the world and happy about it .

At a minimum, Mississippi State- or South Carolina-level success ought to be a given.\nGeorgia\u2019s sensational run through the S.E.C. tournament last spring got us all excited, but the euphoria has worn off and it is time for us to expect more than a long weekend\u2019s worth of excellence. An early lead over Xavier in the Big Dance was a nice baby step, but it is time to begin making real strides.\nRivals.com\u2019s numbers may be somewhat skewed, but they do not lie at the bottom line. The Georgia men\u2019s basketball program has been a liability and should be a strength.

Through my own learning experience and through teaching well over 1,000 students, I have learned a lot on this subject. Students often ask why they are not at the level that they desire to be and what can be done about it. I have asked myself this same question many times in the past. A long time passed before I began to understand the answers.\nLike you probably have done, I have read a ton of interviews with great players and articles written by many of these same players. I often found it frustrating whenever the subject of learning to play guitar came up or when advice was offered on improving one\u2019s playing. With a small number of exceptions, very little time and space was offered on this. Its not uncommon to see the player\u2019s advice be summed up in a grand total of three words: Practice! Practice!! Practice!!! Well of course we all know that practicing is the main ingredient. But rarely are we told much more than that. In my long quest to become an excellent player and to help my students do the same, I carefully took note of what worked and what didn\u2019t. What parts of conventional wisdom is accurate and what parts are not (at least in my opinion). I believe the twenty concepts that have proven to bring great results to those who use them are:\n1. Educate yourself! No matter what level you are at today, you can be (and should be) learning more. If you are currently studying with a teacher or enrolled in a music program at a high school, college or university, you are on the right track. If you aren\u2019t doing this (or if you feel that your current teacher is not helping you enough in reaching your goals) I strongly recommend looking for a new teacher. (I have written an article on this exact topic titled: Choosing a Teacher ) I can\u2019t stress\nenough how important it is to find the teacher that is right for you! Your teacher (or music program) should always be Goal Orientated. If its not, look for another teacher or school to study with! You don\u2019t need a teacher to simply give you information or things to practice \u2013 you can get those things anywhere, what you need is a teacher who:\nA. Knows what your goals are.\nB. Cares about helping you reach your goals.\nC. Knows how to help you reach your goals.\n2. Listen to more music. Find more of the same music you already like. There is a lot of music out there that you haven\u2019t heard. I am sure you can find something you really like and that would inspire you. Look on the internet if you cant find it on the conventional radio. Check out internet radio, you can customize what you here based on your preferences, its a great tool! Check out web sites that you know feature a lot of the music in the style you like.\n3. Turn your musical frustrations into an asset in the form of a motivating force. I wrote a whole article called Musical Frustration. I don\u2019t want to repeat here everything that I wrote in that article, so read it if you haven\u2019t already. If you have read it, it may be worth your time to read it again now.\n4. Believe in yourself. You have probably heard that phrase many times before. Its unfortunate how many people still refuse to invest their own beliefs into themselves. I wrote an article on Perseverance which deals indirectly with believing in yourself. Please read it if you have a problem believing that you can reach your goals.\n5. Understand that becoming a better guitarist means becoming a better musician as well. When developing your musical skills, make sure to think beyond skills that are specific to guitar. Of course you will be working on many guitar skills: various guitar techniques, chords, scales, soloing, etc., but don\u2019t neglect other skills that are not guitar specific like, ear training (also called aural skills), songwriting, improvising, creativity, reading music, music theory, etc.\n6. Surround yourself with better players (or at least with those on your same level.) When you started out playing guitar, everyone was better than you, but now you have grown and there are less people better than you than before. The better you get, the harder it will be to find others who are superior to you to hang around or jam with. But no matter how good you get,\nthere will always be something you can learn from someone else. Seek out those people, get to know them, jam with them, discuss music and guitar with them. Be willing to give as much (or more) as you want to take. If you are fortunate enough to be above the level of other guitarists in your area, seek out great bassists, pianists, violinists, drummers, etc. You can learn\nfrom them as well. (Even if you are not better than your guitar player friends, seek out musicians that play other instruments as well anyway).\n7. Find out what inspires you and soak yourself in that. For me, going to concerts to see great players or bands inspires me to practice more. Listening to great singers inspired me to refine my vibrato and phrasing. Listening and studying the music of great classical composers inspired me to study music composition. I wanted to write great music. Watching the movie\nStar Wars when I was a kid, reading Lord of the Rings, etc. inspired me as well. There are lots of non musical things that have been inspiring to me. The greatest source of inspiration has been my own personal experiences in life and within myself. The desire to express that was (and still is) a constant burning desire and powerful force that thrusts my desire to improve and propel me forward. Know what truly inspires you, seek it out, surround yourself with it and soak there.\n8. Define your purpose. What is your definite purpose? Do you really know what it is? If I were standing in front of you right now and asked you this question, could you give me specific answers and explanations? Can you write it on paper in specific terms? This is critical to setting goals, planning strategy and monitoring the results, etc.\nWhen all the enemies of progress start to creep into your mind, you will need to bring your definite purpose to the forefront of your thinking. I have seen procrastination, fear of failure, self doubt, lack of motivation, temporary setbacks, and other negative things bring people with great potential to a halt. Knowing your definite purpose and reminding yourself of it when a negative thought comes into your mind will help you overcome it.\n9. Define exactly why your purpose exists in your mind. I specifically choose to list this separately from defining your purpose because I did not want you to let the WHY get lost in the act of DEFINING. Trust me, this is important.\n10. Create a strategy! You need a strategy that will layout exactly how you are going to reach your goals. Dreaming alone wont take you anywhere. Telling yourself that you are going to play your guitar everyday isn\u2019t enough. There is a lot more that goes into being an excellent player than simply playing your guitar. Ultimately you should work backwards. State your ultimate goals (on paper) then make a bunch of short and medium range goals. Think of reaching your goals as a relay race, NOT as a marathon. Each short term and medium term goal is the end of one segment of your plan and the beginning of the next segment (just like a relay race.) There are many benefits of looking at things this way as you will discover for yourself in your own way.\nIf you clearly know what your ultimate goals are, you can do this yourself. But if you need help in planning out the short and mid term goals to plan your strategy. Consult a teacher whom you trust and believe can help you with this \u2013 its worth it believe me. If you can\u2019t find a teacher who can do this for you, pay someone (YES I said PAY) to help you develop a specific\nplan to do this. The best person to approach for this is someone who is already doing whatever it is that you want to be doing.\nRemember that its ok to daydream and fantasize about where you are planning to go, but it can\u2019t stop there. Don\u2019t wish without planning!\nDon\u2019t dream without doing! And always, always, have a strategy. You may need to revise certain aspects of your strategy as time goes on and that\u2019s ok, but don\u2019t try to go forward without one if you want the maximum results in the shortest amount of time. In my early days learning to play guitar, I wasted a lot of time aimlessly desiring to get better without having a clue\nas to how to plan for it. Sure I practiced a lot, but without direction and without an efficient path to follow. Most of my substantial progress as a musician came only after I developed a strategy and worked with it. If you are wondering why I haven\u2019t given you a detailed explanation of the strategies I used in the past, it would be pointless for me to tell you what\nmy strategy was, because it was specific only to my goals. Chances are, your goals may differ greatly from mine in many different ways. That is why you need your own strategy for your own personal goals. One last piece of advice before we move on, write everything on paper and read it everyday! It will keep you focused and on target.\n11. Imagine yourself having the skills that you desire. Focus on that and concentrate. Convince yourself that you can do it. Convince yourself that you are already on your way to reaching your first goal \u2013 because you are. Its easier to manifest your desires when you can imagine yourself already in possession of it. Keep your positive mental attitude always.\n12. Define what you plan to do with your musical skills once you have them. If you plan on releasing your own CD or making a living in music. LEARN AND STUDY MUSIC BUSINESS RIGHT NOW!! The fastest way to do that is to actually take music business lessons at a college and take private lessons from a pro (or at least a semi-pro guitarist) Yes you can take lessons in this just like you can for learning guitar, songwriting, etc. Do NOT wait until you are a great player to start learning about this business!!!!!! I can not tell you how many players make this mistake (I made it myself at first and have been studying it intensely for the past few years to get my own career where it is today.)\n13. Find out how your favorite players reached their goals. Often times this is hard to do since you cant always sit down and talk to some very famous musicians. But interviews exist as well as a few biographies on some musicians (especially dead ones). Despite the fact that many successful artists don\u2019t really talk much about this, you can find some that do. Believe me, becoming successful is a lot more than just practicing and luck! REMEMBER that their strategies won\u2019t necessarily work for you because your goals may be different than theirs were. Still you can learn from it.\n14. Don\u2019t compare yourself to others. There is no need to do this anyway. Music should not be a competitive sport among people, only within yourself. Compare yourself only in relation to where you are in your strategy! Are you on your way to reaching your next short term and medium term goal towards your ultimate goals? Are you on schedule, does your strategy need to be revised?\n15. Make sure you are practicing efficiently. Do you really know how to practice the guitar? Are you focused on setting daily and weekly objectives and then practicing in such a way that you will be working towards those goals? These are questions you should ask yourself. The two biggest practicing mistakes I have seen in students (besides not practicing enough) are:\n1. Practicing is not goal orientated.\n2. Not understanding the difference between playing one\u2019s guitar and practicing one\u2019s guitar.\nIf you are having any difficulties with practicing, talk to your teacher about it. He/she should be able to help you.\n16. Play with others in a band or some type of ensemble. It is important to have experience playing with others. It can be in a band or some other ensemble setting. Formal or informal. The main thing is to be doing it. (at least once a month). Some things you just can\u2019t fully practice alone. Besides the fact that this can be really fun, it will also help you overcome stage fright if you have it.\n17. Measure your progress. Document your practice time. Keep a record of how much you practice each day. For technique things, use a metronome to see how fast you are able to play a particular scale, exercise, lick, arpeggio, etc. cleanly. Write down the result, practice it all week and see if you can play it one or two beats per minute faster by next week (or next month). Keep a record of all the technical things you are currently working on. You will clearly see if you are progressing and at what rate. For other items that are not so easily recorded with a metronome, paper and pencil, record yourself on tape or your computer each week. Keep the tapes for a long time. Listen back in 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, etc. Listen to how much you have grown.\n18. Do not pander to your strengths while ignoring your weaknesses. It is not necessary to be able to play all styles of music or every technique to be a good player, but certain aspects are universal, such as: technique, ear training, knowledge of theory, creativity, improvising, etc. Some musical styles will rely more heavily on certain aspects than other styles, regardless, its important to be balanced. If you are a heavy metal guitarist, chances are sight reading won\u2019t be as high on your list of priorities as technique. Likewise, a strict classical guitarist won\u2019t have much use for improvisation (unfortunately). But make sure you don\u2019t avoid weaknesses that you should be paying attention to because if you do \u2013 you will be sorry, sooner or later.\n19. Discipline yourself. Unlike a sport, you do not have a coach or a trainer to work with you all the time. Nobody is there to make sure you are practicing the way you need to, when you need to, and how often you need to. You need to be totally self reliant. If this is not a normal part of your personality, fortunately there is help for you. Only you can stop yourself from procrastinating. Take the initiative now to go forward.\n20. NEVER GIVE UP! Never say cant. Never say I cant. Never say someday. Never say if\u2026 If your IQ is higher than room temperature, if you have all of your fingers and if you really want to succeed, you can.\u00a0 It seems strange to me how many incorrect assumptions and teachings there are about becoming a better guitarist. Here are a few things that are often NOT true.\n1. You should be a well rounded player and learn lots of different styles of music to become a good guitarist. This is one of the most ridiculous statements I have ever heard on the subject. Segovia (the classical guitar master) wasn\u2019t well rounded \u2013 he didn\u2019t waste his time to master jazz or bluegrass for example. Yngwie Malmsteen didn\u2019t study intense jazz guitar. Most great jazz guitarists don\u2019t study classical guitar or heavy metal guitar. Stevie Ray Vaughn never learned to play fusion or metal. Great country players usually don\u2019t study Progressive Rock. Of course there are examples of players that do learn and play in more than one or two styles, but most of the really great guitarists are known for the style they focused on. They are masters of their style, they are specialists, not a jack-of-all-trades type of player. Don\u2019t listen to people who say something like, You must learn blues before you can learn heavy metal or classical guitar. You do not have to be well rounded.\nThe only time one needs to learn lots of different styles of music is because your goals REQUIRE it. If you truly love a lot of styles and want to learn them all, then go ahead and do that. If you want to be a studio musician or a jobber, then you will need that versatility. Its very hard to be REALLY good at many styles.\n2. You should be able to play all the techniques of the guitar. Van Halen did tapping but not with all his fingers as others have done. He didn\u2019t play finger style much either, but we still regard him as an important guitarist, the same thing can be said for Vai and many others. Classical guitar master John William\u2019s probably doesn\u2019t play well with a guitar pick (I am assuming this to be true, I have no proof of it), but he is considered one of the greatest classical guitarists alive today. Skills like improvisation, songwriting and playing with a guitar pick or not going to be high on his list of skills to acquire. This is because classical guitarists generally don\u2019t do those things \u2013 and don\u2019t need to in order to be great at what they do. These players are great players in their own ways and they have spent many years developing their skills. Learning everything about guitar playing would have taken away precious practice time from the things they needed to focus on to reach their goals.\n3. Teaching yourself is the best way to be original. This is so obviously false its hard to believe that anyone could actually believe it \u2013 yet some people still do. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking this is the best way to learn. This is the most close-minded philosophy I can think of. Musical skills are tools. One should want to obtain and master as many of these tools as will be needed to reach your goals. Doing that alone won\u2019t\nwork well and even if it does eventually work, it will take 10 times as long! Besides, how will you know if what you are trying to do is original if you don\u2019t learn about what has already been done?\n4. To be GREAT means I have to be BETTER than everybody else. We already touched on this one above, but it is worth mentioning again here. What matters is reaching YOUR goals, not someone else\u2019s goals. Who cares if you are or are not better than someone else? This is not the Olympics. Music is the art of expression (or for some people, the science of entertainment).\n5. You need natural talent to be a great (or even a good) musician. Don\u2019t believe this. It is true that some people possess more natural abilities in one skill or another. For example, some athletes are naturally\nfast sprinters. Others are great marathon runners. Others can swim faster or longer. Others can jump higher. Others are stronger. Others are smarter. Others have faster reflexes. Others can through a football\nbetter. Others can shoot a basketball better, etc. The point is athletes with great abilities have them usually in one area. For example, Michael Jordan (arguably the world\u2019s greatest basketball player of all time) was not very successful when he tried to play baseball (or golf for that matter). Think about athletes in the Olympics, they are specialists. They have found their natural ability and developed it to its greatest potential, but that natural ability is usually limited to one skill.\nMusic is very different from a skill or a sport. There is no such thing as musical skill. There exists only a large set of musical skills. Think about some of the very different types of skills a musician needs to have: a highly developed ear, good physical technique on his/her instrument, heightened creativity, the ability to improvise well, songwriting/composing skills, the ability to play in time, the ability to play with others, the comprehension of music theory, a good memory, the ability to read music, etc. The list goes on and on. Some players have a natural ability to play fast, some have naturally good ears, some have good voices, some are naturally more creative than others, some are natural improvisers, etc. NOBODY has natural talent in all of the necessary areas to be a complete musician.\nThink about the masters of music. Mozart was probably most naturally gifted in only three of these areas: technical skill, a great ear (perfect pitch), a great musical memory. But he had to work hard at all the other\nareas of music just like everybody else.\nChopin\u2019s natural ability was his ability to improvise. He was the master, but he worked very hard to become the virtuoso pianist that he would later become. Chopin also was the master at small forms, but struggled with large scale forms.\nBeethoven probably had no natural ability known to himself for a long time. He didn\u2019t even begin composing much until around the age of 30! He was not a child prodigy like Mozart and Chopin were. Beethoven was, of course, a master, but did not enjoy the fruits of any natural talents. He constantly edited his works over and over, trying to perfect them. Mozart , by comparison, very rarely ever edited anything he wrote.\nEach of us has some natural ability of some kind. You may already know what yours is or you may not yet discovered it. If being a better musician is not coming easy for you that simply means you are like the rest of us.\nIn reaching your goals: There are only two real players in this game;\n\u2026.You and Time.\n"}, {"score": 1037.3787, "uuid": "df1f9803-2afc-5944-b3aa-630c51c8018c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201wb-40-14817", "target_hostname": "www.buildingthedam.com", "target_uri": "http://www.buildingthedam.com/2011/11/19/2573893/why-beavers-are-better-than-ducks-and-vice-versa-2011", "page_rank": 1.1970736e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>Why</em> Beavers are <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Ducks (and vice-versa) - 2011 - Building The", "snippet": "<em>Why</em> Beavers are <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Ducks (and vice-versa) - 2011 Once again, it&#x27;s Civil War time, and people across our great state will be debating the Beavers and Ducks.

You won't find drills or job postings there, but you will find thoughts from a self-proclaimed coaching nerd who wants to help coaches and teams thrive.\nSupport women's sports and SHARE this story with your friends!\nsource\nWe spend sixty percent of our time listening\u2026yet we only retain twenty five percent of what we hear.\u00c2\u00a0 This is according to Julian Treasure in his TEDtalk, 5 Ways To Listen Better .\u00c2\u00a0 Treasure is a consultant to businesses that want to learn to listen better, he\u2019s written a book about listening, and writes a blog devoted to listening called, Sound Business .\u00c2\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to lie to you, I had no idea that listening was such a big deal.\u00c2\u00a0 But if businesses are spending money to train their employees to listen, it must be important.\nIn his talk, Treasure gives five suggestions for becoming a better listener, though I\u2019m only going to elaborate on three.\u00c2\u00a0 As he says, \u201clistening is our access to understanding\u201d, so let\u2019s figure out how to put our teams into the best possible position to understand what we\u2019re teaching.\n3 ways to make our players better through more effective listening\nThe mixer.\u00c2\u00a0 Using my sport (volleyball) as an example, noise and sound is built into the game.\u00c2\u00a0 There are coaches shouting things from the sideline, players communicating about who should pass the ball, hitters screaming at the setter for the ball, the setter is cheering on her hitters, and then there\u2019s the group celebration of the point.\u00c2\u00a0 And that happens again and again and again over the course of a match.\u00c2\u00a0 We have to teach our players to actively listen. \u00c2\u00a0There are so many levels of sound in a gym during a game and our teams should be able to filter our sounds from the opponent\u2019s sounds and from the crowd.\u00c2\u00a0 I think this is something that\u2019s worth practicing in our gyms.\nListening positions.\u00c2\u00a0 This one is huge!! \u00c2\u00a0Listening positions are the vantage point from which we hear things.\u00c2\u00a0 Are we bored? Are we excited? Are we tired? Are we annoyed?\u00c2\u00a0 A person could hear the same information from each of those listening positions and respond differently each time.\u00c2\u00a0 I believe one of the toughest things to teach teams is to give each other the benefit of the doubt.\u00c2\u00a0 The teams with bad team chemistry are the ones where the players don\u2019t believe the best about one another.\u00c2\u00a0 You know what I mean: one player gives another a basic correction on the court and the corrected player gets super offended and now there\u2019s a problem.\u00c2\u00a0 I ask about the benefit of the doubt in our gym a lot, because mood affects things so much.\u00c2\u00a0 If a player woke up late and missed class, received a D on a test, and got in a fight with their best friend\u2026then they\u2019re much more likely to get offended than a player whose first class got cancelled so they could sleep in, aced their test, and went for a cup of coffee with their best friend and had a great conversation.\nRASA.\u00c2\u00a0 This stands for receive, appreciate, summarize, ask.\u00c2\u00a0 This is the nitty gritty of listening\u2026and something tangible that we can teach our teams.\u00c2\u00a0 Receive what the person is saying (I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve had to tell players that I need them to make eye contact with me when I\u2019m giving instruction), appreciate what they\u2019re saying (instead of planning what you\u2019re going to say in response). This next one reminds me of Starbuck\u2019s when you order and then the person making the drink repeats the same thing\u2026then there\u2019s no confusion.\u00c2\u00a0 So, summarizing seals the listening process because we get to rephrase things in a manner that makes sense in our heads.\u00c2\u00a0 After we summarize, then we make sure that we\u2019ve got it right by asking the other person.\nI can already hear my team giggling as we go through this and I tell them to \u201cappreciate\u201d what their teammates are saying.\u00c2\u00a0 That being said, if we want our teams to be effective listeners\u00e2\u0080\u0094an essential quality in sports\u00e2\u0080\u0094then we\u2019ve got to show them how to listen so that there is understanding.\nSupport women's sports and SHARE

they are in, IMO) and what they can offer appeal to him at that particular time in his life?", "explanation": null, "document": "Print\nI have seen several people comment that John Calipari's tweet that he will be at Kentucky next year, now supplemented by this Lexy audio where you can hear him say it in his own words, with his own voice, is essentially a deception.\u00a0 That's what you mean when you say you don't believe a person when they make an unequivocal statement like Calipari did.\nOf course, the Big Blue Nation is now used to this, and instead of jumping into the breach and defending the Kentucky coach from his detractors again, I am going to ask this question -- is winning an NBA championship more impressive than winning an NCAA national championship?\u00a0 Is it a more worthy life goal for a coach?\nThe answer, I suspect, is largely dependent upon where the person answering the question's fanhood lies.\u00a0 NBA fans who are only casual fans of college basketball would surely answer in the affirmative.\u00a0 College basketball fans who think the NBA game is less worthy would likely think the negative.\u00a0 There is really no right or wrong answer, I suppose, but the reason it is worthy of discussion is that you would think it would figure into any decision Calipari might have to make, depending on what the ultimate outcome of the Summer of Lebron is.\nThe NBA championship has officially been around since 1947, three years as the Basketball Association of America and the rest as the NBA.\u00a0 During the nearly 63 years of the NBA championship series, there have been a total of 17 different teams winning the title.\u00a0 Currently, there are 30 NBA franchises, and of those 30, only 12 of the currently active franchises have won championships under their original names (although six winners have changed cities).\u00a0 Four of the franchises have been renamed, and one championship winner no longer exists (the Baltimore Bullets).\nThere have been five NBA coaches who have won four titles or more -- Phil Jackson (10), Red Auerbach (9), Pat Riley (5), Ray Kundla (5), and Greg Popovich (4).\u00a0 Of these, I would venture that only Jackson, Auerbach and Riley are actually household names.\u00a0 Popovich is certainly known to anyone who has watched the NBA in recent times, but hardly leaps to the tongue.\u00a0 Ray Kundla, who lead the Lakers (then in Minneapolis) to 5 titles, is the answer to a trivia question.\u00a0 NBA coaches who have won four titles or less are known only to fans of the league and the fans of their respective programs.\nCollege basketball has been around much, much longer than the NBA -- almost twice as long.\u00a0 The NCAA Championship has only been around since 1939, but even so, that's 12 years longer than the NBA Championship.\u00a0 During the history of the tournament, 35 teams out of the now 347 division I colleges fielding teams (note:\u00a0 this has changed substantially over the yeas) have claimed championships.\nHousehold name coaches in NCAA basketball for their work done on the floor include John Wooden, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Mike Krzyzewski and Bobby Knight (although Knight is at least as well known for his antics as his victories).\u00a0 Fans of the college sport, and even casual fans from other sports would also recognize names like Bill Self, Jim Calhoun, Jim Boeheim, Lute Olson, Rick Pitino and John Calipari.\nWhat the NBA has going for it are larger team fan bases, more player name recognition, more marketing and apparel tie-ins and even more media exposure as an institution than the NCAA championship.\u00a0 I can't say for sure, but I would guess that there are substantially more casual NBA fans worldwide than of college basketball.\u00a0 The NBA also unquestionably has the best players, since only the cream of the college crop ever make it in the Association.\nWhat the NCAA has going for it are arguably more passionate and dedicated fans.\u00a0 Fans of college basketball tend to be less \"fair weather\" and more likely to follow the team even in down years.\u00a0 The NCAA tournament is also unquestionably more difficult for a given team to win, even considering only the historically best teams.\u00a0 This is due largely to the single-elimination design of the NCAA tournament versus the series format of the NBA.\nThe NBA and NCAA also present distinctly different challenges to coaches.\u00a0 The NBA season is much longer requiring many long trips to faraway cities.\u00a0 Coaching in the NBA is more an exercise in business management than actual coaching, since the players are often employed more like financial assets in a Monopoly game.\u00a0 The NBA requires a coach to manage personalities more than anything else, as he is coaching mostly full-grown men making six and seven figure salaries per year.\u00a0 There are no NCAA violations to worry about, no grades to manage, and virtually no job security whatever.\u00a0 There is very little actual teaching of basketball done in the pros -- mostly just skills refinement for which the players are primarily responsible.\nThe NBA coach has a much shorter season with many fewer games and less time on the road.\u00a0 He has to teach his charges everything from fundamentals to the speed of the game.\u00a0 The coach must manage his players in every detail from grades to rules compliance to media appearances to matters of discipline.\u00a0 He must constantly recruit replacements due to a high turnover in addition to his coaching duties, and the most time he can ever get out of a player is four years.\u00a0 Job security is better than the NCAA, but far from tenure.\u00a0 His public relations responsibilities in jobs like Kentucky and North Carolina are substantial.\u00a0 Overall, even though he is gone from his home town less, he is arguably away from the house even more.\nIn the end, I see no practical difference between the value of winning an NBA or NCAA championship as a coach.\u00a0 I would, in fact, be inclined to argue that the NCAA coach is more meritorious in terms of pure basketball coaching, but others may rationally disagree.\u00a0 Overall, though, I have a hard time with the default idea that an opportunity to coach LeBron James to an NBA title is so tempting that no college coach could turn down the opportunity.\u00a0 I find such opinions entirely suspect to say the least, even though I can't reasonably reject them completely.\nI still insist that no matter what LeBron does, absent kidnapping or blackmail, will convince Calipari to leave this year.\u00a0 Your mileage may vary on this view.\n"}, {"score": 1029.9636, "uuid": "a934f6b8-8194-5b36-b77f-783f273b298d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id":

I\u2019m optimistic now, though \u2013 In Rod I trust. The being said, the press conference by coach Rich Rodriguez today pretty much terrified me.\nIf you haven\u2019t been keeping track, Michigan\u2019s biggest problem right now is quarterback \u2013 i.e. they really don\u2019t have one. They were spoiled by four good years from Chad Henne, but he\u2019s now in his second year as backup with the Dolphins, and a void was left in his stead. Uber frosh Ryan Mallett was supposed to be the answer as a sophomore last year, but he made a knee jerk reaction and left as soon as Rodriguez was hired because he didn\u2019t think he fit in with the system. Now he\u2019s at Arkansas and about to be eligible again. Last year we made due with Nick Sheridan and David Cone mostly, but it was more than ugly. That was to be expected \u2013 they hadn\u2019t been recruited by Rodriguez, and they just weren\u2019t suited to his system.\nThis year Sheridan is still around, and he is being challenged by two true freshman \u2013 early enrollee Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson. Forcier is the brother of former Michigan and Stanford QB Jason, and he\u2019s an impressive all-round talent \u2013 the likely long term starter from the group. Robinson is an athletic freak with a weird habit \u2013 he hasn\u2019t tied up his cleats since he was seven years old. He just tapes his ankles and flops around in his loose shoes. I don\u2019t know what the point is, but it clearly works for him \u2013 he\u2019s a speedster. Sheridan isn\u2019t the most overwhelming talent, but he has the advantage of experience and age, and will be a factor.\nSounds good, right? There is certainly enough there to win well more than the three games we won last year. So why am I terrified. Well, RichRod unveiled his QB for the season opener \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have one. Or rather, he has three. Rodriguez intends to give all three players significant playing time. That doesn\u2019t concern me in that game that much \u2013 it\u2019s only Western Michigan. What does concern me, though, is that Notre Dame is up in week two. I have no respect at all for the Irish, and I want to beat them senseless. I won\u2019t feel as comfortable in that, though, if we have yet to make a QB decision. I don\u2019t think you can QB by committee against legitimate teams. Scary stuff.\nAll that being said, I still think we will win 8 or 9 games this year. And I am totally sober as I write this.\nShare This Post\n"}, {"score": 1027.739, "uuid": "559b16d9-2e75-5817-834f-cdd13c897824", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-66-16465", "target_hostname": "www.testudotimes.com", "target_uri": "http://www.testudotimes.com/2009/3/24/809225/tuesday-links-women-s-bask", "page_rank": 1.1747406e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Tuesday Links: Women&#x27;s <em>Basketball</em> (and <em>Football</em>) Edition - Testudo Times", "snippet": "Besides the fact that more men watch sports <em>than</em> females (men care about men&#x27;s sports more <em>than</em> they do women&#x27;s sports), men&#x27;s <em>basketball</em> <em>is</em> more exciting to watch for those who aren&#x27;t <em>basketball</em> junkies.", "explanation": null, "document": "Print\nThe women's basketball team is starting to get some notice in the media. Strangely, it's all coming from Dan Steinberg.\nFirst, he asks why the media doesn't cover the women as much as the men . It's an interesting debate, but one that is easily explained. Besides the fact that more men watch sports than females (men care about men's sports more than they do women's sports), men's basketball is more exciting to watch for those who aren't basketball junkies. The pace of the women's game is slower and there aren't any high-flying dunks, which turns off some fans. Not saying it's good or bad, just pointing out it out.\nNext, he walks us through the women's locker room . There's colorful, positive signs all over - \"Heart\", \"Fun\". \"Be Aggressive\", etc. There's a jar of toy turtles with coach, player, and staff names on them. When they're dropped in water, they \"come out of their shell\" - an obvious metaphor. It's actually a pretty humorous read.\nRemember, the Lady Terps take on Utah tonight at 7, The game's on ESPN2.\nMaryland football started spring practice today . Out of the bit I caught of Ralph's press conference, he seemed to really like the skill positions (WR, RB) and defensive backfield (S, particularly). Alex Wujiack will be out all spring, which is a disappointment (he can't seem to stay healthy), and Dion Armstrong will miss a week. Cory Jackson had an \"operation\", he'll also be out all spring. Fridge expressed some concern over the OL, and I can't blame him - they are young. He also discussed the QB situation - let's just say it wasn't exactly a ringing endorsement for Jamarr Robinson. It almost sounded like he's already playing catchup to the freshmen (who aren't even on campus yet).\nA new depth chart for football was released today to go along with the start of practice. Demetrius Hartsfield seems like he'll finally see the field; he's a starter right now. Drew Gloster seems to be doing well at the MIKE spot, though he'll lose his position once Wujciak returns. The offensive line, a crapshoot before, seems to be settling: outside of Campbell and Costa - who were known - the starters will be Paul Pinegar, Justin Lewis, and Lamar Young.

Jokingly, I put in State of the CUnion address some time last year what team would have more wins: football or basketball. Of course, basketball should have more wins but it was closer than we all wanted to admit. I surely thought we could get to ten wins but losses to teams like Montana State, Vermont and Buffalo along with only one Big 12 conference win is a recipe for disaster. The team's 22 losses set a new school record for defeats in a year. Today against Texas, the Buffs with their style of play, kept in close like so many games this year but never pushed the Longhorns to think that they could pull off the upset. Texas ended up claiming victory 67 - 56 in another game that the Buffs never led although remaining within three possessions most of the contest.\nUsually a sure thing, Cory Higgins was guarded well by Texas G Dogus Balbay in the first half along with a zone that kept him under wraps.\u00a0 Higgins ended the game with five measly points, far from his 18 ppg average this year going 1 - 11 from the field. Dwight Thorne led the Buffs with 15 but was cold towards the end of the game. Combined, CU's two best scorers were 5 - 22 from the field and 2 - 10 from deep. That won't get it done in the Big 12 conference tournament.\nOn the flip side, like Higgins, Texas guard A.J. Abrams only put up six shots and scored ten points. He leads the team in both shots per game (14.1) and points per game (16.7). Abrams and Higgins lit up the scoreboard in the first meeting of these two teams but were rather ineffective/a non factor today. What killed the Buffs was once again the lack of an inside presence. Today, Texas C Dexter Pittman was the most recent big man to dominate the middle against Colorado. He scored 26 while going 9 - 13 from the floor. He also grab ten rebounds. Pittman didn't even average 10 and 5 in the regular season. Calling all centers who want early playing time at a Big 12 school...the Colorado Buffaloes need you. Pittman is very pedestrian and is probably the 4th or 5th best player on this Texas team. Colorado had no response to the inside presence.\nThe Buffs ended the year at 9 - 22, 12th in the Big 12. I guess the good news is their is no where to go but up. That being said, like many have stated before, I don't know where the light is at the end of the tunnel. Higgins is a good player, Thorne has his nights, maybe Veal and Kelley can bring some energy but unless this team gets more explosive and tougher on the inside, it is hard to see them competing in the Big 12 in the next two to three years. That's it. Done with basketball, let's bring on football.\nA pretty good article here from the Daily Camera talking about the quarterback battle, this time from the perspective of Cody Hawkins. If you haven't seen the ones about Ballenger and Hansen, they are linked in the article. Same old story on Cody. He works harder than anyone else, knows the system better than anyone else but he has physical limitations that make him less than appealing for the starting job. That being said, he is the de facto starting quarterback right now with Hansen and Ballenger needing to outwork, out-think and out-lead him in practice this offseason. One thing is for sure, Hawkins work ethic will make Hansen or Ballenger earn whatever reps they get but the starting job is for the taking. Hopefully, Hansen and Ballenger reach their potential and make this a race that will give everyone confidence about the Buffs signal caller in '09.\nAn interesting comment in the article above from Denver Johnson via Mark Helfrich:\n\"Cody can certainly play better and we can certainly play better around him. Coach (Denver) Johnson made a hilarious comment the other day that is very dead on. He said for all of the stuff that happened to us last year, and having guys in situations where they probably shouldn't be, he goes, \u2018We're drowning three feet from the dock.'\n\"It's not like we're watching film going, \u2018If these seven things would have happened differently, we would have had a chance.' It's one guy here, one guy there. We're not that far away, but that's where your margin for error from a guy like Cody needs to be very, very tuned in. He needs to play very consistently and not perfect but near perfect to give us a chance. ... We want a guy who wants to play the perfect game and chase down that perfect game, and we can certainly do a lot to help him both as coaches and players around him.\"\nI wouldn't say we were only drowning three feet off the dock. If that were the case, we would have seen something work on offense. Nothing worked last year when the Buffs had the ball. Many things and every position needs to improve from last year. I am just waiting for the day that someone comes out and says: \"we were sh*tty last year, plain and simple. We didn't execute, coach well, play well, our energy level was down, etc.\" Sorry, but I just don't agree with the drowning three feet from shore statement. The Buffs were three plays away from being 2 - 10 last year, they weren't three plays from being 8 - 4.\nMike Bohn does a pretty candid interview with the Boulder Daily Camera about the perception of Colorado sports right now, particulary around men's and women's basketball. I think Bohn is a pretty straight shooter when it is all said and done. He gets perception. Now, like he says, winning is the perception. All the off the court stuff is nice and that is a good first step but turning the corner on the scoreboard is the obvious progression. It is going to be a very interesting year in 2009. It may be a deciding year for Colorado athletics for the next five seasons. A winning season from all three shouldn't exceed expectations next year.

Fans loved the exciting offense, national media was popping up in Lubbock, Kingsbury flirted briefly with Heisman talk, but the results were similar.\nSince our expectations at this point were still relatively low, we let this Leach guy stick around, even though the majority of us were disappointed with the results.

On top of that, earlier this year he recruited the best class in school history (#20). So far for 2012, we are ranked #16.\nBased on the expectations of the Leach era, I think Tommy Tuberville did his job.\nTuberville is working his way with this team, but after a season and a half (19 games), everyone wants to burn him at the stake.

Congressman Kingston, a University of Georgia alumnus whose district borders the Sunshine State, declined to honor the Bulldogs\u2019 division rival to the south, for which I took him to task not once , but twice .\nThe second time, I received a comment from CheapSeats1 , whose sister is the Congressman\u2019s legislative assistant in Washington, D.C. I was offered the opportunity to forward a short set of questions to Congressman Kingston through CheapSeats1, which I accepted . My questions (in bold type) and the Congressman\u2019s answers (in regular type) appear below without editing or alteration.\nWhen Representative Kingston\u2019s responses arrived in my e-mail in-basket on Tuesday evening, they were accompanied by an apology from his legislative assistant regarding the delay in getting his answers to me. However, the Congressman had actual public business to which to attend, inasmuch as economic stimulus legislation was before the House, so Congressman Kingston replied quickly enough to be responsive but not so rapidly as to suggest that he didn\u2019t have better things to do. He did, and he was doing them.\nQuite frankly, when you finish reading his answers to my questions, you are likely to reach two conclusions: (a) your decision to vote for an actual party nominee for the post of chief executive rather than write in Jack Kingston\u2019s name for president of the United States was sheer unmitigated folly for which you should hang your head in abject shame and perhaps turn your Knowshon Rockwell Moreno blackout jersey into a hairshirt, and (b) you should never again visit this weblog, because I\u2019m a bozo and an ingrate for having criticized the Congressman in the first place. (Do stick around for MaconDawg\u2019s coverage of national signing day, though.) A couple of concluding paragraphs by me (written in italics) appear at the end.\nDawg Sports: In January 2009, as in January 2007, you voted against a Congressional resolution honoring the Florida Gators as Division I-A college football\u2019s national champion. Why did you vote against these resolutions? Were these votes symbolic gestures in the spirit of rivalry or do you believe Florida was undeserving of the 2006 and 2008 national titles?\nCongressman Kingston: Background: I am the only Member of Congress who grew up in Athens and actually played football in Sanford Stadium. Of course, I was only 10 years old at the time, and merely a participant in a pre-game with my Athens YMCA teammates. It was so pre, pre-game that my parents weren't even there. But, as a Y member, I got to share a locker room with Jake Scott (UGA/Miami Dolphins) and Andy Johnson (UGA/New England Patriots). My job was picking up towels- what an honor. When I was convinced my football career had peaked, I sold football programs in Sanford Stadium for a dollar each and feasted on Poss' Bar-b-que. During the game, we would sit on the grassy hill in the Northwest corner of the stadium. Those were the cheap seats, before the \"Tracks\" became famous.\nI am an SEC guy- I am proud of the conference. It's the toughest in Division IA. You cannot have the NFL without the SEC. In regards to the 2007 vote. I graduated from UGA, but I actually started at Michigan State. I quickly learned that Spartans have the same regard for Ohio State as we do for Florida. So it was great to see Ohio State lose. I was proud of the University of Florida, Urban Myer, and Tim Tebow (How could dislike him? He has better PR than Disney World). However, why endanger a long standing rivalry in a weak moment of hugs and kisses? Just as ancient Athens had Sparta, modern Athens has to have Gainesville.\nDawg Sports: I criticized your vote in each instance because I believe it made Georgia, which historically has boasted a more successful football program than Florida, appear envious of the Gators\u2019 recent success. Is that a valid criticism? If not, why not? Are you concerned at all that your vote could be construed that way? Are you concerned about the possibility of a Gator backlash from the Florida delegation when it comes time for the House of Representatives to honor the Bulldogs after Mark Richt leads them to the national championship?\nCongressman Kingston: When it comes to GA/FL, nothing counts but the present. Have you ever noticed that we only resurrect the \"all-time\" statistics when we lose the game? I might envy the NFL teams that pick up Knowshon and Stafford, but I'll never envy anyone who wears blue and orange to black tie events.\nNext year, when the Bulldogs' national title resolution comes to the floor, I would be disappointed in the Florida delegation if they felt they needed to vote for it. But fortunately, we don't have to have their votes to pass it. Besides, they would probably bring in butterfly ballots, confuse everyone, then demand a recount.\nDawg Sports: Congressman Joe Barton of Texas has introduced the College Football Playoff Act of 2009 (H.R. 390). This bill would, if enacted into law, prohibit the promotion and merchandising of any Division I-A college football game as a \"national championship game\" if it did not involve a playoff and would punish violations as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. What is your position on the College Football Playoff Act of 2009, and why?\nCongressman Kingston: Wow- now that's sour grapes. I favor a playoff, but with a 9% unemployment rate, boots on the ground in the Middle East and people seeing their retirement accounts reduced by half, I think Congress has better things to spend time on. However, since Florida fans are against it, maybe it should be our number one priority.\nDawg Sports: President Barack Obama has stated repeatedly that he supports an eight-team playoff in Division I-A college football and he has indicated his intention to throw his weight behind such a postseason format. What is your position on a Division I-A college football playoff, and why?\nCongressman Kingston: I support any system that allows us to have at least two more games a year. This means more beam and coke, chicken wings, and ESPN Gameday. So there's really no downside. Maybe we should just extend the season through March? After all, no one watches basketball but a bunch of ACC weenies.\nMy profuse thanks go out to Congressman Kingston for his gracious willingness to be interviewed. While I am a firm believer that college football has a necessary connection to the state legislature and the judicial branch , I have tended to be a bit rough on House members for their gridiron-related actions, and it is to the Congressman\u2019s credit that he did not allow this to affect either his sense of humor or his sense of duty. While I still disagree with Jack Kingston\u2019s votes on these resolutions, I credit him with being a conscientious and responsive public servant, as well as being remarkably down to earth for someone who has held office at that level for this long.\nTruly my bad, Congressman; you\u2019re good people and a damn good \u2018Dawg. Here\u2019s hoping that, if the U.S. House of Representatives ever takes up a non-binding resolution to declare me a dufus---and surely such a resolution will be introduced as soon as someone shows this to, say, Dennis Kucinich ---Congressman Kingston will vote in the negative then, too, in spite of any evidence I inadvertently may have given him to the contrary.\nGo \u2018Dawgs!\n"}, {"score": 1008.42, "uuid": "60669b83-8fef-545f-bad8-e9d0eeab53db", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1903wb-32-05393", "target_hostname": "eye-on-football.blogs.cbssports.com", "target_uri": "http://eye-on-football.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22475988/33131267", "page_rank": 1.1714959e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Good news: Tebow <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Eli to start career - CBSSports.com", "snippet": "No one has said TT <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> any of those qb&#x27;s, or that TT <em>is</em> going to have a <em>better</em> career <em>than</em> any of those guys, but its a FACT that he started off THROWING the ball <em>better</em> <em>than</em> any of those guys did. <em>Why</em> <em>is</em> it so hard to look at the facts and accept that?", "explanation": null, "document": "Good news: Tebow better than Eli to start career\nPosted on: November 6, 2011 11:18 am\nAmazingly, it could be worse for Tim Tebow . (Getty Images)\nPosted by Ryan Wilson\nThe Broncos ' Tim Tebow will face the Oakland Raiders in the Black Hole Sunday. Not ideal circumstances for a young quarterback coming off a horrific performance last week. In fact, depending on how he plays, this could be the 2010 first-round pick's last chance at a starting gig this season. First-year coach John Fox, who inherited Tebow from Josh McDaniels, doesn't seem particularly thrilled with any of his options at quarterback, and more than anything, he sounds tired of answering questions about Tebow.\n\u201cThe goofy thing is, it\u2019s almost like if he doesn\u2019t have success it will be anybody\u2019s fault but his. It\u2019s almost that kind of polarizing thing,\u201d Fox told the Los Angeles Times ' Sam Farmer last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll say it could be his supporting cast, or the type of plays. At the end of the day, we are what we are. We\u2019re doing everything we can to win, and we\u2019re finding out about a young quarterback, good, bad or indifferent.\u201d\nThis comes days after an anonymous Lions defender called Tebow \"embarrassing\" and \"a joke.\" But not everybody thinks the former Heisman winner is a sideshow and a pushover.\nRaiders coach Hue Jackson, the man who gave up a first- and (likely) a second-round pick for Carson Palmer , isn't taking Tebow lightly.\n\u201cHe came in here last year and played really well, and I expect he\u2019ll come here again with the same thought,\u201d he said, via the Oakland Tribune . \u201cThe guy has talent. I\u2019ve never questioned that. He can throw. He can run. And he\u2019s on the opposing team, so we have to do everything that we can to get him under control.\u201d\nRaiders defensive end Jarvis Moss was also asked about Tebow, his former teammate at Florida.\n\"He\u2019s a good athlete, man,\u201d Moss said. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong dude. He can definitely hurt you with his legs.\u201d\nThe phrase \"damning with faint praise\" immediately comes to mind but Moss is right: Tebow isn't much of a passer, despite that being a big part of the job description. But former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner, who now works for NFL Network, made this comparison on Sunday's NFL GameDay Morning: Eli Manning vs. Tebow through their first five NFL games.\nWins-Losses: Manning, 0-5; Tebow, 2-3\nCompletion percentage: Manning, 44.4; Tebow, 48.3\nPassing yards per game: Manning, 126.4; Tebow, 196.8\nTD-INT ratio: Manning, 3-7; Tebow, 7-4\nPasser rating: Manning, 44.8; Tebow 74.8\nSo there's your silver lining, Broncos fans. Of course, Denver has other issues -- the offensive line and defense chief among them.\nEither way, Warner says not to panic. \"I think the verdict is yet to be determined (on Tebow), I think everybody needs to relax,\" he said.\nWarren Sapp, Warner's NFL Network colleague, couldn't help but ask: \"Were those really Eli's numbers?\"\nAfter a loss to the Lions last week, Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos look to rebound as they prepare to take on the Oakland Raiders on Sunday.

Houston is Tennessee's all-time leading scorer.\nI don't think anyone would argue about either of these two guys going up in the rafters - both\u00a0were in attendance at UT games this season, Houston seems to have reconnected with the university despite the fact that they fired his father, and quite frankly I'm surprised the Vols haven't already retired his number...but I have no doubts we'll see it soon.\nThe rules also state that\u00a0five years must pass after a player's last game before their number can be retired.\u00a0\u00a0So Ellis and Houston could go up anytime.\u00a0 There are only two other Tennessee players who meet even one of the criteria:\n#35 Ron Slay (2000-03):\u00a0\u00a0SEC POY 03\n#5 Chris Lofton (2005-08):\u00a0 SEC POY 07\nIn addition to their SEC Player of the Year awards, both of these guys were\u00a0All-Americans...but not first teamers.\u00a0 Slay was\u00a0a third team selection his senior year in 2003,\u00a0and\u00a0Lofton has two second team and one third team selection on his resume.\u00a0 But the way the criteria stands now, assuming that neither is going to make an Olympic or NBA All-Star team, both would be out.\nLook, I love Ron Slay.\u00a0 He came to UT as a student the same semester I did, I watched him all four years from the student section, and as such he'll always be my favorite player.\u00a0 But Slay's case is hurt by a knee injury that caused him to miss most of 2002, and the fact that the teams he played on - which produced two NCAA bids and\u00a0another to the\u00a0NIT\u00a0in the three years he was healthy -\u00a0have become much less celebrated in light of what Pearl has done.\u00a0 Ron Slay was a unique and talented individual...but does he\u00a0deserve to have his jersey retired?\u00a0\u00a0Probably not.\nBut Chris Lofton?\u00a0 I'd put his jersey up there in a heartbeat.\nLofton is the second leading scorer in the history of the\u00a0program, and the best three point shooter in the history of the SEC.\u00a0 His\u00a0battle with cancer adds a unique\u00a0quality to his already amazing career.\u00a0 And the fact\u00a0remains that Lofton was the\u00a0on-the-court face of the resurrection of Tennessee Basketball.\u00a0\u00a0It's not a stretch to suggest that,\u00a0in the minds of\u00a0the majority of current fans and perhaps even those who care to read about Tennessee Basketball on this site, Chris Lofton is the best player in the history of the\u00a0program.\nUnder the current rules, Lofton's number can't be retired until\u00a02013.\u00a0\u00a0So there's still\u00a0time for those on the committee to tweak a policy that's only been in existence for three years to begin with.\u00a0 And I have faith that they'll do the right thing, and make an exception for #5.\nBut for the moment, understand that if we're talking about retiring Chism's number,\u00a0a lot of things would have to change in the criteria, or a huge exception would have to be made.\u00a0 The\u00a0stronger argument would be for Lofton, if the committee decided to\u00a0shut him out as the rules currently dictate...we'll see what happens.\nFootball Criteria\nIf you thought the basketball policy was tough, check out the football qualifications :\nTHREE of the following...\nInducted into the College Football Hall of Fame\nSEC Player of the Year\nFirst Team All-American\nHeisman Trophy winner\nWinner of either the Sullivan Award, Draddy Award, or SEC Athlete of the Year (all sports)\n....AND, THREE of the following:\nInducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame\nNFL Offensive or Defensive MVP\nFIVE Pro Bowl selections\nOwn a major single season or career statistical record\n...holy cow, that's impossible.\nFootball Retired Number Candidates\nOf course, it's not impossible if you're Peyton Manning or Reggie White, whose numbers were retired in 2005.\u00a0 But jersey retirement at Tennessee should be for the very best players in the history of Tennessee, not the very best players in the history of football.\nIt should be noted that the rules were bent slightly for Doug Atkins (who absolutely deserves to have his number retired); Atkins is a member of both the college and pro hall of fame, played in eight Pro Bowls and was a first team All-American at UT.\u00a0 The NFL Defensive MVP award wasn't created until 1971, two years after Atkins retired.\nThe Vols have also retired the jerseys of four players who were killed in action during World War II.\nAs the criteria currently stands, who else can get in?\nThe answer, currently, is no one.\nEven\u00a0our most celebrated collegiate players\u00a0don't meet those standards:\u00a0 Eric Berry has first team All-American honors and was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year in 2008, but he'd have to wait for induction into the College Football Hall of Fame to fulfill the third part of the current college requirements, before we even begin to discuss him making five Pro Bowls or going to Canton.\nThe only player who comes close to the NFL requirements is Jamal Lewis, who won an Offensive MVP award in 2003, and set the single game rushing record (295 yards) in the same year, when\u00a0he also\u00a0came within 39 yards of getting Eric Dickerson's record for most yards in a season.\u00a0 Adrian Peterson broke his single game record in 2007 by one yard, but I'd hope UT's committee would allow some breathing room if it came to that.\u00a0 But Lewis hasn't been to five Pro Bowls...and is Jamal Lewis an NFL Hall of Famer?\nEven if he was, he meets none of the collegiate requirements.\u00a0 And I'm not saying Jamal should have his number retired...I'm just pointing out that as the criteria currently stands, the doors are locked and no one else is getting in.\u00a0 You'd need a combination of Eric Berry's sensational college career and Jamal Lewis' sensational pro career just to come close, and would still need the committee to bend the current\u00a0rules to get in.\nOutside of those two, are there others who deserve the honor?\u00a0 Al Wilson was a first team All-American and played in five Pro Bowls, and could get a pass for\u00a0being the leader of the National Championship team.\u00a0 Many will instantly go to the Vols' Heisman silver medalists:\u00a0 Hank Lauricella,\u00a0Johnny Majors, and Heath Shuler.\u00a0 Lauricella was an All-American and is in the college hall of fame, but didn't make it in pro football.\u00a0 Shuler, of course, didn't either; he\u00a0did a lot of incredible things here, but like Ron Slay, his career was instantly overshadowed because of what came directly after it:\u00a0 four years of Peyton Manning, followed by a National Championship.\nBut Johnny Majors, like Chris Lofton, deserves to have the rules bent to accomodate him.\nMajors has the college requirements:\u00a0 he won two SEC MVPs, was an All-American, should've won the Heisman Trophy,\u00a0and is in the College Football Hall of Fame.\u00a0 But as he also never played in the NFL, he meets none of those criteria.\nNumbers were originally retired in 2005, when Phillip Fulmer was still running the show and tensions were much\u00a0higher between he and Majors.\u00a0 But being that Johnny excelled as a player and a coach in Knoxville and has done so much for this program, he should be the next one to have his number on display at Neyland Stadium.\nThe policies for both football and basketball reiterate that having a number retired is the highest honor the university can bestow.\u00a0 And I agree.\u00a0 I don't think we should just do it for everybody,\u00a0and have a dozen retired numbers in every sport.\nBut my hope is that the criteria function as guidelines and not hard and fast rules.\u00a0 Dale Ellis and Allan Houston can go up anytime.\u00a0 And I think Chris Lofton and Johnny Majors deserve to join them.\nAs for the best basketball team in school history?\u00a0 Well, even if we can't retire Wayne's jersey (and if we don't want to hang his headband from the rafters next to Slay's)...at the very least, I'd wager Bruce Pearl is going to get a street named after him sooner than later.\nPoll\nTennessee's jersey retirement policy is:\n57%\n"}, {"score": 1004.8582, "uuid": "8b856e49-d39a-563c-a8a0-1747254ebad1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1615wb-90-12636", "target_hostname": "piefight.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://piefight.typepad.com/piefight/2006/06/brazilians_trai.html", "page_rank": 1.1830262e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Pie Fight: Brazilians train harder, longer and <em>better</em> <em>than</em> Brits", "snippet": "\u201cBrazilians play <em>better</em> <em>than</em> anyone else,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbecause they train harder <em>than</em> anyone else. * Institute for Child and Family Policy", "explanation": null, "document": "Tuesday, June 13, 2006\nBrazilians train harder, longer and better than Brits\nThat's what Simon Clifford argues in this very insightful and perhaps a bit frightening article by the fab Alex Bellos .\nThere's a clip beneath the fold. On the same topic, there's this good analysis of Brazil by James Hamilton .\nClifford, who received a first class degree in Sports Science and Media at Leeds University, also used his time with Juninho to try to learn why Brazilians played with more apparent skill than other nations. He began to realise \u2013 counter-intuitively \u2013 that Brazilian footballers were much more disciplined than their British colleagues. Juninho confided to Clifford that he wanted to do more than the one obligatory training session a day, but was scared of getting into trouble with Middlesbrough\u2019s coach, Bryan Robson, if he was spotted practising with the ball on his own.\nJuninho also introduced Clifford to futebol de sal\u00e3o, a type of football played on a basketball court that uses a small,\u00a0 weighted ball. In Brazil, most of the greatest players of the last 50 years \u2013 including Pel\u00e9, Zico and Ronaldo \u2013 began their careers playing this indoor variant. Juninho was a typical Brazilian child: he started futebol de sal\u00e3o when he was four and only started playing on grass with a full sized ball when he was 14. Clifford felt a thrill that he had uncovered the secret of the Brazilian game \u2013 the footballing equivalent of the Holy Grail. He asked Juninho to have 30 of the small balls sent over and immediately started using them with his own school children.\n{...}\nIn the summer of 1997 Clifford borrowed \u00a35,000 from his teachers union and flew to Brazil. Using Juninho\u2019s contacts he met up with several former World Cup stars.\u00a0 \u201cBrazil had won four World Cups. You\u2019d have thought it would have been obvious to go there to learn how they did it, but I was the first person to do so.\u201d Clifford was most impressed with the work ethic. \u201cBrazilians play better than anyone else,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbecause they train harder than anyone else.\n11:56 AM in Football | Permalink\nGorilla suits\n"}, {"score": 1004.79803, "uuid": "79d1c5f4-016e-55e2-a6fd-bc9d72aa6b4b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0605wb-46-26683", "target_hostname": "www.maizenbrew.com", "target_uri": "http://www.maizenbrew.com/2008/4/1/102444/6261", "page_rank": 1.1705745e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Matt Leinart&#x27;s Life <em>is</em> So Much <em>Better</em> <em>Than</em> Yours - Maize n Brew", "snippet": "by Maize n Brew Dave on Apr 1, 2008 9:24 AM CDT in News This <em>is</em> completely unrelated to Michigan, but in scrolling through my normal morning RSS feeds I clicked on The Wizard of Odds clip show illustrating <em>why</em> the life of Matt Leinart <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> yours.

No other method allows us to calculate as accurately and objectively the relative strengths of two sports teams. Unlike Angle and Trend handicapping systems, Power Ratings inform us how many points a team should beat an opponent by. Unlike fundamental handicapping, Power Ratings are purely objective. No emotion or bias is involved.\nIf Power Ratings are such an exceptional handicapping tool, why isn't everybody using them? Well every handicapper worth their salt is using them. Those who are not often use excuses such as it's too hard and it takes too long. If you fall into this category then this program is just what you have been looking for and best of all its FREE for ever and so easy to use.\nThe Yellow Column is what we call our Simple Basic Power Ratings and our first step is to use the raw Scores to calculate PR's for both Overall and Home/Away. Before continuing, let me explain my reasoning for using only final scores to calculate PR's. While Some handicappers use all sorts of funky statistics in their calculations, what are we trying to predict? First Downs? Fumbles? Points per Yards? No, we want to know the outcome of the game in Points. What simple basic statistic better represents this than final score? The Power Ratings in our software utilizes more sophisticated mathematical formulas, but don't underestimate this system. It does produce strong results and is a good indicator. However, it is possible to modify the final score with these and other statistics to remove the effects of luck and other variables.\nThe Green Column is what we call our Basic Power Ratings have a major flaw. They fail to take into consideration strength of opposition. A team which beats up on cellar dwellers is a far cry from a team which can do it to the upper echelon. So what do we do here, we average the PR's of a teams opponent and plug it into our formula.\nThe Blue Column is what we call our Final Adjusted Power Ratings While our Power Ratings are good, they can be made even better. One problem is they fail to reflect recent performance. All games are now weighted incrementally. This is what we call Front Loading.\nYou now have the ability to calculate razor sharp Power ratings for both overall and home/Away. Below are screen shots from our Excel program.\nWell how do I use the program. The first \"Compute all Power Ratings\" button is used only once. It calculates all the Simple Power ratings in the Yellow Columns based on all the games in your data base.\nSecond step is selecting the date. Very important, if you select too few games then you will get an error. Always make sure to use a minimum of 3 games for both Home and Away.\nThird and final step, click on the \"Compute Power Averages based upon Date\". This will calculate all the Final Power Ratings in the Blue Column.\nThe last box called \"Last Row of Teams\" are used if you want to add or remove teams. So as an example if there are 30 teams in our database and you want to add an additional team, the value in the box would be changed to 31.\nThe Pro Football database follows 32 teams, College Football 119 teams, Pro Football 32 teams and College Basketball 151 teams. You can add as many teams as you want in the future and even use your own ideas\u00a0 This program is all yours and is free.\nWell how do we handicap a game? Lets use Arizona @ Home Vs. Arizona St.\nArizona's Final Overall PR is 101.8 and Home PR is102.7 while Arizona St's Overall PR is 108.8 and Away PR is 109.1. Comparing Overall PR's you have 101.8 - 108.8 = 7 points which Arizona St should be favored by. Using Home/Away PR's you would get (102.7 + 4) for Home Field - 109.1 = 2.4. Therefore Arizona St should be a 2 1/2 Point favorite. Our preference is the Overall Power Power Rating + 3 for HF or HC advantage. Use the Home/Away Power Ratings to confirm the Overall PR. Make sure there is a 2 point overlay. The same logic is used for Pro Football and Basketball.\nTeam Stats | Vegas Odds | Sports Links | Advertising | Contact Us | Home\n\u00a9 1987 Sportrends Inc. \u00a9 1987 College and Pro Football Prophet.

Dr. Atul Gawande, asserts that coaching can play a valuable role in a variety of life\u2019s stages and environments.\u00a0 He tells of his experience working as a surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital inBoston,MA.\u00a0 Though very accomplished, he sought out the help of a former medical school instructor for coaching.\u00a0 Ironically, this doctor was already at the top of his game and teaching surgery atHarvardMedicalSchool.\u00a0 He thinks he needs a coach?\u00a0 Exactly!\u00a0 He explains that world-class tennis players, golfers and other athletes and performers rely on coaches to help them continue to improve, why not surgeons?\u00a0 Coaching is applicable in disciplines even outside the athletic world.\u00a0 Further, coaching is a method for continuous improvement, and we all have the capacity to improve in any endeavor in which we dedicate ourselves.\nTo become proficient in a sport, occupation or pastime one must acquire aptitude and faculty.\u00a0 Dr. Gawande describes this continuous-improvement process as moving from (\u201cUnconscious Incompetence\u201d) or not knowing the barrier preventing improved performance, to a state in which the barrier impeding improvement is identified (\u201cConscious Incompetence\u201d) and then eliminated (\u201cConscious Competence\u201d).\u00a0 At this point, improved performance is achieved \u2013 at least for the moment.\u00a0 However, to become elite and experience a longer-term successful state, those acquired abilities must be put to practice and turned into habit.\u00a0 The new aptitude must become habitual (\u201cUnconscious Competence\u201d).\u00a0 According to Dr. Gawande, a coach is the essential stimulus for experiencing improvement and creating habits because he/she adds an outside perspective whereby flaws in performance unknown previously are corrected, eliminated and the improved skill is practiced and eventually becomes habit.\nHow does an organization go from unconscious safety incompetence to unconscious safety competence?\u00a0 With proper coaching of course!\u00a0 Before I describe safety coaching approaches consider this scenario in a factory I visited this past year.\u00a0 On this particular tour, my guide and I came across a roped-off area of the production floor where two workers were in a crane doing overhead work.\u00a0 We looked for a path around the guarded area and an employee of this organization tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou can cross the rope and enter at your own risk.\u201d\u00a0 He pointed to some people that were lifting up the rope and walking right under the bucket with the workers in it.\u00a0 Sensing my trepidation, my guide found an alternative route around the roped off area.\u00a0 This organization felt that an at-your-own-risk approach to safety management was acceptable; hence, subjecting exposure to risk in the factory to one\u2019s own personal view point.\u00a0 Not good for reducing risk, in my opinion\u2026This organization needed safety coaching!\nSo there are three types of safety coaching.\u00a0 The first and most common is supervisor coaching.\u00a0 In other words, a manager or trainer of some sort observes employees on the operations floor doing work.\u00a0 When that manager sees somebody inching toward being unsafe he/she stops that employee and coaches them how to do it safely.\u00a0 This approach is better than not doing any safety coaching at all but I believe is not enough.\u00a0 Commonplace supervisor safety coaching may foster improvement but here are two additional methods that cover a wider organizational area and can help achieve \u201cUnconscious Safety Competence.\u201d\u00a0 Safety Leadership Strategy Coaching (SLSC) and Peer Assessment Coaching (PAC).\u00a0 The first targets an organization\u2019s management cultural approach to safety and the second targets an organization\u2019s method for promoting employee involvement with safety.\nHave you ever talked to a teenager with big dreams but no plans?\u00a0 Like that well-intentioned teenager, some organizations have lofty-safety-performance dreams but no plan or strategy to achieve them.\u00a0 \u201cOur safety goal is to be world class\u201d may be printed on a banner in the lobby of that organization but really there is not a substantial plan to achieve that world-class standard.\u00a0 Failure to have a plan or following a misguided plan is ultimately management\u2019s responsibility.\u00a0 SLSC is an often-times humbling process where you invite knowledgeable and respected safety professionals from outside your organization to examine your safety philosophy, goals, plan, systems and tools -- the things that management creates to achieve safety in an organization.\u00a0 These trusted safety coaches identify possible shortfalls and opportunities for better alignment within your organization\u2019s safety goals.\u00a0 To make this type of coaching work, you must be willing to fully expose your weaknesses and be prepared to address them.\u00a0 You may learn that amazing safety programs you implemented recently may not be so spectacular after all.\u00a0 Keep in mind, thorough coaching points out all potential flaws without regard for preserving ego that may impede improvement.\u00a0 SLSC works best if it sincerely challenges management\u2019s commitment to safety improvement and leadership stands ready to adjust accordingly.\nTruth be told, coaching from management or an outside consultant is often less impactful than peer-to-peer coaching, orPAC.\u00a0 To illustrate, consider this personal example with my nine-year-old son.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been trying to teach him to throw a football for months now and his friend from next door got through to him in a couple of minutes.\u00a0 I\u2019m happy he improved but where did I go wrong in my coaching?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t!\u00a0 His friend captured his attention in a way that I don\u2019t.\u00a0 Peer teaching and learning is often effective because of the social and team building aspect peers possess by virtue of the relationship dynamics inherent with peer relationships.\u00a0 This goes for children and adults alike.\u00a0 PAC is a non-intimidating method of providing coaching between peers that captures attention better than management often is able.\u00a0 Behavior-based observation is a popular peer coaching method that employs peers as safety coaches.\u00a0 It typically works like this: One employee observes another employee performing a task and evaluates the observed employee based upon a set of criteria and, afterwards, provides coaching based on identified risks observed.\u00a0 Sometimes it feels better to learn how you can improve from a friend working along side you rather than from a manager.\nI believe there is a place for all three methods of safety coaching; however, you miss the mark if your organization utilizes only one or two of these methods.\u00a0 Employing all three will get you closer to unconscious safety competence or a culture where everyone is seamlessly guided by being safe.\u00a0 It\u2019s true, coaches hold a warm place in my heart and I do have a fond appreciation for the role they play in society.\u00a0 I firmly believe that safety can be coached in an organization effectively leading to world class achievement.\u00a0 However, the safety coaching must not be delivered at a management to subordinate level only but also challenge the safety cultural focus of organizational leaders and empower the good people at the shop-floor level as safety coaches as well.\u00a0 Special thanks to the great coaches that have provided the example for us all.\u00a0 May we model our safety coaching after them and be safer because of it!\nAbout the Author, Rob Loose, MAU Safety Manager:\nSafety Professional with Manufacturing, HR and Health Care management experience, Rob has worked for MAU since 2006 supporting both HR and operations functions.

As one person who knows said :\n\"This is UCLA,\" he said. \"The expectations are higher here than anywhere. The amount of success both in terms of championships and wins as well as success off the floor has been second to none in college basketball.\nThat person, of course, was Ben Howland. But why are the expectations so high? Inevitably someone says something to the effect of Coach Wooden has been gone for 37 years. While Coach is the foundation, UCLA basketball is more than just him.\nIt is why Shabazz Muhammad will likely come to UCLA. It is why UCLA is still thought of (wrongly) as a basketball school. UCLA is a premiere place to play basketball and will be again.\nHere are some reasons in no particular order, after the jump.\n1. During summers at UCLA you get to play with the pros\nThink about it. Do you think any pro comes by North Carolina to get in shape for the season like they do at UCLA? The pickup games are incredible and the rules for the pros are simple: every game must have at least one UCLA player. Freesia39 wrote about last year's version here .\nI have seen it a number of times. One of the most memorable times was with Pooh Richardson, the then all-everything UCLA freshman. I saw him shaking like a tween at a Justin Bieber concert one day when he had the chance to play against Magic Johnson. For kids that live in a gym, this is unbeatable.\n2. Stars come to LA\nTo be a basketball player you have to have a bit of an ego. Do you want a kid when he takes a shot to think, well there is a 43% chance this one will go in? No, you want a player who believes he is going to make every shot he takes.\nIf you have a healthy ego, do you want to be playing in a place that the idea of widespread coverage is both the college paper and the local small-town paper covering the team? Not really.\nLos Angeles is a major media market: the second-largest in the United States. It's the home to Hollywood. It is well, I don't really need to elaborate, do I? The best players want to play in the bright lights. And it's hard to find brighter lights than in the City of Angels.\n3. The Best in the West\nAs is obvious by my name, I am on now on the East Coast. And I can tell you that the East Coast thinks basketball on the West Coast begins, and in some cases, ends with UCLA. On the Selection Sunday ESPN radio show the Pac-12 came up and the announcers, led by John Thompson Jr., talked about UCLA. Now if I was not a UCLA fan, this would make me furious. UCLA was a fifth place team that lost in the quarterfinals of the conference tournament. They should not be in any NCAA tournament discussions this year.\nBut that's just it: basketball in the west begins with UCLA. Two more examples: the last two times the Pac-10/12 had only two teams in the NCAA tournament (2010 and 2012) UCLA did not make the tournament. How UCLA goes impacts not just the entire conference, but maybe the entire West Coast basketball scene.\nPerfect example: if you look at this year's Sweet 16, the most western teams are Baylor and Kansas.\nAnd it goes deeper than that: the best players in the west have UCLA connections. Coming from the Pac-12 champions and the only Pac-12 team team to win a game in the tournament, Colorado's all-freshman Spencer Dinwiddie wanted to come to UCLA. Outside of Gonzaga and Colorado, the only other school that went beyond the first round was a New Mexico squad led by Drew Gordon , a UCLA transfer who was conference player of the year in the Mountain West.\nYes, the west is down this year, in no small part due to UCLA. The west needs UCLA so that Kansas won't be the western-most power program.\n4. The NBA\nWhile Howland has done well, UCLA has always turned out NBA players. The complete list is here . Not to take any credit away from Howland who definitely prepares players for the NBA, the fact that the list contains UCLA players from the Lavin error era proves that there is something about UCLA, regardless of who occupies Coach Wooden's seat on the bench. The next likely UCLA basketball Hall of Famer Reggie Miller played under two of the worst coaches in UCLA history in Larry Farmer and Walt Hazzard. Yet, he did okay for himself, wouldn't you say?\nIn short, UCLA is a place where future pros play.\n5. Coach Wooden\nCoach Wooden is the greatest coach in basketball history. He was a great man and teacher; much more than just a basketball coach. If you don't agree with that, please leave here now.\nBut the other great basketball schools can claim they had great coaches as well. But who is the better model?\nKansas had James Nasmith, who invented the game but never won a nation-wide championship.\nKentucky had Adolph Rupp, who will be remembered best for losing a championship game with an all-white team to an all-African American team in 1966. He was a racist and his team was even involved in a point shaving scandal.\nNorth Carolina had Dean Smith. Dean is probably the closest to Wooden and was a real positive force and role model. I can't say anything negative about Dean except he only won two national championships with all those great players and teams while Wooden won ten.\nNo one has an icon and legend like Wooden other than UCLA. As Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said on UCLA after the Sports Illustrated scandal broke (emphasis mine):\n\"I think it's fair to say that whatever you read in the article, you are naive if you think that's not happening at every campus in the country amongst the general student body,\" he said. \"But knowing the leadership at UCLA, and knowing the high standards they hold themselves to, I don't think they'll use that as some excuse.\"\nHe said that the story is noteworthy mostly because it is about UCLA, which has a rich basketball tradition and a reputation of integrity in the college sports world and that the article might serve as a wake-up call to get UCLA back on top.\n\"It really is the gold standard based on history and championship success and Coach (John) Wooden,\" Scott said. \"\nUCLA fans, alumni and students have every right to expect the best from their basketball team. UCLA was elite and should always be. Anything less is selling ourselves, Coach Wooden's legacy, and the university short.\nGo Bruins\n"}, {"score": 995.54144, "uuid": "ba87f6f2-c52d-5ad9-a608-d7962d135e84", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-56-27934", "target_hostname": "www.standard.net", "target_uri": "http://www.standard.net/topics/business/2009/12/14/study-shows-ogden-area-surviving-recession-better-most", "page_rank": 1.2599307e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Study shows Ogden area surviving recession <em>better</em> <em>than</em> most", "snippet": "Study shows Ogden area surviving recession <em>better</em> <em>than</em> most All rights reserved.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.\nImages\nA six-state study on the effects of the recession shows Ogden and Provo have fared better in many ways than other Western metropolitan areas.\nThe study was done jointly by the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the Brookings Institution, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.\n\"Ogden has a lot of jobs in the public sector. It also has a fairly diverse economy, that has helped it,\" said Jonathan Rothwell, a senior research analyst at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.\nThe authors of the report used data from prerecession through September for Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. They describe the group of states as the Intermountain West, and compared the group's 27 metro areas to the rest of the country.\n\"In many Mountain region locations, the sheer abruptness of the shift from hypergrowth early in the decade to a severe contraction in the last year has spawned a sense of almost existential whiplash,\" the authors wrote in a summary of the study.\nSome of the study data included Clearfield as part of the Ogden metro area, a common practice among economists.\nThe report points out:\n* Collectively, the 10 large Intermountain West metros have suffered disproportionately in the recession compared to the rest of the country and other large metros.\n* In terms of recovery, the region also lags, but is largely moving in the same direction as the rest of the country in that Gross Metropolitan Production (GMP) rose from the second quarter to the third in every metro, while job growth remains elusive. In this respect, GMP expanded during the third quarter of 2009 in every metro, with output growth ranging from Denver's tepid 0.3 percent increase to Ogden's robust 1.7 percent growth. Ogden and Phoenix, for example, were hit especially hard with new job losses of more than 1.5 percent in the quarter. With that said, nine of the 10 larger Mountain metros (Ogden being the exception) were losing jobs at a slower rate in September than they had been in the quarter before.\n* Overall, the major metros of the Intermountain West have been registering highly uneven economic performance even as the nation began an economic recovery. In this respect, Las Vegas, Boise and Phoenix have all seen massive losses in jobs. Colorado Springs and Ogden have also weathered the downturn better than the average U.S. metro.\n* Heavily influencing the region's below-average aggregate profile on economic performance is the severe distress afflicting Las Vegas, Phoenix and Boise -- three metros that have been heavily hit by the collapse of the housing bubble.\n\"Ogden is less dependent on the housing bubble. It did have a higher share than average from across the country of employment in housing and construction, but not nearly as bad as other places,\" added Rothwell.\nThe authors said metropolitan education levels, higher in places like Provo, plus a concentration in such industries as health services and related social services, seem to have protected some metros from the worst economic stress.\nThe study also shows house prices have not yet stabilized in the Intermountain West and the region's collective rate of bank-owned properties remains high.\nThe authors made other conclusions, finishing with a reference to a well-known Western writer:\n\"These difficulties, then,\" the study says, \"and the particular experience of the Intermountain West, are going to require patience and creativity in the region that Utah writer Wallace Stegner called the 'native home of hope.' \"\nThe UNLV/Brookings group plans to further study the Western states for economic data.\nTags\n"}, {"score": 992.92676, "uuid": "7c918706-abcf-5cd7-a1c0-7b9ebc2daa5c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1509wb-96-11536", "target_hostname": "voices.idahostatesman.com", "target_uri": "http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2011/06/15/bmurphy/big_sky_commish_were_a_better_place_wac", "page_rank": 1.2074362e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Big Sky commish: &#x27;We&#x27;re in a <em>better</em> place <em>than</em> the WAC <em>is</em>&#x27; | Voices.IdahoStatesman.com", "snippet": "What I don&#x27;t get <em>is</em> that UofI always goes back to, &quot;You get a <em>better</em> education at UofI.&quot; So <em>why</em> care about <em>Football</em>?

The University of Idaho, Utah State University, and San Jose State University have all publicly stated they would like to join the Mountain West Conference and believe themselves to be good fits there. Even Louisiana Tech has made no secret that it would like to become a member of Conference USA. How inviting and enticing of a conference is the WAC when its own members have let it be known that they don't even want to be there? There is no stability, period.\nAt least with the Big Sky, there are a core number of schools who aren't going anywhere. Even with the addition of the University of North Dakota, the Big Sky still has a tighter geographic footprint than the WAC does. The vast majority of Big Sky schools are closer to Grand Forks, North Dakota, than they are to Ruston, Louisiana. Heck, Grand Forks is closer to most Big Sky schools AND Moscow and Logan than each of those schools is to San Marcos, TX (Texas State) and San Antonio, TX (UT-SA). I would imagine the travel costs for Seattle University and UI will spike with non-revenue sports traveling to Texas and Louisiana every year. The Big Sky has already stated it would like to create two divisions, thereby keeping traveling within the school's own geographic region.\nRegarding the \"academic peer\" argument, the Carnegie Foundation classifies the University of Idaho and Utah State University as Research University - High (RU/H) institutions. Other schools classified as RU/H are Idaho State University, University of Montana, University of North Dakota, Portland State University, and Northern Arizona University. Ranked one tier above the Carnegie RU/H classification is the Research University - Very High (RU/VH) classification. Schools ranked as RU/VH include most PAC-12 schools, Ivy League institutions, as well as Montana State University and UC Davis. If you want to be in a conference with \"academic peers,\" the Big Sky would have to get the nod (no current WAC schools are classified as RU/VH).\nLogin to post comments\nSubmitted by boisestfan on Wed, 06/15/2011 - 5:38pm.\nWow.\nReally can't add to that.\n\"...that those guys realize and understand...\"\nFreakin ouch.\n\"FBS-ness\"\nMan I know they don't want to jump down, but for long term stability (at least viewed currently) it could be in their best interest.

Think about who will be in the WAC in 2013, then think about who will be in the Big sky conf in 2013. Add that to the fact that UM is one of the few school that make money, the Wacs unstable future and the next round of conference shakeups due in 2013 and you have the answer. To say they are scared shows you do not Know anything about how these things are put together. You have to think 10 years ahead at least. and in 10 years, UM will probably be FBS and the WAC wont exist. They are being smart, do you now that NMState had to have a bake sale for football equiptment (not kidding) and Fresno had their coach take a paycut to stay solvent, the fresno bee is constantly pumping our financial articles on Fresno state.

Since football is the primary determining factor that drives conference affiliation the conference's future is uncertain. In the meantime, not all Big Sky members (MSU) are happy with such a large conference because the new schedule format has broken apart important rivalries and increased travel costs for some. Finally, there might be some validity to the fear factor. This is only 3rd hand information but about 9 months ago I was told Montana's primary concern is they cannot recruit enough athletes to complete at the FBS level on a consistent basis.\nLogin to post comments\nI also wanted to comment on this\nSubmitted by potato2 on Thu, 06/16/2011 - 4:53pm.\n\"From my perspective the WAC is only as stable as the members are committed to the conference's mission.\"\nsportsisfun1960, this is odd that we can have an intelligent debate with no namecalling given the history on these boards, I'm proud of us!\nbut I think this idea I quoted is untrue. An institution can be as commited as they want to the \"conference mission\" (whatever that is, and arent they all the same?) but it comes down to money, and ability to field a successful program.

We all love the \"rudy\" mentality but sometimes it ends up being more like the end of \"lucas\" for the sake of continuing the conversation in a civil manner I will pick on NMstate instead of my favorite target. they can commit to the mission all they want it just aint going to happen. At first there was some question if the WAC would be able to pull a rabbit out of the hat again, but it is becoming more and more evident that as schools shy away, and the addition of Bball schools the wac is going the way of the big west. I think it is time for NMstate and the other WAC schools to seriously consider other options. Perhaps la tech being in the deep south can justify a FBS football program (and I think they have one foot out the WAC door) It is truely sad and wrong the way money and the BCS has caused this. But it is also wrong to throw precious money after foolish pride.\nLogin to post comments\nI get what you're saying...\nSubmitted by sportsisfun1960... on Thu, 06/16/2011 - 8:23pm.\nand I appreciate a civil conversation as well. I'm not necessarily defending my comment but I want to expand on my earlier thoughts that compelled me to make that statement. First, I wouldn't be surprised if all of the WAC schools, (with the exeception of the schools that haven't yet officially become members) have one foot in and one foot out the door. As for the WAC I don't have a clear idea of what the conferences mission is nor do I know if they have a shared vision. It just seemed to me that a few years ago the conference was unified with its vision to \"Play Up\" and I think it worked out really well for all the WAC members. I think everybody's level of play has vastly improved, particularly the past 5 years. However, with the upcoming departure of Boise St and the future departures of Fresno, Nevada and Hawaii I'm not so sure the conference has any defined identity. So, without the members being committed to a common cause it becomes a loose alliance.\nAlso, while I don't understand the details the money involved, (I gotta read that book VNDL has spoken about regarding the BCS) I do understand the challenges of having sustainable budgets to compete at the FBS level. (I live in the midst of PAC12 country and see the power of TV each season.) If I correctly recall, the PAC 12 schools will receive up to $20 million each year compared to the to the MWC $1.2 million per school. That's a massive difference and it concerns me a great deal...I don't necessarily like it but there's nothing I can do to change it and just like most people I will keep tuning into college football each day there's a game to be played. So, I guess I'm part of the problem.\nAs for the remaining WAC teams and what the alumni, fans, etc desire? All that I can tell you is that I sat through lots of 55-10 blowouts against teams like Mankato St because those were the only teams to come and visit Moscow. The crowds were extremely dismal and I can remember a game against some school like the Colorado College of Mines where only the band and teams showed up. Today, while the crowds aren't huge compared to the larger metro areas today, the crowds are much larger and there's lots more energy and enthusiasm when teams such as Western Michigan, Colo St, UNLV and SDSU show up.\nAs an alumni, it makes it much more enjoyable and worthwhile to spend my time and money visiting Moscow for a game. Anyway, I'm not sure if its pride or just what the market desires. If the UI alumni can't support FBS football then it might just as well they drop football and perhaps replace it with hockey, baseball, soccer and other sports. Gosh, I remember a game against Weber St when only the band was in the stands along with a few thousand spectators...so I guess it comes down to what people want to support.\nAs for the WAC...I would be happy if it simply becomes a conference that enabled schools the opportunity to compete at the FBS level. Perhaps it'll mean 2 to 3 money games per year but I really enjoy when Idaho plays in Seattle, Corvallis and Eugene. There's lots of alumni living over here and a lot of them do show up for the games when played here.\nLogin to post comments\nI think the conference\nSubmitted by potato2 on Thu, 06/16/2011 - 4:40pm.\nhead honcho has been very honest an candid. I also think UM has no need of recruiting worries they would only have to recruit a tad better than now. If NMstate, UI and Latech think that they belong in the FBS recruiting world more than montana it is laughable. Wyoming is the model that UM is looking to follow not BSU. Everyone wants to hit the BSU homerun but Wyoming has made a solid move that UM could reasonably expect to duplicate. UM could win some non AQ conferences with the teams they field now. If you had UM's players in the WAC, BIG West, Sunbelt or MWC for the last 20 years they would have some championship trophies. Now there is no way to prove that but as a BSU fan I am glad they were in the Big sky the past 10 years.\nI think your third hand info is shakey. It is about the MONEY for the scolarships not about who would fill the scholarships. As soon as one understands this they will understand what CFB is about and how scholarships, divisions, conferences, and winning works. This is exactly the reason UI needs to consider the big sky. with or without montana it makes financial sense and the stakes are such that we are gambling the WACs and UIs future on our childrens shoulders. I think in this situation UM is behaving in the most resposible way imaginable. And I think that 10 years in the future you will see the difference in that approach VS the WAC schools approach.\nLogin to post comments\nI agree\nSubmitted by sportsisfun1960... on Thu, 06/16/2011 - 9:07pm.\n3rd hand information can be shakey...especially since it came from a local attorney who got his undergrad degree at Montana and claimed his father is a UM athletics insider. So, who really knows? I just know he shared this information with me weeks before Montana turned down the WAC's offer to join. However, the Montana St unhappiness with the recent Big Sky moves came from the Bozeman newspaper that I'm pretty sure quoted the MSU's president.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I personally understand the difference between being motivated to attend a game against teams like Colorado St versus Mankato St. I also think today's teams are more robust and much deeper than the teams fielded in the 1980's and 1990's. Plus the level of competition is much more entertaining to watch. For example, a few years ago we made the 7-hour trip to Moscow to watch Colt Brennan play in his last season at Hawaii. The only time I recall attending a game to watch and opposing teams quarterback was when I attended a game in Pocatello to watch Idaho State play Portland State when June Jones was playing at PSU.\nAs for behaving in a responsible manner...is it responsible for MWC teams to compete with PAC 12 teams who'll be earning up to $20 million each compared to the MWC teams annual $1.2 million? I personally don't think it's any less responsible than being in a conference that receives $750K per year in TV money. In my view the TV revenue difference between the PAC 12 and MWC is probably more than 1,500%. That's huge. I'm not sure what the WAC teams earn but if they only earn $750K in TV revenue per team then the difference is more than 2,500%. So, I'm not sure how you judge what's responsible.\nLogin to post comments\nWAC TV Revenue\nSubmitted by MSP on Fri, 06/17/2011 - 8:51am.\nLast year, the WAC members only made approximately $400,000 per team in TV revenue. There has already been talk of that number being cut by half or more. I think Big Sky teams made about $60,000 to $75,000 in TV revenue (the conference shares TV deals, such as Montana's, but also games shown on Altitude and ESPN's airing of the conference tournament championship). Most of this info is from a Hawaii newspaper:\nhttp://www.staradvertiser.com/sports/sportsnews/20110303_nevada_tv_holding_up_schedule.html\nThe Big Sky is a way better conference...\nSubmitted by BDuck2009 on Thu, 06/16/2011 - 9:28pm.\n...than the MWC, especially with Boise in it.

"snippet": "I am not going to say that one <em>is</em> <em>better</em> <em>than</em> the other, just that I think it&#x27;s wise to take both into consideration.", "explanation": null, "document": "Print\nIn the many times we have discussed football here at A Sea of Blue, I can't think of a single time the need to upgrade our recruiting efforts in football wasn't raised as a major component of increasing the success of our football program.\u00a0 So I began wondering, \"Is the coaching staff upgrading our recruiting efforts?\"\u00a0 So I gathered data using the Rivals recruiting service and analyzed it in aggregate.\nFirst off, a discussion about recruiting service \"star\" ratings.\u00a0 Debate has raged for years about how viable and accurate recruiting \"star\" rankings are as a qualitative measure of player skill.\u00a0 There have been many analysis done, and there is evidence to support both sides of the debate.\u00a0 Instead of recreating that debate for you, I'll summarize some recent work done by excellent bloggers on this point.\nFirst of all, we have a blog post done just yesterday by Messenger at Wildcats Thunder blog analyzing football recruiting services star rating.\u00a0 Messenger looks at the \"star\" ratings of some recent UK players since about 2002, and demonstrates that a number of players rated 2-star and below have gone on to All-SEC careers here at UK.\u00a0 Messenger takes the position that the people doing the rating of the recruits often are echoing the work of others, and have never actually seen these recruits in action:\nIn fact, many of their \"star\" ratings may simply reflect what they have read about the kids on the internet! IMO, that is the \"dirty little secret\" behind internet ratings. For that reason, their evaluations of HS prospects are not as fundamentally sound as evaluations done by UK's coaches (who have actually seen these kids play football).\nMessenger may well be right about this, and based on the evidence he provides, his argument seems pretty defensible.\u00a0 But there is another side to the coin.\nOutside the Sidelines, an Alabama blog who's owner has now joined our SB Nation sister site Roll 'Bama Roll did this analysis on whether or not recruiting rankings matter.\u00a0 In it, he does an empirical analysis of the subject, looking at how each team performed versus its rank on the recruiting services.\u00a0 His conclusion:\nIt's quickly obvious that there is a very high correlation between good recruiting classes and future wins. If you run the numbers, there is a .8 correlation between Scout.com average recruiting finish rankings and future winning percentage rankings. And there's actually a little higher correlation for Rivals, Inc. as it crunches out at a robust .818.\nIn addition, OTS did yet another analysis, specifically looking at 4 and 5 \"star\" recruits .\u00a0 Once again, he crunched the numbers in his spreadsheet, and came up with this conclusion:\nMuch like with recruiting rankings, as you can see, where you rank in terms of how many four and five star recruits you sign, compared to the rest of the conference, strongly correlates with overall winning percentage on down the road.\nTo be specific, the correlation between recruiting rank and winning percentage rank was a robust .7202. That's not quite as strong as the .8 that we saw between overall team recruiting rankings and winning percentage, but it's still very strong.\nSo there you have two points of view about the value of recruiting rankings as a measure of player quality.\u00a0 Where you shake out on this kind of depends on how you look at the world in general -- those who prefer an analytical approach are likely to feel drawn to what OTS did, and those who operate more on \"feel\" will probably prefer Messenger's take.\u00a0 I am not going to say that one is better than the other, just that I think it's wise to take both into consideration.\u00a0 Messenger makes a good case that lower ranked players can become high-quality SEC players, and OTS demonstrates a statistical correlation essentially between \"star\" ratings and success on the field.\nNow that we have disposed of that, let's take a look at how all this applies to UK's current recruiting, and my question \"are we upgrading our recruiting?\"\u00a0 What I have done for my first spreadsheet is look at 4 SEC schools, including Kentucky, that I consider \"peer\" institutions when it comes to football.\u00a0 Some may make an argument that I haven't chosen well, and I'll try to defend that as best I can, but first, let's look at 2008's data:\nSchool\n"}, {"score": 983.9527, "uuid": "7186a90a-8ece-5aa9-836c-465de22b3642", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1309wb-41-25754", "target_hostname": "www.aseaofblue.com", "target_uri": "http://www.aseaofblue.com/2008/8/21/598445/kentucky-football-recruiti", "page_rank": 1.1771316e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Kentucky <em>football</em> recruiting: This deal <em>is</em> getting <em>better</em> all the time", "snippet": "Obviously, it <em>is</em> great news when we get guys as highly ranked as Morgan Newton and Ryan Mossakowski.

got an e-mail from him thanking me for it!).\u00a0 After he died, I overhauled it.\u00a0 It was featured on Yahoo on the news story about his death.\u00a0 That got this site a BUNCH of hits (1000 before he died, 50,000 during 3 months after he died).\u00a0 This is the only site I have that features a guest book.\u00a0 And no, I don't ask that you sign it.\u00a0 It is for those who wanted to

clay feet of the tin god Michael jordon.\nThis is my pride and joy section.\u00a0 It was my first attempt at web page design -- ahhh!\u00a0 The good old days.\u00a0 This section is also the one that I have dedicated by FAR the most time to.\u00a0 It contains the Java Applets and Java script that I have learned.\u00a0 It contains interactive sections as well, and most of my graphics work.\nIt is part truth with a humorous twist.\u00a0 I grow tired of the hype of the media, saying he is \"without a doubt the best ever\", instead of, saying that he is \"one of the best ever.\"\u00a0 Because of the unfounded hype, I created a webpage using hype in the other extreme, in order to demonstrate the absurdity of the press.\u00a0 Therefore, the theme of the site is \"Michael jordon is a foolish ballhog.\u00a0 His teammates won in spite of him.\u00a0 Not only is he the most overrated basketball player in history, and an out-of-control megalomaniac.\u00a0 However, he happens to be one of the greatest cooks in the world, so this proves that I am unbiased.\"\u00a0 If you just don't \"get it\", then go to the \"Political agenda\" section and read how he masterminded the Clinton-Lewinski scandal.\u00a0 One of the funniest parts is how people take it so seriously, so for added humorous benefit, I print the hate mail and the praise mail.\u00a0 It is just priceless how some people just don't \"get it.\"\u00a0 (and how many tell me, \"You can't spell his name right!\")\nI don't update this site very much anymore.\u00a0 Making fun of him in his current job as part-owner of the Washington Wizards is just too easy.\u00a0 There is no challenge.\u00a0 It's like shooting fish in a barrel.\u00a0 I may remove the frames someday, but for now, I can't think of an easier way to navigate the 75+ html document related to it.\nWhy Jordan is NOT the greatest\nThe sister page to the Exposers of jordon's Foolishness page.\u00a0 Stripped down, just-the-facts site that shows why Michael Jordan is not the greatest basketball player ever.\nThis is a bare-bones, all-facts/no humor site.\u00a0 My Exposers of jordon's Foolishness Site was a lot of fun, but some people thought that because of the humor, that it completely lacked in factual information (due to the obviously absurd parts).\u00a0 As a result, I created this alternate, smaller site to prove what I said before: Jordan is good, but you cannot say with certainty that he is without a doubt, the greatest ever.\nYou don't hear any baseball or football player called the best ever.\u00a0 Why basketball?\u00a0 Because basketball has degenerated from a serious sport into an entertainment business, and Jordan, while he was a great player, was an even better entertainer.\u00a0 Greatest entertainer?\u00a0 Ok.\u00a0 Greatest basketball player?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 The two should not be combined.\nI don't care if you think Michael Jordan is the 2nd greatest player of all-time.\u00a0 I don't care if you think that Wilt Chamberlain is not the greatest player ever.\u00a0 I don't care if think he is better than Chamberlain and somebody else is better than both of them.\u00a0 This site has only one purpose: to show that no matter what criteria is used, Michael Jordan is not the greatest player ever.\u00a0 He maybe #2, #20, or #2000, but he is not #1.\nIf you think he is in your opinion, that is fine, but I simply ask that you first define your criteria for judging players, and then I will show that your very own criteria does not support the conclusion that Jordan is #1.\u00a0 When people call him the best ever, it becomes obvious that they don't understand ever, because they lack knowledge of basketball history.\nThis is not some \"I hate Jordan\" page.\u00a0 He makes my all-time all-NBA team.\u00a0 I am simply sick of the media worshipping him and holding him to a lesser standard than others are held to.\u00a0 When you even the playing field, you see that he is not the best.\nThe

prolific sports handicappers, we specialize in NFL and College Football handicapping and take sports betting to a whole new level by treating sports wagering as an investment...take a ride with us on the \"Money Train\" today!!\nWhy gamble on sports?\nWhy Gamble on Sports?\nby Jim Campbell of Footballforecastor.com\nMen and woman have in all likelihood been gambling on this or that since the beginning of time, mostly for the sheer pleasure and excitement of it all, thus the reason that bookmakers have been around just as long as gamblers themselves.\nIts really not that big of a stretch of the ole imagination to think that today\u0092s gamblers are no different than gamblers of old, the only real difference is what gamblers of old wagered on and what gamblers of today wager on.\nToday we gamble on a lot of the very same things that gamblers of yesterday wagered on, with regard to wagering on horse races, cards, dice, and even political elections to name a few, but gamblers today have the ability to wager on a much wider assortment of things including but not limited to church and fire hall bingo, slot machines, poker machines and even state sponsored lotteries, heck, today we even have a state who has an economy built around gambling halls or what we now refer to as casinos.\nIt\u0092s kind of hard to believe that it was not all that long ago when a gambler interested in wagering on a sporting event was more or less forced to run his/her wager thru a local bookmaker and thus had to take the line given if he or she wanted to place a wager, unless of course the same gambler had access to other \u0093outs\u0094, meaning that this same gambler had an out of town connection that he used in order to allow himself or herself to gain an edge with respect to the posted spread or money line placed on an event.\nIn days gone by before the invention of the personal computer, a smart gambler with the right connections could find more than his fair share of \u0093Middle's\u0094, meaning that if for example NFL team Blue were at home against NFL team Red, it was not that unusual to find the hometown Blue team bet up with the local books because of hometown sentiment while the line placed on the visiting Red team in their hometown would hold steady or be bet down.\nThus, a savvy guy or gal with the right connections in both the Blue city as well as in the Red city might just find a 2 or a 2 1/2 point and sometimes even a 3 point difference in the local line from town to town if he or she looked hard enough and did not hesitate on making a wager upon finding the difference in posted lines city to city.\nAs an example, lets say that the home Blue team was favored to win by 5.5 points on the opening line but by game time the home town Blue backers had bet the line up to \u00967 points, meanwhile, the visiting Red team\u0092s fans back home bet the line down to +4.5 by game time.\nThus the line at game time in Blue town is +/- 7 while the line in Red town is +/- 4.5, this creates what is known as a \u0093Middle\u0094 meaning that a 2.5 point difference now exists between these teams, the worst that can happen is that one wager will lose and one wager will win which means that all that one would lose is the \u0093juice\u0094 associated with the wager, meanwhile, the best that can happen is that the actual score falls somewhere in the middle which allows the gambler to collect on both ends.\nToday however, sports wagering is getting bigger and bigger thanks to the availability of the home computer, cable TV, sports talk radio, and of course the influx of so many off shore sports books, thus the days of finding a good many \u0093middles\u0094 are gone although an astute gambler can still catch a middle opportunity now and then if he or she keeps their eyes open.\nThe lines placed on sporting events today are a lot sharper then in days gone by, but it all evens out in the end because the odds maker is now not the only one privy to the multitude of information available surrounding any given sporting event, this is of course due to the large number of gamblers today owning a home P.C. which allows the savvy gambler to not only gain valuable handicapping information via the internet, but to also \u0093line shop\u0094.\nSo, the real question my friend is \u0093Why should today\u0092s savvy gambler wager on sports instead of wagering on other games of chance\u0094?\nQuite simply because a gambler has a much better chance of winning on a consistent basis when gambling on sporting events than he or she has when playing any casino game, slot or poker machine, the state lottery or for that matter any other game of chance, except for maybe poker or blackjack, but regardless of whether you gamble on poker, blackjack or sports, the savvy gambler must have a firm understanding of the game itself and must do his or her homework.\nWhen it comes to wagering on major sports such as football, baseball, basketball and hockey, usually a spread or money line is placed on the game by the lines maker and then this established spread or money line is wagered on by the gambler, however, most novices as well as a lot of supposed experienced gamblers make the mistake of believing that the spread or money line placed on a sporting event is a true indicator of one teams strength and ability versus the opposing teams strength and ability.\nThe truth of the matter is that the spread or money line placed on a game is meant to garner equal action by the gambler on both teams involved, the winner wins his wager while the loser pays the \u0093juice\u0094 associated with the particular wager that he or she placed, thus creating the commission that the middleman or bookmaker/sports book makes for handling the transaction between winning and losing gamblers.\nThe serious gambler understands that it is not the bookmaker or sports book who is his or her enemy, the true enemy is actually the \u0093Joe public\u0094 bettor that places uninformed, opinionated wagers which of course causes what is referred to as line movement.\nLine movement is simply the difference +/- in what the opening spread or money line was on a particular event versus what the closing numbers were on the same event, it must of course be understood that many factors can and will influence the opening and closing numbers on an event, including but not limited to weather and injury concerns, but always remember that it is the very same \u0093Joe public\u0094 bettor that still influences the established line when they hear of possible weather or injury concerns amongst other things and thus often creates an over reaction with regard to line movement.\nIts all about odds and percentages when it comes to gambling my friend, and that is what truly sets apart sports wagering versus other forms of gambling, take a moment and think about it, if you wager on a football game for example and the posted line is \u00963 or \u00965 or minus whatever, it is still a 50% proposition on a straight wager that you are either right or you are wrong which makes the odds essentially the same as a coin toss.\nOf course you must take into consideration that you pay more when you lose, thus on a straight wager you pay 11 to 10 odds or 110 to 100 dollars wagered, thus the real \u0093Break even\u0094 point or winning percentage that you must achieve on straight wagers is actually 52.38% in order to avoid a monetary loss.\nKeeping in mind that 52.38% is the break even point with regard to straight wagers, a gambler needs to realize that anything above this percentage is money made, most honest, professional handicappers achieve winning percentages of 57% to 60% over the course of an entire season, often the more experienced handicapper can achieve winning rates of 60% to 65% if the ball bounces right for him or her here and there over the course of the season.\nI pointed out the above with regard to what the \u0093Break even\u0094 percentage is versus how honest professionals fare over the course of an entire season for a reason, did you ever notice those ads placed in Fridays edition of the USA Today newspaper by scamdicappers claiming winning percentages of 80% or 85% or 90%?\nEver see those claims of \u0093Can\u0092t lose\u0094, or \u0093Sure lock winner\u0094, or \u0093Game of the year\u0094? Heck, if you get up early enough on Saturday or Sunday morning you can even catch a scamdicapper show or two on TV with some of the very same individuals whose ads were in the previous Fridays USA Today newspaper.\nAds such as the ones described above are designed to sucker in the poor souls who in all likelihood have dug holes for themselves and are panicking, in a lot of cases these panicked losers will do or pay anything for a \u0093Can\u0092t lose\u0094, or \u0093Sure lock winner\u0094, or \u0093Game of the year\u0094, I would even venture a guess that this sort of desperate gambler knows in their heart that those claims of 80% or 85% or 90% winners are bogus.\nSo how did this desperate gambler get into his or her situation to begin with? It happens season in and season out because of a failure to start with a dedicated starting bankroll that is used solely for sports wagering which negates the need to use monies ear marked for the mortgage or car payment.\nA dedicated starting bankroll and a firm understanding of money management is a must if anyone wants to survive the peaks and valleys and ups and downs of the season long marathon that is involved with sports wagering.\nI will get into the different aspects surrounding money management and other topics in another article, but for now remember the key points brought out in this article, the importance of doing your homework, understanding that the line or odds placed on a contest is meant to garner \u0093equal action\u0094 which means that Joe Public is the reason for line movement which of course amplifies the importance of shopping for the best available line thru multiple \u0093outs\u0094 while keeping an eye open for middling possibilities.\nWe are now an amazing and eye opening 9-3 ATS over the past TWELVE years with our Super Bowl selection!!

You had a group of universities within a bus ride of one another, and they played each other in football, baseball, basketball, and other sports. At the major university level, you had a dozen or so conferences, each with no more than 10 teams, and every team played every other team in football every year, and typically each pair of teams played home-and-home series in basketball and baseball. You had the Pac 8, Big 8, WAC, SWC, SEC, Big 10, ACC, Missouri Valley, and the Ivy League, plus a long list of independents like Notre Dame, Miami, Penn State, Pittsburgh, Florida State, and Tulane. There was a second tier of conferences like Southland, Big Sky, PCAA, Yankee, and MAC. Things were fairly stable for a long time.\nThen in 1978 the two big Arizona schools split off to make the Pac 8 the Pac 10. Football independents formed basketball leagues to gain automatic berths in the ever-expanding March Madness tournament, and some of those basketball leagues added football later on. Title 9 encouraged schools to drop some of their men's teams -- e.g., Wichita State dropped football, Tulsa dropped baseball -- leading to a decline of conference cohesion. The SEC picked up South Carolina and Arkansas and split into two divisions, leading a few years later to the demise of the SWC, the creation of the Big 12, the expansion of the WAC to ridiculous extremes, and a period of great upheaval involving conferences with no strong traditions or geographic roots. I've lost track.\nThere's hand-wringing to our north: The Kansas City Star devoted its front-page Sunday headline story to the impact of the end of the Big 12 on their market area , accompanied by an image of tattered school flags for Mizzou, KU, and K-State in front of ominous storm clouds.\nWell, we still have barbecue.\nOur regional universities still boast impressive trophy cases. Memories of impressive tournament failures. Tickets so hot they spawn federal investigations. And researchers who can tell you the best way to mend a heart, grow some corn or plant a wind turbine.\nKansas City remains home to a pair of not-so-major-league sports franchises, affordable housing, a pared-down cell phone company, those oversize badminton thingies, a school district boldly lopped in half, a proud history of a musical genre few people listen to anymore and a funky, thriving arts district.\nAll is not lost.\nBut something is lost.\nLast week's attack on the Big 12 could toss our loyalties and rivalries to the winds. At best it leaves the Kansas, Kansas State and Missouri campuses as well as Kansas City at the center of something lesser. Now the region is a hub of schools left behind by more sought-after universities tempted to hang with a cooler, better-heeled crowd.\nThere's at least one sensible voice in the story:\nFor some, in fact, college sports weren't worth building around in the first place.\n\"What's lost has already been corrupted,\" said Crosby Kemper III, director of the Kansas City Public Library and a member of this former cowtown's most prominent families. \"We need to stop looking at the Big Eight, the Big Ten, the Big 12 and NCAA as things that bring prestige and make us a better community. They don't.\"\nMaybe Kansas City could build a new downtown arena or an entertainment district to recover its municipal pride.... Oh, well.\nThe Sprint Center will be able to fill its dates with other entertainment, Schulte said, but they wouldn't offer the day-long and weekend-long events that entice crowds into KC Live in the Power & Light district.\n\"We need more people and more activity,\" he said.\nAny dip in activity at the Power & Light district could further nick taxpayers. City Hall must pay for any fall off in the downtown entertainment district's performance.\nEven before the Big 12 started to dissolve, the Power & Light district fell short of revenue projections. That meant the city has had to dip into its general fund to pay the debt on bonds sold to build the district. This year that subsidy might grow to $11.4 million.\n\"We've spent a lot of taxpayer money to build up a downtown area,\" said Stretch, an artist, restaurant owner and Tax Increment Financing Commission member. \"Our taxes don't stop coming, and our bills keep coming.\"\nA story in Saturday's edition focuses on the unseemly concern and impotence of Kansas and Missouri politicians about the situation .\nAs long as every conference is becoming unmoored from its historical roots, as long as TV revenues are driving realignment, why not toss everything and embrace a system that adds drama and dynamism to college sports: The English football system of relegation and promotion.\nEnglish football is organized like a pyramid topped by a tower. There are five nationwide leagues in five levels at the top. If you finish near the top of your league, you're promoted to the next highest level for the following season. Finish near the bottom, and you're relegated to the next league down. Below the fifth level, the leagues begin to divide geographically, with more locally-focused leagues at a given level the closer to the base you go. (Here's a graphic of the English football pyramid .)\nIn addition to league play, there's a 14-round, single-elimination tournament called the FA Cup that stretches out from mid-August to mid-May. Any team belonging to the Football Association can enter; members of higher-level leagues get byes to later rounds . Matches are assigned at random for each round, and rounds are spaced about two or three weeks apart. Theoretically, the humblest county league club has a shot at playing in Wembley in the Cup Final. Last year, 762 teams entered the competition . (Imagine an NCAA basketball tournament that included every member of the NCAA.) A smaller tournament, the Carling Cup , involves only the 92 teams in the top four levels of the pyramid.\nIn 2009-2010, Arsenal , which won the Premier League, played 38 Premier League matches (home and home against the other 19 teams), plus 17 matches in three tournaments: UEFA Champions League, Carling Cup, and FA Cup. That's 55 matches in about 40 weeks. Surely, American college football teams can play 30 games over the course of a school year, particularly if players are relieved of the requirement to attend class.\nSo here's my proposal. Put the top 16 football teams in the US in the 1st Division. The next 16 go into the 2nd Division, and so on down for the top 64 schools. The top four divisions would all be nationwide. Each team plays each other team in their division. The next level would involve four regional conferences of 14 teams each. That covers the 120 schools of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A). At the end of each season, the top and bottom four teams would be promoted or relegated. League games would happen every other Saturday. You could add the I-AA teams into the promotion/relegation system, too, playing in regional leagues organized in a couple of tiers.\nInterwoven with league play, you'd have the American College Football Cup. For safety reasons, it should probably be limited to I-A and I-AA teams (about another 120 teams.) You could manage that with an eight-round tournament, but if you give byes to the higher level teams, it might take 11 rounds. So a lower-level team going all the way through the tourney could play a couple dozen games in a nine-month season. A higher level team could add as many as six games to its 15 regular season matches.\nYou could use the same structure for other sports, with no necessary connection between leagues in one sport with leagues in another. Kansas might be in the 1st Division in basketball and in one of the regional leagues in football.\nAt the top levels, the relationship between school and team would be one of licensing. The team would be entitled to use the school's colors, logo, mascots, and facilities, and the players would be entitled to take courses, should they wish, in exchange for massive fees from the team to the school. The teams would be expected to pay a salary to the players from their revenues.\nIn this system, no league gets stuck with a perennial laughingstock, mediocrity in one sport isn't a hindrance to excellence in another, no laughingstock is forever stuck in a league where they can't succeed, and, in true American spirit, there are no barriers to how high a team can rise. With teams moving up and down every year, there's more trivia to memorize and more opportunities for merchandising.\nOTHER SPORTS: In a column from a couple of weeks ago, Bill Haisten wonders why the Tulsa Shock isn't playing at UMAC instead of the massively oversized BOK Center:\nIt doesn't make sense to air-condition, illuminate and staff a 17,839-seat BOK Center when the entire upper deck is unused (and shrouded by black curtains). But the WNBA insists on conducting its contests within super-sized arenas.\nThat column was linked by this blogger, Mister Women's Sports, who says the WNBA should look to another women's league as an example :\nI have said in the past that the WNBA would be wise to CASE* Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). And while it would be wonderful to have all of the WPS teams playing in soccer-specific stadia (like Pizza Hut Park, hem hem), the league is aware that it has to grow into larger venues rather than book a barn and pay lots of overhead for wasted space. (* Copy and Steal Everything)\nHe goes on to explain why, given a choice between the San Antonio team and the Tulsa Shock, he'll go south to see a game:\nIf I spent say, $30 on a single ticket in San Antonio, I'd be very close to courtside under one of the baskets. If I spent that same amount in Tulsa, I'd have \"goal line\" seats if the BOK Center hosted indoor football. Which in so many words means that my concerns about the seating chart on paper were confirmed when I saw the interior of the BOK Center on national TV last night and saw how horrible the sight lines were in the $30-ish seats. No thanks. I want to see the stars of the WNBA, not the rear of the backboard all night.\nAND MORE ON REALIGNMENT:\nMad Okie comments :\nSo if it's all about the money, its time to stop the legal slavery, and pay the student athletes for the services they perform, for without the student athletes, there would be no revenues for these money hungry schools to be fighting over.\nAt this point Nebraska is poised to make 10 million more in their move... will the Nebraska taxpayers see a cut in their taxes going towards higher education?\nCategories\n"}, {"score": 981.09625, "uuid": "3650f0c8-938d-5c25-b19d-7791eab1e660", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0102wb-22-32976", "target_hostname": "www.basketballforum.com", "target_uri": "http://www.basketballforum.com/index.php", "page_rank": 2.0146695e-08, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Basketball</em> Forum : Professional and College <em>Basketball</em> Forums", "snippet": "Who <em>is</em> the <em>better</em> player? <em>Why</em>?
