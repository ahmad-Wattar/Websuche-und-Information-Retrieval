You Decide.\nBy Chad Derdowski September 17, 2009\nSuperman vs. Hulk: Who Would Win in a Fight\n\u00a9 Bob Trate\nBruce Banner, on the run from the law and undercover, eventually makes his way to Metropolis.\u00a0Working as a medic at a homeless shelter, he runs into trouble when Lex Luthor decides to demolish the shelter to make way for a LexCorp subsidiary or secret laboratory of some sort.\u00a0It doesn\u2019t really matter; the bottom line is that Luthor won\u2019t like Dr. Banner when he\u2019s angry.\u00a0Gamma-powered blood begins to flow, pulse pounds and heart rate increases\u2026 next thing you know, we\u2019ve got an eight-foot, 1,400 lb rampaging behemoth tearing up Metropolis.\u00a0Looks like a job for Superman!\nThe Tale of the Tape\nSuperman\u2019s Strengths (or Why Kal-El could KO Hulk)\nWell, Superman sort of has a reputation for being the most powerful being on the planet earth.\u00a0Not only that, he\u2019s smart\u2013not smarter than Dr. Bruce Banner, but definitely smarter than the Hulk.\u00a0If Superman is going to win this battle, he\u2019s going to have to rely on brains over brawn, which shouldn\u2019t be too hard, considering the Hulk\u2019s intelligence level is on par with the average 5-year old.\nWhile the Hulk is just a big, strong monster, Superman is faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive.\u00a0Even a nuclear explosion can\u2019t put him down for the count, so he could definitely go toe-to-toe with the Hulk and give ol\u2019 jade jaws a run for his money.\u00a0But wait, there\u2019s more!\u00a0Superman possesses a smorgasbord of abilities far beyond those of mortal men.\u00a0He could use his super breath to freeze the Hulk.\u00a0He could bore a hole into the earth at super speed and bury the Hulk in it.\u00a0He could use his microscopic vision to\u2026 OK; maybe that one wouldn\u2019t be of much use.\nHulk\u2019s Strengths (or Why Hulk Could Knock Supes for a Loop)\nThe Incredible Hulk definitely lives up to his name.\u00a0His level of strength, endurance and healing ability is determined by his emotional state.\u00a0Or to put it more simply, the madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\u00a0When the Hulk goes on a rampage, the best we can hope for is that he eventually gets bored and leaves.\u00a0He has withstood temperatures equivalent of those found in the sun\u2019s core, been hit with a nuclear bomb and survived planet-splitting impacts.\u00a0Heck, he\u2019s gone 12 rounds with the God of Thunder and was barely breathing heavy.\u00a0He took on the entire Marvel Universe a couple of years ago in a story entitled \u201cWorld War Hulk.\u201d\nAnd you think a little solar-powered Kryptonian is gonna be able to beat him?\nThe Weaknesses\nAs far as weaknesses go, the Hulk has really only got one, but it\u2019s a doozy: He\u2019s as dumb as a box of rocks.\u00a0If you can figure out a way to outthink the Hulk, you might be able to beat him.\nSuperman\u2019s got a few weaknesses, but since the Hulk isn\u2019t magical and he\u2019s not likely carrying a chunk of Kryptonite in those ripped-up purple pants, there\u2019s really only one flaw left for him to exploit: Superman\u2019s heart.\u00a0Superman might possess enough power to actually kill the Hulk, but would he do it?\u00a0Unlikely.\u00a0Add to that the distraction of saving the lives of innocents caught in the midst of the battle and Superman is gonna have his hands full.\u00a0It might be just enough to give the Hulk the upper hand.\nHistorical Matchups\nPerhaps the best way to compare these two combatants is to take a look at some of the more notable bouts they\u2019ve had in the past.\u00a0By taking a look at the caliber of their old rivals and their win/loss records, we can better determine who will come out on top.\nThe Last Son of Krypton has had his share of notable enemies, among them:\nBizarro\u2013an imperfect clone of the Man of Steel.\u00a0He\u2019s all the brawn with half the brains.\u00a0Superman has handed Bizarro his ass on many occasions.\nGeneral Zoda Kryptonian villain who possesses all of Superman\u2019s powers but none of his morals.\u00a0The Son of Jor-El has narrowly defeated this villain by trapping him in the Phantom Zone.\u00a0It\u2019s sort of like the superhero equivalent of hitting a guy with a loaded glove.\nDoomsday\u2013a genetically modified Kryptonian engine of destruction, Doomday is a lot like Clubber Lang in Rocky III, or more appropriately, Ivan Drago in Rocky IV.\u00a0He\u2019s not only defeated Superman, he killed him!\nThe Incredible Hulk has fought a number of heavy-hitting bruisers as well\u2026\nAbomination\u2013sort of the Bizarro-Hulk, Abomination has gamma-powered muscles and a scientists\u2019 brain.\u00a0He\u2019s one of the few folks who has actually managed to KO the Hulk!\nAbsorbing Man\u2013Crusher Creel possesses the ability to take on the characteristics of whatever he touches: steel, rock, etc.\u00a0He\u2019s turned into stone and been smashed to pieces by the Hulk more times than we can count.\nThe Leader\u2013gamma radiation gave this guy a big ol\u2019 brain instead of muscles.\u00a0Despite his impressive intellect, he\u2019s never been able to get the Hulk down for the count, proving that sometimes might does make right!\nThe Outcome\nSo who wins?\u00a0The way we see it, it goes down like this\u2026\nAfter doing a number on Metropolis and laying waste to the Science Police and a few minor heroes, the Hulk finally comes face-to-face with the toughest battle of his life: Superman.\u00a0The two lock horns and create massive amounts of property damage.\u00a0No matter how hard Hulk hits Supes, the Big Blue Boy Scout just won\u2019t stay down, a fact that only serves to further enrage the Hulk.\u00a0The adrenaline starts flowing and the Hulk \u201cHulks out,\u201d to use a popular phrase.\nHulk could care less about the puny humans who get in his way but Superman is determined to make sure there will be no collateral damage in this fight.\u00a0This distraction allows the Hulk to get in a few cheap shots, weakening the Man of Steel.\u00a0Just as it\u2019s looking like we\u2019re going to see another Doomsday scenario, Kal-El whisks the Hulk off to the Arctic Circle where the only ones in danger are a few penguins and a polar bear.\nThe battle rages on but before it\u2019s too late, Superman manages to get inside the Fortress of Solitude and nail the Hulk with the Phantom Zone projector, sending the gamma-spawned behemoth to that netherworld between worlds.\u00a0It\u2019s a victory for the Man of Steel, but in the process, Hulk laid waste to Metropolis and trashed the Fortress of Solitude, destroying many of Superman\u2019s personal items, historical Kryptonian artifacts and his prized stamp collection.\nCOMICS REVIEWS\n"}, {"score": 921.5322, "uuid":

They made it a keypoint to bring up the old tv show when talking about the creating process.\nBig addition to the Hulk from Norton's rewrite....He says character Leonard \"Doc\" Samson would be in the movie, and that they were actually going to mention other Marvel superheroes (by name) in the movie. It looks like Norton wants the different franchises to be linked better than they have been in recent years.\nNorton said: \"I came into this and wrote the screenplay. I was a Marvel kid. I had subscriptions to a lot of Marvel comics. I loved the early incarnation of the Hulk and then the television show, and then in later years, where they took it in the Bruce Jones Return of the Monster series. I always felt like it was like one of those great contemporary myths. Comes right out of the tradition of Greek mythology, notion of suppression of your inner demon. Initial idea of starting from scratch and reconceiving the story as a mythic saga was really appealing to me and I liked the idea of the lonely fugitive aspect of it.\"\nKevin Feige (President of Marvel Studios) made it\u00a0 a point to say this was a new beginning of the Hulk saga. This would confirm reports of the previous Hulk (2003) not being part of\u00a0 the series in their mindsets going into the production.\nThere was no footage shown of the film itself for obvious reasons. Filming began only 2 weeks ago in Toronto.\nLook for \"easter eggs\" in terms of the original tv Hulk, Bill Bixby.\nProducer Gale Hurd made it a point to say we won't be getting a Hulk shaping in 3 different sizes.\n\"We have a Hulk who's not going to be three different sizes in this movie.

It\u2019s actually a good example of what I think the \u201cAll-Star\u201d premise was intended for: A couple of big-name creators given the time and leeway to produce the best story featuring the character that they could. The book wasn\u2019t monthly, but it shipped regularly, and fans looked forward to it. (By contrast, All-Star Batman seems to have received more bad critical attention than good, and I think it\u2019s still not done, even though it started before Superman. I skipped it, since I see writer Frank Miller as little more than self-parody, these days.)\nWhat did I think about it? Well, I thought it was very good, and occasionally excellent. I think it\u2019s hands-down the best thing Grant Morrison has done over the last two years (though admittedly I think you have to go back to JLA to find his last really solid series). It uses (essentially) the pre-Crisis Superman, a figure of almost godlike power but deep connection and empathy with mankind, and explores the nooks and crannies of his friendships and backdrop, without getting wrapped up in continuity or going overboard with too many characters.\nThe story\u2019s structure is based around the twelve labors of Hercules (although I don\u2019t think the tasks in each issue correspond even loosely to those of Hercules), with the detail that in the first issue Lex Luthor manages to overwhelm Superman\u2019s cells with a blast of energy from the sun, giving him additional powers but also dooming him to death within one year.\nThere are several excellent issues in the series, especially issue #5 in which Clark Kent interviews Lex Luthor in prison. (To be fair, this issue has a pretty bad pun near the end, which may be biased me in favor of it.) I also particularly liked #2, with Lois staying at the Fortress and seeing some of its wonders. On the other hand, stretching the Bizarro world story out to two parts (#7-8) felt like pushing it. Issue #9 with the two other survivors of Krypton seemed routine. And issue #10 features a number of running themes of the series, but also feels disjointed and like little more than a lead-in to the two-part conclusion.\nThis last issue is something of a mixed bag. The final confrontation with Luthor is quite good, but the scenes where Superman returns from the brink of death didn\u2019t really make any sense. Morrison\u2019s hallucinatory sequences tend to be among the least effective moments in his writing. He\u2019s much stronger when he stays grounded in the concrete elements of the story. Consequently, the issue\u2019s denouement has a weak moment \u2013 in which Superman goes off to \u201cfix\u201d the sun, with a Morrisonian flourish in which he\u2019s building it a new heart, a concept which sounds good in words but seems ridiculous when illustrated \u2013 and a strong moment, when the scientist Leo Quintum answers the question of what the world would do if Superman didn\u2019t come back. (Thus the series ends with one of its strongest visual images.)\nI\u2019m always conflicted when I see Frank Quitely\u2019s artwork. In many ways it\u2019s similar to that of Gary Frank: Both artists give a real sense of form and substance to their figures, but both artists tend to be weak on backgrounds, in that the backgrounds are often absent so they feel rather distracting when they\u2019re present in a panel. Their characters also often have the same facial tics, which often works for Frank but which I find a minus for Quitely because his characters\u2019 grimaces often make them look grotesque, even inhuman. Quitely\u2019s female figures have this squashed look to their faces, and their bodies look weirdly deformed \u2013 and it\u2019s consistent across the women, so it looks really weird. The best art I\u2019ve seen from Quitely was in JLA: Earth 2 ; it seems like his style has been getting quirkier ever since then, and not, to my mind, for the better.\nOverall, a good series. Not as strong as Alan Moore\u2019s \u201cWhatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\u201d , to which it has some similarities, although to be fair that\u2019s a ludicrously high standard to hold any Superman tale to.\nI had originally thought that John Byrne\u2019s Assignment: Earth series was going to be 12 issues, with a loosely-connected overall story arc similar to that from Byrne & Roger Stern\u2019s Marvel: The Lost Generation . I\u2019m not sure why I thought that, since apparently it was always planned as a 5-issue series .\nIt ended up being 5 basically standalone stories, each one taking place a year later than the previous one. Unfortunately, all of the stories are fairly routine, the leap in time is never large enough to make much of a difference, and we never learn anything really deep about Gary Seven or Roberta. So it ends up being something of a shrug of a series. I think my favorite bit is actually the \u201cback-up\u201d story in this last issue, featuring Roberta and Isis; the lead story involves a double of Richard Nixon (as you can tell from the cover), and pales by comparison despite its longer length.\nBill Willingham is probably best known in comics today as the writer of Fables, the DC/Vertigo book about legendary fantastic characters exiled to our world. And it\u2019s a well-deserved reknown, since Fables is an excellent comic that I\u2019ve been enjoying from the beginning. Back in the 1990s he was a lot less well-known, though; I mainly knew him from his 1980s series The Elementals, and his short-lived series Coventry. Somehow I stumbled upon issue #4 of Pantheon, a series Willingham was writing for Lone Star Press, and I was impressed enough to order the earlier issues and follow it through to its conclusion (it ran for 13 issues , with a few side stories along the way). Now the first half has been collected in paperback \u2013 and in color, as the original series was in B&W \u2013 with some extra material. The second volume is planned to come out next year.\nPantheon has a high concept premise: It\u2019s another \u201clast superhero story\u201d, which is the same high concept as Watchmen, and which came into vogue later through (for instance) Marvel\u2019s \u201cThe End\u201d series of stories about its characters. In that way, it\u2019s not very original, although that doesn\u2019t really diminish the concept: Not only do readers enjoy reading the end of a story, but reading about the end of an era also has its own special charm (it\u2019s the reason I regard The Lord of the Rings as a great story \u2013 the end of an era of wonders pervades every chapter of the book). And while Watchmen is about a particularly quirky world with an unusual assortment of heroes, Pantheon is about (essentially) any DC/Marvel-style superhero universe, with specific characters standing in for the trademarked ones. So we have the Freedom Machine standing in for the Justice League and Avengers, with Dynasty and Blackheart standing in for Superman and Batman, and various clear analogues throughout the rest of the roster.\nWhat makes the series work \u2013 and what, frankly, is Willingham\u2019s true strength as a writer \u2013 is that all of these characters are their own figures, they\u2019re not merely pale shadows of the more famous ones. Dynasty is a woman, and her powers are somewhat tied to that fact. Blackheart is as obsessed as Batman, but he has his own particular quirks. Willingham takes ideals and creates new and memorable concrete characters out of them. You\u2019d think every writer could do this, but somehow Willingham does it better than almost everyone else. I think this is part of why Fables works, too: Willingham tends to the details, and is able to bring them out to the point that they affect the big picture, too. (I think the evolution of Prince Charming is a good example of this.)\nThe premise of the story is that the heroes have defeated all of the major villains in the world, having either imprisoned, exiled or killed them. But what do the heroes do once their work is done? They split into two factions, one (led by Dynasty) which believes in staying ready but otherwise staying the course as defenders of humanity, and another (led by the telekinetic Daedalus) who thinks that superheroes should take over the world and guide it into a new golden age. Daedalus is cold and calculating, and believes that anyone not with him is against him (or might be), and takes terrible measures to prevent any aid from coming to his foes. He also releases four of the worst villains the Freedom Machine has imprisoned to keep them busy while he schemes. Most chilling is a flashback \u2013 which obviously is important since it spans two issues of the series, but it\u2019s not immediately evident how \u2013 in which all the heroes gathered together in the 80s to fight a terrifying teenaged villain named Deathboy. This sets the tone for the series as being brutal in resolving the characters\u2019 fates in high-pressure situations, although it never falls to the level of raw gore; it\u2019s still rooted in the style of traditional superheroes.\nFor me, Pantheon had a \u201ccan\u2019t-look-away\u201d feel to it, with imaginative characters and scenarios which made me what to see how they turned out. Without giving too much away, the story completes its arc as intended, although I found it just a little bit disappointing for not going farther than it did, although with some bits left deliberately dangling at the end and left to the reader\u2019s imagination. While I\u2019d say Pantheon didn\u2019t quite live up to its promise, it\u2019s still a really good story and a must-read if you enjoy this sort of story, or just enjoy superhero stories with an unusual degree of imagination in them.\nThe art is by Mike Leeke and Bill Williams (Williams being the publisher of Lone Star), with the occasional artist doing a few pages, presumably when Leeke couldn\u2019t keep up. Leeke has an interesting style, reminiscent of Steve Woron\u2019s (although without the \u201cgood girl art\u201d content), with a good sense of form, design, and expression, yet with some rough edges: Sometimes a head is too small, or a pose looks a little off. But overall he fits the series very well. And if you\u2019ve wondered why I sometimes carp on artists who give backgrounds the short shrift, Leeke\u2019s a good example of why: He draws detailed and solid backgrounds which provide a strong sense of setting. Even in a sequence in the Grand Canyon he puts plenty of rock formations in the background rather than just drawing shots of people standing on (or flying above) the ground. Although it looks like he did some work for Comico and Valiant (both now defunct companies), I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen his work anywhere since Pantheon, which is a shame.\n(The covers to the issues of the series were really cool, too. Colorful and eye-catching.)\nIt\u2019s rare for a small press to produce a mainstream superhero book which stacks up against the big guys \u2013 even the larger independent companies often have trouble pulling that off \u2013 but Pantheon hits the mark while being different and imaginative. It might not be for everyone, and some people might find it not different enough, but for most people, if you\u2019re a fan of superhero comics, this one is well worth searching out (or even buying from the publisher !).\n"}, {"score": 909.977, "uuid": "854dd8de-714c-5c34-81f5-ce02698521a0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0405wb-15-15416", "target_hostname": "www.factpile.com", "target_uri": "http://www.factpile.com/5277-arthur-peter-sylar-vs-superman/", "page_rank": 1.2253255e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "\u00bb Arthur, Peter, &amp; Sylar Vs <em>Superman</em> \u00bb FactPile", "snippet": "So how about a Kryptonite vulnerable <em>superman</em> <em>who</em> <em>is</em> forced to wear a kryptonite necklace the entire battle.

That will probably translate to $55 million for the three-day, which is much stronger than Universal had been hoping for. One source told me that \"mid-40s and long legs\" would be a triumph. If this number holds, The Incredible Hulk will be the all-time 11th-best opening for a comic book adaptation:\nALL-TIME TOP 20 OPENINGS FOR COMIC BOOK ADAPTATIONS\n1.

It is also the all-time best opening for Edward Norton and director Louis Leterrier.\nKung Fu Panda, the latest animated film from Dreamworks, was predictably strong, grabbing $15 million on Saturday, and the Paramount release should post a $35.5 million second weekend.\nUndoubtedly the biggest surprise of the weekend has been The Happening (20th Century Fox). Studio execs all over town were calling for an opening in the high teens. Instead, I am told that the M. Night Shyamalan thriller may have scored another $11.5 million on Saturday, and it should finish the weekend with about $32 million, far higher than competing studios were predicting. It appears as though The Happening will post the all-time third-best Shyamalan opening.\nEXCLUSIVE FANTASY MOGULS EARLY SATURDAY ESTIMATES\n1.

Davies\u2019 run, the Doctor made several references to his inability to live a normal life, and how that made him feel sad.\u00a0 But here, we get a Doctor that is not so bogged down in his feelings of isolation, like a little kid standing outside your window in the snow, eternally outside looking in.\u00a0 None of that, just a good Doctor having fun and kicking butt at being normal.\nThis was probably Matt Smith\u2019s finest performance since episode 1.\u00a0 All season long, I\u2019ve regretted that Smith just hasn\u2019t seemed as daffy or assertive as I generally like my Doctors to be.\u00a0 I like my Doctors to say ridiculous, off the wall stuff that makes perfect sense in retrospect, and I like to see them charging around, getting stuff done.\u00a0 But Smith has generally been a more passive Doctor.\u00a0 Perhaps the absence of Amy helps.\u00a0 Maybe she manages to overshadow the Doctor in some way, with her forceful personality.\nWhatever the case, this was a much stronger performance than I\u2019ve come to expect.\u00a0 I knew that Smith had that zany wackiness inside him this whole time.\u00a0 Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s bugged me that he\u2019s been so average the whole year.\nThe idea of a busted ship acting as the villain is something we\u2019ve seen before, but it came as a bit of a surprise this time.\u00a0 As did the all-too familiar design of the console room.\u00a0 Hopefully we\u2019ll learn more about it later.\nThis episode did a marvelous job of making the Doctor seem strange and alien again, while at the same time cementing his actions in real world scenarios such as taking a shower and going to work.\u00a0 A really great Doctor-heavy episode.\u00a0 Just what we needed.\nVisit our Doctor Who section for more articles & reviews \u2013 CLICK HERE\nA COMIC BOOK BLOG RATING\nPros\nVery Doctor-Heavy, with a great performance by Smith\nThe Doctor gives his secrets away a little too easily\nRating\n"}, {"score": 517.01276, "uuid": "29983617-6c7d-5430-84a7-9ac64b6a32f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1414wb-92-10819", "target_hostname": "acomicbookblog.com", "target_uri": "http://acomicbookblog.com/tag/doctor-who/", "page_rank": 1.1865394e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Doctor <em>Who</em> - A COMIC BOOK BLOG", "snippet": "She and Smith seem to have genuine chemistry, and I\u2019m glad that if the Doctor HAD to have a wife <em>or</em> something similar, it\u2019s a woman who\u2019s as suitably larger-than-life as he <em>is</em>.

", "explanation": null, "document": "2 comments\n\u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d\nWith Amy and Rory trapped on a spaceship that\u2019s about to crash onto a colonized world, the Doctor must convince the rich old miser who controls the planet\u2019s artificial cloud-system to help him or his friends will die.\u00a0 Aided by a beautiful woman frozen in suspended animation, and a giant flying shark, the Doctor will bring together past, present and future just in time to save Christmas.\nThe story\u2019s title draws an obvious comparison to the Dickens tale, about three spirits visiting Ebeneezer Scrooge and teaching him the meaning of Christmas and humanity while showing him various eras of his own life.\nLuckily, the episode itself only borrows the initial premise, while thankfully staying away from a straight sci-fi adaption.\nUnlike previous Christmas specials, which usually revolve around the Doctor\u2019s sense of loneliness and isolation, this one features his two constant companions, Amy and Rory (who is now listed in the opening credits, good for him).\u00a0 The Doctor\u2019s whole motivation in the story is to rescue the pair.\u00a0 This gives the Doctor free-range to try and help someone else deal with their inner turmoil, which is a much more enjoyably heroic trait.\nMatt Smith\u2019s Doctor feels a little more defined here than he did last season.\u00a0 I think writer and actor have a better idea of where they want to take the Eleventh Doctor this time around, with Smith exhibiting an actual personality to go along with all his quirky traits.\u00a0 Also, it helps that Amy isn\u2019t around to overshadow him.\nI thought Smith was a bit thin at times last season, in comparison with some of the past Doctors.\u00a0 But here, he is in full swing, ranging from geeky nerd to suave party-goer (My new favorite Doctor-quote is \u201cMarilyn, get your coat!\u201d).\u00a0 I hope this Doctor is the one we see return for Season 6.\nAs with a lot of Steven Moffat\u2019s stories, this one revolves around children, with the kind of fairy tale feeling you get from something like Peter Pan.\u00a0 The character of Kazran, in his pajamas, running around with the Doctor, brings to mind \u201cThe Girl in the Fireplace\u201d and \u201cThe Eleventh Hour.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen this kind of story done before, with the Doctor traveling along someone\u2019s history.\u00a0 But to be fair, this one does have a different slant on it.\u00a0 Here the Doctor is deliberately trying to alter someone\u2019s life, which calls to mind Steven Moffat\u2019s own short story \u201cContinuity Errors.\u201d\nKazran, the rich old miser, played by Michael Gambon (Dumbledore II from Harry Potter) was a suitably cranky character, but the kind you love to hate.\u00a0 He got so many great lines in the episode, and the opening scene with him was hilarious.\u00a0 And the character of Abygail was just as enchanting and lovable as you\u2019d want her to be.\nRemarkably, the episode is able to take all the different characters, and give them equal importance and time, without overshadowing anyone.\u00a0 Amy and Rory don\u2019t have a lot to do, but that\u2019s fair, since we just saw a bunch of them, and we are about to see a lot more.\nThe story of Kazran is an interesting one.\u00a0 As I said above, Steven Moffat wrote a short Doctor Who story way back in the 90\u2032s called \u201cContinuity Errors\u201d (set in the planet-sized Library from \u201cSilence in the Library) about the Doctor coming up against a bitter librarian who refuses to lend him an important book.\u00a0 Just like this story, the Doctor goes back and changes bits of her history to make her a nicer person.\u00a0 But here, things are a little tougher, as Kazran says in one of the best exchanges, \u201cTime can be rewritten\u2026 People can\u2019t.\u201d\nAll the various Kazran\u2019s did a great job, especially considering that he is essentially the villain of the story.\u00a0 You come to understand and feel for him.\nAbygail\u2019s character is just as engaging, if a little less defined.\u00a0 She\u2019s more of a plot device than a character.\u00a0 But in the end, it works out.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to deal with the fallout of the situation.\u00a0 At times, Doctor Who has focused a little too much on the sadness of a situation.\u00a0 But here, we get the opposing argument, that sadness and happiness go hand in hand.\u00a0 You can\u2019t have one without the other.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s a hallmark of Moffat\u2019s stories, and of his series so far.\nKazran and Abygail\u2019s story was bittersweet, but perfect for both Christmas and Doctor Who.

He is slightly stronger than his appearance would suggest, has greater stamina and better than average agility. His senses are also slightly keener than a humans, and he is capable of noticing ripples in the patterns of time. He is capable of surviving without oxygen for short periods of time, and can even survive unprotected in the vacuum of space for several minutes. Among the more obvious physical differences between his body and that of a human is that he has two hearts. He is capable of healing most wounds given time, even regrowing severed appendages on occasion (although this can take weeks). If he suffers an injury so severe that he cannot survive then he is able to completely regenerate his body, taking on a entirely new form (based on examples of other Time Lords seen regenerating, even decapitation might not be fatal; severe injury to both hearts, however, would be). Doing so causes near fatal mental strain, and as a result he generally suffers a period of mental instability thereafter, which in the past has manifested as amnesia, mood swings, and even full blown psychotic episodes; in the end his mind settles down again, but in every instance his personality is altered by the experience. Perhaps due to the strain this imposes, Time Lords can only regenerate twelve times, allowing them a total of thirteen bodies. During the first 15 hours after a regeneration, a Time Lord possesses enough residual regenerative energy to regrow lost limbs in seconds if they are severed; conversely, the severed appendage also retains some residual life, and can continue moving to some degree for at least a year afterwards.\nThe Doctor is moderately telepathic, another of his species' gifts. He cannot read minds, but is capable of communicating with other telepathic beings. Boosted by his TARDIS, this telepathy is able to act as an instant translator of virtually all spoken or written languages, a gift which is extended to those who travel with him; it is so effective that those using the gift are generally not even conscious of the fact that they shouldn't be able to understand the alien tongues they are listening to. Time Lords can recognise one another by their telepathic signature even when they have changed their appearances, unless one of them is deliberately masking who they are.\nThe Doctor's greatest ability is his intellect. He is vastly more intelligent than any human, with extensive knowledge of most sciences, and an extremely quick and adaptive mind. He is resistant to forms of mental coercion such as hypnosis, brainwashing, mind control or mind probes. Trips into his mindscape has shown that each of his earlier persona's still survives there, acting as keepers of their portions of his memories and aspects of his personality (the fifth incarnation is generally seen as the conscience of the later Doctors, for example). Future personalities have also seen to form in this mindscape, in preparation for impending regeneration - for example the Doctor's seventh persona is widely believed to have deliberately usurped the body and forced a regeneration after his sixth body suffered a minor head injury. Combined with their telepathic ability, some Time Lords can give these future forms a level of physical presence in the real world separate from their main body; the Doctor himself has demonstrated this ability on two occasions, once when he subconsciously created a poorly defined \"Watcher\" entity just prior to his fourth regeneration, and once when a distilled composite of all his evil and less noble traits broke loose and became the being known as the Valeyard. All incarnations of the Doctor have been seen to be skilled hypnotists too, and most have displayed a talent for disguise and mimicry.\nThe Doctor is a brilliant engineer, well known for his ability to build a device for any circumstances he encounters. If what he needs is not to hand he often jury-rigs temporary equipment to combat the evils he comes across. His most common tool (other than his TARDIS) is the sonic screwdriver, which can be adapted to a number of uses, most commonly to open locked doors of all varieties. It has also been seen to remotely detonate mines and swamp gas, to repel creatures with sensitive hearing, and even to\u00a0remove screws. The Doctor stores a variety of useful objects in his pockets, which he has finally admitted have an extra dimension sewn into them, making them much bigger on the inside.\nEach version of the Doctor has certain abilities and skills peculiar only to that regeneration. The third was a master of unarmed combat, in particular Venusian Aikido, a talent he achieved without any training. The seventh could disrupt the brain's electrons with a touch, allowing him to render people unconscious. The eighth has the ability to read the patterns of time, allowing him to pull out hints about a person's past or future from their timeline.\nWhile the Doctor normally disdains physical violence, he has shown himself in the past to be a skilled swordsman (at least from his fourth incarnation on), having been trained by one of Cleopatra's guards. He is an expert with a crossbow (trained with William Tell), and even his first, elderly form was an able fighter, having learned wrestling from the Mountain Mauler of Montana.\nHistory: (TV series and novels) - When the universe was in it's infancy, one of the first civilisations arose on the planet Gallifrey. They were exceptionally long lived, naturally sensitive to the flow of time, and highly telepathic. For many long years the Gallifreyans were ruled by a matriarchal cult led by the Pythia, who ruled through superstition and magic. Gradually an opposing faction arose which embraced science, conquering space and establishing a Gallifreyan Empire. Most notably a triumvirate of three young Gallifreyans came to the fore; the scientist Rassilon, the engineer Omega, and a third individual whose name has been lost to history, remembered only as The Other. Together these three pioneered the science of time travel. Foreseeing that her rule was ending, the 508th Pythia committed suicide, but not before using her vast telepathic powers to curse her people with sterility; no more children would be born of the womb on Gallifrey.\nRassilon turned his attention to this problem, and created vast Looms of genetic material, capable of decanting new Gallifreyans from the primordial soup within. His first few prototypes of the new \"Loom-born\" Gallifreyans would eventually become known as the Special Executive . The later Loom-born had lesser telepathic abilities and shorter life spans than their Womb-born counterparts, but could regenerate their forms. To keep the population under control, Rassilon organised the Gallifreyans into Houses, and decreed that each House could have only 45 \"Cousins\" at any one time.\nThe three friends' experiments into time travel continued, and they came to realise that a very special power source was required to allow development of stable time travel. They would need to capture a black hole. So they developed a stellar manipulator known as the Hand of Omega, able to blow up stars. Unfortunately sabotage by an outside agency meant that Omega's ship was sucked into the newly created void, and he would long be believed dead. But his sacrifice helped make the Gallifreyans Lords of Time.\nBack on Gallifrey Rassilon had become a hero, and de facto ruler of the planet. Some nine years after the death of the Pythia, he ordered a massacre of her remaining followers who were hiding in her temple. Rassilon felt no pity for her acolytes as his wife had miscarried when the Pythia invoked her curse, but the Other could not stomach the new, totalitarian regime he could see taking over his world. He ordered that his sole surviving relative (and the last child who had been born before the curse), his grand-daughter Susan, be taken safely off-world, for he saw trouble in his planet's future, and then he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Looms, mixing his genetic material with what was already there.\nThe Other would be proven right; first Rassilon would lead a campaign against any alien powers he deemed might one day threaten his new Gallifrey, exterminating a number of species such as the Charon and the Great Vampires; where possible they would wipe them from history in what would later be termed the Time Wars. And secondly civil war came again to Gallifrey when the Loom-born, tired of being treated as second class citizens, rose up to exterminate their Womb-born fellows. Although Rassilon himself remained venerated as their \"father\", the rest of the Womb-born were eventually thought to be wiped out, although in truth a handful of them survived, hiding themselves amongst the rest of the population. Some of them survive to this day, millennia later.\nEventually the Time Lords adopted a policy of non-intervention. Forbidden to travel into their own past or future, a people who prided themselves on observing and recording all history ironically (or conveniently) forgot much of their own. \u00a0Rassilon's era became known as the Old Time.\nA little over one thousand years ago a new Cousin was born in the House of Lungbarrow. His true name is all but unpronounceable to anyone who isn't Gallifreyan, and besides, his relatives soon took to calling him by the derisive nicknames \"Snail\" and \"Wormhole\" because of the small indentation-like birth mark he had in the lower portion of his chest. Being Loom-borns, none of them recognised what another species would have said was a belly-button. Unknown to all, including the new born, the Other's genetic material had finally been fully restored to a new body. Snail never fitted in and had no real friends amongst his Cousins.\nAs was expected Snail went to the Academy, the graduates of whom would rise above being simple Gallifreyans to the thousand strong Time Lord elite, and there he gained a new name from his classmates: Theta Sigma, or Thete for short. Enrolled in the Prydonian Chapter, whose members were renowned for being devious, he encountered Irving Braxiatel, a kindred spirit a few classes above him, who also yearned for life beyond he stagnant atmosphere on unchanging Gallifrey. He also fell in with a group of the brightest students who called themselves the Deca. Many of this group would later leave Gallifrey and become renegades from their people. And it was while he was one of the Deca that Thete finally chose a name for himself, rather than letting others pick for him; he became known as the Doctor.\nKnowing that the head of his House, Quences, had ambitions of high office for him, the Doctor deliberately scraped a minimum pass mark at the Academy. Angered, Quences disowned the Doctor, and without waiting for permission to do so, had the family Loom decant a new Cousin to replace him. The Doctor informed the head of the Prydonian Chapter of this breach of the rules, and then decided that the time was right to leave his homeworld. Stealing a TARDIS from the repair bays (as the rest were too well guarded), he departed Gallifrey unaware that his House had been excommunicated for creating a new Cousin, their names struck off all records and all his Cousins buried alive in the House for their crime. They would remain there for hundreds of years.\nThe Doctor soon discovered he had a stowaway in his new TARDIS. The Hand of Omega, which had been in storage for many years since its last use, had recognised in the Doctor the pattern of one of its makers, and followed him on board. It overrode the safeguards that prevented travel into Gallifrey's past, taking the Doctor back to the Old Time. There he soon encountered a young girl living on the streets. Susan, the Other's grand-daughter, had not made it off-planet after all; the instant she and the Doctor met they recognised a connection between them, and when Susan called him \"Grandfather\" somehow the Doctor knew she was correct no matter how much it defied logic.\nTogether they set off on journeys across the breadth of the universe, until Susan decided she wanted to try living as a proper teenager for a while. The two Gallifreyans stopped off in 1963 England, and Susan enrolled in a local school, Coal Hill. But her strange nature soon drew the attention of two of her teachers, Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright, who followed her home one night to the junkyard where the TARDIS had landed. The Doctor had used the prolonged stay to arrange to hide the Hand of Omega on Earth, and possibly because of this and a fear that the teachers might draw the attention of the authorities to the Hand, he took off with them inside the ship, kidnapping them.\nTime passed. Susan left him, and Ian and Barbara, having long since earned his trust, eventually returned home. Other companions joined him in his travels, and as he saw more of the universe, the Doctor increasingly encountered beings of evil he felt had to be opposed. After a while his body, old when he had left Gallifrey, finally gave in to time, and he experienced his first regeneration.\nHis new body had a tendency to act the fool while quietly manipulating events behind the scenes. He continued his campaign against evil across the galaxy, and more companions came and went. Finally he faced a problem that he could not deal with alone, and reluctantly called on the help of the Time Lords. They assisted him, but then put him on trial for breaking their laws on non-interference. The Doctor argued that there were some evils that had to be fought. In the end he won a partial victory. The Time Lords exiled him to a single planet and a single era, but it was his favourite world, Earth, and the era had been chosen because it was a period when the planet would face regular threats from alien incursions. They also forced another regeneration on him. He had a brief respite during which he secretly carried out missions for the Time Lords, before sentence was finally carried out.\nThe new incarnation of the Doctor arrived shortly after man had started to travel into space, drawing the attention of other races. He agreed to help UNIT, a United Nations taskforce whose remit was to combat alien threats, and worked to repair his TARDIS and beat his exile. After a couple of years his opportunity came when Omega returned, angry at the Time Lords for abandoning him. Unable to deal with the threat themselves, the Time Lords brought together all three versions of the Doctor to battle Omega. His success bought him his freedom; the Time Lords restored his ability to travel in time and space.\nEventually the third Doctor died too, and a fourth version was born, consumed with a wanderlust that was likely a reaction to his previous self's period of enforced stability. He finally returned home, only to be accused of murdering the President of the High Council. In order to prevent his own execution he utilized a little remembered law and declared his intention to stand for the post himself; until the election was over he was protected by legislation put in place to prevent tyrants from murdering their rivals. But the killer turned out to be the other Presidential candidate, who died while trying to eliminate the Doctor. As the only surviving candidate, the Doctor won by default. Elected to the highest post in Gallifrey, the Doctor did the only thing he could; he ran. But even though he had deserted the post, the title remained his, as the Gallifreyans had no rules to cover this kind of eventuality.\nIt was towards the end of this long lived fourth incarnation's time that the Doctor had his first recorded encounter with someone from the Marvel Megaverse.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#60) - The Doctor was surprised when the TARDIS materialised without him setting the co-ordinates. He emerged to discover an unusual looking man who claimed he had summoned the ship with the powers of his mind to help in the hour of Earth's greatest need. They were in the far future, inside the last surviving stronghold of the light against the barbarian forces of Catavolcus. The castle would soon fall to the enemy, but the old man, who was subsequently called Merlin by one of the defenders, wanted to use the Doctor's TARDIS to evacuate the survivors before a nuclear device he had activated destroyed everything. Having armed the weapon, the two fled back to the time ship as Catavolcus' Neutron Knights pierced the castle wall. The Doctor hurried the retreating defenders into his ship, and they departed seconds before the castle and the attackers were vapourised. The Time Lord set the controls to take his passengers to a safe disembarkation spot, and then passed out. He awoke lying outside the TARDIS in some quiet woods, unsure if what he remembered was real or just a dream. But when he entered his ship, he was met by a vision of Merlin, who informed him that they would meet again, \"in some distant time, in some other form.\"\n(TV series and novels) - Shortly after this the fourth Doctor faced his old enemy the Master once more, and was killed when he fell from the top of a radio telescope. He regenerated again, taking on his youngest looking form to date.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#61 (fb) - BTS) Following many adventures the Doctor received a mysterious message from the Time Lords. At their behest, he dropped off his travelling companions, and checked into a bed and breakfast in the little English town of Stockbridge.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#61) - The Doctor was taking part in a local cricket match when a wave of temporal distortions started, mixing things from different time periods. The Doctor was about to bat, awaiting the bowler's throw, when the cricket ball was swapped for a grenade from the 1940's, which blew apart the wickets. Gunfire then drew the Doctor, a policeman and the other cricketers to a nearby lane, where a local man had discharged a shotgun to drive off attackers wielding swords. When the constable investigated the adjoining woods, he was attacked by a Roman legionary, who then turned on the Doctor. The Doctor deflected the blow with his cricket bat, and the man with the shotgun fired on the Roman, who vanished. Slipping away, the Doctor headed to the spot where he had hidden the TARDIS to check its instruments. Scanning the news channels confirmed that the effect was not localised, so the Doctor decided to collect his belongings from his lodgings and then try to track down the cause. But as he left the TARDIS he was attacked by a knight on horseback.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#62) - The Doctor dodged the charge, and the knight was unhorsed when his lance smashed against the TARDIS. The Doctor brought the unconscious man inside the TARDIS, and was in the process of removing his armour to check for injuries when he revived. The knight introduced himself as Sir Justin, and explained that he was snatched from the middle of a joust only to reappear bearing down on the Doctor.\u00a0The Time Lord stated he would return Justin to his own time, but first he needed to deal with the cause of the temporal anomalies. Foreseeing a chance to perform great deeds, Justin happily agreed to accompany the Doctor. They travelled back to Gallifrey, were the Doctor still held the position of President. Once there the Doctor connected himself to the Matrix, a gigantic computer network containing the preserved memories of all the dead Time Lords, hoping it would help him deduce what was happening. As he did this, a strange shadow man materialised next to the TARDIS and entered the craft. Meanwhile\u00a0the Doctor's virtual self found himself confronted by representations of Rassilon and two other great Time Lords . They were holding council with other \"High Evolutionaries\" from the Althrace system and with Merlin the Wise of Earth.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#63) - Merlin informed the Doctor that the being behind the time distortions was the demon Melanicus, a foe he banished from this plane of existence a thousand years ago. Melanicus had hijacked a device known as the Event Synthesiser which regulated the flow of time. Rassilon charged the Doctor with finding Melanicus and restoring the Synthesiser to its proper function. Returning to the real world, Justin and the Doctor made their way back to the TARDIS to begin their quest. Before they could take off however a beam penetrated Gallifrey's defenses and deposited an assassin inside the ship. As time slowed down for the Doctor and Justin, effectively paralysing them, the shadow man who breached the TARDIS earlier materialised behind the Time Lord and shot the assassin before he could carry out his deadly mission.\nReleased from the grip of the beam, the TARDIS was sent hurtling into the void by the beings in the Matrix, penetrating the domain of Melanicus. In a place where chaos and insanity reigned they initially found that the ship had materialised floating in a gigantic bathtub alongside a huge toy duck, before it next materialised inside a Hall of Mirrors. The Doctor and Justin emerged into the fairground beyond, where the Doctor spotted someone who looked like his old companion Zoe Herriot. He gave chase, following her into the Ghost Train. Convinced the girl might have an idea as to what was happening in this bizarre world, the Doctor jumped into one of the cars and continued his pursuit, unaware that the shadow man was sitting just behind him. The car proved to be on a rollercoaster track, taking the Doctor rapidly through an entrance marked \"Door to Hell\". On the other side they were surrounded by flames, and the Doctor realised they were heading straight towards the giant form of the demon Melanicus.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#64) - The Doctor was unsure as to whether or not the image before him was real. Meanwhile, back in the Matrix, the three Time Lords he encountered earlier at the council meeting decided to raise the manifestation level of their other agent. Suddenly the shadow man who had been dogging the Doctor's footsteps made his presence known, explaining that what the Doctor was facing was a vibratory illusion created by the Synthesiser, indistinguishable from the real thing and just as deadly. However the false Melanicus was no match for the shadow man's gun, and with it's destruction the Ghost Train car exited the fake hell. Seconds later it reached the end of the track, dropping the Doctor and his saviour from a great height.\nSir Justin had experienced his own worries since the Doctor rushed off, being attacked by a number of armoured men. He retreated into the Hall of Mirrors. At the same time the Doctor awakened, having been stunned by his impact on the ground. The shadow man at first appeared to have vanished, but in fact was hiding within the Doctor's own shadow. The Time Lord examined the room he was in, and accidentally knocked into a coffin laid out behind him. This drew the attention of the coffin's resident, a stereotypical vampiric count. Unimpressed by the Doctor's observation that \"you represent a strictly mythical figure drawn largely from a work of Victorian fiction\", the count advanced threateningly. But Justin spotted the Doctor being threatened through one of the mirrors in the Hall he was in, and smashed his way through to his ally. He drove the vampire off using the hilt of his sword as a cross, and the two friends rushed back into the TARDIS. Aware that he needed to follow the logic of the weird dimension they were in, the Doctor enquired of Justin as to exactly how many mirrors the knight had been forced to break to save him. Informed that it was four, the Doctor calculated as they take off\u00a0that they were in for twenty-eight years of bad luck.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#65) - To avoid the bad luck, the Doctor slipped the TARDIS sideways into another dimension. Twenty-four hours passed for those inside, while outside twenty-eight years went by. During this time Melanicus caused over a thousand years of war to erupt across a thousand planets, with time zones mixing combatants wildly: the Millennium Wars. On Gallifrey in the Matrix Merlin consulted with the other High Evolutionaries. As yet Melanicus' limited understanding of the Event Synthesiser had restricted his damage to only a single dimension, but they feared he might discover how to spread the damage across a multitude of dimensions. If the Doctor could not locate the Synthesiser then the entire cosmos was threatened.\nBack in the TARDIS the Doctor decided they must enter the maelstrom Melanicus had created and land as near to the Synthesiser as possible. The problem was that they had no way of knowing where that was at any given moment. A voice pointed out that it's position should be easy to calculate so long as you tooke into account the size of the Synthesiser and the fact that it didn't move; rather everything else moved in relation to it. The voice proved to be that of the shadow man, who introduced himself as Shayde. He explained that he was a mental construct who served the Matrix lords, and was sent to help the Doctor on his mission. While he explained this, the TARDIS picked up a reading, and when the Doctor checked the scanner he was greeted by an extraordinary sight - a crystalline craft composed of pure energy. The craft proved to belong to the Lords of Althrace, one of the groups of High Evolutionaries, who transported the travellers to Althrace, a set of joined planets spinning in the middle of a White Hole.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#66) - There the Lords explained the origins of Melanicus, informing the Doctor that the demon had been a native of Althrace. Fleeing to another dimension after an aborted attempt to conquer his home system, he managed to make contact with Catavolcus, then a third century despot. Catavolcus gave Melanicus access to another dimension, Earth's, and in return was given great power and the ability to traverse time. If Merlin had not intervened they would have conquered the Earth. Merlin banished Melanicus back to the dimension he had been hiding in, although Catavolcus remained free, roaming time and space and pillaging planets for their power...at least until he will one day be killed in the nuclear explosion the fourth Doctor nearly witnessed.\nAccording to the Lords of Althrace, Melanicus had turned his full attention to the Earth. The Lords felt responsible, since it was they who first built the Event Synthesiser. Now they planned to unite the wills of all the High Evolutionaries across the galaxies, to stop time and allow the Doctor and Justin to face the villain.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#67) - With all time stopped the Doctor followed the co-ordinates he had now been given and landed the TARDIS on a devastated Earth. From the nearby ruins of a church, he and Justin could hear an organ playing. Inside they found the Event Synthesiser, and as the organist continued to play the ground around them erupted. Sir Justin splashed the face of the organist with a hat-full of Holy Water from the font, unmasking him as Melanicus. As the demon turned on his companion, the Doctor faced a fight of his own, when a cadaverous corpse rose from the ground and attempted to throttle him. Justin came to his rescue, but Melanicus had used the diversion to escape. The demon climbed the outside of the bell tower, only to find Shayde waiting for him at the top. The shadow being fired two precise shots, blinding the villain and causing him to plummet downwards. He saved himself by grabbing onto the edge of one of the windows as he fell, unaware that he was now visible to Justin and the Doctor. The young knight drew his sword and charged, smashing through the window to impale the beast on his weapon. A huge explosion of energy knocked the Doctor out, his last sight being the Event Synthesiser being commandeered by its rightful guardian. The Doctor awoke in the church, to find the damaged building whole once more. Justin was gone, and in his place the Doctor was dismayed to find only a statue in memory of his sacrifice. As the Doctor read the epitaph at its base and pondered who could have put it there, he was unaware of the spectre of Merlin standing behind him.\nThe Doctor's reverie was disturbed by a man in cricket gear who reminded the Doctor that it was his turn to bat, and he left the church, St Justinians, and returns to his game. His mind reeled from his recent experiences, and he noted that everything appeared the same as when things started, leaving him to wonder how much of it was real, or if it was all just a dream. Watching in the shadows at the edge of the green, Shayde was informed his mission was over, and he could return home to Gallifrey.\n(other strips) - The Doctor resumed his travels, eventually picking up a new companion in the form of American fighter pilot Angus \"Gus\" Goodman.\n(Doctor Who Monthly#84) - The TARDIS landed on the planet Celeste. Gus had finally decided to end his travels with the Doctor, who was now trying to get his companion back home. The Doctor told Gus that it might take a while, but he would get them there, and Gus replies that he knew this; he had faith in the TARDIS. As they wandered away from the ship a ragged figure called out a warning to them, telling them to hide or the \"Gaunts\" would get them. Seconds later they were caught in the spotlight of an airship, and gunfire shattered the ground around them. Armoured men (Gaunts) move towards them, and Gus and the Doctor ran, only for their escape to be blocked by a perimeter wall. Just as the Gaunts were about to gun them down, the earth gave way beneath the travellers, dropping them into a tunnel that someone had been trying to dig under the wall. The Gaunts blocked the tunnel by bulldozing rubble into it, leaving the two friends below only one choice - they had to find the other end if they want to get out.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#86) - Making their way along the tunnel, the Doctor and Gus witnessed Gaunts herding men in chains, the enslaved miners. Heading a different way, they were confronted by a giant war 'droid, the Wrekka, who opened fire on them. This noise provided the chained miners a distraction and they turned on their captors. The Doctor and Gus fled back past the point where the miners had just overpowered the Gaunts, closely followed by the Wrekka. As the robot filled the tunnels with tear gas, the Doctor responded to a miner's call for help by grabbing a dropped pistol and shooting off the man's chains. This slight delay gave the Wrekka time to catch up, and the Doctor was knocked out by a stun grenade. The Wrekka loaded the unconscious Time Lord over it's shoulder, and herded the captive Gus in front of it. The two men were taken to the office of the owner of the mines, Josiah W. Dogbolter, a humanoid frog, where they were interrogated by Hob, Dogbolter's right-hand robot. When the Doctor's answers failed to please Hob, the little robot ordered the Wrekka to behead Gus. Faced with this threat the Doctor admitted they had arrived in a time machine, a revelation that drew the personal interest of Dogbolter.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#87) - Seeing the business opportunities inherent in time travel, Dogbolter demanded to buy the TARDIS. The Doctor refused, but Hob insisted, stating that Dogbolter would pay whatever price the Doctor wants. Hating to seem inflexible, the Doctor acquiesced: he would sell the TARDIS to Dogbolter in return for half a pound...of frogspawn. Dogbolter's fury began to rise, but before it could erupt the wall of his office was demolished as the rebelling miners smashed a giant bulldozer into the side of the building. In the confusion the Doctor and Gus made good their escape. The TARDIS' departure was witnessed by one of Dogbolter's engineers, who passes on a description to his employer. Dogbolter, not ready to give up, ordered the bounty hunter known as The Moderator to track down the Time Lord.\nThe Moderator caught up with the travellers just as they finally reached Gus' home time on Earth. Gus was making his farewells to his friend when the armoured mercenary raced into sight and opened fire. Gus shoved the Doctor aside, saving his friend's life, but suffered fatal injuries in his stead. He fired his service revolver at their attacker, whose armour, designed to deflect particles from energy weapons, proved completely useless against primitive lead bullets. The Moderator went down, but Gus died at the Doctor's side.\nThe enraged Time Lord picked up Gus' gun, turned to the wounded bounty hunter...and fired two shots into the killer's dislodged headpiece, whose stuck radio had been pouring out a Vera Lynn song throughout. He then took the injured Moderator into the TARDIS and dropped the man off on the nearest planet capable of giving the alien medical treatment.\n(TV series and comic strips - BTS) - The Doctor returned to Stockbridge and collected the travelling companions he left behind when the Time Lords originally asked him to wait there. Unsurprisingly he failed to tell them about just how long he had really been gone, or the fact that he picked up two new travelling companions during that time, both of whom died whilst accompanying him. While other things distracted him from his hunt for the employer of the Moderator, he did not forget his desire to find out who was behind the death of his friend. He merely puts it on hold.\n(TV series and novels) - The Doctor continued his travels. Eventually he and his companion of the time, Peri, were exposed to a deadly poison. Only managing to get enough antidote for one of them, the Doctor, refusing to lose another friend, administered the cure to Peri, then regenerated. His new form was more brash and bombastic than the previous. After a shaky start he and Peri became firm friends.\n(comics - BTS) - Peri decided to take a break from the Doctor, and he returned her to modern day New York. Alone again, he turned his attention to finding out who was behind the Moderator.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#88) - The Doctor was on a sleazy alien world tracking down information on the Moderator. Deciding that he finally had enough information to confirm that it was Dogbolter who sent the bounty hunter after him, the Doctor returned to his ship, unaware that he had picked up a tail: a shapeshifting Whifferdill detective named Avan Tarklu was following him, hoping to claim the price on his head. Reaching the TARDIS, the Doctor was attacked by two assassins, also after the money. The Doctor managed to defeat one of them, but the second pulled a gun. Tarklu, unwilling to let someone else get the reward, knocked out the gunman, although in the darkness the Doctor failed to see what happened. Still unaware of the presence of the shapeshifter, the Doctor entered his ship and set the co-ordinates for Dogbolter's base on Venus, only to be caught by surprise when Tarklu revealed himself.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#89) - The Whifferdill demanded to be taken to Venus, which the Doctor pointed out was his destination anyway. But the Time Lord was still astonished to discover that he was to be turned in for the reward money, as Tarklu revealed how much his captive was worth to Dogbolter. A short while later the TARDIS landed on Venus atop Dogbolter's corporate headquarters. A note was dispatched from inside the craft which made it's way to Hob, who read it to his master. The note stated that the bounty-hunter was willing to deliver the Doctor in return for the reward money. Dogbolter agreed, eager for revenge (by this stage, acquiring the TARDIS had become secondary to dealing with its owner). The Doctor was ushered out of the TARDIS by a bizarre figure in a heavy trenchcoat, beard and low brimmed hat. The figure handed over his prisoner and took the money off of Hob. He then departed in the TARDIS, leaving his captive with the Gaunts. Much to the guards surprise the Doctor almost immediately vanished, as he was really the shapeshifter Tarklu (and the man in the concealing clothes was the real Doctor). He and the Doctor had reached a deal whereby both got what they wanted; Tarklu the money and the Doctor a measure of payback against Dogbolter. The Doctor returned to collect his new ally, and was dismayed to find that the Whifferdill has decided to hang around for a while.\n(Comic, TV series and novels) - The Doctor continued to journey with his new friend (who adopted the name Frobisher), eventually collecting Peri. Time passed and Peri departed the Doctor's company more permanently.\n(The Maltese Penguin audio play) - The Doctor had dropped Frobisher off at the Whifferdill's request, as the shapeshifter wanted to prove to himself he still had what it took to be a detective. Up to his beak in a case involving a mysterious item and with Dogbolter breathing down his neck, Frobisher repeatedly turned down help from his Time Lord friend, who kept popping back to try and convince his friend to resume their journeys together. Eventually, the case solved and Dogbolter thwarted once more, Frobisher rejoined the TARDIS crew.\n(TV series and novels) - Frobisher eventually left the Doctor. Much later he regenerated again, taking on his seventh form. This new incarnation at first seemed a clown in many respects, but it soon transpired that he was the most manipulative of all the Time Lord's personae, the one closest to being like the Other.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#135) - Travelling in the time vortex, the TARDIS collided with a large obstacle in it's path, forcing both to land. The bump attracted the attention of a Time Warden, who fled the second he saw what the TARDIS had hit. It was the giant form of the robot known as Death's Head, who picked up the Time Lord as if he were an insect when he emerged from within the vessel. The bounty hunter felt that the Doctor had gotten in his way, and when someone did that they either had to have something worth bargaining with him or die, yes? As he was about to pulverise the Doctor, the Time Lord located a Tissue Compression Eliminator he took from his old foe the Master. Although it was a nasty device which killed people by shrinking them to a fraction of their size, the Doctor decided that desperate situations called for desperate measures, and fired on Death's Head. The effect wasn't quite what he expected; Death's Head was shrunk down to human size, but not destroyed. As the much reduced robot pursued the fleeing Time Lord, the Time Warden again appeared, but departed once more when Death's Head made it clear that helping the Doctor would get him killed.\nHaving managed to get far enough ahead to stop for a breather, the Doctor realised he had something he could use to bargain with his mechanoid pursuer. He offered the time displaced robot the TARDIS and a demonstration on how to fly it. Death's Head agreed, but didn't trust the Doctor and insisted he accompanies the cyborg for the first trip. The Doctor programmed the ship for Earth in the year 8162, but when he activated the controls, it was only Death's Head who vanished. The Time Warden popped his head in the TARDIS door to see what happened, and the Doctor explained that he programmed the ship to lock on the nearest mechanical organism and send it through time. As the Time Warden departed, the Doctor wondered what Death's Head will do on Earth.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#140 - BTS) The Doctor picked up a distress signal coming from the planet Ryos. He set down to help, and discovered the person who activated the signal, a medic, but was unable to prevent her falling into in the clutches of the hostile natives. Indeed, he himself was spotted by the locals, and forced to flee as they pursued him riding on the backs of their giant steeds.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#140) - Luckily for the Doctor a space salvage merchant called Keepsake also picked up the signal, and with more profit oriented and less noble aims in mind, had also set down. Keepsake spotted the Doctor running from his pursuers, and took off before the Doctor could get on board. But the Time Lord was close enough to get swept up by one of the salvage ship's landing legs, and managed to hang on until Keepsake (who couldn't gain altitude and exit the atmosphere with someone weighing down the landing strut) landed. Once on the ground again, the Doctor introduced himself and roped the reluctant pilot into his rescue mission. They flew over the alien village and dropped detonators which exploded harmlessly above the huts, distracting the locals. While the Doctor skipped off the ship and rushed inside one of the buildings to find the captive medic, the reluctant Keepsake held off the natives for a few minutes. A little later, having successfully accomplished what he set out to do, the Doctor had Keepsake drop him off by the TARDIS, leaving the salvage man to return the extremely pretty, extremely greatful, female medic to civilisation.\n(Death's Head#8) - The Doctor was taking part in a seaside pier pantomime playing the part of the jester when Death's Head materialised on the stage behind him. The mechanoid had been hired by Dogbolter to kill the Doctor and was using the ruthless businessman's new prototype time travel pack. Before he could fire on his target, a trap door beneath the robot dropped him into the basement, and the Doctor legged it. As Death's Head hunted through the theatre for his prey, the Doctor escaped disguised as the front end of a pantomime horse. He returnd to his TARDIS and set random co-ordinates, hoping that would lose his pursuer, but before he took off Death's Head materialised inside the ship. His arrival triggered the vessel's Geiger counter, leading the Doctor to conclude that the device on the bounty hunter's back was about to go nuclear. Death's Head realised that Dogbolter had set him up and forced the Doctor at gunpoint to take him back to Dogbolter's headquarters in the 82nd century. Once there he handed his gun over to the Doctor and told him to shoot off the straps that were holding the time pack / bomb to his back. That failed to work, but an attempt by the Doctor to pick the locks on the straps did. Death's Head threw the explosive device out of the TARDIS, and they departed just before it detonated. \u00a0Dogbolter and Hob were caught in the blast. The Doctor dropped Death's Head off, and the mechanoid warned him they were quits now - next time he might kill the Time Lord. The Doctor, tired of the threats, gave him back his gun and informed DH he would need it, and all his other weapons, because the Doctor would\u00a0not be easy to kill. Then he added that Death's Head was doomed, because the mechanoid was incapable of change. And with this he departed, leaving the robot wondering where the Doctor had deposited him. Unknown to the bounty hunter, he was atop Four's Freedom Plaza, the home of the Fantastic Four, on Earth-616. The Time Lord had dropped him off in another dimension.\n(TV series, comics and novels) - A short while later the Doctor retrieved his (then) current companion, Ace, whom he had left dinosaur-spotting in the Cretaceous.\n(Doctor Who Magazine#173) - The Doctor had been trying to make it to Maruthea, a space-port at the centre of the space-time vortex, in order to attend his friend Bonjaxx's birthday party. As he landed another TARDIS was departing, with the Doctor in that craft having just expelled some penguins who were looking for a friend of theirs. The Doctor caught sight of the dematerialising ship, although Ace did not, and he commented to his friend that anything could happen here, and frequently did. They entered Bonjaxx's bar, where the Doctor greeted his old friend. As the Daemon bar owner put the Doctor's gift on a pile of identical ones (probably given by other incarnations of the Time Lord, as they were all identically wrapped), he informed the Doctor that someone was looking for him earlier. The Doctor glanced around the bar, which was filled with a large number of familiar faces (see comments). He and Ace sat down at a table, and the Doctor mused about who would know he was present. Ace suggested it might be Death's Head, who was sitting at a nearby table counting his money. Death's Head raised his glass in acknowledgement of the Doctor. Then Ace wondered if it might be a couple who were approaching where she and the Doctor were sitting. The Doctor turned to look, and after a few seconds, recognition hit him, and he said hello to his future self. Meanwhile Ace introduced herself to the other Doctor's companion, Ria. Before things could progress further an extremely drunk Beep the Meep arrived, looking for revenge. A brawl erupted, dragging almost everyone in bar into it. Everyone except the Doctor, who continued their conversation untouched by the chaos around them. As the fight started to wind down, the Doctor retrieved their companions, thanked Bonjaxx for the party, and walked out. Each Doctor returned to their respective TARDIS, just as the fourth incarnation of the Doctor arrived at the party, materialising his ship amidst the wreckage of the bar.\n(Incomplete Death's Head#12) - Unbeknownst to most at the party they were being observed by Hob, now a monstrous behemoth obsessed with finding Dogbolter and getting revenge of Death's Head and the Doctor for exposing him to the nuclear explosion that hurtled him out of time and space. Also watching were Death's Head and his own future (Minion) incarnation, both trapped in a virtual reality. The later Death's Head managed to escape the virtual reality and return to his own body, which was nearby. Now that the (seventh) Doctor had departed Hob attacked the original Death's Head, but the newer Death's Head came to his rescue, and together they managed to destroy Hob. The seventh Doctor returns, wiped the original Death's Head memory of meeting his future counterpart, and explained that it was he who sent the new Death's Head and his partner Tuck to Maruthea, to thwart Hob. The newer Death's Head was annoyed at being manipulated but let it go under the circumstances. The Doctor offered to buy him and Tuck a drink, but the cyborg bounty hunter passed. As he got ready to depart, the Doctor extended an offer to Tuck to look him up if she ever wanted a new partner. The Doctor watched as the two of them left, then helped the original Deaths' Head back up and suggested he attend a party - such as the one in Bonjaxx's bar.\n(TV series, comics, novels) - The seventh incarnation of the Doctor finally met his end after a long series of adventures, and was reborn as a younger looking, less cynical individual. This eighth incarnation had a turbulent existence, experiencing a number of bouts of amnesia, having his history rewritten by the Faction Paradox, battling Rassilon, the founder of Time Lord society, and even destroying his own homeworld Gallifrey and virtually his entire species retroactively, so that they never existed, though he later reversed this and reinstated them.\n(new TV series) - However the Time Lords were subsequently caught up in a temporal war with the Daleks, which ended when the Doctor initiated an attack that burned the Daleks out of time at the cost of his own species being wiped out too. Having not expected to survive, the Doctor instead found himself the last Time Lord (and regenerated, likely as a result of this final blow in the war). Though suffering from Survivor's Guilt, the Doctor continued doing the only thing he knew, saving the universe. A new companion, Rose Tyler, gradually managed to lighten his mood, even after he discovered the Daleks had survived and the loss of his own people had been in vain. He again sacrificed an incarnation, this time to save Rose, regenerating into his current, tenth, form. No longer burdened by the guilt of his last life, the Doctor continues to travel time and space.\nComments: Created by Sidney Newman and Donald Wilson. The nine incarnations of the Doctor have been played on television by William Hartnell (1st), Richard Hurndall (1st, in the 20th Anniversary special after Hartnell passed away), Patrick Troughton (2nd), Jon Pertwee (3rd), Tom Baker (4th), Peter Davison (5th), Colin Baker (6th), Sylvester\u00a0McCoy (7th), Paul McGann (8th), Christopher Eccleston (9th) and David Tennant (10th). Another \"official ninth incarnation\" was played by Richard E.Grant (see picture below) in an animated audio drama, \"Scream of the Shalka\", which was broadcast on the BBC website, but the advent of the new series has sadly had Grant's performance redesignated as being \"Unbound\" (Who terminology for an alternate universe Doctor). As Per Degaton points out, a villainous future incarnation of the Doctor, the Valeyard, was played in the show by actor Michael Jayston. In other, BBC licensed productions, he's been played on stage by Trevor Martin and David Banks, and while not strictly the same character, Peter Cushing played Doctor Who twice in the cinema in the 1960's. He has also been played by a string of actors in a Comic Relief Charity Special - Rowan Atkinson (9th Doctor), Richard E. Grant (10th - this was prior to his online appearance), Jim Broadbent (11th), Hugh Grant (12th) and Joanna Lumley (13th). Actor and (new series) writer Mark Gatiss portrayed the Doctor in a number of short sketches during a Doctor Who themed evening on BBC 2 on November 13th 1999. \u00a0The officially licensed audio plays produced by Big Finish have gone on to add another several actors to the role, releasing in the 40th Anniversary year a series of Unbound (\"What If?\" style) adventures, each one starring an alternate Doctor - the \"new\" Doctors are Geoffrey Bayldon (alternate version of the first or maybe second Doctor), David Warner (alternate third Doctor), David Collings (unspecified alternate incarnation) with Ian Brooker (his next incarnation), Sir Derek Jacobi (alternate first Doctor), Arabella Weir (alternate third Doctor) with cameo by Nick Briggs (alternate second Doctor). The Doctor returned to regular television in 2005, proving a ratings hit which has already spawned two spin-off series, Torchwood and The Sarah-Jane Adventures.\n\"The Doctor is an underachiever who never saw the point of exams, brought up on a planet that was basically a big university. He was a member of the social elite, but never saw the point of the rituals and social structures that kept that elite in power. He's an aristocrat who has rejected the comforts of his former life and the role that was expected of him. He has no real powers other than a keen intelligence and a lot of learning. He solves problems not through violence, but through wit and reason. No one can be The Doctor, he's more than human, but we can try to be like The Doctor - peaceful, intelligent, witty, reasonable, aware of what is truly important.\" - Lance Parkin, Doctor Who author\nThe Doctor's history above is, in the end, only a potted version. Firstly the character has been around for forty years now, with over 150 TV stories, even more officially licensed original novels, comic strips for most of that time, including spin-offs covering his enemies and travelling companions, over thirty official audio plays and so on; there is no way I can cover all of that in this profile. Nor should I, as this site is dedicated to the characters of the Marvel Universe, and covering the entire breadth and width of the Doctor's history is outwith the remit of this site. There are entire sites out there dedicated to doing just that, notably Outpost Gallifrey's Canon Guide , and Stripping Down , which covers the bulk of the Doctor's Marvel comic adventures. However an entry that just covered the Doctor's interaction with Marvel characters would not do the character justice; hopefully I've managed to get a reasonable balance.\nAmongst Doctor Who fans there is much debate as to what is canon (beyond the original TV show), and much of the background to the character's origins which has been established in the novel's since the show left the air is ignored or refuted by them. If I did the same here, then I should also forget his comic book appearances, and then there would be no point in him having an entry in the Appendix. So, to those who ignore the Doctor's further adventures outside the medium of television, I have only one question: What are you doing reading this in the first place?\nA common confusion that arises is that because the title of the TV show is \"Doctor Who\" that this is also the name of the lead character; this isn't the case. The name he uses is the Doctor, and the title of the show was chosen to reflect the mystery which originally existed as to the origins of the lead character. It should be noted that while the Doctor himself never uses the alias \"Doctor Who\", it has very occasionally been applied to him by others.\u00a0The Doctor himself seems to be aware of the confusion his lack of a surname can cause, and has been known to answer the query \"Doctor? Doctor who?\" with a firm \"Yes.\" He also once signed his name as Doctor W., and once employed the alias Doctor von Wer (which is German for Who).\nFor those who have the Doctor's U.S \u00a0reprinted adventures, here's how they match to the U.K. original printings, as far as I can devine from the covers (I don't have the U.S. printings)\nMarvel Premiere#57-58 - The Iron Legion (Doctor Who Weekly#1-8)\nMarvel Premiere#59-60 - City of the Damned (Doctor Who Weekly#9-16) - called City of the Cursed in the US version.\nDoctor Who#1-2 (U.S.) - The Star Beast (Doctor Who Weekly#19-26) - the story in issues 17&18 was Time Slip, which might have been in either MP 60 or DW1, or in neither.\nDoctor Who#3-4 (U.S.) - Dogs of Doom (Doctor Who Weekly#27-34)\nDoctor Who#5 (U.S.) - The Time Witch (Doctor Who Weekly#35-38)\nDoctor Who#6-7 (U.S.) - Dragon's Claw (Doctor Who Weekly/Monthly#39-45)\nDoctor Who#8 (U.S.) - The Collector (Doctor Who Monthly#46) and probably The Dreamers of Death (Doctor Who Monthly 47-48)\nDoctor Who#9 (U.S.) - The Life Bringer (Doctor Who Monthly#49-50)\nDoctor Who#10 (U.S.) - War of the Words (Doctor Who Monthly#51) and probably The Spider God (Doctor Who Monthly 52)\nDoctor Who#11 (U.S.) - The Deal (Doctor Who Monthly#53) I'm guessing they filled the US issue out with some of the shorter back-up strips that used to appear in the magazine.\nDoctor Who (U.S.) #12 - End of the Line (Doctor Who Monthly#54-55)\nDoctor Who (U.S.) #13 - Junkyard Demon (Doctor Who Monthly#58-59), possibly also Freefall Warriors (Doctor Who Monthly56-57)\nDoctor Who#14 (U.S.) - The Neutron Knights (Doctor Who Monthly#60)\nDoctor Who#15-18 (U.S.) - The Tides of Time (Doctor Who Monthly#61-67)\nDoctor Who#19 (U.S.) - The Stars Fell on Stockbridge (Doctor Who Monthly#68-69)\nDoctor Who#20-22 (U.S.) - The Stockbridge Horror (Doctor Who Monthly#70-75)\nDoctor Who#23 (U.S.) - Lunar Lagoon (Doctor Who Monthly#66-67)\nThe Doctor's family\nAs I explain in the history, Time Lords of the modern era are arranged into houses with 45 Cousins in each. But Irving Braxiatel is described as the Doctor's brother. How can this be? Brax isn't one of the Cousins, as all of them are accounted for in the same story that introduces the House of Lungbarrow. It could just be a term of affection, but the way it comes across, that doesn't seem right. More likely is that Braxiatel also shares some of the Other's genetic heritage (or has the genetic heritage of the Other's brother), and in the same way Susan and the Doctor recognised each other when they first met, so too did Braxiatel and the Doctor.\nIn the T.V. Comic's strips from 1966, the First Doctor had two grandchilren, other than Susan Foreman, John and Gillian, last name unknown, the author is also unknown, but the artist was John Canning. I don't know if the strip is considered canon, but they were reprinted in Doctor Who Classic Comics magazine by Marvel UK. - Darc_Light\nYou don't want to get into a \"what is and isn't canon\" debate with a Doctor Who fan. Nobody can agree it seems - the perils of appearing in so many mediums with so many different writers adding their own spin. Out of the fans who don't just dismiss anything that wasn't shown on TV, there's been a recent shift to try and fit John and Gillian into the canon, based on certain alien races seen in the TV Comic strips being name checked in the novels (which many fans are happy to consider canon). The attitude is that if those races are canon, so is everything in the TV Comic strips, no matter how bad or infantile. However a far more satisfying explanation was provided in the novel \"Conundrum\". In it the Doctor and his companions are trapped in a dimension called the Land of Fiction (which turned up once in the TV version). This reality can be manipulated by \"the Master of the Land\", letting him create virtually anything...and he has been running test simulations in preparation for his battle with the Doctor, practising against a fictional version. Sometimes the simulation acts alone, sometimes against fictional versions of real foes, sometimes with fictional versions of real companions, and sometimes the fictional Doctor is accompanied by brand new fictional companions. The real Doctor runs into two children, John and Gillian, who call him grandfather, and the Doctor replies that he has never seen them before in his life. So my take is that John and Gillian have never been \"real\" companions or relatives of the Doctor. Perhaps the TV Comics strips needed a disclaimer, and one springs to mind, from the final pre-Crisis Superman story which was written by Alan Moore:\n\"This is an imaginary story....but then, aren't they all.\"\nThe Doctor as Merlin\nThe Doctor will in a future incarnation become known as Merlin. We even know which incarnation (it's the one who also calls himself Muldwych) ,and what he looks like (right). The Merlin met by the fourth and fifth incarnations of the Doctor bears no real resemblance to Muldwych; he does however look exactly like one of the forms taken on by the Merlyn who gave Captain Britain his powers when that character shapeshifts in Daredevils#1. It should be noted however that this isn't a guarantee that the Doctor has met that Merlyn. While unlikely, it's conceivable that the Merlin of the Neutron Knights story might be another incarnation of the Doctor. The story which first tells us the Doctor will become Merlin also implies that he will regenerate while using this name. The Merlin of Neutron Knights could be the first incarnation of the Doctor to use the name, and Muldwych the second. Captain Britain's Merlyn could very easily copy his appearance if he so desired. Confused? That's what you get when you have two extremely manipulative individuals who change names and appearances on a regular basis and aren't beyond pinching other people's identities when it suits them. For my money though, the Merlin the fourth and fifth Doctor's met is probably the Marvel Universe's Merlyn.\nJust to confuse things further - the Doctor discovered in Battlefield (TV story) that he would one day become Merlin on an alternate Earth (though not necessarily the one he ran into in Tides of Time and Neutron Knights).\nPerhaps the \"Merlin\" role he took there was in homage to the actual Merlin? - Changeling. \u00a0It's entirely possible that he pinched the name of the real Merlin, either in homage, or, upon arriving and finding out that the real Merlin had been around a few years back and was still remembered, by claiming that he was Merlin returned. Particularly easy if the locals knew Merlin could alter his appearance.\nIs Earth 8162 A.D. Marvel universe or Doctor universe?\nAnother thing worth noting is that the first time the Doctor met Death's Head, he dumped the cyborg in Earth 8162. That Earth contains Dogbolter, who is 1) a Earth-Who character, and 2) doesn't have access to interdimensional travel technology. So this would suggest that Earth 8162 is the future of Earth-Who, not of Earth-616. Taking this into account, the only time we have actually seen the Doctor in the Marvel Multiverse is when he drops Death's Head off after their second encounter, onto the top of Four's Freedom Plaza. And if the Merlin he met wasn't CB's Merlyn, then the only time we actually see him meeting Marvel Multiverse natives is at Bonjaxx's party, and the only ones he actually talks to are the Minion version of Death's Head, and Tuck (the original Death's Head isn't a native of that Multiverse, though he is a native of the Marvel Megaverse).\nThere is no definitive future for Earth-616, only potential or alternate futures.\nA brief refresher on the Omniverse :\nHaving now reviewed the concept of the Omniverse, you're now ready to understand this discussion. Earth 8162 was written by Marvel and should be considered part of the Megaverse, without question. Even though the Doctor is not owned by Marvel, the other concepts were created by them and are still Marvel's to use. Whether this happens to be the same reality of the Doctor or not is irrelevant.\nDeath's Head, the Freelance Peacekeeping Agent, is similarly complex, but he's native to part of the Marvel Megaverse, at least.\nNone of the cosmic entities have been seen on Earth 8162, and it remains to be seen whether they exist or not in that reality. That is the criteria to determine whether Earth 8162 is part of the mainstream Multiverse or not.\nThe fact that characters from the modern era are not referenced in 8162 is also irrelevant. There have only been, what, 20? 30? stories definitively involving this timeline (a few from Dr. Who, most of the first Death's Head series, and Dragon's Claws). The modern era would be well over 6100 years ago in the year 8162. How often do we see characters from before 4000BC in the mainstream comics? There are certainly plenty of instances; I'm just saying that it's not commonplace (meaning less frequently than every month at Marvel, which usually covers around 30 books).\nOK? I now return you to your regularly scheduled profile--Snood.\nPer Degaton observed \"Loki has mentioned his idea of Dragon's Claws taking place in the Doctor's side of the Omniverse, due to the presence as natives in 8162 of Doctor Who characters. The only thing I am wondering; whatever happened to Spratt (Death's Head sidekick from 8162)? When did he die? I ask this because I am wondering, when Death's Head met up with Earth-616 characters (and for that matter the Iron Man of 2020), was Spratt surprised to hear about them actually existing? After all, people from different multiverses tend to first hear of each other as fictional characters. If Spratt was shown as having known about the Earth-616 characters as actual historical characters, then might gum things up, but if he knew of them as fictional characters, then it would help.\"\nBut the fictional character rule doesn't always work, as Changeling notes \"Decalog 3: Consequences (a book of ten short stories featuring the Doctor) includes a tale which implies that the seventh Doctor often went back in time to introduce himself as a \"fictional\" character on worlds he fears may notice his continual meddlings in their history. I liked the idea of that, as in Remembrance of the Daleks (another one of the TV shows) it was shown that the Doctor Who TV show does indeed exist in his own timeline, and also Dr Who is a fictional character on Earth 616 (Excalibur I #1).\"\nAs Changeling says, the Doctor isn't adverse to taking the identity of a fictional character when it suits. The show in Rememberance of the Daleks wasn't actually named, as the programme cut away before the announcer could say what it was, and subsequent writers have decided it was the start of \"Professor X\", a show about a mysterious traveller in time and space who traverses the universe inside a pillar box (for the Americans, it's a red cylindrical box a little shorter than a man where you post letters for collection by the Post Office) called a TASID. By 1976 the character is played by British comedy actor Frankie Howard. And of course the idea is that the Doctor is, if not the actual creator of the show, the inspiration for it - someone who has met him in \"real life\" has based this character on him. Star Trek, in all its incarnations, has been clearly established as a fictional show in the Doctor Who universe, but there have been hints the Doctor knows some of the various Enterprise crew members for real. Their history as established by that show just doesn't fit with Doctor Who history, so it suggests that he met them in a cross-dimensional trip, and now may well have cashed in by supplying the idea to Gene Roddenberry for a percentage of the gross.\nSo by the same basis, the Doctor being a fictional character on Earth 616 could be down to the same thing - he may even have created the show himself to provide funds for when he is on Earth 616. Oh, and one last note - its now been firmly established that the other BBC science fiction show of the 1970's, Blake 7, IS part of Doctor Who's universe.\nOther incarnations of the Time Lord\nThe other Doctor at Maruthea, from the seventh Doctor's future, is commonly known as the Nth Doctor. He is based on Nick Briggs, an actor who played the Doctor in a series of fan-produced, unofficial audio plays in the early 1980's. Nick has subsequently gone on to write and produce a number of the official audio plays, and played the incarnation of the Doctor prior to Arabella Weir's in one of the Unbound series of audio plays. Ria was played by Patricia Merrick, Liz Knight and finally Heather Barker in the original fan audio plays. Bonjaxx's party marks his first comic appearance, but not his last. During one of the eighth Doctor's comic strip appearances the Doctor appeared to suffer severe injury and regenerated into this version, apparently making him the Ninth incarnation. It was subsequently revealed that the regeneration was a ploy to draw an enemy out while they believed the Doctor was vulnerable in the period just after his transformation. The Doctor was fine, and the being who had regenerated was in fact a disguised Shayde. So while we know that this is a future version of the Doctor, we still don't know which one. Other future incarnations of the Doctor include his Merlin self, also known as Muldwych. At first described as having red hair, by the time we encounter Muldwych he has spent 1000 years exiled on a barren future Earth, and is now white haired and balding. A series of actors played the ninth through thirteenth Doctors (listed above) for the charity programme Comic Relief, but even the most die hard inclusionist doesn't tend to treat this story as canon - just fun. The last known future incarnation of the Doctor is the 42nd incarnation (so somehow he got round the limitations on how many regenerations he could have; hardly a surprise, he's the consummate rule-breaker). This Doctor turned up in the epilogue of one of the official novels, although the editors cut him out before it went to print (spoilsports). He's been happily married since his previous incarnation.\nCameos\nStrictly speaking Bonjaxx's party on Maruthea should show up several times in the Doctor's history, as we see the leg of the departing sixth Doctor at the start of the story, and the fourth Doctor arrives at the end. But placing where in each of these incarnation's timelines this trip happened would be difficult, and frankly unimportant for this profile. The other individuals seen at the party in Doctor Who Monthly#173, other than those mentioned in the history above, include: Captain UK and Captain Britain (or similarly dressed members of the Captain Britain Corps), a female Silurian from Doctor Who, a Draconian (probably Salander of the Star Tigers, as his teammate Abslom Daak is present), Bart Simpson, Shayde, Steel and Sapphire (from ITC television series Sapphire and Steel), Worf (ST:TNG), an Ogron (Doctor Who), \u00a0a Werelok from Doctor Who strip Dogs of Doom (but not Brill, the Doctor's friend, because the number on his cowl is 4, not 3 as Brill's was), Axel Pressbutton (Warrior Magazine), Abslom Daak, Dalek Killer and leader of the Star Tigers (Doctor Who spin-off character), unknown person collapsed on the table, Doctor Asimoff (also from Doctor Who comic strips), the robotic Ticket Inspector from Doctor Who TV story \"Greatest Show in the Galaxy\", two Daleks in love, \u00a0a Wrarth warrior (from Doctor Who strip \"The Star Beast\"), a Sontaran (from Doctor Who, various stories), The Freefall Warriors (guys with FF logo) - Machine-Head, Big Cat, Bruce and Cool Breeze, all from the Doctor Who strip \"The Freefall Warriors\"; the Melkur, from the Doctor Who story \"Keeper of Traken\"; a Ferengi from Star Trek; the Hulk, the demon Melanicus (or perhaps another of his species), a Quark robot from Doctor Who \"The Dominators\", the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock, a pair of Indians with a flying fish (from Time Spirits, an Epic Comic); a Vervoid (Doctor Who: Trial of a Time Lord Parts 9-12); Giggles of the Cherubim; a Meep, possibly Beep the Meep, from Doctor Who strip \"The Star Beast.\"; an Ice Warrior (from Doctor Who), probably Harma, another member of Daak' Star Tigers; The Destroyer (from Doctor Who story \"Battlefield\"), Jetsam (from Doctor Who comic strip \"Junkyard Demon\"), a cybernetic cannibal (from Doctor Who strip \"End of the Line\") ; Morbius (from Doctor Who story \"Brian of Morbius\"), the Master (original Roger Delgado Master); the Mekon (from Dan Dare); Catavolcus, leader of the Neutron Knights; a robot member of Alien Guard, from the Doctor Who Strip \"The Iron Legion\"; an Alpha Centauri alien from Doctor Who; the Cyber Controller from Doctor Who story \"Tomb of the Cybermen\"; a Yeti; Mercurius, the last of Abslom Daak's Star Tigers; a Sensorite; Vesuvius, oldest robot in the Roman Empire, from the Doctor Who strip \"The Iron Legion\"; the Kandyman from the Doctor Who story \"The Happiness Patrol\"; the Giant Robot K-1 from the Doctor Who story \"Robot\", one of the White Robots from the Doctor Who story \"The Mind Robber\"; a Chumblie from the Doctor Who story \"Galaxy Four\"; Emma Peel (of the Avengers TV series); Meltron, guardian of the Time Witch's dimension, from the Doctor Who strip \"The Time Witch\"; John Steed (also of the Avengers TV series); and a Wirrn, from the Doctor Who story \"The Ark in Space\". Whew! Anyone who wants to play spot the character using the above can check the scanned version of this story available on The Death's Head Diary site.\nBut it's not over there, as the framing story in the Incomplete Death's Head reprint of the above adds more. Per Degaton noted \"Rocket Raccoon, the Hulk, Random, the Scarlet Witch, Doctor Doom, Doctor Strange, Namor, the Crazy Gang, Thor, Doctor Octopus, the Human Torch, the Silver Surfer, Adam Warlock, Apocalypse, and Conan (who wears a \"Crom Rules\" hat). Due to the peculiar nature of Maruthea, we cannot say as to whether these were the Earth-616 versions of these characters, or even if they were, we cannot place their appearances chronologically.\" Most of these characters appear as part of the framing sequence in Incomplete Death's Head #11.\nThere were plans for the Doctor to meet with Doctor Strange, which would have marked his first real encounter with an Earth-616 character. However this idea was shelved as an editorial decision was made to no longer have the BBC character interact with the Marvel Universe. Which I find both a pity, and a little weird when you take the preceding paragraphs into account - the Doctor has only just brushed against the fringes of the Marvel Universe.\nPer Degaton points out another meeting of the Doctor and the Marvel Megaverse (although still not Earth-616): \"Something of interest, in the recent X-Men:Chaos Engine trilogy of prose novels, the author Steve Roman made extensive use of Roma, Otherworld, Saturnyne, and Captain U.K. Not only that, but he remembered to sneak in an implied appearance of the Doctor from Gallifrey! In chapter 2 of book of two of the Chaos Engine, Roma has a comical Scotsman working for her as a Chief Physician. In chapter 23 of book three, \"a man well over six feet tall, with an enormous bush of brown curls that looked more like a party wig than natural hair\", \"dressed in a baggy gray suit and matching overcoat, and a wide-brimmed brown hat rested at a rakish angle on the back of his head\" appears. He says to Captain U.K. \"I make an exquisite cup of Darjeeling\". When asked his identity, this figure says he is the Chief Physician. Saturnyne says he is not, because the Chief Physician is much shorter, has less hair, and speaks with a Scottish twang. The man with the big hair states \"I'm just not the man I used to be....or will be......\". At the end of chapter 25, the big-haired man in the floppy hat says \"Would you care for a jelly baby\"? Ahem...... Of course, the big hair and floppy hat refer to the fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) while the short Scotsman refers to the seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy).\"\nSneaky little so and so gets everywhere! If Saturnyne didn't know who he was, that implies he was up to something, on some adventure of his own. And it wouldn't be the first time the Seventh Doctor has used an earlier incarnation of himself to carry out some obscure task for him - the Seventh Doctor cheated on several occasions when it came to fighting his enemies by using his foreknowledge of events and even by going back AFTER his battles with them to make sure certain things he needed where handily lying around for him to find EARLIER.\nHe also mentions \"Another oblique reference to the Doctor occurs in either Fantastic Four III#9 or III#27 (I think it was#9) The Doctor has almost certainly appeared in mainline MU. Somewhere about the place I have a Claremont FF (volume 3, the one where Manoli and Neal are filming a day in the life, also featuring Kay Cera but I can't remember the number or currently lay my hands on the book) where we find a phone-box shaped time travel machine, bigger inside, that Reed got from \"that Doctor friend of his.\" If that ain't The Doctor, then who is it?\"\nJohn 'Chud' Chidley-Hill mentions this reference as evidence of Marvel U.K. being part of Earth-616 (which some fans like to dispute). While interesting info, it doesn't really help with \"building the case\", for a couple of reasons. First, Marvel UK IS Earth-616 - the real debate should be if the rest of the Marvel Universe is Earth-616 (and the answer is, of course, yes). Second, the Doctor's interaction with Reed Richards doesn't prove a thing, since the Doctor isn't a native of Earth-616 / Marvel UK / etc.\n\" I wonder if Reed realises his friend the Doctor was responsible for stranding Death's Head on his roof that time? Perhaps the Doctor went back at some point to look for DH and bumped into Reed in the process?\" - Changeling.\nPerhaps the Doctor dropped DH off there knowing who the inhabitants were, and trusting they would be able to deal with the FPA.\n\"I like that theory. If I remember the story correctly there was something wrong with the FF's automated defense system because it began attacking the FF as well as DH. Perhaps this was a subtle manipulation on the Doctors part. He knew DH would likely trigger the systems, thus alerting Reed to the problem. He gets rid of DH, and helps his friends in the process. Perhaps he also wanted to introduce DH to Reed, in order to ensure Reed would help DH became the dominant personality of the Minion cyborg.\" - Changeling\nThe Doctor also appears to have interacted with Professor Alistaire Stuart of the Weird Happenings Organisation (WHO). Per Degaton notes that \"Alistaire Stuart of WHO mentions meeting someone from Gallifrey in Excalibur I#25. He explicitly calls it Gallifrey. Alistaire Stuart of WHO recalls having met somebody from Gallifrey (clearly the Doctor), during the CrossTime Saga where Excalibur travelled through parallel dimensions (much like the Sliders) and discussing trans-temporal relativity dynamics with him. The Doctor left him a torch-like device which can generate trans-temporal anomalies with resulting energy fractures.\"\nSpeaking of Alistaire, Colins Hicks wrote in to ask about the resemblance between Brigadier Alysande Stuart (Alistaire's sister) of W.H.O. and Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart of U.N.I.T. Well spotted. Chris Claremont is a fan of Doctor Who, and one of the Doctor's most frequent allies is the latter Brigadier. The two met back during the Doctor's second incarnation, when LS was only a Colonel, and the Doctor aided the British army in repelling an invasion of robotic Yeti who had occupied the London underground. Following this encounter, and with the assistance of (former Group Captain) Gilmore, who years earlier had repelled another alien invasion (the Daleks, with the help of the seventh incarnation of the Doctor) he successfully lobbied Parliament to set up a special army force dedicated to protecting humanity from such incursions. This force, which operated under UN mandate rather than UK, was the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, or UNIT, and Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart was promoted to Brigadier and put in charge of the British arm of it. The Doctor would long be associated with UNIT, working with them through many of his incarnations, and the Brigadier would become one of the Doctor's closest friends. (All from the TV series, except for the bit about GC Gilmore - he'd appeared in the TV series, but his involvement in the creation of UNIT comes from the novels)\nWhen he had been a Lieutenant, LS fathered a son on an African girl, Mariatu. This son, who took his father's surname (it's unclear whether LS married the girl, but they lived together for some 8 years, so it is likely), would be the first in a line of warriors which culminated in Brigadier Yembe Lethbridge-Stewart about a century from now. There was one more member of this line, Kadaitu Lethbridge-Stewart, who was brought up by Yembe as his daughter (though the exact family relationship is slightly more complex, as she was actually a genetically modified test-tube baby altered to be a supersoldier - her basic DNA came from Yembe though, so she is a Lethbridge-Stewart). Kadaitu would eventually become a time-traveller in her own right. (Transit novel). The original Lethbridge-Stewart married after Maraitu left him, to Fiona. They had a daughter, Kate, but then they divorced, partially because he could not tell her what he really did for the army. Kate would in turn have a child out of wedlock, and named him Gordon after his grandfather. (Downtime novel and video drama). Lethbridge-Stewart would eventually leave UNIT and remarry, this time to Doris (TV series, Battlefield story). An old man, he was rejuvinated / regenerated during another encounter with the Doctor (novel, Happy Endings). Sadly Doris died in a boating accident a few years later (novel, Shadows of Avalon), the Brig rejoined UNIT, and eventually became military ambassador to the extra-dimensional court of Avalon and consort to its queen (same novel).\nIn the X-Men (c.#217 I think) we see British soldiers clearing up after a battle between some of that mutant team and the Juggernaut. They wear UNIT patches (iirc) and refer to the Brigadier - a small in joke. But later, when Claremont set up Excalibur, he followed this idea up. He couldn't use UNIT again (copyright I would think) so it became WHO - the Weird Happenings Organisation (continuing the joke), with Brigadier Alysande Stuart. If the surname had been spelt differently there might have been a case to make that this was the child of the Earth-616 counterpart to the character in the Doctor Who universe, but since it isn't, we have to put it down to a nice in-joke / tribute.\nPer Degaton notes \"A Dalek is seen on page 24 of Excalibur I#14. This occurs when Excalibur, during the Great Muppet Caper......excuse me, the Cross-Time Caper, visit an Earth which apparently diverged during Acts of Vengeance, where superhuman battles have gone out of control apparently due to the Impossible Man's influence.\"\nThe Doctor is bipartisan and doesn't just visit the Marvel Universe, it seems:\n\"In the first issue of JLA Classified (by Grant Morrison, an author who also wrote a few Doctor Who strips for \"Doctor Who Magazine\"), a Dalek make a cameo in Batman's Sci-Fi Closet! On page 24 as Batman talks to Alfred, he tells him that he's going into his \"Sci-Fi Closet\". Inside that closet, in the lower right of the panel, is the unmistakable top of a Dalek - eyestock and all. \" - from Outpost Gallifrey, a Doctor Who news page.\nCarycomix: According to a \"Space Ghost FAQ\" website,\u00a0 HANNA-BARBERA TV-STARS # 3\u00a0 (Marvel Comics, Dec. 1978) featured a story in which SG met an eccentric old man named Nathaniel Pilgreem.\u00a0 The latter was a time traveler wanna-be who had invented a spaceship that resembled an_antique car from 1936!_\u00a0\u00a0 Could it have been the Third Doctor (post-reprieve)?\nLoki: Possibly inspired by the Doctor, but could as easily have been inspired by the Time Machine movie. Back to The Future did the car motif a few years later. Now Bill and Ted's time machine on the other hand...\nPretenders to the throne\nThere is another version of the Doctor though as far as Marvel is concerned. In Power Man and Iron Fist#79 the heroic duo encounter a Professor Gamble , an eccentric time traveller who lives in a house that is bigger on the inside and which can go anywhere in time and space. He is an enemy of the Dredlox (Daleks), mechanical monsters who utter the fearful cry of \"Incinerate!\" (Exterminate) as they attack. Having completed his goal of opposing these metal fiends with the assistance of the two heroes, he departs, leaving them at a loss as to who or what he had really been. A later author brought Gamble back and explained his origin, which kind of defeated the point. Oh, and in case anyone still doubts the idea that Gamble was meant to be a homage to the Doctor, \"A Gamble with Time\" was the original name for the Doctor Who story which eventually became \"City of Death\", something the writers of PM&IF were well aware of.\nAnd finally, Per Degaton also brings up the following fact. \"In Alf#38, Alf meets Doctor Whozonfirst, a Melmacian looking Fourth Doctor analog. Since Alf seems to have taken place on Earth-616 (the High Evolutionary's appearance in Alf Annual#1 is even included in his listing on the Marvel Chronology Project!) this may be of interest......\"\nby Loki\nCLARIFICATIONS: The Doctor should not be confused with\nDoctor Who, the star of two 1960's movies made by Amicus and a comic adaptation by Dell Comics.

Maybe there is a connection.\nThe TARDIS\nThe TARDIS is the Doctor's space-time craft. The letters stand for \"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\", a name thought up by Susan, the Other's grand-daughter, back in the Old Time on Gallifrey. The Doctor's ship is an antiquated Type 40, which suffers from many malfunctions. Theoretically the Doctor can pilot it anywhere in time and space, although he isn't known for his accurate piloting most of the time. The Doctor shares a telepathic bond with his ship, and often refers to her as \"Old Girl\". He sometimes suspects his piloting problems are down to the semi-sentient ship ignoring his instructions and going where she feels like going.\nThe TARDIS comes equipped with a Chameleon Circuit, which should disguise the ship as something inconspicuous whenever it lands somewhere new. However the Chameleon Circuit broke just after the Doctor landed in 1963 London, leaving the ship in the space of a Police Telephone Box (used by constables to call for help in the days before portable radios and mobile phones); the Doctor has attempted to fix the circuit on occasion, but generally isn't too bothered by this particular fault. Like all TARDIS, the Doctor's draws power from a captive black hole kept on Gallifrey, the so-called Eye of Harmony. Should the ship's direct link (also called the Eye of Harmony) to this source be opened unshielded then the planet the TARDIS is on will be torn apart\u00a0by the conflicting gravitational sources at the stroke of midnight (when the planet's native sun is on the exact opposite side of the planet from where the Eye is).\nThe interior of the ship is actually located in another dimension from the exterior, making the ship much bigger inside than the outer appearance would suggest. Because this outer appearance is merely a mathematical construct, a door to another universe, it is nearly invulnerable under normal circumstances, and the inside of the TARDIS can be disconnected from the exterior to prevent gravity or other outside forces from affecting the interior. The ship travels by dematerialising its outer shell from the universe it is in, and then reopening (rematerialising) a new exit at the point the pilot wishes to reach.\nSir Justin\nSir Justin was a medieval knight who was snatched by the power of the Event\u00a0Synthesiser from the middle of a jousting\u00a0tournament with Sir Hector\u00a0of Richmond, and deposited\u00a0in the late\u00a0twentieth century. Over the centuries the\u00a0jousting site had become a\u00a0small wooded\u00a0area near the village of Stockbridge, and at the exact time Sir Justin reappeared, the Doctor\u00a0was approaching his TARDIS, which he had landed nearby. Sir\u00a0Justin\u00a0rammed the TARDIS, was knocked\u00a0off his horse\u00a0and rendered unconscious. Taken into the\u00a0timeship by\u00a0the Doctor, he dedicated himself to assisting the Time Lord\u00a0with his mission to mend time, believing the Doctor to be an Angel of God (in spite of his protestations otherwise) and\u00a0their\u00a0work to be a holy crusade. He accompanied the Doctor to Gallifrey, then into the\u00a0madness of Melanicus' nightmare\u00a0dimension, to the White Hole of Althrace, and finally back to a time-frozen Stockbridge, where they confronted the demon\u00a0inside the ruins of a local church. There Justin\u00a0proved\u00a0pivotal to the battle, unmasking Melanicus using\u00a0a hat full of holy water, saving\u00a0the\u00a0Doctor from a\u00a0zombie, and then sacrificing his own life, leaping through a stained glass window to impale Melanicus\u00a0through the heart with\u00a0his sword.\nAfter time set itself right, the Doctor awoke in the restored church (now called St. Justinians), to find a statue commemorating his fallen companion. Unsure of how much of what he remembered had really happened, he read the epitaph beneath the statue: \"The journey has not ended here, for his spirit claimed, by death-knell's chime, lies waiting still, to cross once more a sea of stars, and sail the tides of time\"\n- Doctor Who Monthly#61, (62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67\n\"Gus\" Goodman\nAngus \"Gus\" Goodman was an American\u00a0pilot fighting\u00a0World War\u00a0II against the Japanese in the year 1963, in a time line that had been distorted by the Doctor's old enemy Mortimus (sometimes known as the Meddling Monk or the Time Meddler). He lost\u00a0a dog-fight and his\u00a0plane was shot down. Gus bailed out and parachuted down to a Pacific island where the Doctor had\u00a0recently arrived. The two hooked up, after an initial poor start where\u00a0Gus held\u00a0the\u00a0Time Lord at gun point, and together they tracked\u00a0down the Monk and his Ice\u00a0Warrior\u00a0allies, and\u00a0undid the\u00a0damage they\u00a0had caused.\nThey then set out to return Gus home, but as often happened with those travelling with the Doctor, they didn't get to the intended destination right away. One of the stops they made was on the planet Celeste, where they gained the enmity of\u00a0Dogbolter. Eventually the Doctor did get Gus to the right time period, only for\u00a0Dogbolter's bounty hunter, the Moderator, to catch them up as the two companions were exchanging farewells. Gus was gunned down by the mercenary, but returned fire with his service revolver, bringing down his attacker.

Instead of handing him\u00a0over, he helped the Doctor\u00a0gain revenge on the corrupt tycoon\u00a0and steal the bounty money. Adopting the name Frobisher (which he felt sounded very British and so would appeal to his new friend), the Whifferdill decided he best enjoyed the\u00a0form of a penguin (and indeed was briefly stuck in this\u00a0shape).

Fenric had a long-standing enmity with the Time Lord known as the Doctor, and wishing to position her to be used against his foe, Fenric engineered a time storm which swept the young girl away to the far future and the planet Svartos.

The two travelled together for a prolonged period of time, and there are various conflicting and mutually exclusive accounts of Ace's final fate - she died, she became a time travelling vigilante, she became a Time Lord herself - but given that the Doctor's enemies starting messing with the Time Lord's personal timeline around this point, they may all be accurate too.\nAce was with the seventh incarnation of the Doctor when he attended Bonjaxx's party.\nRia\nRia travelled with\u00a0the future (Nth) Doctor. Little is known about her, although it is believed that her physiology is unique, and not totally human. She travelled with her incarnation of the Time Lord for several adventures, and was accompanying him when he attended Bonjaxx's birthday party.\nShayde/Fey-Truscott Sade/\"Feyde\"\nShayde is a construct of the\u00a0Matrix, an artificial being\u00a0who carries\u00a0out missions for\u00a0the\u00a0minds\u00a0of the dead Time Lords who lie within. He first met the Doctor during the\u00a0Melanicus\u00a0crisis, when he\u00a0first covertly, then overtly assisted that Time Lord's battle with the\u00a0demon. He stowed away on board the TARDIS while the Doctor was on Gallifrey discussing the temporal\u00a0distortions caused by\u00a0Melanicus, and prevented\u00a0the Time Lord from being assassinated as he attempted to leave his homeworld. During the Doctor's trip\u00a0through the madness\u00a0of\u00a0Melanicus' dimension, Shayde shadowed him, saving his life time and again, and finally revealed himself to his\u00a0ally. Later he directed the\u00a0Doctor to Althrace, where he learned the true nature of the threat he faced, and where\u00a0Shayde was used\u00a0to link the minds\u00a0of the High\u00a0Evolutionaries, allowing them to stop\u00a0time itself with their combined powers. When the Doctor and Sir Justin confronted Melanicus in the church at Stockbridge, Shayde turned\u00a0the\u00a0course of the battle when he appeared before the demon and blinded him with two shots to the face, leaving him vulnerable to a final, fatal, attack by\u00a0the Doctor's knightly companion.\nShortly afterwards the Doctor's TARDIS was invaded by a malevolent entity. Back on Gallifrey Shayde coalesced into existence, only to realise he had not been given a directive. Allowed to act on his own initiative, he transferred himself to the TARDIS, where he assisted his former ally in expunging the entity from the ship. When the Doctor was put on trial by his people for his \"carelessness\" in allowing a potentially dangerous being to take control of a TARDIS,\u00a0which might then have allowed it to move on to do the same on Gallifrey, Shayde deliberately destroyed the evidence that might support this case, guaranteeing the Doctor his freedom.\nHe assisted the fifth incarnation of the Doctor a third time when a mutated creature living inside of the TARDIS tried to take control of the ship and murder the Time Lord and his two latest travelling companions, Erimem and Peri.\nYears later the eighth incarnation of Doctor was badly wounded, and his companions of the time, Izzy and Fey-Truscott Sade returned him to Gallifrey for medical attention. But while his mind was in the Matrix, his body was attacked by unknown assailants, who were thwarted in their deadly mission by the intervention of Shayde. The attackers proved to be part of a plot for an insane Time Lord to go back to the Old Time and usurp Rassilon as the founder of Time Lord society. Although the villain was defeated, the device he had intended to use\u00a0to alter history was activated, and in order to prevent it from causing untold destruction, the Doctor prepared to use his own body to short circuit it. Unknown to Fey and Izzy, Shayde offered an alternative, which would have an additional advantage.\nSince just prior to the end of his previous incarnation, the Doctor had been fighting a number of skirmishes with a group known as the Threshold. As well as engineering the death of Ace (one of his previous companions), they were clearly monitoring the Doctor through a deep-planted hypnotic manipulation of Fey - how else had she been able to read the TARDIS manual in\u00a0order to pilot the ship to Gallifrey when the Doctor had been injured, when that book was written in Gallifreyan script? Shayde assumed\u00a0the appearance of the Doctor, and took his place in short circuiting the time manipulating device. Afterwards he altered his appearance to make it look like he had regenerated into the future incarnation of the\u00a0Doctor seen at Bonjaxx's party. Knowing that Time Lord's are at their most vulnerable immediately after a regeneration, the Threshold took control of Fey and had her bring the ship to their hidden base. While the Threshold were busy dealing with \"the Doctor\", the true Doctor set about sabotaging their schemes. Revealing the nature of their deceptions, Shayde and the Doctor unmasked for the final confrontation. During this Shayde was attacked by the power behind the Threshold - his own prototype, a creature known as the Pariah. Pariah critically wounded the artificial being, and in order to prevent his demise, Fey allowed him to merge with her; with their combined strength they were able to destroy Pariah. The new gestalt entity, dubbed Feyde by the Doctor,\u00a0departed the TARDIS, each component feeling the calling of their separate responsibilities.\nIn the case of Shayde, this was Rassilon. In the case of Fey, this was King George of England. Fey was an agent of the British crown who\u00a0had previously met the Doctor during an unrecorded adventure involving \"the psychic weasels of Russell Square\". Given a whistle which could summon the TARDIS, she used it to call the Doctor to aid her in a case in 1939, at the end of which the Time Lord had been injured, precipitating the afore-mentioned trip to Gallifrey that concluded with her being bonded to Shayde.\nTwo years passed for Fey and Shayde before they met\u00a0the Doctor again. Fey was fighting the Nazis, and arguing with Shayde, who would not let her use their combined abilities to kill Hitler, lest it disrupt the web of time. But then they received a summons from the Doctor, who had watched Izzy be kidnapped before his eyes. With the aid of his old companion(s) the Time Lord recovered their lost friend, and Fey returned to the war.\n- (Shayde): Doctor Who Monthly#62, (63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 72, 73, 74, \"No Place Like Home\" Audio Play, \u00a0Doctor Who Monthly#263, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271\n- (Fey): Doctor Who Monthly#257, (258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271\n- (Feyde): Doctor Who Monthly#271, (318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328\nRassilon\nRassilon was one of the founder's of Time Lord society. Although it is now known that his body\u00a0rests in his tomb\u00a0on Gallifrey, his mind\u00a0remained active, usually manifesting itself within the Matrix, a repository of the minds\u00a0of\u00a0\"all\" the dead Time Lords of Gallifrey's past. The Doctor first discovered Rassilon's continued activity when four of his incarnations were brought\u00a0together inside The Tomb of Rassilon, where they witnessed a mental projection of Rassilon which appeared above Rassilon's inert body. Later the fifth incarnation of the Doctor, who had been at that gathering,\u00a0met Rassilon again,\u00a0during the Melanicus crisis. Rassilon, along with other \"High Evolutionaries\", advised the Doctor, and then worked in concert to freeze time, so that their chosen\u00a0agents could confront the demon. Shortly afterwards he ordered the Doctor placed on trial for carelessly allowing his TARDIS to be invaded by an elemental entity which threatened to then move on to Gallifrey as a result.\nIt wasn't until the eighth incarnation of the Doctor was severely injured and returned to his home world by his companions of that time that we saw Rassilon again, as he assisted the Time Lord's recovery. He was in return helped by the Doctor, who prevented a renegade Time Lord's attempt to replace Rassilon by altering Gallifreyan history. However Rassilon's ruthless darker side became more apparent when he tried to transform the Doctor into his pawn and assassin against a race of beings whom he had once deemed to dangerous to exist. Rassilon had imprisoned them, cutting them out of history, but had been unable to destroy them. Fearing their eventual escape, he sought to sacrifice the Doctor to save himself from their eventual revenge. The Doctor bested him, and Rassilon was last seen being thrown into the very prison dimension he had trapped this alien species in, to face their wrath.\n- The Five Doctors TV story, (Cat's Cradle: Time's Crucible novel (fb) - BTS), Remembrance of the Daleks novelisation, Doctor Who Monthly#47, 265, \u00a0The Five Doctors, Doctor Who Monthly#62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 74, 262, 263, 265, Zagreus audio drama, Neverland audio drama\nMorvane and Bedevere\nMorvane and Bedevere are two Time Lords and \"High\u00a0Evolutionaries\" whose minds\u00a0reside\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0Gallifreyan Matrix. They and Rassilon discuss important issues that threaten Gallifrey, and if necessary, they can activate a mental construct known as Shayde, which is fueled by their wills and can travel across the galaxy\u00a0to\u00a0carry out missions for them. They were first seen during the Melanicus crisis, and again, much later, when the injured\u00a0eighth incarnation of\u00a0the Doctor entered the Matrix to speed up the healing of his injured mind.\nAlthough it isn't stated, it would seem likely that they hail from Rassilon's time on Gallifrey and are (or rather were, when they were alive) womb-born Gallifreyans. (The Matrix was created by Rassilon, so they can't predate him, and Loom-born's minds are weaker, making them less likely to qualify as \"High Evolutionaries\"). They might even have been Rassilon's council in life, replacing his original partners, Omega and the Other.\n- Doctor Who Monthly#62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 262, 263, 265\nBonjaxx\nBonjaxx is an old friend of the Doctor's (going back to at least his fourth incarnation), and runs a\u00a0bar on the space station Maruthea, which is located at the centre of the space-time vortex. The Doctor likes to attend Bonjaxx's birthday\u00a0bashes at least once per incarnation, but seems to\u00a0always attend the same one (or maybe, given the nature of the station, there is only one).\nBonjaxx looks to be of the Daemon race, incredibly powerful beings who mostly died out millennia ago. Since the third Doctor mentioned he had never encountered one of these beings (just prior to encountering one), it would appear that he hadn't met Bonjaxx prior to this point, and that the first and second incarnations thus don't get to go to Bonjaxx's parties.\n- Doctor Who Monthly#173\nBeep the Meep\nThe Meep were a peaceloving race until their planet was exposed to \"black sun\" radiation, transforming them into a ravenous horde of galactic conquerors who reveled in torture and depravity. Their battle fleets were finally defeated during a massive space battle, but the leader of the Meeps, the evil Beep, escaped. Crashing on Earth with Wrarth warriors close behind him, he faked benevolence and gained the trust of a couple of Earth children. However when the Doctor (in his fourth persona)\u00a0stumbled into the situation, he soon realised the truth, and helped bring the war criminal to justice.\nFifteen years later he was given parole, and he returned to Earth, seeking revenge. Again his plots were thwarted by the fourth incarnation of the Doctor, who somehow trapped him inside a children's movie, For the Love of Lassie.\nThe Meep escaped and attempted to take revenge on Earth for the indignities it had heaped on him by using televised signals to take over the planet. This time he was thwarted by the sixth incarnation of the Time Lord.\nMuch later he attended Bonjaxx's birthday party at Maruthea, although he may not have been an invited guest. Blitzed out his skull, he made\u00a0a very poor attempt to kill the seventh and nth Doctors, and accidentally precipitated a bar room brawl instead.\nBeep was last seen having gone back in time to 1979, where he attempted to broadcast black sun radiation through people's televisions, thus transforming Earth into a psychotic world like his own. But at the television centre he planned to use he mistook\u00a0an actor called Tom Baker for his hated foe, and while distracted, the eighth incarnation of the Doctor stopped his plot.\nBeep was also seen in Doctor Who Monthly#250, but this was a VR version of him, not a genuine appearance.\n- Doctor Who Monthly#19-26, DW Yearbook 1996, The Ratings War audio play,\u00a0Doctor Who Monthly#173, 283\nLast updated: 03/02/07 (he's British, and time is important to his character - so the date goes the British way round)\nAny Additions/Corrections? please let me know .\nThe Doctor, The TARDIS, Ace, and Rassilon are \u0099\u00a0 and \u00a9 1963-2004 BBC.

But I agree with you in a sense. Sure WISE is completely correct that there are numerous types of media out there now compared to in the past, but that doesn't mean there wasn't more to do. There were just different things to do back then. Either way I suppose you can't compare, but to say there wasn't TV or DVD or video games and therefore less things to do isn't entirely acurate. Though obviously there is a loss of income for those who have decided that movie theaters have become more annoying than rewarding due to moronic individuals who only think of themselves and distract you from the movie experience and therefore they wait for the DVD. I suppose there were people back then that simply avoided the movie experience all together for that same reason and just never saw the movie. There would be no way to prove it, but it seems logical.\nAnd Wise you know I think you are Wise so don't think I'm ripping on your opinion, if it is your opinion or if you took someone else's opinion and made it your own as Evilbeagle might have pointed out, but I'm more or less trying to play the devil here and say that I agree that money isn't a way to prove which movie is the most successful, but rather the number of people that saw it, and maybe more importantly the number of people who saw it and loved it. GWTW was voted Paople's choice awards greatest movie of all time, but that was in the eighties, the older it gets the less viewers will be around that have actually scene it, so I guess things change with time regardless.\nJust a thought. I for one think GWTW is a better movie, but that doesn't mean I would chose to watch it over the other.\n1\nADD A COMMENT\nYou must be logged in to leave a comment.

It&#x27;s really good, and Frank <em>is</em> on top form.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tuesday, 21 July 2009\nComic Book Artist: Gary Frank\nI meant to do two of these a month, back when I was hoping to keep up a regular schedule. I've never done an art appreciation course, so I don't have the critical facilities to objectively judge comic book art, which is why I wanted to try a series of posts looking at what I like and hopefully why.\nToday, I'll be talking about Gary Frank, an artist on my list of favourites just outside my top 5 . Like a lot of people, I discovered Frank's art when he did a two-year run on Peter David's Incredible Hulk (between #401 and 425) back in 1993. It wasn't his first work (he started out doing work for Marvel UK on Motormouth & Killpower and Dark Angel) but he seemed to be fully formed as an artist straight off. That's not to say he hasn't got better as an artist in the intervening years, just that he seemed confident and strong in his style and storytelling in his first major work on a US superhero book. Especially as he was following fan-favourite Dale Keown on the run that made him 'hot'.\nOver the next few years, he did various books (including a run on Gen13 with John Arcudi) before becoming the artist on Peter David's revamp of Supergirl (is that series even part of continuity any more?). They already had the dynamic of a writer and artist in sync with each other, and Frank had proved he could do emotions and humour with the Hulk, so it was a good match, and Frank was able to draw a teenage girl that was actually recognisable as a teenager.\nAlthough he still did work for DC after this run, his next contribution was to the world of creator-owned properties, when he wrote and drew Kin, a six-issue limited series about a secret government agency discovering the existence of Neanderthals in Alaska that wants to steal their technology (because Neanderthals have larger brains than Homo sapiens and are stronger as well). I enjoyed it, and would have liked to have seen more from Frank, who proved he could write as well as draw.\nThe connection with Top Cow (who published the trade paperback) seems to have led to the step that started Frank on the path to his current superstar status, when he was paired with J Michael Straczynski on Midnight Nation, a 12-issue limited series about a police officer who has to go on a quest to find his soul when he becomes a 'Walker'. This led to Frank being the artist for when JMS revamped the Squadron Supreme in the MAX series Supreme Power, which had an adult take on the concept of the superhero and the scope to deal with that in the adults-only book. This first series lasted for 18 issues before it was decided, after two mini-series that Frank didn't draw, to restart the series as a non-MAX book and call it Squadron Supreme. However, this series only lasted for seven issues before JMS left, and the team wasn't brought back until the Ultimate Power crossover.\nWith the abrupt and bizarre end to Squadron Supreme, Frank needed something to keep him busy on his Marvel exclusive contract \u2013 he did cover and even worked on the Incredible Hulk again \u2013 but he decided to take up a DC exclusive contract when the Marvel one ended in 2007 and he became the defining Superman artist of the moment when he joined Geoff Johns for the Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes story in Action Comics and the Braniac story after that. There is also the World of Krypton storyline and he will be the artist on the supposedly definitive Superman Origin story, again with Johns, and he seems to be going from strength to strength. This is great news for someone who has enjoyed his art since the early days, and not just because he is a British chap.\nFrank has a clean and strong style, in the tradition of the classic modern superhero artists (going back to Neal Adams). He draws superheroes as they should be drawn (or as I believe they should be portrayed) \u2013 noble, beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, clear, unfussy.

Part of this is because I, myself, share Russian heritage (with my beard and last name, I know this must come as a shock). Due to this, I have always enjoyed Russian characters in comics, and of course this relates to the Winter Guard. However, the characters have been painfully underused in comics as of late, appearing in the opening arc of Jeph Loeb's Hulk run as well as a single one-shot which really was some brief story angled around an excuse for a reprint. Granted, that one-shot also acts as a segue into this story, but the Winter Guard really have not had due time to shine.\nBut that's not what Gallaher and Ellis want! With their incredibly brief time at Marvel, they have brought back the Winter Guard to some form of \"prominence,\" and by that I mean they have reminded us of who they are. Cue Darkstar and the Winter Guard issue 1, a nice and surprisingly pleasant/pleasantly surprising beginning to what I hope will be a rather entertaining mini. In our first issue, Gallaher and Ellis introduce us to the world that they want the Winter Guard to mainly operate in - one of marketability as well as rigid command. Red Guardian is a strict later, Ursa Major is our vicious but still most lovable (and almost \"comic relief\" character), Darkstar is our unsure of herself character, and Crimson Dynamo is the newbie (having been recruited after the events of Hulk: Winter Guard). It's easily accessible to new readers, which is highly important with something like this, but also has enough in the story that allows older fans of the Winter Guard to say, \"Oh yeah! These guys know what they're doing!\", which you can see by the last page.\nNeedless to say, handing the keys to the vodka-mobile to these two was a great idea by Marvel. Gallaher's love for the characters really shows through in the writing, even in something as short and sweet as this first issue. I'm not entirely sure why the mini has a Darkstar at the front of it, considering all the characters get good and equal treatment here, but I digress. I'd say that anyone willing to take a chance with this issue would find it easy to come at home with the book and the characters, as all are rather easily likable - even the new Red Guardian. Ellis' art also looks absolutely fantastic, and definitely the cleanest and smoothest it's ever been considering he didn't do all the inking. Not that I dislike his own personal inking, but this issue had such a different look to it that I thought was really impressive. It was as if I was looking at someone completely different's art, yet it was still obviously Ellis.\nGallaher and Ellis make a fantastic duo, and so far I'm really excited for their future work with the Winter Guard. In all honesty, I'd love to see a team like this (both in the comic and the pair authoring the book) find a home within the Marvel U and it's fanbase. I'm already a little sad this is going to be so short, but if anything I hope it opens the door for future stories with these characters, because I'm already getting behind this series a lot.\nFinal Verdict: 9.1 - Buy\nSuperman/Batman Annual\nI can't say I've ever been a huge fan of Batman Beyond. I don't why this is, but I never really got into it at the time. As I get older and look back on the cartoons I watched as a kid, I definitely have a stronger appreciation for these properties, and a rewatch of them generally finds me highly entertained. While I am definitely not one of those people who are freaking out beyond freaking out at the return of Batman Beyond the DCU, I was definitely intrigued by this particular issue. Not only does this act as the first official comic for Batman Beyond since 2001 (not including his brief guest appearances), but it's actually his second appearance in Superman/Batman (the first being issue #22 by Loeb). Now we have the pen of superstar Paul Levitz, so you can only imagine how good the issue would turn out to be.\nAnd good it was! This issue felt 100% worth the purchase to me, and often times I can't say that about books I take \"risks\" on buying. With the high price of this issue, it being an annual in a series I stopped following, there as a high chance that I would ultimately be disappointed. However, given the nature of the story and it's ability to function as just a one-shot, my entry into it was great. On top of that, it is basically all story. There are VERY few ads in this issue, and that was fantastic. I really felt like I paid a good price for the amount of content I was given, and considering DC has upped it's basic prices a good deal already, I'm happy to say that.\nThe issue follows the future Batman as a set of hoodlums from Metropolis come to Gotham because of a mysterious \"ghost.\" This, of course, leads Terry to investigate into the series of events only to reveal that Superman has returned to the dystopian Metropolis with the hopes of overthrowing Luthor from his seat of power in a good old fashioned team-up that felt both relevant and poignant for the story. High kudos to Paul Levitz on this one, because the fact that Paul Levitz wrote it was ultimately the selling point for me. I don't have much interest in the upcoming mini based on the writer, but I felt like Levitz was a name I could definitely trust, especially with his recent Legion related works. My trust was well met as I highly enjoyed the issue with it's multiple narratives and clean flow of story. If every issue of the future Batman Beyond mini was like this, I'd be stoked.\nOh, and how about the artistic duo of Renato Guedes and Jose Wilson? I loved the look and feel of this issue. It was very fitting towards the world and story being presented but at the same time largely paying tribute to the source material of the cartoon. It was like a more adult update to the animated 'verse, and it looked wonderful. Stylish and appropriate throughout, the world of Neo-Gotham and Dystopic Metropolis couldn't have looked better.\nSuffice it to say, if you're a Batman Beyond fan, this is a must buy for sure. Heck, i dystopic f you're interested in what a Batman Beyond comic could and should be like, you should buy this comic. Or if you just like stories about futures and crazy alternate versions of classic heroes and villains... well, here you go! Plus, with the amount of story you get in this bad boy for the price? It's easily a very worthwhile and rounded package.\nFinal Verdict: 8.9 - Buy\nRed Hood: Lost Days #1\nThere are two things I am generally not a fan of: Judd Winnick's writing and Jason Todd's return. I have learned to live with the latter as his character becomes more relevant in the modern DCU and I have learned to become complacent with the former, but there haven't really been too many occasions when I've actively enjoyed the two combined. Winnick's role in Justice League: Generation Lost is fantastic so far though, as that book is a gold mine of entertainment, so I decided to try out this Red Hood mini. My general hope with the title is that all the issues about the jarring return Todd had before will now be \"fixed\" due to the resurrection (if you can even call it that?) being more fleshed out.\nSuffice it to say, I believe my one hope here will be sufficiently sated.\nIn the first issue of the Red Hood, Jason Todd is picked up by Talia al Ghul from his mindless wanderings as she hopes to fix him. The first issue covers between when she finds out he is dead and the moment she pushes him into the Lazarus Pit. The most that we had ever known about Jason Todd's return was from details we had learned about from the 25th Batman Annual (also written by Winnick), so already I was enjoying this issue due to the fact that it actually took time to discuss his mysterious return. I always thought Jason Todd's return was brushed over quickly, but I felt like in this - even though he has no real memories yet - it helped have it make a tad more sense. If nothing else, it served as a fleshing out of his relationship with Talia Al Ghul, a character whose general relationship to Batman himself has always been quite interesting.\nSince I am often an avidly outspoken as to my distaste for Winnick's writing, I think it goes to say a little something as to how much I enjoyed this issue. For the reasons I already touched upon, the book reads incredibly well. The characters are well written, and as I've said I really enjoy that the events are being more fleshed out. It seems more natural now, and the story flows. Raimondi's artwork is great as well, really capturing the tale vividly. They couldn't have picked a better artist to capture Winnick's writing, and the \"fight scenes\" are very well choreographed and fun to read. I love Raimondi's look for the al Ghul's, and even the young and not-quite-jaded-yet Todd, and I'm really looking forward to how he draws some of the later elements of the story.\nYou can tell by the end of this issue that the mini will (assumedly/hopefully) do a good job of covering more bases than the original story, which I think will probably make me enjoy the \"Under the Hood\" arc more upon a re-read. I'm really quite happy I enjoyed this book, actually, because the Red Hood/Jason Todd's return is such a huge part of the current Batman saga that my generation has grown up reading, and it's something I've always disliked - even if I like Jason Todd in things like Countdown and Morrison's Batman and Robin. I'm just glad something is being done to make me appreciate his return in the first place.\nFinal Verdict: 8.6 - Buy\nHawkeye And Mockingbird #1\nWith the Heroic Age coming, I'd say that the return of a Hawkeye on-going was my most anticipated element, let alone the fact that Clint would be in his normal costume. Jim McCann also returning to the book after the New Avengers mini-series he did was equally exciting, because it would mean that there would be resolution to the threads he started. It was a very exciting prospect.\nHowever, the issue in itself didn't exactly pan out. While I still love the character of Hawkeye, I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to get behind this title. It's not that I have anything against them or even McCann, but after reading a lot of the action in this book, it felt rather forced and at times kind of hokey. I guess when Hawkeye and Mockingbird are calling each other pet names and \"lover\" during battle. That and the opening sequence, in the way that resolves, leaves me raising one eyebrow.\nThere are two other things I want to make note of. The first is, I don't really like how all Hawkeye stories have washed over his change back into being Hawkeye. Bendis briefly touched on it (and even that's putting it lightly), but I would've liked SOME kind of acknowledgement of the change from Ronin to Hawkeye. The second note is - this book has a lot of striking similarities to a certain other publishing companies old team-up book between a male archer and a female with a bird name, and if Clint (i.e. Jim McCann) had put the word \"pretty\" in front of the nickname he called Bobbi, it would have been that other book. Basically. Which to me is incredibly odd and a tad bit disconcerting, but I suppose these things do happen.\nOn the other hand, what's neat about the title is that McCann has clearly done his character for Bobbi Morse, a character who hasn't really been relevant in quite some time. Bringing back an old foe and updating her for the new series shows the knowledge and research that went into the creation of this title. The other side of this, though, is that in an age where anyone and everyone is supposed to be able to get into new titles, bringing back the Phantom Rider and the Slades out of nowhere isn't exactly making it easy for new fans.\nHowever, one thing I think everyone could probably get behind is that David Lopez makes this issue look great, especially teamed up with Nathan Fairbairn. The book almost looks like Jamie McKelvie's Phonogram art, and that only makes me love it even more. Very sleek and wonderfully colored, the art is arguably my favorite thing about the issue. Lopez has such a stylized way of drawing his characters and settings, it draws me right into the tale and keeps the action sequences excellently paced.\nUltimately, I'm undecided on Hawkeye and Mockingbird. There are things I like a lot (the art, the continuity) and there are things I really dislike (the dialogue). I feel like I'm going to have to at least give this book an arc before finally deciding, because there is a lot of hype and expectations on this title on my part, but for now the book gets a meager shrug of the shoulders.\nFinal Verdict 6.9-7.1 - Browse/Buy at your own discretion\nDAVID'S REVIEWS\nGood. God.\nRobert Kirkman\u2026Ryan Ottley\u2026Cliff Rathburn\u2026FCO Plascencia\u2026you guys are intense!\nSeriously, this issue of Invincible which also happens to be the second (SECOND) issue of The Viltrumite War mega-arc also happens to be a complete bloodbath, featuring a knockdown drag out fight between Conquest and Invincible that puts their previous battle to shame. A battle, if you remember correctly, featured Invincible\u2019s girlfriend murdered (temporarily) and Invincible himself having broken nearly every bone he has. So yeah, when I say that this fight is pretty gnarly, I am most definitely not kidding.\nThe entirety of the issue deals with the ramifications of the last one, in which a trio of Viltrumites shows up to take out the mothership of the incoming war fleet \u2013 led by the aforementioned Conquest. This issue is a showdown between those opposing forces, and really is a showcase for Ryan Ottley and the rest of the art team. They step up to the plate and knock this issue out of the park, capturing the brutality and the hatred between these two sides with a real sense of power and the moment. This book, for all its blood and gore, has never been more beautiful.\nKirkman himself sets the stage for his art team and lets them run rampant as a good writer should. He also has a lot of clever bits of storytelling in here, such as mid-fight when Oliver loses his breath and has to go planetside before he can recapture the fray, leading to Conquest pursuing him to finish him off (\u201clook at this\u2026the weakest strays from the pack, ensuring its demise.\u201d \u2013 INTENSE!). Some comics you read and think \u201cho hum, no one will really die\u201d but Invincible is never one of them. To me, even Mark Grayson feels on the verge at times (especially this issue), and Kirkman does a better job of that than ANYONE in comics. Bravo to him.\nThis is just superb work from everyone. Kirkman\u2019s teams on this and The Walking Dead are as consistent as anyone in the comic game today, and this issue just continues to prove why they\u2019re the best.\nFinal Verdict: 9.6 - Buy\nDemo #5\nThis is an interesting issue for me as a reviewer, as to I have a hard time distinguishing whether or not it\u2019s my failing as a reader or the comic\u2019s failing at its job that led me to not connecting fully with this issue. It isn\u2019t even the issue at the whole that I have a hard time with \u2013 it\u2019s simply hard to figure out what exactly is happening up until the title page. I understand that our lead is a stock trader and a lover with awful morning-after etiquette, but the fourth and fifth pages throw me for a loop entirely.\nThe rest of the issue is mostly superb though, revealing that our lead is in fact a time traveler (hence why she is so incredible as a stock trader) and one that is going back to a watershed moment in her life to fix all of her relationship issues once and for all. The moments Lisbeth shares with little/old Evey, the moments she shares with herself\u2026those are touching and exceptional work from Brian Wood. He has an incredible gift of giving inspirational and course changing speeches in his books that never come across as preachy, and the one in this issue is a top performance from him. Even I was feeling the motivation from Lisbeth as she told her younger version that this doesn\u2019t have to be her life, and it will be that way \u201conly if you let it.\u201d Exceptional stuff.\nStrangely enough, another faltering in this issue (to me at least) is that it steps into hard sci-fi and eventually concludes with a battle between Lisbeth and her time traveling abusive father. It seems like a pitfall these creators would normally avoid, but the story groaned when these moments came up \u2013 she\u2019d already beaten her father down\u2026why wouldn\u2019t we just have the issue with the happy ending and not include the second show down? It seemed odd to me, and to disrupt the positive flow of the story.\nBecky Cloonan\u2026she\u2019s just a giant(ess) amongst men. Her work on this series has lapped the field and then some, continuing to bowl me over month to month with her incredible design and beautiful line work. Her work touches on so many styles and uses so many different methods to effectively convey the story. Cloonan just continues to astound me. The page where she first returns to the present after her jaunt to 1979 depicting Lisbeth in an empty room is powerful in its starkness, using dense shades juxtaposed with the bright time travel door to escalate the image to a higher plane.\nWhile I didn\u2019t love this issue and would put it towards the bottom of my list of all Demo issues, it\u2019s still a very good one and a challenging read that will likely get better for me the more I read it. Additionally, every issue gets the bonus of the delightful follow up sections from Wood and Cloonan \u2013 I really wish every writer/artist would do what they do after each issue. A nice effort, assuredly, but one I didn\u2019t connect to fully.\nFinal Verdict: 7.5 - Buy\nEnder in Exile #1\nI was a bit skeptical of this mini, as gone were Mike Carey and Chris Yost along with Pasqual Ferry and Sebastian Fiumura, to be replaced with Aaron Johnston and Pop Mhan. While I was semi-familiar with Pop Mhan and met seeing his name with a positive reaction even though I didn\u2019t know why, Johnston was a complete unknown to me. Still, with the guiding hand of Orson Scott Card leading the way, it\u2019s hard to imagine they won\u2019t be successful in this series that fills in some of the gaps of Ender and Valentine\u2019s travels to the Formic homeworld.\nGiven that I\u2019m a huge fan of Ender\u2019s Game, this story was an especially interesting entry into the series for me because a lot of it felt fresh. While the primary Ender series that preceded this felt redundant in their artistic envisioning of the book, it was the Bean minis from Mike Carey that really came to life in my eyes. Given that this is fresh material with the prodigal duo of the book, this is even more exciting, and Johnston doesn\u2019t disappoint in his rendering of the story. His grasp on Ender and what he would do in this situation is well thought out, and the quick development of a villainous figure is solid work from him. From a plotting standpoint, I enjoyed it greatly. However, one of my consistent beefs with this series is the persistent aping of Card\u2019s dialogue by these talented writers \u2013 it doesn\u2019t bridge the gap between the book and the comic, it just mitigates the power of the story.\nMhan quickly reminds me of why my initial reaction to his name was a positive one, as this is one of the prettiest issues of the collected series to date. Considering the uniform high quality of art (Ferry and Fiumura killed it in minis past), it\u2019s very enjoyable to see Mhan live up to their already high standards. His Ender, for one, is the most distinct and fully realized Ender from any of the artists, and I for one was very thankful for that addition.\nBasically, if you\u2019re a fan of Ender\u2019s Game, this is a worthy read for you. If you aren\u2019t I highly suggest you going out to getting the books ASAP because you\u2019re missing out on some damn fine work, and then getting out there to get these comics too. It looks like the unknown duo of Johnston and Mhan will be living up to the legacy of this series very well after all.\nFinal Verdict: 7.2 - Buy\nGIL'S REVIEWS\nThe Thanos Imperative #1\nLife is cancer, and death is the universe\u2019s way of cleansing that cancer. I get it, DnA, that\u2019s totally what you\u2019re going for.\nIn the inaugural issue of The Thanos Imperative (second if you count the Ignition title that released last week, The Cancerverse is invading and it\u2019s up to our plucky group of misfits to save the universe before it\u2019s too late. Thanos, the Mad Titan and would be God, has even reluctantly joined them, based on the threats of a raccoon driving what looked like the thing Sigourney Weaver piloted in the movie Aliens. It got the job done though, and now we have the curious team-up of Thanos and Drax the Destroyer, someone made to KILL The Mad Titan. It\u2019s a lovely little twist to the story, which has major implications for the rest of the universe.\nIt\u2019s far from a perfect issue however. The weakest point of the title is the art. Sometimes I was pulled out by some lazy penciling. At one point, I stopped reading and looked through the entire book because it seemed Thanos was missing his nose. Is that a small problem? I\u2019d say not. While he\u2019s not human, he still has a nose, and has always had a nose. Inconsistent character designs bother me. But the odd thing is, sometimes the art is absolutely stunning. I don\u2019t understand what happened. Was Miguel Sepulveda running behind on deadlines? I guess your guess is as good as mine.\nI\u2019m going to keep on reading, because there seems to be some foreshadowing with the appearance of The Silver Surfer, out of action, just observing what\u2019s going on. I hope he shows up, and SOON.\nFinal Verdict: 6.5 - Browse\nBrightest Day #3\nYou know, I\u2019ve figured out Brightest Days biggest failing. There is no way something like 52 can work in continuity, because when it is, we get something like Countdown, which was terrible beyond words. Brightest Day should have been a group of mini-series\u2019 focusing each on the characters that have come back and star in this bi-weekly series (Firestorm, The Hawks but not Hawk, Deadman, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman and Mera) instead of a channel flipping style set up. It feels stilted and forced. I\u2019m not feeling it. I\u2019m sticking around, but it\u2019s just not meshing the way it should. Turn it around DC, I know you can, you have some of the most talented artists and writers in the game on your side. Make it happen.\nThat being said, there are some solid ELEMENTS of the story in this book. Deadman continues to be the most interesting if infuriating portion of the story (the ring responding with \u201cOKAY\u201d absolutely killed me) and Martian Manhunter\u2019s story makes me hope for more of it, if for the fact the mega talented Patrick Gleason is doing the art. He\u2019s a favorite of mine, and this continues to prove it.\nThis book is slowly but surely dipping off my radar as it doesn\u2019t really seem to be going anywhere soon. I hope it picks up. At least the art is really good, if grisly.\nFinal Verdict: 6.0 - Browse\nHercules: Twilight of a God #1\nWhat did I just read? I\u2019m not entirely sure. Hercules has always been a fantasy character, and this book did the impossible, it made him into a Sci-Fi character. I\u2019m not sure it really works for the most part, as it feels a lot like Star Wars: Episode I felt. A little bit of political intrigue mixed with a lot of back-story and interpersonal relations that don\u2019t resonate as well as they should. But at least there\u2019s the sense of humor. My Lord is this book funny. A running joke seems to be \u201cHerc did my sister! AWESOME!\u201d and it never failed to put a smile on my face.\nThe art was pretty standard, as it had a similar feel to the Incredible Hercules title. Something I genuinely appreciated. Herc was still Herc and I really liked it.\nI can tell this is basically filler, giving us a Hercules title until the end of the Amadeus Cho book when I can assume Hercules can come back. Unless this book doesn\u2019t take place in canon at all; which makes this book a stupid exercise.\nFinal Verdict: 5.5 Browse\nJustice Society Of America #39\nNazis have a valued place in the history of comics. They\u2019re reliably evil and the best go-to for absolute tyranny. I\u2019ve said it before, and even if I hadn\u2019t it\u2019s a well known fact. The problem is that I couldn\u2019t really connect with the book one bit. Despite the acclaim that Days of Future Past gets, stories like that ultimately don\u2019t matter because they\u2019ll never be canon. No matter what happens, unless it\u2019s referenced in the Legion of Super-Heroes, it doesn\u2019t matter one bit.\nAs they go though, it\u2019s told in such a way that makes it at least passably interesting. I\u2019m not entirely sure how Captain Nazi (I mean COLONEL Nazi) could take out the entirety of the Green Lantern Corps, but ok, I guess it works.\nThe art is serviceable and it tells a truly bleak story that is truly bleak. If you don\u2019t mind non-canon stories and want to see Superman killed by Nazis? Go right on ahead. I can\u2019t recommend it though, for obvious reasons.\nFinal Verdict: 5.0 \u2013 Browse\nMan guys what happened? It seems like the more books Willingham writes the lesser quality all of them are\u2026\nBRANDON'S REVIEWS\nI, Zombie #2\nMike Allred is a golden god fanpeeps. This is nothing that any self-respecting comic fan doesn\u2019t already know though. His art is so unique in the medium despite some attempts to ape his style and when you add his wife\u2019s coloring of his work it truly helps to solidify his status as a living legend of the business. While he doesn\u2019t blow us away with brilliant panel designs or whacked out character designs his art has a timeless feel that is instantly recognizable and undeniably eye attracting. This issue\u2019s art was very much so in line with this description. The story I didn\u2019t feel as strongly about.\nChris Roberson gives us a decent issue in which we are further introduced to the motivations and quirks of our main character as well as the supporting cast and people who populate the world in which this title exists. At times though I found myself thinking, \u201cOk, and\u2026\u201d. As a whole the issue really didn\u2019t grab me and let me know why it was worth my time and money.\nI truly feel that the art carried this issue through some rather slow points. Are the slow points acceptable slow points? Yes, it is early and setup is required if we are ever to get the emotional investment required to make a book matter. Some people are experts at this, Bendis\u2019 first few issues of Ultimate Spider-Man stand out as an example of this expertise. Roberson just didn\u2019t bring it this issue as much as I felt he did in issue #1.\nNow, is there enough between the first issue and the second to warrant picking up this issue let alone a third issue? Without a doubt my friends. The concept is fun and the art is\u2026well\u2026you already know. I am sure that the pace will quicken and the story will evolve and become something more given the time to flourish. Having to look at the issue as an individual stand alone issue though I would have to say I wasn\u2019t impressed.\nFinal Verdict: 6.5 - Browse\nBulletproof Coffin #1\nI purchased this issue based solely on the fact that I rather enjoy the covers and some of the interior art I had seen were Mike Allredesque. I guess there is also the fact that I really enjoy David Hine\u2019s work as well. Outside of those three things I knew absolutely nothing else going into this issue. I hoped for the best but remained wary of disappointment. I was not disappointed though and while I found my Allredesque judgment of the art to be rather off base I still found it to have a similar vibe.\nHine gives us a story about a gravedigger with a twist. Instead of robbing the dead\u2019s grave he instead robs their homes. When the main man of this title does so he seemingly finds himself in possession of a comic issue that is not only rare, it shouldn\u2019t exist at all. As the story progresses the mystery deepens and the creepy factor becomes deliciously apparent. Between Lester the dog, transvestite Dad and the final page I was sufficiently pleased that the weirdo quota had been more than filled.\nShaky Kane is on art and while I am sure this is a pen name I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to do much looking into who the artist really is. I found his art had the Allred flavor that is pays homage to the Silver Age of comics. Kane\u2019s art was good but not great. I would have found it all the more enjoyable had the art taken on two styles. One style for the main story and another style for the comic within the comic would have been optimal I think this would have added an extra layer to the comic that would have helped it reach that next level experience.\nThe comic when it\u2019s all said and done was rather different and that is a good thing. It left me wondering where this was all headed and what was going on in the last page. It really had me looking forward to issue two, which I named one of my most looked forward to issues for the month of July based on solicitations. This issue was a positive sign that I made a good choice.\nFinal Verdict: 7.7 - Buy it\nJoker's Asylum: Riddler\nFucking brilliant work. I can honestly say I walked away from this book truly impressed by the storytelling as well as the art. If you\u2019re familiar with my low ratings for comics that while enjoyable didn\u2019t blow my mind and are hoping to read another train wreck like that than expect to be disappointed. This issue was solid. SOLID.\nThe story as written by Peter Calloway revolves around a Joker narrated tale about the Riddler who falls in love with a woman and tries repeatedly to obtain her affection through various methods. The story seems rather straightforward but there is a continuing thread about a mystery individual who is pulling strings in the background. In the end the reader wants to know whom the individual is but the Joker refuses to tell and instead tells the readers the clues are within the story and that we as readers shouldn\u2019t be lazy and should go back and figure it out. \u201cA riddle in a story about the Riddler\u201d, Joker says, \u201cHow delightful\u201d, he finishes. This sums up the story and the feeling I have for the issue perfectly in that order.\nThe art as done by Andres Guinaldo is also really well executed. While it isn\u2019t as brilliant as the writing it still is strong and rather integral to the entire riddle within the story. Without the bright as day clues hidden throughout the story the reader would be lost in the riddle without answers. I really enjoyed the panel that contained the spade made of a shirt with the Riddler lying on the floor next to it. Overall, strong stuff in this issue as far as the arting goes fanpeeps.\nSo in the end I have nothing but positive things to say about this issue. Did you figure out the character in the story? I\u2019m pretty sure I did. If you haven\u2019t let me just say it\u2019s worth the reread to figure it out.\nFinal Verdict: 8.9 - Buy it!\nSweet Tooth #10\nLet\u2019s take a journey through the mind of an animal/human hybrid and trace it back to its roots shall we? This issue seems to set the tone for the title as it moves into its next phase. While it wasn\u2019t mind blowing as far as the story itself goes, I did find the art to be the best of the series thus far.\nJeff Lemire without a doubt continues to bring us a story that is as unique as it is compelling but this issue was solicited as one of the more bizarre of the bunch and while it may have been one of the more bizarre issues of the series so far it really wasn\u2019t that insanely bizarre. I found the use of hypnotism to unlock the secret\u2019s of Gus\u2019 mind to be a great plot point for the issue but not bizarre in the slightest.\nThe art is where I really found the enjoy ability of this issue. I found the two-page spread of Gus and the doctor on Gus\u2019 head to be really great. My favorite pages by far and maybe one of my favorite pages of the series is Gus and the Doctor stepping back into Gus\u2019 ear to reenter his mind. That fanpeeps was a brilliant page. Brilliant. A page in which I would die to own the original art to.\nThis series continues to be one of the better titles on the shelves but at times I feel it is too slow and the point behind it all seems at times to be lost amongst the need to establish it. It has too much introduction and not enough definition. I do enjoy this book and will continue to pick it up in large part because of consistent brilliances like the ear entrance page. Lemire seems to grow before our eyes despite already being a ridiculously brilliant character writer.\nFinale Verdict: 7.6 - Buy It\nWALT'S REVIEWS\nAdventure Comics #12\nI really enjoyed both Superman and the Legion of Superheroes and Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds, so I asked a friend who was more knowledgeable about the Legion for some recommendations. After reading all sorts of Paul Levitz-penned goodies, including the amazing Great Darkness Saga, I was incredibly excited to hear that the same Levitz would be writing two Legion-centered ongoings this year.\nFor those who haven't heard yet, Legion of Superheroes consists of completely new stories set further in the Legion's future, while Adventure Comics will feature earlier tales of the Legion, particularly involving Superboy. With all sorts of Crises over the years, the Legion's place in continuity has been all over the place in the past, but with Infinite Crisis and yet another retelling of the big blue boy scout's origin, the original incarnation of the Legion is back, and Levitz is here to ease their past into the difficult-to-sift-through mess that is DC continuity.\nThis issue was essentially a one-shot to give new readers a feel for the new direction the book is taking, and it's a good one in my opinion. The wordiness and the melodrama that some had a problem with in the first issue of the new Legion ongoing isn't present in this at all; rather, this looks like it is going to be capturing all the fun of the original series of the 60's (that is, even before Levitz), something that is sorely lacking in a lot of mainstream comics. If you're like me and have had your interest piqued in the Legion due to their recent re-exposure in the Superman books, this is definitely something to pick up. Plus, it's perfectly accessible to newcomers!\nFinal Verdict - 7.2 - Buy it!\nRed Robin #13\nI was really hesitant about continuing to pick this up after Fabian Nicieza replaced Christopher Yost (have I said that enough?), but I'll admit, this wasn't bad. It wasn't really good either, but hey, better going from excellent to kinda good than excellent to terrible, no?\nThis just looks like it will be a continuation of Nicieza's story from the last issues of the Robin solo series, wherein Tim tried a little War Games of his own. While that arc wasn't great, it's probably my favorite work of Nicieza's over at DC, so I'm at least slightly interested. For whatever reason, Red Robin seems to be the title that really glues the rest of the Bat-books in regular DC continuity, giving context for what happens when in each of the books and when that all happens in relation to the rest of the DCU. Anyways, I digress. While this just looks like it's going to just end up being your average superhero beat-em-up, so whether or not one enjoys the title will really depend on if you like the characters or not.\nI already said more or less the same thing last week, but man Marcus To is a great artist. I wouldn't have even bothered giving Nicieza another chance if To had left the book. The best word to describe the art is simply \"clean\"; everything is as clear as can be, and the various inkers have done a great job of keeping the art that way. I can't wait to see what other books he may do in the future; personally, I would love to see him on a Superboy title.\nFinal Verdict: 6.7 - Browse, but it's worth picking up if you were reading Yost's run.\nAvengers: The Origin #3\nWhen this series was originally solicited, I was looking forward to it, but now? Color me unimpressed. The first two issues were alright, but I'm just finding this to be one of those titles that I wouldn't even notice that I've missed an issue. Like a lot of things on the shelf, I wouldn't call it bad, it's just the same old stuff.\nI feel the number on problem with this mini is its length. A good origin story shouldn't meander around, we should get the character's (or in this case the team's) origin and first big struggle, plus maybe a teaser at what is/was next for them, and that's it. The best origin stories, in my opinion, are told in four issues. Six issues is fine if there's a lot of content, but this issue just seems like it could have easily been condensed to half an issue. This decompression is fine for an ongoing, but for a miniseries like this? Can't say I'm sold on it.\nI will say, though, that Phil Noto's art is very crisp and pleasing to the eye. He's one of the few artists who can make the lense-less Iron Man helmet look good! When writing is dull, a good artist works wonders, and Noto does a good job of giving the book a vibrance it is otherwise sorely lacking. Sorry Joe Casey, but as much as I love origin stories this one has lost its original appeal.\nFinal Verdict: 6.4 - Browse, though it may read better in trade.\nHeralds #1\nThis is one of those books that I picked up where I didn't really expect anything great beforehand. While I was pleasantly surprised with Kathryn Immomen's writing, I would still say that this wasn't quite worth the buy.\nNow, one of the reasons that this gets a few points from me is that it features Emma Frost, and I'm a huge Emma Frost fan. However, I don't just commend anything with Emma in it; rather, I will utterly crucify the comic if it butchers her character (like that recent Origins one-shot). While Immomen didn't really get me too interested in the story, she definitely did a good job of getting Emma's voice right, though it's a bit early to judge overall characterization. Other than that though... well, it wasn't bad, and it certainly left me a bit interested in what will happen next, but other than that it was just your run of the mill superhero comic.\nThe art by Tonci Zonjic was quite varied. Some panels I looked at and thought \"Yeah, that looks good.\" But other times I just really wasn't impressed. As I said in the Iron Man 2 review way back when, consistency is key. If half of a comic was Alex Maleev quality while the rest looked like a 5 year old drew it, I would easily call a comic that was consistently in the middle of those two extremes far better. While Zonjic's art isn't quite at either extremes, going from bad to good and back is just jarring. As of now, I might take another look at the shop, but Emma alone isn't enough to get me to buy another team book (even if it's just a mini).\nFinal Verdict - 5.9 - Browse.\nMatthew Meylikhov is Editor-In-Chief of Multiversity Comics and all around comic book enthusiast.

That's how superheroes originate.\nGood superheroes fight crime and promote truth, justice and the American way. Bad ones [\"supervillains\"] seek to take over the world and form alliances with Communists, crime syndicates, and evil politicians.\nSUPERHEROES\nThe first superhero was Superman (began 1938) whose success prompted editors to introduce other superheroes. With World War II came Bullet Man (1940), Flash (1940), Wonder Woman (1940) and Captain America (1941).\nThe super-powered wore bright costumes often with \"underpants outside\", often a mask and cape, and had a secret identity and secret headquarters. They always won their battles, often against super-powered criminals thereby reassuring everyone that good ultimately triumphs, as Democracy would over Communism.\nIn the 1960s came new superheroes including Spiderman, the Incredible Hulk, Captain Atom, and The Thing. Some had everyday problems of study, relationships and employment and struggled under the responsibilities that super powers imposed.\nNON-SUPER COSTUMED CRIME FIGHTERS\nPulp fiction and comic strips of the 1930s featured heroic crime fighters, fantastic adventures, strange powers, mysterious lands, and scantily clad women needing rescue.\nTarzan of the Apes (1912) was endowed with animal strength, endurance and trained senses. The Shadow (1930), Phantom (1936) and Batman (1939) were superior crime-fighters; Flash Gordon travelled the galaxy and righted wrongs on other planets; and Conan the Barbarian (1932) tackled primitive civilizations.\nThese were \"costumed crime fighters\" rather than superheroes since they lacked superhuman traits and relied on superior training, talent, or technology. Batman, for example, had peak physical condition, was expert in hand-to-hand combat, drove a high tech \"Bat Car\", and wore a utility belt holding gadgets of every sort.\nSuch escapist fantasy reassured Americans impoverished by the Great Depression or anxious over Nazism and Imperial Japan. Science was unknown to most people - but they'd heard of x-rays, mutations, gas warfare, and malformed babies and this made fantasy believable.\nTarzan, Batman and Phantom keep making comebacks. Similar to Tarzan was \"Turok Son of Stone\". Commencing with Valiant Comics the story ran 1954 to 1982. Two pre-Columbian Indians, Turok and his brother Andar, wandered a lost valley encountering dinosaurs (called \"Honkers\"), primitive tribes, great natural disasters, and giant birds, insects and apes.\nSUPERMAN\nSuperman first appeared in a comic book in 1938 written by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster.\nIn the story parents on the doomed planet Krypton send their baby boy to Earth where he is reared by Martha and Jonathan Kent. The baby is named Clark and develops x-ray vision, flight, and unlimited strength. Superman can't be hurt or destroyed except by a mineral called Kryptonite. Clark Kent works as a \"mild mannered\" reporter for the Daily Planet. Fellow reporter Lois Lane, bedazzled by Superman, constantly shrugs Clark off.\nThe first movie Superman was Kirk Alyn (1910-1999). Then came George Reeves (1914-1959) of the 1950s TV series with Phillis Coates the first Lois Lane and Noel Neill the second.\nDean Cain starred in the 1993 TV series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Tom Welling was Super Boy in the TV series Smallville (2001). Christopher Reeve starred in four Superman movies (1978; 1981; 1983; 1987). Brandon Rough starred in Superman Returns (2006).\nWe sometimes hear of the \"curse of Superman\". Actors playing Superman, or supporting cast, seem bedevilled by suicide, accident, illness, financial ruin and madness.\nKirk Alyn starred in Superman (1948) and Atom Man vs Superman (1950). He rarely worked in Hollywood again, claiming \"Playing Superman ruined my career\", developed Alzheimers, and died in obscurity.\nGeorge Reeves died by gunshot in 1959. He too couldn't get another acting role and mismanaged his finances. It's rumoured he was murdered for an affair with a producer's wife, but more likely he killed himself.\nMost calamitous was Christopher Reeve. His non-Superman movies were box-office flops, malaria struck him in 1993, and a horse-riding accident left him paralyzed in 1994.\nReeve's \"Lois Lane\", Margot Kidder, had a car accident in Canada in 1990, was wheelchair dependent for a year, sold her jewelry to pay for convalescence, and incurred debts of $350,000. She developed drink and drug problems, suffered a nervous breakdown in 1996, and had another car accident in 2001.\nSuperman's creators too seemed \"cursed\". Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster sold the rights to the Superman character to DC Comics for $100, were fired from the corporation in 1947, and spent decades in legal wrangling for compensation.\nHowever, Dean Cain may have broken the supposed curse. He refused to do risky stunts, had a $2million insurance policy, and seems OK to this day. Similarly, Tom Welling of the TV series Smallville currently remains healthy.\nMargot Kidder said after her 2001 car accident: \"If I hadn't hit a telegraph pole after rolling three times, I would have dropped down a 50ft to 60ft ravine. Why don't people focus on that?\" The Curse of Superman is now the \"Luck of Superman\"!\nTHE CAPTAINS\nCaptain America arrived in 1941. Steve Rogers, a youth too sickly to fight in WWII, becomes test subject for a secret serum which enhances him to human physical peak. He obtains an indestructible shield, wears a costume featuring the American flag, and fights Nazis, Japs and Fascists. Captain America lost popularity after WWII but resurfaced from \"suspended animation\" in 1964.\nCaptain Atom appeared in 1960. His alter ego, Allen Adam, becomes \"atomized\" when trapped in an experimental rocket, which explodes. Like Superman he flies and is super-strong and invulnerable. His costume is red and yellow.\nOther \"Captain\" superheroes include Captain Marvel (1940-1953), Captain Canuck of Canada (1975) who obtained super-strength from extra-terrestrials, and Captain Britain (1976) whose super-strength, force-field and ability to fly were implanted by Merlyn the Magician.\nCaptain Nazi, a perfect specimen of Hitler's master race, appeared in December 1941. His super strength, speed, enhanced senses and ability to fly made him a tough opponent of Captain Marvel and Bullet Man. With Hitler's defeat Captain Nazi retired into suspended animation. He returned in the 1990s, joined Lex Luthor's Society of Super Villains, strove to restart the Third Reich, and battled Wonder Woman and other superheroes.\nTHE FLASH\nThe Flash, the fastest man in the world, got his super speed when lightning struck a cabinet of chemicals. Air friction poses no problem to his super-fast movements because he has an \"aura\" that neutralizes it. The Flash wore a tight red costume and yellow boots.\nI recall a comic story in which the Flash and his alter-identity simultaneously converse with a third person. To explain the presence of both the next page slowed Flash's movement down and showed him crossing and re-crossing the room between spoken phrases, and simultaneously changing his clothing, faster than the hearer could move his head right and left.\nOf course super speed would also require super-fast reflexes for super-fast stops and turns to avoid repeated concussion from collisions with walls, trees and whatever!\nActually there were four main Flashes plus other less poplar ones. The first Flash, college student Jay Garrick, appeared in Flash Comics in 1940.\nThe second Flash, Barry Allen, existed in a parallel world and appeared in comics from 1956 to 1986. Upon his heroic death the Flash mantle passed to his nephew Wally West (Kid Flash) from 1986 to 2006. Next came Bart Allen grandson of Barry Allan who Flashed in 2006-2007.\nAmong the less famous Flashes was a female, Jesse Chambers, whom Wally West asked to be his replacement.\nWONDER WOMAN\nWonder Woman, the daughter of an Amazon Queen, is a busty beauty whose crime-fighting outfit is a red and blue bathing suit and red boots. She obtained superpowers from the Olympian gods and has bulletproof bracelets, a \"truth lasso\" (which forces lassoed baddies to tell the truth), and great strength, speed and agility. In the television series she switches from everyday clothing to her crime-fighting swimsuit by spinning around.\nThe comics described her as \"beautiful as Aphrodite, wise as Athena, swifter than Hermes, and stronger than Hercules.\" Wonder Woman began in 1941 and became a TV series in 1975-1979.\nHer creator, William Moulton, was a psychologist, pro-feminist, and invented a lie detector, hence the idea of a truth lasso.\nSPIDER-MAN\nSpider-Man came to Marvel Comics in 1962, actually as a \"Spider-Teenager\".\nSpider-Man is the alter ego of Peter Parker a lonely, awkward high school student bitten by a radioactive spider. Its mutated DNA merges with his DNA and gives him adhesive hands and feet, a powerful grip, and the ability to sling spider-like threads and swing through city streets at amazing speeds.\nIn the comic series he developed into a college student, then a teacher, and has a daughter who becomes \"Spider-Girl\". The big-budget movie Spider-Man (2002), however, has a modern setting but still portrays him as a student.\nINCREDIBLE HULK\nDr Bruce Banner works on a gamma-ray bomb but gets careless. Gamma rays are in the high-energy sector of the electromagnetic spectrum and lethal in high doses. Details of Banner's exposure vary, in the movie version Banner inherits modified DNA from his geneticist father and is further altered when gamma rays interact with nanotechnology.\nBanner thereafter transforms into the Hulk whenever he's seriously upset.\nThe Hulk ripples with solid muscle, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1970s, is green in color, huge in size, amazing in strength (able to toss cars and trucks), and can bounce and jump along at great speed.\nSUPERHEROES EVERYWHERE\nThere are numberless other superheroes in comics, books and films. These include Human Torch, Hawkman, Aquaman, Starman, Dr Strange, Daredevil, Green Goblin, Green Lantern, Plastic Man, Iron Man, Black Panther, Galvaniser, Gambit, Ghost Rider, Hellboy, Spawn, Invincible, Professor X, Saturn Girl, Invisible Girl, Power Girl, Mister Fantastic, Shapeshifter, Doctor Solar, Sub-Mariner, and Quicksilver. The list goes on and on.\nSome male superheroes have female counterparts such as Bullet Girl, Hawkgirl, Batwoman, Supergirl, Spider-Girl, etc.\nDC Comics which introduced Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Hawkman, Aquaman and Green Arrow banded most of these into the \"Justice League of America\" in 1960, a move that increased sales tremendously.\nJapan's output of superheroes is second to America's, and many other countries also have superheroes.\nSuperheroes and costumed crime fighters are sometimes classified as follows:\nGadgeteer: Uses equipment that imitates superpowers, e.g. Batman.\nMage: Uses magic, e.g. Doctor Strange.\nMarksman: Uses guns, bows and arrows, e.g. Green Arrow.\nMartial Artist: Phenomenal physical abilities, e.g. Phantom.\nMentalist: Paranormal abilities such as telekinesis and telepathy, e.g. Professor X and Saturn Girl.\nShapeshifter: Changes body shape, e.g. Plastic Man.\nSpeedster: Has superior speed and reflexes, e.g. The Flash.\nCONSIDERATIONS\nSuper heroes apparently wear super-strength costumes, since they never emerge naked from burning buildings, powerful tornadoes, catastrophic collisions, fiery explosions, or high-velocity jumps (when wind speed should rip or burn the costume off). In the 1978 Christopher Reeve movie, however, Superman's mother sews his costume using ordinary fabric.\nAlso superheroes' hair never gets disarrayed no matter how violent the action!\nMany superheroes use an anti-aging formula, since we don't see them aging. Superman and Wonder Woman look as young in current movies as in the 1940s. Others reach the modern world upon awaking from suspended animation. Spider Man remains an adolescent, still in college, after 45 years! His original co-students would have become teachers, taught him for 40 years, and now face retirement, whereas he still struggles to make next grade.\nEVERY MAN A SUPER MAN\nLegalities aside, technology can now endow everyone with superhero abilities.\nYou can smash through walls as effectively as the Hulk by using plastic explosives!

And those many later battles taking place between the two is a little surprising--because their second meeting in FF #25 definitively settles the matter regarding which character is stronger than the other. (That would be the Hulk.) In fact, in both that issue and the next, the Hulk more than held his own in a battle with both the FF and the Avengers. So the fact that a Thing/Hulk battle still continued to draw interest in later stories probably had more to do with the prospect of a good battle issue, rather than the possibility that the Thing would prevail.\nYet it's the Hulk's overwhelming strength advantage over the Thing in this particular story that seemed to be the point of the battle. Even the title, \"The Hulk vs. The Thing,\" bears that out--perhaps meaning to let fans know that this battle would at last contain the answer to who was stronger, once and for all. And that it does. Even the Thing admits to himself that he was beaten--another surprise, given the fact that he gets up and keeps fighting even after being soundly thrashed. But in addition to establishing Ben Grimm's fighting spirit, it also generates interest in the next issue. It turns out he never does prevail against the Hulk, but he makes a damn good fight of it.\nAnd you have to give it up for the Hulk, who at this stage of his character is no hero in any sense of the word. Even on the run as he seems to be, he keeps this fight on his own terms and sets the pace for it, many times outsmarting his foes. Canny, aggressive and relentless, he puts everyone on the defensive at some point--with the exception of Captain America and Thor (and, to some extent, if you can believe it, the Wasp). Thor, naturally, is all but kept on the sidelines--not by the Avengers, but by artist Jack Kirby, who knows that the spotlight isn't on the Thunder God this time around. This story, by the way, also has the distinguishment of being the first meeting between the FF and the Avengers--who, once they stop getting in each other's way, manage some semblance of teamwork in tackling the Hulk, though just barely.\nKirby's artwork, as usual, has no difficulty in pacing the two issues or giving all the major players of the story their due. Yet Kirby hasn't, at this point, developed that wonderful talent he had in later art of making you feel the impact of a punch without actually needing to see it land. So you spend a lot of time seeing people reeling from punches or tactics that are merely represented, instead of delivered. Nor was I impressed by inker George Bell's work on this story, whose finishes made a normally fighting-mad bruiser like the Thing look more like a hapless oaf. You get more of a sense that you're looking at layouts, rather than finished work. The two-part battle, for all its intensity and drama, consequently comes off as looking plodding. Have a look at this awkward charge between two very powerful characters:\nIs the Thing about to cry?\nIf you'd like to see a more dynamic battle between the Hulk and the Thing, you might try their next meeting in Fantastic Four #112, \"Battle of the Behemoths.\" In this issue you will see a fighting-mad Thing, given that the Thing has a mad-on for pretty much everyone at this point in time. The Hulk is still the overwhelming adversary he always was, but the Thing gives a much better accounting of himself, thanks to artist John Buscema. I mean, look at the difference:\nThere's nothing quite like inker Joe Sinnott's finishes, is there? His work always looks so sharp and polished. Every panel in this story looks and feels action-packed. Jack Kirby, in later FF issues, would certainly get to this point--but in FF #s25-26, he's not there yet, and it's a story that truly needed all the action the reader could handle. Nevertheless, it accomplished its purpose in establishing the status quo for the Thing and the Hulk for all time--and though there would be exceptions in other issues, where the Thing's strength would be artificially or otherwise increased for the duration of the battle, no one doubts to this day that, as far as \"clobberin' time\" goes, no one does it better than the Hulk.\n"}, {"score": 256.2288, "uuid": "42d43ff2-8889-5745-8e9c-69440ec05da5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1609wb-75-33310", "target_hostname": "www.fandomlife.net", "target_uri": "http://www.fandomlife.net/article.cfm?ID=3", "page_rank": 1.1963264e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Fandomlife.net - Pop Culture Phenomena and Fandom.", "snippet": "Mountainous in stature and covered in hard, orange rock, Ben Grimm, Manhattan native, can punch his way through steel just as easily as his contemporaries: &#x27;The <em>Hulk</em>&#x27;, Juggernaut, Hercules <em>or</em> <em>Superman</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Follow me on Twitter\nBEN GRIMM aka THE THING\nHeroic literature exhibits no shortage of strong men. Can I get away with calling comic books \"heroic literature?\" You're reading this at an e-zine devoted to fandom, so I don't think I need to persuade you that they are. At any rate, throughout the history of comics, no strong man has a stronger heart than The Fantastic Four's Ben Grimm a.k.a 'The Thing'.\nMountainous in stature and covered in hard, orange rock, Ben Grimm, Manhattan native, can punch his way through steel just as easily as his contemporaries: 'The Hulk', Juggernaut, Hercules or Superman. At one time or another he's gone toe to toe with just about everybody - and usually come out looking the worse for wear. The Thing falls into that category of superhero known to many as \"the brick,\" the hard, muscle-bound guy (or gal) that keeps their feet on the ground punching out robot-tanks and such while his cohorts - \"the brain,\" \"the blaster,\" etc. - swirl, swoop and fly around him. Historical examples include Gawain to Lancelot, Little John to Robin Hood. Certainly, the stocky sidekick archetype is Ben Grimm to a T.\nAs part of the Fantastic Four, Ben's job is to run back up or absorb blows for Reed Richards, the elastic Mr. Fantastic (the brain); Johnny Storm, the Human Torch (the blaster); and Sue Storm/Richards, Invisible Girl (a kind of handy but by no means underestimated accessory and den mother). He's also the voice of the proletariat in this otherwise white-collar, middle-class club. Misshapen and \"ugly\" where his teammates are handsome. Ben is the \"Yancy Streeter\" with the \"New Yawk\" accent that counters Reed's Princeton lab-speak. \"Put it in plain English to me, Stretch!\" he complains, confronted with Dr. Doom's latest machine of destruction. \"Whatta we gotta do ta stop this thingummy?!\"\nBen Grimm always comes off as much the FF's servant as their friend. Even before the space encounter that transformed them from ordinary astronauts this was so; of all the roles on the ship, Ben was the pilot. The chauffeur. Indeed, Ben's gutter talk was intended to provide comic relief - his verbal sparring with Johnny an ongoing joke all the more poignant on those occasions when Johnny's high-flying antics would have to pull Ben out of the fire, so to speak. But Ben's usefulness to the FF saga runs much deeper than that.\nIn fact, he took center-stage shortly after The Fantastic Four launched in the early 60s, overtaking Johnny as the fan favorite and eventually earning his own series. What makes The Thing such an enduring character is his appeal to the common people. Don't let his wisecracks fool you - he is not indifferent to his ugliness, his sense of other. He spends a great deal of his time lamenting the fact that he must remain unadored while babe-alicious blond Storm counts devotees by the score and the Richards' have each other. He feels like a monster that, unlike the Hulk, can never change back. Only a romance with blind sculptress Alicia Masters helps him break through this feeling of ugliness and otherness. The sensitive heart that beats within the orange chest - a heart that is not unlike our own in that it feels deeply the wounds of a society that actively seeks to ostracize the different or the \"unattractive\" - is what gives the Thing his cathartic appeal.\nFor who has not felt like Ben at one time or another? Who has not been taunted, pushed out, ignored? And who among us has not wished that somehow in our otherness we were empowered, like The Thing was empowered? That the compensation for our lack of beauty included enormous physical strength and toughness? That the fact that we were called \"four eyes\" or \"fatty\" did not entitle us to powerful arms and a resilient hide, hands to crush and X-ray eyes to burn?\nIt is his humanity that pushes Ben further than the other traditional bricks. The Hulk is rage personified - he burns out, confused, returns to earth, and is never quite in control of himself. The X-Men's Colossus is eloquent, shiny, malleable, and a chrome Adonis. Superman? Perfection. Forget it, he has no place among the troglodytes of this world. Only The Thing really suffers, and out of this suffering is born his greatest strengths, like the boxer that is outclassed from the first bell but fights valiantly and hopelessly all the way to the twelfth - which The Thing has done time and time again, against Hulk, against Juggernaut, against himself.\nSome bricks are stronger and some more eloquent; certainly many are more powerful, more popular. Few are more enduring, and more sympathetic, than The Thing. Even less are more \"like us folks\" than this multifaceted man and his complicated web of feelings. With such trademark quips as \"You couldn't out punch my aunt Petunia\" and the immortal \"It's clobberin' time!\" Ben Grimm has secured his place in the sagas as handily as he has secured his place in our hearts, as brutally as he once toppled Galactus!

It happens when Mr. Bell, who narrates the film in the jocular first-person style of Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock, reflects on steroid use as a metaphor for modern American life. Are steroids un-American, as Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. is heard to say? Or are they as American as apple pie?\nMore About This Movie\nAdd to Netflix Queue\nHow do you reconcile the imperative drilled into children by parents, teachers and the news media that winning is everything with the increasingly quaint moral injunctions to play fair, exercise good sportsmanship and do the right thing? If your childhood idols are preening supermen like Hulk Hogan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who preached clean living but revealed their own reliance on steroids, which path are you likely to follow?\nTo an impressionable boy, the spectacularly muscular superhero is an irresistible role model. What shy youngster confronted with Superman doesn\u2019t fantasize about changing into a skintight blue suit and transforming into the Man of Steel? The movie shows the evolution of the G.I. Joe action figure from a fit soldier into a mountainous, V-shaped hulk, an increasingly achievable ideal, thanks to steroids.\nThe movie ponders the question of what constitutes cheating when you look objectively at the role of medicine in competitive sport. Is it cheating for a bicycle racer to pump more oxygen into his system by sleeping in a high-altitude chamber? Has Tiger Woods\u2019s Lasik eye surgery given him an unfair competitive advantage? The lines between cheating and fair play, the movie suggests, are hazy to the point of being arbitrary. Pharmaceutical enhancement extends even to the sedate world of classical music, in which musicians susceptible to stage fright consume beta blockers to keep them calm.\nIn some areas, the film suggests, deception is more the rule than the exception. You have to take on faith the claims of the unregulated food supplement industry, in which a pinch of this and a pinch of that is often added to useless filler. We learn that in fitness industry advertising, before and after pictures are often shot on the same day, then doctored.\nThe bottom line in the debate is the sprinter Ben Johnson\u2019s rationale for using steroids, which cost him his 1988 Olympic 100-meter title: Everybody does it.\n\u201cBigger, Stronger, Faster*\u201d methodically examines the history of performance enhancement in sports, concentrating on the years since the mid-1950s when a physician for the United States weight lifting team observed Soviet athletes being given injections. Almost immediately the American pharmaceutical industry began work on developing an oral anabolic steroid, Dianabol, for American athletes.\nNow and again the movie circles back to the poignant stories of Mr. Bell and his siblings, who, growing up in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., took up weight lifting and strength training to help overcome feelings of inadequacy because of a family tendency toward obesity.\nMr. Bell, a power lifter who is the smallest of the three (and has written television segments for World Wrestling Entertainment), used to take anabolic steroids but, unlike his siblings, has sworn them off. His older brother, Mike Bell, nicknamed Mad Dog, who as an overweight boy was tauntingly labeled Pugsley, took up weight lifting and became captain of the high school football team. In college, when he discovered that he was no longer his team\u2019s biggest and strongest player, he gave up football for wrestling.\nSince then Mike Bell has obsessively pursued his dream of becoming a World Wrestling Entertainment star, and once became so frustrated that he attempted suicide. His declaration that he can\u2019t bear the idea of not being a star is the film\u2019s saddest moment.\nThe youngest brother, Mark Bell (nicknamed Smelly), grew up with a learning disability but developed self-esteem as a power lifter. He gave up pursuing a career as a pro wrestler after marrying and becoming a father. But he continues to take steroids (to his wife\u2019s chagrin) and enter weight lifting exhibitions.\nThe movie questions stories about the horrors of steroid abuse. The explosive aggression known as \u201c\u00a0\u2019roid rage\u201d is largely a myth, several experts insist. A hilarious excerpt from a 1994 television movie starring Ben Affleck as a steroid-using high school football player gone berserk is compared to the marijuana scare movie \u201cReefer Madness.\u201d\nThe filmmaker interviews a man in Houston who blames steroids for his 17-year-old son\u2019s suicide, and a San Francisco AIDS patient who was wasting away until he began taking steroids. The movie doubts the football star Lyle Alzado\u2019s assertion that the brain tumor from which he died in 1992 at 43 was caused by steroids. Although the movie doesn\u2019t defend steroid use, neither does it go on the attack.\n\u201cBigger, Stronger, Faster*\u201d left me convinced that the steroid scandals will abate as the drugs are reluctantly accepted as inevitable products of a continuing revolution in biotechnology. Replaceable body parts, plastic surgery, anti-depressants, Viagra and steroids are just a few of the technological advancements in a never-ending drive to make the species superhuman.\nBIGGER, STRONGER, FASTER*\nOpens on Friday in Manhattan and in Irvine, Los Angeles and Pasadena, Calif.\nDirected by Christopher Bell; written by Mr. Bell, Alexander Buono and Tamsin Rawady; director of photography, Mr. Buono; edited by Brian Singbiel; music by Dave Porter; produced by Mr. Buono, Ms. Rawady and Jim Czarnecki; released by Magnolia Pictures.

I came today in hopes of having the pleasure of showing it to you.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she countered, \u201cthat shall not be necessary.\u201d\nHe said apologetically, \u201cI understand if you are too tired. I should have thought better than to intrude upon your time.\u201d He retrieved his gloves from where they lay upon a bench. \u201cI had only thought of how much you have enjoyed the park while we have kept each other company. The walk I had thought to share was one of my late mother\u2019s favorites. I had forgotten about it until Lady Catherine reminded me.\u201d He prayed that such a small prevarication would not come back to haunt him.\u00a0 \u201cI simply thought you might find it a pleasant choice for a solitary walk.\nElizabeth hesitated briefly before saying, \u201cIf it is not too far, I would take delight in seeing it, Sir. Thank you for considering my pleasure.\u201d She rested her gloved hand on his proffered arm.\nWalking along the narrow, winding path, Elizabeth often moved closer for support, as the footing was a bit bumpy with tree roots. Lost to her closeness, Darcy considered the pleasure he would know by lifting Elizabeth into his arms and carrying her along the path. To feel her clinging to his chest would be pure bliss, but he resisted any rash impropriety.\nIn less than ten minutes, they emerged from the thick-trunk, tree-lined path into a clearing painted by the sun. Darcy pushed aside some branches and permitted Elizabeth to step into a field of vibrantly colored wildflowers\u2014primroses, bluebells, wild hyacinths, and anemones. He enjoyed the gasp she emitted upon seeing what the clearing had to offer.\n\u201cMr. Darcy,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cthis is magnificent!\u201d\nHe could not stop the smile erupting upon his lips. As Elizabeth stepped away from him and scampered toward the field, Darcy reluctantly released her. He watched as she stopped suddenly, spread her arms wide, and turned around and around, looking skyward with joy. He did not expect such unencumbered pleasure, but he could not turn his head. She was the most exquisite creature that he had ever seen.\nShe walked through the field at several angles, stopping to enjoy the various flowers; then she strode purposely toward him. \u201cMr. Darcy, you have honored me by sharing this clearing. I cannot understand why you chose to do so, but it will be a treasured memory of my trip to Rosings.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother loved nature, Miss Elizabeth. I believe she would have been pleased to know you approved of her favorite refuge,\u201d he offered. Realizing he could not press her too quickly, he said evenly, \u201cAre you prepared to return to the Parsonage?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Sir, I believe I am.\u201d He extended his arm, and anticipating the pathway\u2019s unevenness, she took a firmer grip than previously. Her rich, mellow hazel eyes sparkling as she turned around and around in the field had filled Darcy with happiness. He loved Elizabeth Bennet; the realization of admitting his feelings flashed through his being; no more would he say he loved her eyes or loved how she spoke her mind; no longer would he think of his feelings being only a strong attraction; Darcy loved Elizabeth. It was as simple as that: he loved Elizabeth. Finally openly acknowledging his devotion for her to himself, Darcy wanted to scream it to the world. Instead, he forced himself to swallow hard and say, \u201cI am pleased my intrusion was not unpleasant, Miss Elizabeth.\u201d\n\u201cI believe I told you earlier not all intrusions are unwelcome, Sir.\u201d\n\u201cOur acquaintance has been long enough for us to know something of the other\u2019s preferences.\u201d She looked at him with questions hidden behind her eyes; Darcy realized that Elizabeth would now expect him to make known his intentions: He shared his mother\u2019s favorite refuge with her, and he had told her of his wishing to share precious parts of his life with her. The lady could no longer doubt his purpose.\nBroken only by occasional civilities regarding the weather and of books recently read, the companionable silence returned between them. As customary, he left her at the Parsonage\u2019s door, but this time as he strode away he allowed himself the pleasure of turning for a final look at her; Elizabeth stood transfixed and looking toward where he brought up; he touched the brim of his hat to bid her farewell and strolled away. After he turned toward Rosings the second time, he did not see her grimace, nor did he observe her perplexed stare.\nTomorrow\u2014he thought as he made his way along the path; tomorrow he would offer his hand to Elizabeth. He would depart from Rosings in two days; therefore, tomorrow would be the day. The prayer the Devil answers, he reminded himself. Let the Devil beware, Darcy thought. He would declare his love for Elizabeth; she would accept; and then Darcy would deal with those whose censure would surely come. Tonight he would prepare a proper proposal; he would tell Elizabeth how his regard for her had grown despite their differences. He imagined her happiness at his declaration. That evening Darcy slept well with the knowledge that on the morrow Elizabeth Bennet would be his.\n(This scene comes from Chapter 8 of my first Austen-inspired novel, Darcy\u2019s Passions.)\n"}, {"score": 239.41486, "uuid": "c9f8c879-6a9c-5597-9aa2-bd705f02fe6a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1711wb-87-11144", "target_hostname": "www.toonzone.net", "target_uri": "http://www.toonzone.net/blog/blogs/454/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic---lesson-zero-recap/", "page_rank": 1.5036838e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "toonzone: blog: My Little Pony: Friendship <em>is</em> Magic - &quot;Lesson Zero&quot; Recap", "snippet": "Perish: The Bullet Manga and Comics Have To Bite (<em>Or</em> Else.)", "explanation": null, "document": "Share |\nHyper-organized Twilight Sparkle panics when she mistakenly omits writing her weekly friendship letter to the princess from her daily checklist. She then sets off on a quest to find someone in need of a friend so she can learn her weekly lesson. When Twilight Sparkle finds she can't accomplish that, she attempts to create a problem that she can solve.\nHere we have the third episode of the second season. Or the first in some ponies minds. I'm not going to argue over technicalities. However, I will say that this episode felt like the first episode of a new season, and I mean that in the best of ways. The episode starts strong with a beautiful and well done set up. Twilight comes off as overly organized but not in a way that's out of character. And Spike comes off as an excellent main character rather than a side character. I have no complaints with the setup.\nNow we get to the part where Twilight panics and runs off to find a problem to solve. Of course there are no problems to be found and it's a peaceful day. Twilight slowly gets more and more stressed over the situation while her friends laugh away the problem as no big deal. All combined with Twilight's usual overreacting over how the princess will react. Until finally, she snaps.\nI found the characters to all be well played and in character with almost no exception. The animation, visuals, and pacing were all great. The episode also employed a superb and original technique to show time slowly pass for the day, which I loved. Unfortunately the episode isn't without its flaws. It exaggerates certain elements for comedic effect. Which in concept is fine, but in this episode it causes a running gag involving Rarity that is just out of character for her. Although it was still funny. The exaggeration is taken too far at several other minor spots as well and it caused some of the humor to come off as forced. Also, it felt off when Twilight finally snapped, like the reason behind it wasn't strong enough for the reaction. But I suppose it was necessary for the episode to reach its climax, and it was well-played once added.\nIt all leads to an ending that I found even better and stronger than the episode's beginning was.

She then sets off on a quest to find someone in need of a friend so she can learn her weekly lesson. When Twilight Sparkle finds she can't accomplish that, she attempts to create a problem that she can solve.\nHere we have the third episode of the second season. Or the first in some ponies minds. I'm not going to argue over technicalities. However, I will say that this episode felt like the first episode of a new season, and I mean that in the best of ways. The episode starts strong with a beautiful and well done set up. Twilight comes off as overly organized but not in a way that's out of character. And Spike comes off as an excellent main character rather than a side character. I have no complaints with the setup.\nNow we get to the part where Twilight panics and runs off to find a problem to solve. Of course there are no problems to be found and it's a peaceful day. Twilight slowly gets more and more stressed over the situation while her friends laugh away the problem as no big deal. All combined with Twilight's usual overreacting over how the princess will react. Until finally, she snaps.\nI found the characters to all be well played and in character with almost no exception. The animation, visuals, and pacing were all great. The episode also employed a superb and original technique to show time slowly pass for the day, which I loved. Unfortunately the episode isn't without its flaws. It exaggerates certain elements for comedic effect. Which in concept is fine, but in this episode it causes a running gag involving Rarity that is just out of character for her. Although it was still funny. The exaggeration is taken too far at several other minor spots as well and it caused some of the humor to come off as forced. Also, it felt off when Twilight finally snapped, like the reason behind it wasn't strong enough for the reaction. But I suppose it was necessary for the episode to reach its climax, and it was well-played once added.\nIt all leads to an ending that I found even better and stronger than the episode's beginning was. The moral to the story was nice. And something wonderful was setup involving the friendship letters, thus allowing for more creative freedom in the future. Ultimately this is a great and well done episode with only some problems, all of which stem from the same source.

His album, The Eminem Show, had a comic-book theme, and he dressed up as Batman\u0092s sidekick, Robin, in the video for his single Without Me.\nMillar is in final negotiations with Universal Pictures, but has agreed his fee and credits, and is delighted with his first big film deal.\n\u0093I\u0092m really excited about the possibility of Marshall playing the lead role, and Universal have already been in talks with his people, and also lined up one of the top five producers in Hollywood,\u0094 he said. \u0093I had three years of writing about superheroes, so last year I wanted to do something that was really bad.\n\u0093The plot of Wanted is ideal for a film treatment. Films about the bad guys are always far more interesting and this is the most violent and evil thing that I have ever written.\u0094\nThe comic books, which were drawn by the artist JG Jones, tell the story of Wesley Gibson, a spineless office worker who is bullied by his boss and whose girlfriend Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend \u0097 until he discovers that he is the son of the most evil supervillain on the planet.\nWhen his father, a bisexual villain called the Killer, is apparently assassinated, he is kidnapped and taken to the centre of the meta-human criminal network, responsible for all crime around the world.\nHis father, wracked with guilt at leaving Gibson\u0092s mother when he was an infant, has left him his entire fortune. But in order to inherit the \u00a325m in cash, and a string of houses and cars, Gibson is forced to join the fraternity for six months and learn how to become an assassin himself.\nThe final parts of the comic book series will be published later this year, but in a final twist, Gibson will become a stronger man and will kill one of the people that he comes to care about most.\nMillar, who will be a consultant on the film, said that the role of Gibson\u0092s father could be played by Tommy Lee Jones, the star of the Men in Black films and Batman Forever.\nThe film\u0092s producer also plans to approach agents for Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, the singer, who was reportedly keen to play Lois Lane in a new film of Superman, and has asked to see all upcoming scripts for movies based on comic books.\nMillar, who has set up his own company, www.millarworld.biz, has created a number of controversial characters. In the DC Comics publication, The Authority, he devised the gay superheroes, Midnighter and Apollo \u0097 a camp version of Superman, who outsold the dated hero three times over.\nHe toughened up the Incredible Hulk, re-created the X-Men, and last year wrote Superman: Red Son, where the hero\u0092s space capsule lands in Russia and he becomes a Russian superhero.\"\nposted by Jim at 9:24 PM\nMark Millar to take over Wolverine.\nWith Greg Rucka having signed an exclusive contract with DC Comics, Marvel have been looking for a new writer for Wolverine for a while now. Luckilly, Rucka scripted the series up until #18 before going to work for DC, meaning the need to replace him hasn't been too urgent. John Romita Jr confirmed on Fanboy Radio that he will be taking over art chores on the series, with Mark Millar writing.\nRomita Jr will also be providing art for an upcoming story arc in The Punisher, written by Garth Ennis.\nposted by Jim at 9:20 PM\nUltimates Vol.2 To Be Late.\nIn a move that shocks, well, no one, Mark Millar has said that the first issue of The Ultimates V.2 will not ship on it's solicited April release date.

I definitely did not expect this to go 45 minutes but he had a lot to share, and it\u2019s worth it to hear him talk about all of this. His love for his work comes across quickly. He really loves what he does. It\u2019s clear that this is a man still enjoying and exploring his craft and the process of storytelling despite already being a master at it.\nI was also struck with how unfortunate it is for someone who has lived and breathed the Archie characters for the last 40 years, who has been the artist on their most commercially successful and buzz worthy books (for good reason), now finds himself with some uncertainty . Fortunately he\u2019s still immensely talented. His abilities not only haven\u2019t diminished, but may be stronger than ever. And he remained classy throughout, with not a bad word to say about his former employers. Already plans are in the works for the next phase of his career, and that to me is exciting. With over 60 years in the biz, he still has a lot of creativity to give.\nHere\u2019s the audio of our interview:\nMP3 Download\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what he talked about:\nHis 40-year career with Archie Comics, characters he clearly loves and respects, and his recent departure from the company.\nCreating the color designs for Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four (the Thing is colored like \u201ca wrinkled orange\u201d), the Hulk (his pants were meant to be magenta, not purple), and the rest of the Marvel Comics universe, including the villains like Dr. Doom.\nBeing asked by Marvel to draw the Fantastic Four 50 years after coloring the first issue in 1961.\nHis work being reprinted in prestige hard cover books: Archie: The Best of Stan Goldberg [ Amazon link ] and Archie Marries\u2026 [ Amazon link ]\nBeing mentored by Stan Lee the art director in the \u201950s\nUsing the Marvel Method for Millie the Model\nCreating Kathy the Teenage Tornado (reprint this, Marvel!)\nOn the comics industry during the Senate hearings of the 1950s and the industry\u2019s response: \u201cIt almost destroyed the whole industry.\u201d He says the Comics Code Authority, the industry\u2019s content watchdog, went overboard: \u201cThey made some corrections, but I guess they had to show what they were then getting paid for.\u201d Marvel even lost their distributor for a time, which resulted in Stan having to go freelance.\nHis work on Millie the Model influencing women in fashion design and magazines like Cosmopolitan, McCall\u2019s and others.\nCollaborating with Michael Uslan on last year\u2019s \u201cArchie Marries\u2026\u201d story starting in Archie #600, which sold 50% better than Marvel & DC comic books at the time.

Photograph: Zade Rosenthal\nActors in any capacity, artists of any stripe, are inspired by their curiosity, by their desire to explore all quarters of life, in light and in dark, and reflect what they find in their work. Artists instinctively want to reflect humanity, their own and each other's, in all its intermittent virtue and vitality, frailty and fallibility.\nI have never been more inspired than when I watched Harold Pinter speak in a direct address to camera in his Nobel lecture in 2005. \"Truth in drama is forever elusive. You never quite find it but the search for it is compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the endeavour. The search is your task. More often than not you stumble upon the truth in the dark, colliding with it or just glimpsing an image or a shape which seems to correspond with the truth, often without realising that you have done so. But the real truth is that there never is any such thing as one truth to be found in dramatic art. There are many. These truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other. Some times you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers and is lost.\"\nBig talk for someone in a silly superhero film, I hear you say. But superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out. Ancient societies had anthropomorphic gods: a huge pantheon expanding into centuries of dynastic drama; fathers and sons, martyred heroes, star-crossed lovers, the deaths of kings \u2013 stories that taught us of the danger of hubris and the primacy of humility. It's the everyday stuff of every man's life, and we love it. It sounds cliched, but superheroes can be lonely, vain, arrogant and proud. Often they overcome these human frailties for the greater good. The possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we have to earn it.\nThe Hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive consequences, its consuming fire. There's not a soul on this earth who hasn't wanted to \"Hulk smash\" something in their lives. And when the heat of rage cools, all that we are left with is shame and regret. Bruce Banner, the Hulk's humble alter ego, is as appalled by his anger as we are. That other superhero Bruce \u2013 Wayne \u2013 is the superhero-Hamlet: a brooding soul, misunderstood, alone, for ever condemned to avenge the unjust murder of his parents. Captain America is a poster boy for martial heroism in military combat: the natural leader, the war hero. Spider-Man is the eternal adolescent \u2013 Peter Parker's arachnid counterpart is an embodiment of his best-kept secret \u2013 his independent thought and power.\nSuperhero movies also represent the pinnacle of cinema as \"motion picture\". I'd like to think that the Lumi\u00e8re brothers would thrill at the cat-and-mouse chase through the netherworld streets of Gotham in The Dark Knight, with helicopters tripping on high-tensile wires and falling from the sky, and a huge Joker-driven triple-length truck upending 180 degrees like a Russian acrobat. I hope that they would cheer and delight at the rollercoaster ride through the skies of Manhattan at the end of Avengers Assemble . These scenes are the result of a creative engine set in motion when the Lumi\u00e8res shot L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat in 1895. The trains just move a lot faster these days.\u00a0And not just trains; trucks, bikes, bat-mobiles and men in flying, shining iron suits. The spectacle is part of the fun \u2013 part of the art, part of our shared joy.\nHow far I hope we have come since the judgment of Christopher Reeve's peers. Maybe playing superheroes isn't such an ignoble undertaking after all. \"I still believe in heroes,\" says Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury in Avengers Assemble. So do I, sir.

This throw down has always been a classic fan favorite detailed in various comics and even in a Marvel movie. The Hulk, if he\u2019s portrayed properly, doesn\u2019t belong on a super hero team. He didn\u2019t in the comics and he doesn\u2019t now. The Hulk is supposed to be an out of control monster, not this semi intelligent brute. He exists on pure anger and he gets stronger the more angry he gets, or at least that\u2019s the most accurate rendition of the character. He\u2019s been brilliant in the past and he\u2019s been gray and red, but the real Hulk is a giant green monster. Not everyone will agree with these assertions of course, but that\u2019s what makes the web great.\nSo, the Hulk is smart enough to be a part of the team and negotiate with his alter ego but this week he was even more angry than usual (that sounds weird). His utter disregard for those around him was rubbing Thor wrong from the opening credits so anyone who\u2019s even the mildest of fns knew what was coming. The best thing about a fight between Thor and Hulk is that Hulk isn\u2019t intimidated by Thor being a God and he\u2019s willing and able to smack the arrogance right off Thor\u2019s face. By fight\u2019s end, Thor should really be on top but the fact that his normal methods of issuing threats and intimidating don\u2019t work on Hulk is pretty entertaining. The battle scenes between Hulk and the rest of the Avengers were action packed and a whole lot of fun. The villain of the episode, the real one, got very little development though. It felt like the writer was leaning on fans just knowing her and what her motivations really are. Thor offers up on throwaway line about her and that\u2019s it.\nThe bulk of the episode was focused on introducing the new team to their new headquarters; Avengers Mansion. They also found their way into the training rooms and managed to start tearing things up right away. Hulk and Thor ripping things apart was no surprise but Giant Man gowning through the ceiling seemed a little excessive. This is a kid\u2019s show though so what should we really expect? The Wasp\u2019s enthusiasm for the team and the mansion was fairly amusing too. Does anyone else think that Iron Man/Tony Stark\u2019s voice comes off a bit too young?\nThere are two fairly clever character introductions in this episode for a kid\u2019s show. One of them isn\u2019t really a surprise, it was just cool. The other one was really subtle and if you aren\u2019t a fan of the Marvel Universe you wouldn\u2019t know by his intro whether this character is a villain or a hero and there will be no spoiling it here. This episode like the premiere was just good fun, not much more than that. There are only five Avengers so far and everyone who\u2019s anyone knows there are always six\u2026.\n"}, {"score": 221.40604, "uuid": "d1a11c3d-585f-593a-bc10-208a6367c859", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0609wb-60-01374", "target_hostname": "www.robertweinberg.net", "target_uri": "http://www.robertweinberg.net/superheroes.htm", "page_rank": 1.1740449e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "The Science of Superheroes by Author Robert Weinberg", "snippet": "If Superman&#x27;s strength <em>is</em> a result of the much <em>stronger</em> gravity on Krypton, exactly how big was Krypton?

The book received an award for \"Distinguished International-Level Merit in Technical Communications\" and also won the special \"Best in Show 2003\" award from the Rochester Chapter of the Organization. This is the first time ever that a book on pop-science and comic books has been so honored by this highly regarded professional association.\nSTC is the world's largest professional association for technical communicators. With more than 20,000 members across the globe, STC provides unparalleled opportunities for continuing education and peer networking. Members include every kind of technical communicator, including technical writers, editors, and illustrators as well as Web designers, technical translators, and managers and teachers of technical communication. They work in industries as diverse as computer software, medicine, aviation, manufacturing, and entertainment. STC has 150 local chapters on six continents-- anywhere people need technical information, STC members are there.\nMs. Gresh, a member of the Society's Rochester Chapter, attended the dinner and was caught completely by surprise by the double honor. In her short, impromptu, acceptance speech, she thanked the Society for the two Awards and promised to keep up the good work, as she and Mr. Weinberg are hard at work on their new science book, THE SCIENCE OF SUPERVILLAINS.\nNow available in trade hardcover edition from John Wiley & Sons, is The Science of Superheroes written by Bob and Lois H. Gresh. For more than sixty years, comic book superheroes such as Superman, Batman, the X-Men, the Flash and Spider-man\nhave protected humanity from evil-doers while defending truth and justice. Now, Bob Weinberg and Lois Gresh have launched and amusing yet provocative investigation behind those superpowers in their book, The Science of Superheroes. Featuring an introduction by Dean Koontz, the book seeks to answer the question: science fiction or science fact.\nBeginning with Superman, the first comic book super hero, the authors ask how can a building lifted by Superman remain in one piece? Could he actually travel faster than the speed of light? If Superman's strength is a result of the much stronger gravity on Krypton, exactly how big was Krypton? Filled with real scientific evidence, Gresh and Weinberg's findings will delight and amuse any superman fan. From there, they move onto other super characters including the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Aquaman and the Sub-Mariner, Spiderman, the Green Lantern and many more. Concluding the book, Weinberg and Gresh ask several well-known comic writers their opinions on the science in comics.\nPublished at $24.95, The Science of Superheroes is available from John Wiley & Sons, Amazon.com, and bookstores throughout the United States, England, and Canada. Foreign rights have been sold in both Europe and Asia; the British Science Fiction Book Club plans to bring the book out in January. And, there's even talk of a possible movie or TV special sometime in the future.\n\"Fantastically hilarious\" says Diamond Galleries SCOOP magazine, Nov 1, 2002\n\"---the book should go down well with the comics' teenage readers: the writing is an accessible style and the authors skillfully manage the difficult gear-shift between describing the heroes and discussing the science.\" New Scientist, October 23-24\n\"Overall, the book has just the right tone -- straightforward, educational, but not too stuffy or serious. They aren't making fun of superheroes or poking holes in the stories, but using them as springboards to teach readers more about the principles behind the concepts. At the same time, they aren't bending over backwards to make the heroes \"realistic\" or believable; they understand that some things are done for the sake of interesting or exciting stories.\" Comics Worth Reading, Johanna Draper Carlson.\n\"What seemed impossible just sixty years ago during the Golden Age of Comics, now appears increasingly plausible.

It was considered an ignoble thing for a classical actor to do.\nThe Avengers [also known as Avengers Assemble]\nProduction year: 2012\nRuntime: 142 mins\nDirectors: Joss Whedon\nCast: Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Cobie Smulders, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hiddleston\nMore on this film\nI grew up watching Superman. As a child, when I first learned to dive into a swimming pool, I wasn't diving, I was flying, like Superman. I used to dream of rescuing a girl I had a crush on (my Lois Lane) from a playground bully (General Zod). Reeve, to my mind, was\u00a0the first real superhero.\nSince then some of the greatest actors have turned superheroes into a serious business: Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in Batman; Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, the first venerable knights of the X-Men, who have now passed the baton to Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. In spite of 20 years of mercurial work in the likes of Chaplin and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, it was his rock-star-charismatic yet somehow humble Tony Stark in Iron Man that helped wider audiences finally embrace the enormous talent of Robert Downey Jr . And Heath Ledger 's performance in The Dark Knight quite simply changed the game. He raised the bar not just for actors in superhero films, but young actors everywhere; for me. His performance was dark, anarchic, dizzying, free, and totally, thrillingly, dangerous.\nTom Hiddleston as Loki in Avengers Assemble. Photograph: Zade Rosenthal\nActors in any capacity, artists of any stripe, are inspired by their curiosity, by their desire to explore all quarters of life, in light and in dark, and reflect what they find in their work. Artists instinctively want to reflect humanity, their own and each other's, in all its intermittent virtue and vitality, frailty and fallibility.\nI have never been more inspired than when I watched Harold Pinter speak in a direct address to camera in his Nobel lecture in 2005. \"Truth in drama is forever elusive. You never quite find it but the search for it is compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the endeavour. The search is your task. More often than not you stumble upon the truth in the dark, colliding with it or just glimpsing an image or a shape which seems to correspond with the truth, often without realising that you have done so. But the real truth is that there never is any such thing as one truth to be found in dramatic art. There are many. These truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other. Some times you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers and is lost.\"\nBig talk for someone in a silly superhero film, I hear you say. But superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out. Ancient societies had anthropomorphic gods: a huge pantheon expanding into centuries of dynastic drama; fathers and sons, martyred heroes, star-crossed lovers, the deaths of kings \u2013 stories that taught us of the danger of hubris and the primacy of humility. It's the everyday stuff of every man's life, and we love it. It sounds cliched, but superheroes can be lonely, vain, arrogant and proud. Often they overcome these human frailties for the greater good. The possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we have to earn it.\nThe Hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive consequences, its consuming fire. There's not a soul on this earth who hasn't wanted to \"Hulk smash\" something in their lives. And when the heat of rage cools, all that we are left with is shame and regret. Bruce Banner, the Hulk's humble alter ego, is as appalled by his anger as we are. That other superhero Bruce \u2013 Wayne \u2013 is the superhero-Hamlet: a brooding soul, misunderstood, alone, for ever condemned to avenge the unjust murder of his parents. Captain America is a poster boy for martial heroism in military combat: the natural leader, the war hero. Spider-Man is the eternal adolescent \u2013 Peter Parker's arachnid counterpart is an embodiment of his best-kept secret \u2013 his independent thought and power.\nSuperhero movies also represent the pinnacle of cinema as \"motion picture\". I'd like to think that the Lumi\u00e8re brothers would thrill at the cat-and-mouse chase through the netherworld streets of Gotham in The Dark Knight, with helicopters tripping on high-tensile wires and falling from the sky, and a huge Joker-driven triple-length truck upending 180 degrees like a Russian acrobat. I hope that they would cheer and delight at the rollercoaster ride through the skies of Manhattan at the end of Avengers Assemble. These scenes are the result of a creative engine set in motion when the Lumi\u00e8res shot L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat in 1895. The trains just move a lot faster these days.\u00a0And not just trains; trucks, bikes, bat-mobiles and men in flying, shining iron suits. The spectacle is part of the fun \u2013 part of the art, part of our shared joy.\nHow far I hope we have come since the judgment of Christopher Reeve's peers. Maybe playing superheroes isn't such an ignoble undertaking after all. \"I still believe in heroes,\" says Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury in Avengers Assemble. So do I, sir.

In fact, months after it was first posted, it was still getting more hits per week than some newer articles and reviews! So I've decided to re-present it here, slightly modified. Some new quotes have been added, older ones given greater context, and a few pics have been added...\nAdded maybe a dozen quotes throughout the various categories - April 2010\nGreat Comic Book Quotables\n- quotes, quotations, and bon mots\n\"To be or not to be...\", \"It was the best of times...\", \"This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want...\", \"The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world...\" and so on. When people quote books, movies and TV, it's a form of legitimization. If it's worth repeating, it must be worth knowing in the first place. But what of comics?\nTo consider the respectability, and value, of comics, let's delve whole heartedly into that epitomy of pop intellectualism...the quote (or quotes). What wisdom can be milked from comics, that most maligned of mediums? I first posted this a few years ago (adding to it over time) and recently was looking over some similiar pages and message boards where others compiled their own favourite four colour sayings. But often these were the \"cool\" lines, or the witty quip, and sometimes lines which, I'll confess, seemed to have little resonance if you didn't know the character and the scene to begin with. I've certainly included some of those myself here, but what I was more interested in was the powerful quote, the provocative musing.\nI broke the list up into categories, just to make it more digestible. But, let's face it, the placing can be pretty arbitrary in some cases (I've moved quotes from one section to another -- and back -- unsure where it best belonged).\nSo, without further ado, may I present Great Quotations of Western Thought -- the Funnybooks Version:\n_______Responsibility\nWith great power there must also come -- great responsibility! (perhaps the most famous phrase of the Silver Age of comics, and, arguably, it redefined the narrative focus of the entire genre...or, as actor Nicholas Cage said, when presenting Stan Lee with a lifetime achievement award, it's a phrase that can raise an ordinary man up to the level of a hero...or bring a hero down to the level of an ordinary man.\u00a0 It was first expressed in a narrative caption (not by his uncle as it was in the movie) in Spider-Man's debut in Amazing Fantasy #15, Stan Lee)\n\"We are responsible for each other. That's part of being human -- isn't it?\" (Robin re-iterating a similar \"brother's keeper\" theme, though on a more personal level, after Batman denies responsibility for Catwoman's nervous breakdown -- a sentiment Batman would come to recognize by issue's end -- \"Never Scratch a Cat\" Batman #355, Gerry Conway)\n\"You've been so full of vindictive, self-righteous wrath that you've forgotten one little thing; you killed this man's wife and child! If Fate is insane, if \"Sunshine\" is dead -- it's your fault!\" (Super hero Devil Slayer was a reformed mob hit man, but when Fate, a man whose wife and child Devil-Slayer had inadvertently killed, comes after him for revenge, it's the people around Devil-Slayer who suffer -- including a junkie Devil Slayer had been trying to rehabilitate named \"Sunshine\". It took guest star Wonder Man, in the above dialogue, to remind Devil-Slayer that culpability doesn't end just 'cause we want it to -- \"Yesterday Never Dies!\" The Defenders, 1st series, #104, J.M. DeMatteis)\n________War & Consequences\n\"Wars are never won, regardless of who might be the victor. The very act of war is itself a horrible defeat.\" (a Guardian of the Universe to Hal Jordan after Hal asks if \"we've won?\" as they survey the grim aftermath of a conflict between the Green Lantern Corps and the Weaponers of Qward -- \"Battleground: Oa!\" Green Lantern, 1st Silver Age series, #127, Denny O'Neil)\n\"No good has ever come of a Holy War, and never will!\" (Superman chastising some Christian and Jewish kids fighting over religious differences -- though the kids make up by agreeing to aall go off and watch A Christmas Carol together, suggesting the writer may've missed the nuances of the conflict himself! -- \"The War for Peace\", Action Comics #517, Gerry Conway)\n\"I got a look at some of our Japanese-American relocation centers, back during the Big One. Saw what they do to men -- on both sides of the barbed wire.\" (Nick Fury explaining why he allowed traitor-by-association, the alien Captain Marvel, to escape -- \"All Things Must End!\" Avengers, 1st series, #92, Roy Thomas)\n\"We didn't mean it! We never mean it! But what good does that do...\" (Vietnam veteran Flash Thompson, having second thoughts about the war in Southeast Asia and its impact on the Vietnemese -- \"Enter: Dr. Strange!\" Amazing Spider-Man, 1st series, #109, Stan Lee)\n\"I'll never forget the Death Star...but I'll never forget the day after it, either.\" (Luke Skywalker battles a storm trooper in the aftermath of the destruction of the Death Star, only to discover that, beneath the impersonal mask, lies a boy no older than himself.\u00a0 Not a radical scene, but it spoke more about\u00a0 the reality of war in a single comicbook than in any of George Lucas' multi-billion dollar grossing motion pictures -- \"The Day After the Death Star\" Star Wars, Marvel Illustrated Book, vol. 1, Archie Goodwin)\n________Right & Wrong\n\"In this world, there is right and there is wrong, and that distinction is not difficult to make.\" (Superman making, arguably, an oversimplification...but, damn!, it makes sense -- Kingdom Come #3, Mark Waid, but paraphrasing a phrase written by Elliot S! Maggin in the novel Superman, The Last Son of Krypton...and maybe elsewhere)\n\"Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.\" (Rorschach summing up his philosophy -- \"A Stronger Loving World\" The Watchmen #12, Alan Moore)\n\"May God protect us -- from guys who do the right thing.\" (Hulk side kick Jim Wilson after being reassured his betrayal of the Hulk was the \"right thing\" to do -- \"A Titan Stalks the Tenements!\" The Hulk, 2nd series, #131, Roy Thomas)\n\"What you say is reasonable, logical, justifiable. But does that make it right?\" (Nightcrawler's pointed response to Wolverine's justification of lethal force...and you can bet Marvel doesn't O.K. such critiques of their feral cash cow these days -- \"Rage\" Uncanny X-Men #140, 1st series, Chris Claremont)\n________Truth\n\"(Truth) is a subjective concept, one to be accepted or rejected depending on the viewer's prejudices\" (villain Thanos -- \"How Strange My Destiny\" Warlock, 1st series, #11, Jim Starlin)\n\"..truth is a whore. She'll belong to any man for an hour if the price is right. When the time's done, you're back where you started -- alone.\" (A philosophical member oof the conspiracy -- \"A Little Dream of Me\" The X-Files, Topps series, #3, Stefan Petrucha)\n\"The news isn't there to tell you what happened. It's there to tell you what it wants you to hear, or what it thinks you want to hear. They already have their stories worked out. They just wait for events to fill in the blanks.

Only there's skins you never bothered with -- the Black Skins!\" (An elderly African-American confronting Green Lantern, as DC Comics tried to grown up with the times...and maybe acknowledge that sometimes \"metaphors\" like orange skinned aliens have to give way to literal issues -- \"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight!\", Green Lantern, 1st Silver Age series, #76, Denny O'Neil)\n________Philosophy in a Nut Shell\n\"Do you suppose they finally understood...that a man who can inspire laughter...and joy...is the holiest man of all?\" (guest star Ayla, in what could be an eulogy for entertainers everywhere; actually I could literally quote almost the entire issue, it's that good -- \"And Then I Died\" Man-Thing, 1st series, #6, Steve Gerber)\n\"Insanity is defined by its cultural milieu.\" (told ya I could quote more from that issue -- Man-Thing #6, again!)\n\"A man without hope is a man without fear\" (mobster, the Kingpin, too late realizing he might've created an even more implacable enemy in Daredevil, after stripping him of everything he holds dear -- \"Pariah\", Daredevil, 1st series, #229, Frank Miller)\n\"..nobody's got so many friends that he can afford to start losin' 'em.\" (The Falcon, explaing his search for a missing old friend -- \"The Summons of Psyklop\" The Avengers (1st series) #88, Roy Thomas)\nChildhood is the interval between nothingness and disillusionment. An interval of innocence. (A text caption from \"Suffer the Children\" The Question #3, Dennis O'Neil)\n\"Vengeance is but the last resort of the unthinking!\" (Vashti trying, in vain, to calm the raging Prince Namor, The Sub-Mariner -- \"When a Monarch Goes Mad!\", Tales to Astonish #81, Stan Lee)\n\"Every time a man raises his hand against his neighbour in the name of his faith, he renounces his faith!\" (Superman, same scene as the earlier quote in the War & Consequences category -- \"The War for Peace\" Action Comics #517, Gerry Conway)\n\"The real proof of a man is not how he treats his friends...but his enemies!\" (Kid Flash -- \"Less Than Human!?\", Teen Titans (1st series) #33, Bob Haney, 1972)\n\"But, surely this is better than celebrating the season of life by killing a tree?\" (Mr. Fantastic explaining the moral virtues of an artificial Christmas Tree -- \"Terrax the Untamed\", The Fantastic Four, 1st series, #242, John Byrne)\n\"..once you find an excuse for killing, you will never lack one.\" (The Phantom Stranger cautioning that some lines, once crossed, can't be un-crossed -- \"Images of the Dead\" The Phantom Stranger, 2nd series, #37, Paul Levitz)\n\"People are like cattle.

In anticipation of Joss Whedon\u2019s superhero epic, we\u2019ll have a variety of articles and reviews published looking at various aspects of \u201cEarth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes.\u201d\nRead our review of The Avengers here .\nAvengers/JLA is about as nerdy as a comic book crossover can get. Really. It takes two teams of superheroes which were both formed to allow existing heroes to team up\u2026 and then teams those two teams up. It\u2019s pure geek chic, after all. I have no shame in admitting that I enjoyed on a purely fanboyish\u00a0level, my inner eight-year-old ecstatic at the idea of taking so many toys out of so many different boxes and bashing them together which such delightful cheer. It\u2019s not an essential story, nor a brilliant one, nor a creative one \u2013 but it does exactly what it says on the tin. It gives us a gigantic crossover between two of the more recognisable Marvel and DC superhero teams.\nThe very definition of awesome...\nI suppose that Kurt Busiek\u00a0and George Perez make good choices to work on this. Both writer and artist have a long pedigree at each of the two companies, and each knows the universe and the material remarkably well. Busiek, of course, relaunched the Avengers at Marvel (and offered us\u00a0the superb Marvels miniseries) as well as relaunching Superman after Infinite Crisis. Perez himself was the chief artist on a long and appreciated Avengers run with Busiek and had also drawn perhaps the most essential DC universe story of all time \u2013 Crisis on Infinite Earths . These impressive bodies of work notwithstanding, both are perfectly qualified for the job because they love the characters.\nBusiek knows his continuity inside out, and Perez can draw detail like nobody\u2019s business. The oversized edition from DC is perhaps the best way to read this book, as it allows you to drink in some of Perez\u2019s superb work. It\u2019s rendered beautifully. Even when the story and dialogue are just a little bit flakey, you need only study the art to be swept off your feet. It\u2019s presented in a wonderful way.\nPlay spot the hero...\nBusiek, as the writer, knows that he isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel here. It\u2019s a giant inter-company crossover, not an acclaimed reimagining. The plot is really just dressing, following the patterns of other gigantic comic book events. In the opening pages, the same anti-matter universe is destroyed as was destroyed at the start of Crisis on Infinite Earths. The two teams don\u2019t work together off the bat \u2013 contrived circumstances are constructed to ensure that fans are treated to long and ominous confrontations in which all characters are well represented. There\u2019s a traditional \u201cquest\u201d narrative which sees the teams essentially competing for items plucked from the mythology of both universes, but there\u2019s also a second narrative which sees the teams uniting to save reality itself.\nIt\u2019s interesting how Busiek contrasts not only the characters, but the very outlooks of the worlds that they inhabit. The Flash arrives in the Marvel Universe only to find himself lynched by an anti-mutant mob. When the Avengers land in Metropolis, they are greeted by screaming fans who just want their autographs. It might\u00a0a very reductive impression of the worlds portrayed across the two companies, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it is in any way inaccurate.\nMetron shares a universe...\nThe Marvel Universe is, by its very nature, darker and grittier. \u201cIf I lived over there?\u201d the Flash asks on returning to the Justice League satellite. \u201cI\u2019d want to get out, too.\u201d Superman doesn\u2019t have to see too much of it to realise that \u201cit\u2019s not a nice place.\u201d It\u2019s a world where people with gifts are hunted and feared, and the heroes are barely tolerated, let alone appreciated (it\u2019s worth noting that this miniseries was published a few years before the Marvel Universe fully tore apart these characters and their ideas or heroism in events like Civil War and World War Hulk ).\nSuperman is less than impressed with the notoriously flawed superheroes who inhabit this world. \u201cIf those were its heroes, I\u2019m not impressed,\u201d he remarks after their first encounter, going on to describe the Avengers as \u201ca sorry, disgraceful shambles.\u201d Indeed, this world creates an under-siege mindset in the characters that inhabit it. As they are about to venture to the DC universe, Captain America warns his colleagues that, \u201cit\u2019s likely we\u2019ll be met with hostility.\u201d\nCaptain America steps up to bat...\nBy contrast, the DC universe is a far brighter place. It runs on far more hokey science, for example. \u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d Iron Man remarks of the Flash\u2019s cosmic treadmill, a sixties sci-fi conceit if ever there was one. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work back home.\u201d However, the differences are deeper than that. \u201cThey do honour their heroes well here,\u201d Thor remarks, while Quicksilver \u2013 forever persecuted as a mutant \u2013 is amazed to visit the Flash Museum. Captain America is not convinced by the facade, and argues that the heroes of the DC universe tower over the citizens that inhabit it like gods.\nBusiek\u00a0acknowledges that the it\u2019s wrong to attempt to compare the two fictional worlds, or to argue one is better or worse than the other. Although the JLA\u00a0as a team seem more effective and stronger than the Avengers, he does have Aquaman put it in context: \u201cThe heroes here seem less powerful, in general, then at home. And their world\u2019s stacked against them \u2013 so it seem like they\u2019ve just got to fight amazingly hard to keep things on an even keel.\u201d It explains why it might be harsh to measure the two against each other \u2013 which would be a foolish choice, but you know that some fans will. Towards the end of the crossover, Superman himself adequately sums up the differences in philosophy between the two universes, stating that they are brothers in arms \u201cwhether we fear we do too much \u2013 or not enough.\u201d Guess which side is which.\nThe big blue boy scouts share a moment...\nThere are times when\u00a0Busiek\u00a0does push the boat out a little bit too far. In the early stages of the crossover, Busiek writes Superman and Captain America as jerks, who are confrontational for the sake of being confrontational. Superman decries Captain America\u2019s \u201cphony, sanctimonious pose\u201d, while the Avenger describes the Kryptonian as an \u201cover-muscled, high-and-mighty pretty boy.\u201d In the story, Busiek explains this as the result of the universes melding and possibly some outside influence thrown into the mix. It\u2019s also more than likely the author was using the characters to mock hardcore DC or Marvel fans who irrationally hate the other company for any number of exaggerated reasons. Whatever the concept, it gets very old very fast \u2013 Superman seems to spend most of the crossover in dire need of a chill pill. Until he gets to hold Captain America\u2019s shield and Thor\u2019s hammer. That\u2019s just cool.\nBusiek\u00a0is wonderful at chopping and changing various characters and storypoints\u00a0from the comic books, drawing from a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of both universes. He knows that the crossover is running purely on the thrill of seeing all these characters in the same panel, so he teases us with any number of intriguing fantasy combinations. He never allows them to bog down the whole crossover, but provides any number of fleeting and tantalising glimpses. My personal favourites includes Darkseid (who, we\u2019re told, is \u201cworse than Thanos\u201d) holding the Infinity Gauntlet for a page, or a quick panel of Lobo\u00a0tearing into the Shi\u2019ar\u00a0Imperial Guard, or Amazo\u00a0and Ultron\u00a0bonded together. I\u2019m pretty sure I missed a whole host of similar references, but Busiek knows the audience that he is pitching this towards \u2013 and it never reaches the same levels of \u201cinside baseball\u201d as, say, Avengers Forever .\nUh-oh...\nEven the DC and Marvel characters he pairs up are inspired \u2013 there\u2019s virtually something wonderful about each combination who share a panel. For example, seeing Green Lantern and Iron Man walking into a meeting together calls to mind the suggestion that they perhaps perfect counterparts to each other. Iron Man and Batman share a short bit as the two billionaires on each team, one a weapon\u2019s manufacturer and the other who has vowed never to use a gun. Wonder Woman, from a mythical island, goes to Asgard. The happily married Sue and Ralph Dibny\u00a0provide an effective contrast to Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne. Aquaman\u00a0comments on\u00a0Victor Von Doom, \u201cThis is no way for a monarch to act.\u201d There\u2019s a lot to think about and digest in those compositions, and it\u2019s\u00a0clear that Busiek and Perez put these panels together with a lot of thought.\nTake, for example, the way that Busiek\u00a0pairs Batman and Captain America. One might think that the idealistic Superman would make the perfect counterpart for the First Avenger \u2013 and, in a way, the two do take on the burden of speaking for their universes. However, Captain America is \u2013 Busiek suggests \u2013 a better foil to Batman. By comparing the most idealistic Marvel character to the most cynical DC character, he makes a wonderful point of comparison between both fictional universes \u2013 Batman would be relatively normal in the Marvel Universe and Captain America would be fairly average (perhaps even a little cynical) in the DC Universe.\nExplosive action...\nBut it goes deeper than that. Ignoring for a moment how cool their \u201cmeta\u201d fight is (they consider fighting, but decide that they\u2019ll fight each other to a standstill, so just decide to team up instead), Busiek hits on some fairly fundamental points of comparison between the two. \u201cYou\u2026 lost a partner?\u201d Captain America suggests as he stumbles across the memorial for Jason Todd in the Batcave \u2013 calling to mind the death of Bucky in the Second World War. When Captain America reveals an ace up his sleeve, Batman acknowledges that he too is a master strategist. \u201cYou were more prepared than you seemed,\u201d he concedes. The collection opens with Batman telepathically\u00a0coordinating a Justice League assault, and it ends with Captain America telepathically directing both the League and the Avengers. They\u2019re quite alike, but born on different worlds.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is how Busiek\u00a0is able to use the most cringeworthy\u00a0moments in the history of each character as part of the plot of the story. Confronted with the responsibility of restoring the two continuities, the characters each face their own futures \u2013 a veritable selection of awkward moments that even the nerdier amongst the audience would like to forget, mostly from \u201cthe dark age of comic books\u201d (that period in the nineties Busiek and many others would rather forget). \u201cAnd in the end,\u201d the narration remarks, \u201ctheir minds are overwhelmed with death and betrayal and madness \u2014 and even the images of hope, warmth and love are scant comfort.\u201d Iron Man remembers his murderous days in the Crossing, Hal Jordan remembers the time he massacred the Green Lantern Corps. Batman remembers A Death in the Family . These are all sore points for the fans and the characters, moments which have hung over the heads of the characters and the continuity for a long time.\nA crossover...\nHere Busiek makes the decision of the heroes to set things back to the way they were a more nuanced and tragic one. This isn\u2019t just Standard Superhero Operating Procedures 101, this is something with real and tangible consequences for them. Hal Jordan and Barry Allen make the choice to go back, knowing that they will die (well, at least for a while \u2013 both have since returned). Indeed, much like in Alex Ross\u2019 miniseries Justice , Busiek has Hal Jordan reject a comfortable but fake reality in order to confront a harsher real world. This is poetic, given that it was Hal\u2019s construction of an elaborate fantasy when he was unable to deal with his own reality is what led to his death.\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Busiek basically uses the opportunity to make an argument not only in favour of sticking to established continuity even when difficult, but also to defend the seeming static portrayal of these characters at the same time. He argues, quite astutely,\u00a0that any progressive changes\u00a0to these characters are ultimately overwritten anyway. Notice, for example, the many appearances of Superman during the climactic fight (at one stage, he grows a mullet and then becomes \u201celectric blue\u201d Superman \u2013 the point that Thor can\u2019t recognise him as Superman). Busiek would argue that \u2013 since we inevitably return to the same template, we shouldn\u2019t change it too much.\nLet's you and him fight!\n\u201cTwenty minutes ago, we never had children,\u201d the Scarlet Witch explains, facing a life which is rapidly shifting before her eyes. \u201cIn five minutes, we may not ever have been married. Don\u2019t you see? We can\u2019t preserve the way things are. But if we try to restore what was\u2026\u201d To Busiek, if we \u201ctry to restore what was\u201d, we can keep the comic book industry afloat. None of any of these cosmetic or \u201ccutting edge\u201d changes to characters are sustainable (\u201cwe can\u2019t preserve the way things are\u201d), so we are best to leave the classics as they work best.\nPerhaps I\u2019m reading too much into it. It\u2019s a fun crossover.It comes complete with a smaller supplemental book which includes all manner of juicy, nerdy extras. There\u2019s the infamous \u201cshouting match\u201d that resulted from the original eighties attempt at a Marvel/DC crossover (with the two companies blaming each other rather loudly for the deal falling through), but there\u2019s also George Perez\u2019s original artwork for the first issue of that proposed miniseries, complete with notes. Perez also annotes his artwork on the main series \u2013 better allowing the reader to appreciate his level of detail (including cameos for the Joker and Wolverine).\nDetails are sketchy at best...\nOther extras include material from Busiek, such as his original pitch and the proposed \u201calternate\u201d third chapter, which would have seen the characters swap universes. I\u2019m kinda curious to see what Marvel\u2019s Superman or DC\u2019s Hulk would look like, but perhaps it would have been one gimmick too far. Anyway, the extras are superb.\nSo, Avengers/JLA succeeds as an inter-company crossover, which is surprisingly difficult given the bureaucracy surrounding them (consult the extras for an idea of the scale of the administrative hurdles facing Busiek and Perez). It doesn\u2019t necessarily need any excess thought beyond \u201coooh, this is cool\u201d. While it contains countless easter eggs, it isn\u2019t as dense as Avengers Forever and is quite accessible for anybody with a passing knowledge of the DC and Marvel Universes. It does exactly what it says on the tin.\nRate this:\n"}, {"score": 216.24203, "uuid": "d602627c-ad05-5564-84d4-2869aab8fcce", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-33-14589", "target_hostname": "dskemmanuel.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://dskemmanuel.deviantart.com/?offset=40", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "dskemmanuel on deviantART", "snippet": "I have submitted my poster in the latest DevianArt contest if you would like to I have also made a deviation of The Incredible <em>Hulk</em> vs the Prince of Saiyans: Vegeta.

Which to my mind spells the end of summer. \u00a0Who cares what the calendar says, summer = not-in-school, end of discussion. And the end of summer, also, means the end of summer movie season. Some cinephiles welcome this transition. Not me.\nYou see, I like comic books. And I\u2019m not one of those stuck-up toffs who thinks comics need to be graphic novels, all arty and grown-up and off-putting. No, I like superhero comics, and I like movies based on superhero comics. I like popcorn movies, I like movies who only aim to please, I like special effects.\nIn short, I\u2019m easy to please. That being said, why am I so heard to please?\nI mean, seriously. Is it too much to ask that when you have a consortium of media companies who\u2019ve invested a hundred million dollars or more in something they chooses to refer to as a \u201ctent-pole,\u201d and then invest another big sack of million dollar bills in market-testing, that the end result actually be worth paying money to sit through?\nAm I being radical by asking that movies calculated to be entertaining be entertaining?\nPart of the problem is this unholy obsession with origin stories that has unaccountably gripped Hollywood. I have come to believe that the five most terrifying words in the English language are \u201cevery story has a beginning.\u201d\nLet\u2019s take as a point of discussion Ang Lee\u2019s The Hulk, a film widely derided and very close to joining Ishtar as a punch line. For all that is said and written about this film\u2019s missteps, not enough focus is given to the most obvious culprit: the decision to make it about the Hulk\u2019s origins.\nThe first wave of superhero comics had heroes who were magical beings, space aliens, or rich men with psychological disorders: Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman. When Marvel came along to provide some competition in the marketplace, part of what they did to set their brand identity apart was to enforce some \u201crealism,\u201d at least by the standards of Cold War era pulp fiction. Marvel heroes had \u201cscientific\u201d explanations\u2013usually something to do with radiation.\nFast forward to the 21st century, where 50 plus years of experience with radiation has taught us the cold, unhappy truth: it causes cancer. And not a whole lot else.\nBut in the world of comics, who cares? The Hulk is an interesting character, a tragic figure a la Larry Talbot of the old Wolf Man movies. His origins are buried in the distant past, swept under the pop cultural carpet. All the hard-to-swallow stuff is behind us, and we can just indulge in the fun of watching poor Bruce Banner lose his cool.\nBut noooooo, the producers of the film felt that the best, most important, most satisfying Hulk story to tell was that first one, the least plausible and least enjoyable.\nTime was, superhero movies didn\u2019t care about origins, and accepted the fact that the fun stuff happens in media res.\nTake for example the first superhero movie of them all, Judex.\nIf you wanted to be pedantic (and believe me, I\u2019m fighting the urge), you could say that superhero fiction has its roots in eighteenth and nineteenth century pulp detective fiction\u2013the Vidocqs and Lecoqs and Lupins. Fair enough. But you could do worse than start your clock at the moment Judex takes the stage.\nJudex was a cliffhanger adventure serial created by the inestimable Louis Feuillade in 1917. Feuillade had taken some heat from the decency police of his day for allegedly glamorizing crime and violence in such serials as Fantomas and Les Vampires. Feuillade decided to try to shake the censors off his back by taking the genre formula he\u2019d perfected and invert it, so that it celebrated a good guy rather than a ne\u2019er- do-well.\nWhen Judex begins, the audience is lulled into thinking the mysterious black clad stranger is another Fantomas-style villain, preying on an upstanding and respectable French family. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that the so-called victims of Judex\u2019s attacks are corrupt monsters who have been shielded by their power and prestige. Judex is an avenger, tired of waiting for official justice, who has decided to settle the score on his own terms\u2013using secret identities, gadgets, comrades, and an underground lair.\nIf you\u2019re thinking \u201cBatman\u201d while watching this, well, come to front of the class and accept your gold star. The influence is so obvious that, had this happened in this era rather than a century ago there would\u2019ve been lawsuits.\nThen in 1963, Georges Franju remade Judex. And I mean remake\u2013no silly \u201cre-imagining\u201d nonsense for him. Franju probably would have preferred to have been reverse-reincarnated as Feuillade, and figured the next best thing was to obsessively remake Feuillade\u2019s films for modern audiences, with as few revisions as possible.\nHere\u2019s a small taste of the Feuillade/batman overlaps: in 1996, art house filmmaker Olivier Assayas paid his homage to Feuillade in the form of Irma Vep. It was a film-within-film study of a French film crew that sets out to pay homage to Feuillade by making a remake of Les Vampires. The crew within the film try to bring some contemporary energy to their remake by acting Hong Kong star Maggie Chung as Irma Vep, the slinky female super villain of the story. And when it comes time to outfit Chung for her role, naturally enough they attempt to copy Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s Catwoman costume from Tim Burton\u2019s Batman Returns!\nSome small-minded development executive is going to read this blog and go into work on Monday proposing a remake of Judex, maybe starring Steve Carell or Zach Efron, that would be all about The Rise of Judex. Judex Begins. Something like that. Every story has a beginning. And it would tell the story of young Judex\u2019s victimization at the hands of banker Favreaux (played by Jon Favreau, of course!). The film would end with Judex in his secret lair, wrapping a mask around his face for the first time. You\u2019d have to do it this way, of course, to introduce the character of Judex to American audiences, who wouldn\u2019t be familiar with him, right?\nI really don\u2019t get that fixation on origin stories. Who needs to be introduced at the beginning? How many of your best friends did you meet when they were born? The original Judex opens with his revenge scheme already in full swing\u2013the 1960 remake chose not to change this, knowing that the audience would figure out what they needed to know about the character as it went along.\nThe very first Batman comic, taking whatever inspiration it did from Judex, isn\u2019t Batman\u2019s first adventure, merely the first one the writers shared with us. His \u201corigin story\u201d wasn\u2019t unveiled until issue 33! And it doesn\u2019t seem to have hindered audience acceptance of the character.\nOh well. I\u2019m tired if kicking against the pricks. Next week I\u2019ll share with you my origin story.\n"}, {"score": 208.00473, "uuid": "addafb42-672b-5e40-8f37-27e3a51791ef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-04-17777", "target_hostname": "www.fascinationplace.org", "target_uri": "http://www.fascinationplace.org/tag/doctor-fate/", "page_rank": 1.2041608e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Doctor Fate &laquo; Fascination Place", "snippet": "The seven each have one <em>or</em> more unusual powers, but their father dotes on Number One, <em>who</em> <em>is</em> a <em>Superman</em>-like figure, and denegrates the others.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tags: Doctor Fate , Echo , Grendel , Star Trek\nThe Brave and the Bold #13, by Mark Waid, Jerry Ordway, Scott Koblish & Bob McLeod ( DC )\nCountdown to Mystery #8 of 8, by Matthew Sturges, Chad Hardin & Robert Campanella, and Adam Beechen & Stephen Jorge Segovia, and Mark Evanier, Joe Bennett & Belardino Brabo, and Mark Waid, Michael O\u2019Hare & John Floyd, and Gail Simone, Chad Hardin & Walden Wong (DC)\nJustice Society of America #15, by Geoff Johns, Alex Ross, Dale Eaglesham & Prentis Rollins (DC)\nTangent: Superman\u2019s Reign #3 of 12, by Dan Jurgens, Jamal Ingle & Robin Riggs (DC)\nEcho #3, by Terry Moore ( Abstract Studios )\nThe End League #3, by Rick Remender, Mat Broome & Sean Parsons ( Dark Horse )\nGrendel: Devil Quest HC , by Matt Wagner (Dark Horse)\nStar Trek: Assignment: Earth #1 of 12, by John Byrne ( IDW )\nThe Perhapanauts #2, by Todd Dezago & Craig Rousseau ( Image )\nWe\u2019ll probably never know what Steve Gerber had in mind for the conclusion to his Doctor Fate story in Countdown to Mystery before he died. Four 4-page entries written by four different writers probably wasn\u2019t it, and consequently the story comes to a rather abrupt end (several of them) with none of the delicacy it really required, as Gerber was always walking on the knife-edge of making the thing work anyway. Of the four, Mark Evanier\u2019s version feels most true to Gerber\u2019s style, while Gail Simone\u2019s feels the least. But all of them are too short, too simplistic. Gerber\u2019s writing has always (well, that I\u2019ve seen) had a strong psychological component, not only having quirky characters but exploring what their quirks mean and where they come from. Although this facet of his work was often the most uneven part, it\u2019s also a tack that few other comics writers ever take, and unfortunately what there is of that facet in these four endings tends to be far more heavy-handed than Gerber would have used.\nIt\u2019s not really anybody\u2019s fault, and I appreciate that DC and the four writers wanted to pay a little tribute to Gerber, but I think the story and the readers would have been better served to have picked one ending and done that one the best they could. Ah well.\nThe other half of the comics, the Eclipso yarn, ended up being slightly more meaningful than I\u2019d expected, comparing the similarities between Eclipso and the Spectre. The thing was still pretty superfluous, though, as nearly everything tied in to Countdown to Final Crisis has been. Just think: If DC had gone with Plan A and just done a Doctor Fate mini-series (which they had solicited and then cancelled), we could have avoided this whole Eclipso rubbish and Gerber might have been able to finish the story in his lifetime. Sheesh.\nThings really pick up in the third issue of Echo, which encourages me enormously: We find out something about\n\u2018s family, and why her husband is divorcing her. We find out something about the metal suit that\u2019s partially grafted itself onto her body. And there\u2019s an odd scene at the end which I expect will be explained in the coming months. Suddenly this is feeling like a much less generic indy comic. Which is good.\nMatt Wagner\u2019s Grendel series is one of my favorites. It didn\u2019t start out that way, though, as its first volume, Devil by the Deed concerned a crime lord named Hunter Rose. Wagner has revisited the Rose character from time to time, but I\u2019ve pretty much given up on those, as it\u2019s the least interesting slice of the Grendel story. Much more interesting are the stories which concern how Grendel \u2013 a spirit of aggression \u2013 affects the history of Earth over the next few hundred years, expanding from profoundly affecting a few influential individuals, to eventually helping to craft a global empire under the rule of Emperor Orion Assante several hundred years from now.\nThis volume, Devil Quest, takes place several generations after the excellent War Child story \u2013 which is about Orion\u2019s son, Jupiter \u2013 concerning several interested parties trying to locate the Grendel cyborg who had helped Jupiter establish his own rule after his father died. The cyborg Grendel-Prime is on his own mission trying to strengthen the Empire, too, and his quest leads directly into the second half of the Batman/Grendel volume (the better half, as the first half involves Hunter Rose meeting Batman).\nWritten and drawn by Wagner, the art is superb. The story is eccentric and sometimes violently brutal, which I think is intentional; Wagner was trying to shock and push the envelope a little. Unfortunately it also comes to an ending which feels unfinished \u2013 even with the Batman story factored in \u2013 which makes it a disappointing read in total. Though the trip to get there is quite interesting.\nAnyway, I did enjoy it enough to pick up this new hardcover collection. But your mileage may vary. I keep waiting for Wagner to do another Grendel sequence carrying the future history beyond this volume, but it seems like Wagner\u2019s done as much as he plans to with the tale and he\u2019s otherwise just poking around in the side corridors of the earlier stories, which doesn\u2019t interest me as much. Alas.\n\u201cAssignment: Earth\u201d was an episode of the original Star Trek series which was intended as a pilot for a new TV series. The series didn\u2019t sell, which isn\u2019t surprising because it was a pretty wan, unimaginative episode. Nonetheless, IDW\u2019s current renaissance of Star Trek comic books has resulted in a series based on the episode, written and drawn by John Byrne! As he\u2019s done elsewhere, Byrne is using an unorthodox storytelling technique of having each issue take place a year later than the first one. Although not everything Byrne does works for me, I do usually enjoy his stories which are structurally adventurous like this, so I was moved to buy it.\nIt\u2019s not bad, although it doesn\u2019t go much past the TV episode. But then, it\u2019s basically trying to lay the groundwork for the overall arc, which will I guess run through about 1980. He obviously has a lot of fun writing Roberta Lincoln (the Teri Garr role), as well as drawing Gary Seven (the Robert Lansing role) whose character he expands a little bit here. So it\u2019s a decent start, and I\u2019m curious to see where Byrne goes with it.\n"}, {"score": 207.98187, "uuid": "3376ad07-814c-518f-833e-752c98dbf956", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1709wb-12-07226", "target_hostname": "teran80.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://teran80.deviantart.com/", "page_rank": 5.590921e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "teran80 on deviantART", "snippet": "You must be familiar with the topic: Goku vs <em>Superman</em>, <em>who</em> <em>is</em> <em>stronger</em>?

Lying in bed, a never-ending debate runs through his mind over which superhero he should be when he gets big.\nBatman, Superman, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk. Even Plastic Man remains a viable option. Each, after all, is unique, offering a child endless possibilities in the way of costumes, superpowers, weapons, vehicles and villains.\nI may not be a superhero, but as a parent, I hope I\u2019m providing him with the lessons he needs to become one. Here are six that were handed down to me:\nSuperhero Lesson #1: Superheroes aren\u2019t perfect. Sometimes they crash\u2014and it\u2019s not always the cape\u2019s fault. Or the villain\u2019s fault. Or anybody\u2019s fault, really. Things just happen. Superheroes don\u2019t waste time blaming. If they crash, they brush it off and get back to business.\nSuperhero Lesson #2: Always trust your Spidey sense. It\u2019s usually right\u2014and with a little practice and a lot of faith, you\u2019ll learn that.\nSuperhero Lesson #3: To be successful in anything, you must first be successful in your mind. Picture it there first, and your body will know what to do when the time comes to face that first curveball.\nSuperhero Lesson #4: When you hear a screaming ambulance racing down the street\u2014be it close by or far off in the distance\u2014take a second and say a little prayer for whoever\u2019s in need. Superheroes can\u2019t be in all places at all times, but their prayers can be.\nSuperhero Lesson #5: Choose your words carefully. Most mere mortals assume that the greatest superhero powers come from radioactive accidents, genetic mutations or intergalactic immigration. The truth of the matter is, superheroes first master the most common\u2014and yet most difficult\u2014skills. Chief among those is choosing what you say carefully. Certain words shouldn\u2019t be uttered by any superhero. These include \u201cnever,\u201d \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d and \u201cI give up.\u201d Other examples include \u201chate\u201d and \u201ckill.\u201d\nJust the same, there are certain words in the vocabularies of all superheroes that should be said now and again\u2014and sometimes these are even more difficult to master. Examples include \u201chelp\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The thing is, superheroes can\u2019t do everything on their own, and they don\u2019t know everything there is to know. They\u2019re aware of this imperfect quality, no matter how super they may be. Choose your words\u2014and the words you choose not to use\u2014carefully.\nSuperhero Lesson #6: If there\u2019s one thing superheroes do well, it\u2019s appreciating how lucky they are. After all, it\u2019s not everyone who can fly, sling webs, or turn green and muscle-bound when danger looms. Superheroes are lucky\u2014and they know it. That\u2019s why they end each day with a prayer of thanks.\nAs you lie in bed at night, spend a few minutes thinking about everything you\u2019re thankful for: family, friends, your home, anyone and anything that made your day better. It\u2019s one of the most important exercises a superhero can do. And like all exercise, it makes you even stronger.\nDiscover more at www.superheroesintraining.com .\n"}, {"score": 205.52467, "uuid": "cef693bc-2dcb-5d11-8fd9-18825761a702", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1414wb-17-16831", "target_hostname": "acomicbookblog.com", "target_uri": "http://acomicbookblog.com/2012/03/comic-book-battle-fantasy-battle-tournament-round-2/", "page_rank": 1.2040453e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Comic Book Battles In Our Fantasy Battle Tournament | A Comic Book", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> there any reason why you didn\u2019t put in <em>superman</em> <em>or</em> spiderman?

However, the original to wear the suit made my gun toting Punisher look like\u00a0 rank amateur. And your mercenary with the eyepatch defeated my Widow with child like ease.

But my kung fu master got defeated as well by that tricky little bat child Red Robin and his arsenal of toys.

I will enjoy ruling your world when you lose.\u201d\nThe man in white leans forward in his seat and fixes his blank gaze on the man in darkness.

In HeroQuest, you narrate a story and then find a way to apply the rules to what you narrated, picking up the appropriate bonuses and abilities. Narration first, rule application second.\nThis is exactly how I have been playing for decades in RQ, BRP, KAP, GURPS or HERO\nOriginally Posted by RosenMcStern\nIn BRP, it is more frequent that you extract a story from the mechanical effects of rule application. Think of what happens in a RuneQuest combat: you roll the dice, you pick a combat manoeuver and then narrate the scene based on the mechanical effects dictated. Rule application first, narration second.\nI agree except for the last sentence. It is true that you might extract a story element from a rule. When the system is good, it does it fact enhance the story. It is a feature, not a bug.\nOriginally Posted by RosenMcStern\nThis is exactly the point. ALL systems work this way, if you rely on the GM.\nThat's why I don't see a direct gain of HQ over say HERO to play a super game. The great asset of HQ (narration), can be reproduced in HERO. I'd like to point out that we have been playing in very crunchy systems (a Champions campaign in HERO and a GURPS Warhammer campaign) and narration and roleplaying was a very heavy portion of our play time. Even in crunch time (mainly combat) in depth description of intent and colorful results supported by the rules and outcomes where the norm. The GURPS Warhammer game was very brutal and graphic, the Champions game was very high-flying and high-octane. HQ would have given us nothing more on both account and would have taken out all the tactical options and the precise depiction of powers (and yes, HERO and GURPS do support improvisational powers so contrary to popular belief, not everything has to be written on the sheet).\nNote though that I prefer crunchy games so obviously someone favoring rule light games might be put off by HERO or GURPS. Note also that as written, HERO, HQ and GURPS are all better suited for a super game because well BRP is underdevelopped on that front. If it was, BRP would in my opinion be better than HQ (playstyle preference) or GURPS (BRP just scale so much better than GURPS for high level supers). I am not sure it could acheive HERO's customization power though.\nOriginally Posted by RosenMcStern\nPlease note that the rules in BRP do not allow you to give bonuses because a relationship is in danger, so you are discussing your GM-ing style here, not BRP.\nThe little trick here is \"rules\" as opposed to \"rulings\". This is the difference.\nI'd like to dispute that on two accounts. First, one can use the Circumstantial Action Modifiers in BGB. Sure it doesn't specifically talk about relationship but it is a very good mechanic to take it into account. Second, other BRP family games have Passions and Personality mechanics.\nOriginally Posted by RosenMcStern\nThe point is that the relative scale in power level is true and fixed in stone only in the annual hero catalogs that illustrate how cool and powerful that hero is. I remember those splash pages with Spidey and the Thing and the Hulk and the exact weight they are able to lift, from the sixties, and everything looks like there is a set hierarchy of powers - and then, in the stories, things happen very differently and you have Captain America fighting against the Cosmic Cube (!).\nYes and no. The relative scale of power is almost always true. Hulk is stronger than the Thing who is stronger than Spider-Man. Mr.Fantastic is always the brightest of the 4 and Captain America is always the most charismatic leader. The only time it is not true, it's when there are special circumstances and plot devices. These can be dealt equally in BRP or HQ\nOriginally Posted by RosenMcStern\nHeroQuest 2 works this way, too: it gives you a tool to discriminate between Spiderman (Strong 10w2), The Thing (Strong 10w3) and The Hulk (Strong 10w4), and then tells you to ignore these values while the story unfolds, and set the difficulty according to what can make the story exciting. Well, this sounds exactly like what happens in the comics.\nFirst, this is not what happens is comics, and second that is part of my problem with HQ. I don't want a game to tell me to ignore values just because it suits the story. If, as a GM, I need an element as important as Hulk's strength to be tempered, I will alsolutely make it a strong element of the story (what? Hulk has lost his strength!) and introduce the plot element and corresponding modifier to suite the purpose instead of looking at the pass-fail cycle and realizing that oh, well, Hulk is not so tough this time around so let's work my story around that rule mechanic. The second thing is that as we can rate Spidey, Thing and Hulk's strength, so can we rate Doomsday, Black Adam and Darkseid but not in HQ since thy are treated as mere resistance.\nOriginally Posted by RosenMcStern\nNote - I am not saying it is the best way to handle things. I often pre-calculate resistances in HeroQuest, instead of using relative values and the pass-fail cycle. I am only saying that it does fit the way things are narrated in the comics rather well. In other genres, I would rather use different techniques.\nHQ has huge advantages on other games and these are low prep time and the lack of need of define power sets or NPC stats. The pass and fail cycle can also help a GM guide the story. I don't see it as the best fit for the genre but it can emulate it if the playstyle it provides suite your needs. It just doesn't suite mine.\nLast edited by DreadDomain; 2 Weeks Ago at 11:00.\n"}, {"score": 203.42087, "uuid": "654fe060-533b-5a0e-bc6b-871f0bde840d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0815wb-72-10531", "target_hostname": "quirkbooks.com", "target_uri": "http://quirkbooks.com/comment/2984", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "A Guide to Pairing Your Comics &amp; Beer | Quirk Books : Publishers &amp;", "snippet": ") <em>who</em> sometimes also the angel of death, <em>or</em> a redhead <em>who</em> <em>or</em> may <em>or</em> may not be either the embodiment <em>or</em> host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird \u2013 well, I think off-beat covers it.", "explanation": null, "document": "Seekers of All Things Awesome.

And in a world where comic books are finally seen as \u201ccool,\u201d why not add class it up some more? Comic books are an event, after all. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this all just a clever ruse for me to combine two of my biggest passions into one delectable event. Comics and Beer \u2013 the perfect combination. But like wine and cheese, the real trick is in finding a brew that will somehow improve upon your comic book affair. One that accentuates the proper tones, and enriches the flavor \u2013 a beer that you can experience along with your comic book. A beer that betters your comic book, and a comic book that betters your beer, all at the same time.\nHere\u2019s a brief guide to pairing your Comics and Beer:\nCaptain America: Captain America is, well, American. That\u2019s kind of the point. But not in that corporate, militant, bully nationalism-type way. Cap stands for the American ideal, something that everyone can agree with and get behind, that\u2019s not colored by politics and money. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to go for a microbrewed American-style lager or pale ale. Something clean, palatable, and easy to drink, something that everyone can agree on but is still wholly American. I\u2019d personally recommend Brooklyn Lager (after his home turf after all), or Sam Adams Lager, or something similar.\nDaredevil: The Man Without Fear is, of course, blind, but the rest of his senses are heightened and more than compensate for this. India Pale Ales (IPA) are flavorful and aromatic, thanks to an abundance of hops (historically added to act as a preservative so that English ales might survive the long trip to India). As a result, they engage the senses more than the average beer, and will encourage you to rely on more than just sight, like Daredevil himself. IPAs are also known for their bitterness, and as anyone who\u2019s ever read a Daredevil comic can attest, bitterness and aguish run rampant in the life of Matt Murdock. The higher alcohol content will make your head spin, much like the conspiracies and ninja smoke that Murdock faces himself. Recommended for the uninitiated: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, Mojo IPA, Harpoon IPA.\nWoodchuck Cider Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nSpider-Man: Spidey\u2019s not much of a drinker (except for that one time he got wasted on 2 beers at Aunt May\u2019s wedding and almost hooked up with his roommate before blacking out), so this is a tough one. But to complement Spider-Man\u2019s innocence and playful nature, I\u2019d recommend you go for a hard cider, such as Magners, Strongbow, or Woodchuck (Harpoon also makes one of which I am particularly fond). They basically taste like sparkling apple juice (something that Peter Parker would definitely drink), but with the added bonus of giving you a slight buzz (thank of it like your very own personal spider-sense). Plus, ciders are refreshing \u2013 an excellent end to a hard day of web-slinging.\nIron Man: Dude. Seriously? That\u2019s not funny. Tony\u2019s an alcoholic. (But if you were to drink something along with your Iron Man comics, I\u2019d recommend something classy and foreign, like a Chimay. Or go all the way like Tony himself with some red wine or a nice bottle of scotch. But you\u2019re still an insensitive jerk.)\nGhost Rider: Rogue Dead Guy Ale. *rim shot on the drums*\nThe Hulk: For a Hulk comic, you\u2019re going to want something strong. Something that gets you smashed. And possibly a little angry. Isn\u2019t that what The Hulk is all about? I\u2019d recommend a barleywine \u2013 Brooklyn Brewery\u2019s Monster Ale might be the best and most obvious option. Something (very) high in alcohol, with an almost sickly sweetness to counteract the bitter, chewy tastes. (and remind you of the human innocence within the Monster. Or something. I'm sure there's a metaphor in there somewhere.) You could also go for a Russian Stout, such as Rasputin\u2019s, which also has a sickly, albeit cough syrup-esque sweetness in otherwise dark and heavy brew (although this might be better paired with one of the Hulk\u2019s adversaries such as the Abomination or the Red Ghost).\nWolverine: Labatt Blue. For one thing, it\u2019s Canadian, and has that crisp, refreshing Canadian flavor (whatever that means). For another, you can drink a lot of these, and feel neither too full, nor too drunk, just like Wolverine himself! Except, you don\u2019t have a mutant healing factor, or an adamantium skeleton, nor were you the unwilling test subject of a government super-soldier experiment. So not like Wolverine at all. But enjoy the beer!\nX-Men: This is a very broad category, as there are a lot of X-Men among the different teams (approximately 198 at current, thanks to the Scarlet Witch). Rather than break them down by individual or team (which I could very easily do, but it would take a while, and I don\u2019t think you want to read about which beers pair best with Chamber, or Longshot), I would recommend that you pair your X-Men comics with any variety of brews for the Dogfish Head Brewery.\nDogfish Head\u2019s slogan touts them as \u201coff-centered ales for off-centered people,\u201d and, well, what\u2019s more off-centered than a bunch of genetically mutated superhumans banded together into a peacekeeping unit (and currently occupying an island nation off the coast of San Francisco)? Dogfish Head has a history of incorporating bizarre or slightly off-beat ingredients into their brews, and when you\u2019re looking at a cast of characters that includes a fuzzy blue lion-man who happens to be a scientific genius as well as a poet, or a billionaire playboy with feathered or metal wings (depending) who sometimes also the angel of death,\u00a0\u00a0or a redhead who or may or may not be either the embodiment or host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird \u2013 well, I think off-beat covers it.\nChocolate Stout Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nBatman: Look for a sweet stout, something along the lines of Young\u2019s Double Chocolate or Left Hand\u2019s Milk Stout. A darker, richer beer \u2013much like the Dark Knight himself \u2013 that still has a sweet spot, as Bruce does for young boys. (Not like, a sweet spot for young boys, like \u2013 whatever, you know what I mean, get your mind out of the gutter) The chocolate/sweetness is more of a mask \u2013 the face of Bruce Wayne, if you will \u2013 that plays up his exterior image as a decadent playboy, but really serves as an attempt to hide the burnt bitterness beneath. Of course, Batman is also a detective, and the thick, roasted, robust flavor of these stouts will encourage you to drink them more slowly, holding back the effects of intoxication and allowing you to keep up with the Great Gotham detective and solve the clues along with him.\nGreen Lantern: Arrogant Bastard Ale. A little darker, a little heavier \u2013 much like the emotional weight of being an intergalactic police officer \u2013 with a high enough alcohol content to make you a little hot-headed, like Hal Jordon himself. Or Guy Gardner. Or, hell, Sinestro. Or the Guardians, actually\u2026there\u2019s a lot of hot-headed Lanterns with dark sides to them, huh? Plus, Lanterns receive their abilities from willpower, and it\u2019ll take a lot of willpower to stand up, or doing productive, after polishing off a few of these.\nSuperman: Much like Captain America, Superman reflects an American ideal that everyone can get behind, regardless of politics. Unlike Cap, however, Superman isn\u2019t quite as in touch with the American people (because he\u2019s, ya know, an alien), and as such, wouldn\u2019t be as attuned to the craft beer movement that\u2019s been sweeping the nation. I would still pair him with a light, easy, American-style pale ale or lager, but rather than a hip microbrew, Superman would go better with something with more of a pedigree and universal appeal, such as Yuengling.\nThe Flash: FourLoko.

I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this all just a clever ruse for me to combine two of my biggest passions into one delectable event. Comics and Beer \u2013 the perfect combination. But like wine and cheese, the real trick is in finding a brew that will somehow improve upon your comic book affair. One that accentuates the proper tones, and enriches the flavor \u2013 a beer that you can experience along with your comic book. A beer that betters your comic book, and a comic book that betters your beer, all at the same time.\nHere\u2019s a brief guide to pairing your Comics and Beer:\nCaptain America: Captain America is, well, American. That\u2019s kind of the point. But not in that corporate, militant, bully nationalism-type way. Cap stands for the American ideal, something that everyone can agree with and get behind, that\u2019s not colored by politics and money. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to go for a microbrewed American-style lager or pale ale. Something clean, palatable, and easy to drink, something that everyone can agree on but is still wholly American. I\u2019d personally recommend Brooklyn Lager (after his home turf after all), or Sam Adams Lager, or something similar.\nDaredevil: The Man Without Fear is, of course, blind, but the rest of his senses are heightened and more than compensate for this. India Pale Ales (IPA) are flavorful and aromatic, thanks to an abundance of hops (historically added to act as a preservative so that English ales might survive the long trip to India). As a result, they engage the senses more than the average beer, and will encourage you to rely on more than just sight, like Daredevil himself. IPAs are also known for their bitterness, and as anyone who\u2019s ever read a Daredevil comic can attest, bitterness and aguish run rampant in the life of Matt Murdock. The higher alcohol content will make your head spin, much like the conspiracies and ninja smoke that Murdock faces himself. Recommended for the uninitiated: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, Mojo IPA, Harpoon IPA.\nWoodchuck Cider Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nSpider-Man: Spidey\u2019s not much of a drinker (except for that one time he got wasted on 2 beers at Aunt May\u2019s wedding and almost hooked up with his roommate before blacking out), so this is a tough one. But to complement Spider-Man\u2019s innocence and playful nature, I\u2019d recommend you go for a hard cider, such as Magners, Strongbow, or Woodchuck (Harpoon also makes one of which I am particularly fond). They basically taste like sparkling apple juice (something that Peter Parker would definitely drink), but with the added bonus of giving you a slight buzz (thank of it like your very own personal spider-sense). Plus, ciders are refreshing \u2013 an excellent end to a hard day of web-slinging.\nIron Man: Dude. Seriously? That\u2019s not funny. Tony\u2019s an alcoholic. (But if you were to drink something along with your Iron Man comics, I\u2019d recommend something classy and foreign, like a Chimay. Or go all the way like Tony himself with some red wine or a nice bottle of scotch. But you\u2019re still an insensitive jerk.)\nGhost Rider: Rogue Dead Guy Ale. *rim shot on the drums*\nThe Hulk: For a Hulk comic, you\u2019re going to want something strong. Something that gets you smashed. And possibly a little angry. Isn\u2019t that what The Hulk is all about? I\u2019d recommend a barleywine \u2013 Brooklyn Brewery\u2019s Monster Ale might be the best and most obvious option. Something (very) high in alcohol, with an almost sickly sweetness to counteract the bitter, chewy tastes. (and remind you of the human innocence within the Monster. Or something. I'm sure there's a metaphor in there somewhere.) You could also go for a Russian Stout, such as Rasputin\u2019s, which also has a sickly, albeit cough syrup-esque sweetness in otherwise dark and heavy brew (although this might be better paired with one of the Hulk\u2019s adversaries such as the Abomination or the Red Ghost).\nWolverine: Labatt Blue. For one thing, it\u2019s Canadian, and has that crisp, refreshing Canadian flavor (whatever that means). For another, you can drink a lot of these, and feel neither too full, nor too drunk, just like Wolverine himself! Except, you don\u2019t have a mutant healing factor, or an adamantium skeleton, nor were you the unwilling test subject of a government super-soldier experiment. So not like Wolverine at all. But enjoy the beer!\nX-Men: This is a very broad category, as there are a lot of X-Men among the different teams (approximately 198 at current, thanks to the Scarlet Witch). Rather than break them down by individual or team (which I could very easily do, but it would take a while, and I don\u2019t think you want to read about which beers pair best with Chamber, or Longshot), I would recommend that you pair your X-Men comics with any variety of brews for the Dogfish Head Brewery.\nDogfish Head\u2019s slogan touts them as \u201coff-centered ales for off-centered people,\u201d and, well, what\u2019s more off-centered than a bunch of genetically mutated superhumans banded together into a peacekeeping unit (and currently occupying an island nation off the coast of San Francisco)? Dogfish Head has a history of incorporating bizarre or slightly off-beat ingredients into their brews, and when you\u2019re looking at a cast of characters that includes a fuzzy blue lion-man who happens to be a scientific genius as well as a poet, or a billionaire playboy with feathered or metal wings (depending) who sometimes also the angel of death,\u00a0\u00a0or a redhead who or may or may not be either the embodiment or host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird \u2013 well, I think off-beat covers it.\nChocolate Stout Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nBatman: Look for a sweet stout, something along the lines of Young\u2019s Double Chocolate or Left Hand\u2019s Milk Stout. A darker, richer beer \u2013much like the Dark Knight himself \u2013 that still has a sweet spot, as Bruce does for young boys. (Not like, a sweet spot for young boys, like \u2013 whatever, you know what I mean, get your mind out of the gutter) The chocolate/sweetness is more of a mask \u2013 the face of Bruce Wayne, if you will \u2013 that plays up his exterior image as a decadent playboy, but really serves as an attempt to hide the burnt bitterness beneath. Of course, Batman is also a detective, and the thick, roasted, robust flavor of these stouts will encourage you to drink them more slowly, holding back the effects of intoxication and allowing you to keep up with the Great Gotham detective and solve the clues along with him.\nGreen Lantern: Arrogant Bastard Ale. A little darker, a little heavier \u2013 much like the emotional weight of being an intergalactic police officer \u2013 with a high enough alcohol content to make you a little hot-headed, like Hal Jordon himself. Or Guy Gardner. Or, hell, Sinestro. Or the Guardians, actually\u2026there\u2019s a lot of hot-headed Lanterns with dark sides to them, huh? Plus, Lanterns receive their abilities from willpower, and it\u2019ll take a lot of willpower to stand up, or doing productive, after polishing off a few of these.\nSuperman: Much like Captain America, Superman reflects an American ideal that everyone can get behind, regardless of politics. Unlike Cap, however, Superman isn\u2019t quite as in touch with the American people (because he\u2019s, ya know, an alien), and as such, wouldn\u2019t be as attuned to the craft beer movement that\u2019s been sweeping the nation. I would still pair him with a light, easy, American-style pale ale or lager, but rather than a hip microbrew, Superman would go better with something with more of a pedigree and universal appeal, such as Yuengling.\nThe Flash: FourLoko.

Rather than break them down by individual or team (which I could very easily do, but it would take a while, and I don\u2019t think you want to read about which beers pair best with Chamber, or Longshot), I would recommend that you pair your X-Men comics with any variety of brews for the Dogfish Head Brewery.\nDogfish Head\u2019s slogan touts them as \u201coff-centered ales for off-centered people,\u201d and, well, what\u2019s more off-centered than a bunch of genetically mutated superhumans banded together into a peacekeeping unit (and currently occupying an island nation off the coast of San Francisco)? Dogfish Head has a history of incorporating bizarre or slightly off-beat ingredients into their brews, and when you\u2019re looking at a cast of characters that includes a fuzzy blue lion-man who happens to be a scientific genius as well as a poet, or a billionaire playboy with feathered or metal wings (depending) who sometimes also the angel of death,\u00a0\u00a0or a redhead who or may or may not be either the embodiment or host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird \u2013 well, I think off-beat covers it.\nChocolate Stout Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nBatman: Look for a sweet stout, something along the lines of Young\u2019s Double Chocolate or Left Hand\u2019s Milk Stout. A darker, richer beer \u2013much like the Dark Knight himself \u2013 that still has a sweet spot, as Bruce does for young boys. (Not like, a sweet spot for young boys, like \u2013 whatever, you know what I mean, get your mind out of the gutter) The chocolate/sweetness is more of a mask \u2013 the face of Bruce Wayne, if you will \u2013 that plays up his exterior image as a decadent playboy, but really serves as an attempt to hide the burnt bitterness beneath. Of course, Batman is also a detective, and the thick, roasted, robust flavor of these stouts will encourage you to drink them more slowly, holding back the effects of intoxication and allowing you to keep up with the Great Gotham detective and solve the clues along with him.\nGreen Lantern: Arrogant Bastard Ale. A little darker, a little heavier \u2013 much like the emotional weight of being an intergalactic police officer \u2013 with a high enough alcohol content to make you a little hot-headed, like Hal Jordon himself. Or Guy Gardner. Or, hell, Sinestro. Or the Guardians, actually\u2026there\u2019s a lot of hot-headed Lanterns with dark sides to them, huh? Plus, Lanterns receive their abilities from willpower, and it\u2019ll take a lot of willpower to stand up, or doing productive, after polishing off a few of these.\nSuperman: Much like Captain America, Superman reflects an American ideal that everyone can get behind, regardless of politics. Unlike Cap, however, Superman isn\u2019t quite as in touch with the American people (because he\u2019s, ya know, an alien), and as such, wouldn\u2019t be as attuned to the craft beer movement that\u2019s been sweeping the nation. I would still pair him with a light, easy, American-style pale ale or lager, but rather than a hip microbrew, Superman would go better with something with more of a pedigree and universal appeal, such as Yuengling.\nThe Flash: FourLoko.

Drink responsibly.\nThroughout history, mankind has always found reasons to add booze to everything, under the auspices of somehow making it classier. Eventually, people figured out how to use these seemingly tangential excuses for drink as a means of complementing and enhancing their experiences. Drinking wine? For shame! Wine and cheese? Perhaps a side of delicious red steak? Now we\u2019re talking! Drinking in the morning? Forbidden! Orange juice in your cocktail at brunch? Fantastic and socially acceptable! Even in a recession, when people are cutting corners and forced to find new ways to be frugal \u2013 everyone still likes to drink.\nThe point is, drink pairings are classy. And in a world where comic books are finally seen as \u201ccool,\u201d why not add class it up some more? Comic books are an event, after all. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this all just a clever ruse for me to combine two of my biggest passions into one delectable event. Comics and Beer \u2013 the perfect combination. But like wine and cheese, the real trick is in finding a brew that will somehow improve upon your comic book affair. One that accentuates the proper tones, and enriches the flavor \u2013 a beer that you can experience along with your comic book. A beer that betters your comic book, and a comic book that betters your beer, all at the same time.\nHere\u2019s a brief guide to pairing your Comics and Beer:\nCaptain America: Captain America is, well, American. That\u2019s kind of the point. But not in that corporate, militant, bully nationalism-type way. Cap stands for the American ideal, something that everyone can agree with and get behind, that\u2019s not colored by politics and money. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to go for a microbrewed American-style lager or pale ale. Something clean, palatable, and easy to drink, something that everyone can agree on but is still wholly American. I\u2019d personally recommend Brooklyn Lager (after his home turf after all), or Sam Adams Lager, or something similar.\nDaredevil: The Man Without Fear is, of course, blind, but the rest of his senses are heightened and more than compensate for this. India Pale Ales (IPA) are flavorful and aromatic, thanks to an abundance of hops (historically added to act as a preservative so that English ales might survive the long trip to India). As a result, they engage the senses more than the average beer, and will encourage you to rely on more than just sight, like Daredevil himself. IPAs are also known for their bitterness, and as anyone who\u2019s ever read a Daredevil comic can attest, bitterness and aguish run rampant in the life of Matt Murdock. The higher alcohol content will make your head spin, much like the conspiracies and ninja smoke that Murdock faces himself. Recommended for the uninitiated: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, Mojo IPA, Harpoon IPA.\nWoodchuck Cider Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nSpider-Man: Spidey\u2019s not much of a drinker (except for that one time he got wasted on 2 beers at Aunt May\u2019s wedding and almost hooked up with his roommate before blacking out), so this is a tough one. But to complement Spider-Man\u2019s innocence and playful nature, I\u2019d recommend you go for a hard cider, such as Magners, Strongbow, or Woodchuck (Harpoon also makes one of which I am particularly fond). They basically taste like sparkling apple juice (something that Peter Parker would definitely drink), but with the added bonus of giving you a slight buzz (thank of it like your very own personal spider-sense). Plus, ciders are refreshing \u2013 an excellent end to a hard day of web-slinging.\nIron Man: Dude. Seriously? That\u2019s not funny. Tony\u2019s an alcoholic. (But if you were to drink something along with your Iron Man comics, I\u2019d recommend something classy and foreign, like a Chimay. Or go all the way like Tony himself with some red wine or a nice bottle of scotch. But you\u2019re still an insensitive jerk.)\nGhost Rider: Rogue Dead Guy Ale. *rim shot on the drums*\nThe Hulk: For a Hulk comic, you\u2019re going to want something strong. Something that gets you smashed. And possibly a little angry. Isn\u2019t that what The Hulk is all about? I\u2019d recommend a barleywine \u2013 Brooklyn Brewery\u2019s Monster Ale might be the best and most obvious option. Something (very) high in alcohol, with an almost sickly sweetness to counteract the bitter, chewy tastes. (and remind you of the human innocence within the Monster. Or something. I'm sure there's a metaphor in there somewhere.) You could also go for a Russian Stout, such as Rasputin\u2019s, which also has a sickly, albeit cough syrup-esque sweetness in otherwise dark and heavy brew (although this might be better paired with one of the Hulk\u2019s adversaries such as the Abomination or the Red Ghost).\nWolverine: Labatt Blue. For one thing, it\u2019s Canadian, and has that crisp, refreshing Canadian flavor (whatever that means). For another, you can drink a lot of these, and feel neither too full, nor too drunk, just like Wolverine himself! Except, you don\u2019t have a mutant healing factor, or an adamantium skeleton, nor were you the unwilling test subject of a government super-soldier experiment. So not like Wolverine at all.

Dogfish Head has a history of incorporating bizarre or slightly off-beat ingredients into their brews, and when you\u2019re looking at a cast of characters that includes a fuzzy blue lion-man who happens to be a scientific genius as well as a poet, or a billionaire playboy with feathered or metal wings (depending) who sometimes also the angel of death,\u00a0\u00a0or a redhead who or may or may not be either the embodiment or host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird \u2013 well, I think off-beat covers it.\nChocolate Stout Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nBatman: Look for a sweet stout, something along the lines of Young\u2019s Double Chocolate or Left Hand\u2019s Milk Stout. A darker, richer beer \u2013much like the Dark Knight himself \u2013 that still has a sweet spot, as Bruce does for young boys. (Not like, a sweet spot for young boys, like \u2013 whatever, you know what I mean, get your mind out of the gutter) The chocolate/sweetness is more of a mask \u2013 the face of Bruce Wayne, if you will \u2013 that plays up his exterior image as a decadent playboy, but really serves as an attempt to hide the burnt bitterness beneath. Of course, Batman is also a detective, and the thick, roasted, robust flavor of these stouts will encourage you to drink them more slowly, holding back the effects of intoxication and allowing you to keep up with the Great Gotham detective and solve the clues along with him.\nGreen Lantern: Arrogant Bastard Ale. A little darker, a little heavier \u2013 much like the emotional weight of being an intergalactic police officer \u2013 with a high enough alcohol content to make you a little hot-headed, like Hal Jordon himself. Or Guy Gardner. Or, hell, Sinestro. Or the Guardians, actually\u2026there\u2019s a lot of hot-headed Lanterns with dark sides to them, huh? Plus, Lanterns receive their abilities from willpower, and it\u2019ll take a lot of willpower to stand up, or doing productive, after polishing off a few of these.\nSuperman: Much like Captain America, Superman reflects an American ideal that everyone can get behind, regardless of politics. Unlike Cap, however, Superman isn\u2019t quite as in touch with the American people (because he\u2019s, ya know, an alien), and as such, wouldn\u2019t be as attuned to the craft beer movement that\u2019s been sweeping the nation. I would still pair him with a light, easy, American-style pale ale or lager, but rather than a hip microbrew, Superman would go better with something with more of a pedigree and universal appeal, such as Yuengling.\nThe Flash: FourLoko.

Drink responsibly.\nThroughout history, mankind has always found reasons to add booze to everything, under the auspices of somehow making it classier. Eventually, people figured out how to use these seemingly tangential excuses for drink as a means of complementing and enhancing their experiences. Drinking wine? For shame! Wine and cheese? Perhaps a side of delicious red steak? Now we\u2019re talking! Drinking in the morning? Forbidden! Orange juice in your cocktail at brunch? Fantastic and socially acceptable! Even in a recession, when people are cutting corners and forced to find new ways to be frugal \u2013 everyone still likes to drink.\nThe point is, drink pairings are classy. And in a world where comic books are finally seen as \u201ccool,\u201d why not add class it up some more? Comic books are an event, after all. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this all just a clever ruse for me to combine two of my biggest passions into one delectable event. Comics and Beer \u2013 the perfect combination. But like wine and cheese, the real trick is in finding a brew that will somehow improve upon your comic book affair. One that accentuates the proper tones, and enriches the flavor \u2013 a beer that you can experience along with your comic book. A beer that betters your comic book, and a comic book that betters your beer, all at the same time.\nHere\u2019s a brief guide to pairing your Comics and Beer:\nCaptain America: Captain America is, well, American. That\u2019s kind of the point. But not in that corporate, militant, bully nationalism-type way. Cap stands for the American ideal, something that everyone can agree with and get behind, that\u2019s not colored by politics and money. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to go for a microbrewed American-style lager or pale ale. Something clean, palatable, and easy to drink, something that everyone can agree on but is still wholly American. I\u2019d personally recommend Brooklyn Lager (after his home turf after all), or Sam Adams Lager, or something similar.\nDaredevil: The Man Without Fear is, of course, blind, but the rest of his senses are heightened and more than compensate for this. India Pale Ales (IPA) are flavorful and aromatic, thanks to an abundance of hops (historically added to act as a preservative so that English ales might survive the long trip to India). As a result, they engage the senses more than the average beer, and will encourage you to rely on more than just sight, like Daredevil himself. IPAs are also known for their bitterness, and as anyone who\u2019s ever read a Daredevil comic can attest, bitterness and aguish run rampant in the life of Matt Murdock. The higher alcohol content will make your head spin, much like the conspiracies and ninja smoke that Murdock faces himself. Recommended for the uninitiated: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, Mojo IPA, Harpoon IPA.\nWoodchuck Cider Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nSpider-Man: Spidey\u2019s not much of a drinker (except for that one time he got wasted on 2 beers at Aunt May\u2019s wedding and almost hooked up with his roommate before blacking out), so this is a tough one. But to complement Spider-Man\u2019s innocence and playful nature, I\u2019d recommend you go for a hard cider, such as Magners, Strongbow, or Woodchuck (Harpoon also makes one of which I am particularly fond). They basically taste like sparkling apple juice (something that Peter Parker would definitely drink), but with the added bonus of giving you a slight buzz (thank of it like your very own personal spider-sense). Plus, ciders are refreshing \u2013 an excellent end to a hard day of web-slinging.\nIron Man: Dude. Seriously? That\u2019s not funny. Tony\u2019s an alcoholic. (But if you were to drink something along with your Iron Man comics, I\u2019d recommend something classy and foreign, like a Chimay. Or go all the way like Tony himself with some red wine or a nice bottle of scotch. But you\u2019re still an insensitive jerk.)\nGhost Rider: Rogue Dead Guy Ale. *rim shot on the drums*\nThe Hulk: For a Hulk comic, you\u2019re going to want something strong. Something that gets you smashed. And possibly a little angry. Isn\u2019t that what The Hulk is all about? I\u2019d recommend a barleywine \u2013 Brooklyn Brewery\u2019s Monster Ale might be the best and most obvious option. Something (very) high in alcohol, with an almost sickly sweetness to counteract the bitter, chewy tastes. (and remind you of the human innocence within the Monster. Or something. I'm sure there's a metaphor in there somewhere.) You could also go for a Russian Stout, such as Rasputin\u2019s, which also has a sickly, albeit cough syrup-esque sweetness in otherwise dark and heavy brew (although this might be better paired with one of the Hulk\u2019s adversaries such as the Abomination or the Red Ghost).\nWolverine: Labatt Blue. For one thing, it\u2019s Canadian, and has that crisp, refreshing Canadian flavor (whatever that means). For another, you can drink a lot of these, and feel neither too full, nor too drunk, just like Wolverine himself! Except, you don\u2019t have a mutant healing factor, or an adamantium skeleton, nor were you the unwilling test subject of a government super-soldier experiment. So not like Wolverine at all. But enjoy the beer!\nX-Men: This is a very broad category, as there are a lot of X-Men among the different teams (approximately 198 at current, thanks to the Scarlet Witch).

Dogfish Head has a history of incorporating bizarre or slightly off-beat ingredients into their brews, and when you\u2019re looking at a cast of characters that includes a fuzzy blue lion-man who happens to be a scientific genius as well as a poet, or a billionaire playboy with feathered or metal wings (depending) who sometimes also the angel of death,\u00a0\u00a0or a redhead who or may or may not be either the embodiment or host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird \u2013 well, I think off-beat covers it.\nChocolate Stout Photo via The Perfectly Happy Man\nBatman: Look for a sweet stout, something along the lines of Young\u2019s Double Chocolate or Left Hand\u2019s Milk Stout. A darker, richer beer \u2013much like the Dark Knight himself \u2013 that still has a sweet spot, as Bruce does for young boys. (Not like, a sweet spot for young boys, like \u2013 whatever, you know what I mean, get your mind out of the gutter) The chocolate/sweetness is more of a mask \u2013 the face of Bruce Wayne, if you will \u2013 that plays up his exterior image as a decadent playboy, but really serves as an attempt to hide the burnt bitterness beneath. Of course, Batman is also a detective, and the thick, roasted, robust flavor of these stouts will encourage you to drink them more slowly, holding back the effects of intoxication and allowing you to keep up with the Great Gotham detective and solve the clues along with him.\nGreen Lantern: Arrogant Bastard Ale. A little darker, a little heavier \u2013 much like the emotional weight of being an intergalactic police officer \u2013 with a high enough alcohol content to make you a little hot-headed, like Hal Jordon himself. Or Guy Gardner. Or, hell, Sinestro. Or the Guardians, actually\u2026there\u2019s a lot of hot-headed Lanterns with dark sides to them, huh? Plus, Lanterns receive their abilities from willpower, and it\u2019ll take a lot of willpower to stand up, or doing productive, after polishing off a few of these.\nSuperman: Much like Captain America, Superman reflects an American ideal that everyone can get behind, regardless of politics. Unlike Cap, however, Superman isn\u2019t quite as in touch with the American people (because he\u2019s, ya know, an alien), and as such, wouldn\u2019t be as attuned to the craft beer movement that\u2019s been sweeping the nation. I would still pair him with a light, easy, American-style pale ale or lager, but rather than a hip microbrew, Superman would go better with something with more of a pedigree and universal appeal, such as Yuengling.\nThe Flash: FourLoko.

Since most of my guy's are villians, the questions are very funny!!\nFirst, select your ten fictional characters (from any medium) by whichever method you like best. Then answer the questions below.\n1. Dr. Doom (Marvel Comics) 2. Vegeta (Dragon Ball Z) 3. Black Adam (DC Comics) 4. Thor (Marvel Comics) 5. Q (Star Trek TNG) 6. Raiden (Mortal Combat) 7. Darth Vader (Star Wars) 8. Sub Mariner (Marvel Comics) 9. Sub Zero (Mortal Combat) 10. Dormammu (Marvel Comics)\n1. Divide the list up by even and odd. Which group of five would make a better Five Man Band (like a Power Rangers team)? Who would you slot in each position: Leader, Lancer (second-in-command), Big Guy, Smart Guy, The Chick? If you think the team would be improved by swapping one character between the even and odd groups, which ones would you switch?\nTeam A: Dr. Doom, Thor, Raiden, Black Adam, Vegeta\nTeam B: \"Q\", Dormammu, Darth Vader, Sub Zero, Sub Mariner Team\nA: Doom would be the best commander, he is the smartest even though everyone one team A is a damn ruler / leader / royalty (it might cause some conflict there\nTeam B: \u201cQ\u201d would be the leader, since not even Dormammu would be able to take him on.\n2. Gender-swap 2, 8 & 10. Which character would have the most change in their story arc? Which the least? Would any of these characters have to have a complete personality change to be believable as the opposite sex?\nVegeta, Sub Mariner and Dormammu? lol\nWell, we have seen Namorita and Namora, and they basically ARE the Sub Mariner with blonde hair and nicer legs. Dormammu\u2019s sister Umar is basically his female version, being a godlike being generally trancends gender. So Vegeta would be the most interesting. I think if \u201che\u201d were a \u201cshe\u201d he would have had more of a \u201clove\u201d as opposed to \u201clove / hate\u201d relationship with Goku.\n3. Compare the matchups of 1 & 8 and 5 & 9. (Ignore canon sexual preferences for the moment.) Which couple would be more compatible? Which couple would be more plausible to people from either principal's home culture?\nDr. Doom and the Submariner / Q and Sub Zero? I\u2019d have to go with Doom and the Submariner. Though it wouldn\u2019t last, two doms? Not. But the sex would be rough and intense!\n4. Your team is 3, 4 & 9. The mission consists of a social challenge, a mental challenge and a physical challenge. Which team member do you assign to each challenge?\nBlack Adam, Thor and Sub Zero.\nBlack Adam would have to deal with the social challenge of the \u201cJena Six\u201d. After Black Adam killed the judge and prosecutor, as well as destroyed all but the Black portions of the town (BA assuming that the African Americans there had Khandaqi ancestry) would set up the land as Khandaqi Soil and make it a Khandaqi protectorate.\nThor could handle any physical challenge because\u2026well\u2026because he is: \u201cThor, god of thunder, Prince of Asgard!!!\u201d\nBecause Sub Zero is a cryomancer, his mental skills should be honed to handle any mental challange.\n5. 7 becomes 1's boss for a week in some plausible fashion. How's their working relationship?\nLord Vader as Lord Doom\u2019s boss. That would last about 3 seconds and one would kill the other.\n6. 2 finds him/her/itself inserted into 6's continuity. As far as anyone other than 2 or 6 is concerned, they've always been there. What role would 2 be presumed to have had in 6's story, and could they fit in without going wonky?\nVegeta in Mortal Combat? Shao Khan and outworld would be destroyed by Vegeta\u2019s Big Bang Attack!!!\n7. 3 and 5 get three wishes. The catch is that they have to agree on all three wishes before they get the benefits of any of them. What three wishes would they make?\nBlack Adam and Q? lol. Q doesn\u2019t need wishes, and has a sense of humor and loves pissing of Picard, so He would let Black Adam have all three. Isis would be back, Osisris would be back and Earth would bow down to BA!\n8. 1 and 2 are brainwashed by a one-time artifact that works even on people immune to mind control to attack and kill 4. They keep their normal personality, skills and competence level, except any Code vs. Killing has been turned off. Can 4 survive? How?\nDoom and Vegeta vs. Thor. Hmmmm. Unless Thor had the Odin force, Vegeta would toast him with Doom laughing manically in the background!\n9. 6, 7, 9 & 10 must help an orphanage full of small and depressed children have a merry Christmas. Who does what, knowing that at the very least the kids will be expecting a visit from Santa?\nRaiden, Darth Vader, Sub Zero and Dormammu? Dormammu as Santa? Nope\u2026..Vader has kids, so I guess he would go as Santa. Sub Zero would make Ice sculptures, Raiden and Dromammu would bring gifts!!\n10. 3 and 8 are challenged to circumnavigate the Earth in eighty days or less, using only forms of transportation invented before 1900. Can they do it, or will they be fatally distracted by sidequests or their own personality conflicts?\nBlack Adam and Sub Mariner? They would probably become blood brothers and best pals after the trip!!\n"}, {"score": 199.15788, "uuid": "5772057b-fa1c-57ad-b89d-ed0fb28611be", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1014wb-84-07457", "target_hostname": "dracostarhome.deviantart.com", "target_uri": "http://dracostarhome.deviantart.com/?offset=40", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "dracostarhome on deviantART", "snippet": "I have also made a deviation of The Incredible <em>Hulk</em> vs the Prince of Saiyans: Vegeta.

The <em>Hulk</em> <em>is</em> a man, Bruce Banner, <em>who</em> becomes enhanced by a massive blast of gamma radiation.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Avengers Help You Understand Your Fears About Transhumanism\nTranshumanism is a big, complicated, sprawling idea. The central concept \u2013 that humans can be made better with technology \u2013 touches on a lot of hopes and fears about the future of humanity. Though I\u2019m always going on about how great human enhancement could be, I\u2019ve got my fair share of fears myself. But my fears are probably way different than many of your fears.\u00a0But how in the world can we represent those concerns? As it turns out, I\u2019ve found a pretty good set of archetypes that represent our hopes and fears: Marvel Comic\u2019s Avengers .\nHow we frame scientific progress changes how we see individual technologies. When we think about science changing people, our minds naturally go to that group of individuals constantly being bombarded by gamma radiation, genetic mutagens, cybernetic interventions, and biological acceleration. I\u2019m talking, of course, about superheroes.\u00a0Superheroes are modern mythology. And because of that, they make great metaphors for understanding big issues.\u00a0With The Avengers movie officially announced, I can\u2019t help but notice that the four main members* of Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes \u2013 Thor, the Hulk, Captain America, and Iron Man \u2013 are great examples of the different ways different people understand (or misunderstand) enhancement. Respectively, they are The God, The Monster, The Soldier, and The Robot.\nNow, in the case of the Avengers, I don\u2019t mean that they each represent a kind of enhancement, like cognitive enhancing pharmaceuticals or genetic engineering for athleticism. I am talking about the mindset people have around enhancement. Will transhumanism make people into monsters or Gods? Is science on the right track or out of control? The Avengers represent how you think enhancement works. Not only that, each Avenger symbolizes the hopes, fears, and problems enhancement may have. Whatever your dreams or nightmares about enhancement are, at least one member of Marvel\u2019s wonder team has got you covered. So which Avenger represents you?\nThe Hulk\nThe Hulk represents The Monster. The Hulk is a man, Bruce Banner, who becomes enhanced by a massive blast of gamma radiation. But his enhancement is beyond his control. Rage, a state we associate with a loss of control, brings out the monstrous Hyde to Banner\u2019s human Jekyll. The Hulk is what we think about when we worry that human enhancement will result in unpredictable and overwhelming changes in a person.\nThe Fears: The Hulk (as generally portrayed) is far less intelligent than Banner. He is pure, furious id smashing his way through any obstacle. One fear the Hulk embodies is the idea that enhancement could change our basic biological limits such that our humanity falls by the wayside, leaving only a creature of incredible but inhumane power. Unlike the other Avengers, the Hulk becomes inhuman when enhanced.\nViews Science as Out of Control: Banner\u2019s transformation into the Hulk is the result of an accident. Instead of enhancement occurring because of a deliberate plan, the Hulk is a result of super-science playing with fire. The Monster sees science as just too many accidents waiting to happen. Enhancement will have a lot of unintended consequences, one of which may be the loss of humanity itself.\nThe Hopes: The Hulk is still Bruce Banner. The good and kindness in Banner manifest in the Hulk\u2019s fight against evil and enemies of those he loves. Banner is also constantly searching for a cure, at least a way to control, his Hulk side. Even if science reaches too far, good scientists will fix their errors.\nBottom Line: The Hulk, The Monster, represents science out of control. The fear is that our pursuit of enhancement will make monsters of us whether we like it or not. The hope is that if we start down that path, human nature and science will help us return to our better angels. The Monster is torn between caution and arrogance.\nThor\nThor represents The God.\u00a0Thor is godlike. He possesses superhuman powers like near immortality, incredible strength, and endurance, but is not omniscient or infallible. Moreover, he is not human. Thor is an Asguardian, a humanlike race distinct from human beings in terms of biological superiority and magical ability. The God is what we think of when we think of enhancement making a superhuman race. The God is the opposite of the Monster.\nThe Fears: Thor is an Aryan wet dream. Blue eyes, blond hair, perfect physical attributes, cunning intelligence, and a member of a superior race. In this aspect, he represents the fear of eugenics being used to create racial purity or under the auspices of \u201cimproving the species\u201d by eliminating \u201cundesirable\u201d racial attributes. Also, he\u2019s cast down to Earth due to his arrogance. Time among the pleebs will straighten him out. Not the best perspective of normal humans.\nViews Science as Techno-Magic: Thor represents the misconception that enhancement is closer to a magical cure-all than a scientific pursuit. Science fantasy like a pill that will let you live forever (i.e. the golden apples of Idunn ) comes to mind. Forget actual genetics and biology, for those who view transhumanism through the lens of The God, science may as well be magic.\nThe Hopes: Thor sees himself as protector. The difference in race is not a reason to subjugate humans but instead creates a duty to defend them. Asguard and its ruler, Odin, hold Asguardians to higher standards of ethics and morality because of their superior abilities. In this aspect, The God represents the hopes surrounding moral enhancement.\nBottom Line: Thor, The God, represents the view that enhancement will lead to an ideal. The fear is that the ideal is based on physicality and race, the hope is that the ideal is based on morality and ethics. The God is torn between seeing biological superiority as a license for cruelty and as a duty to protect those unable to protect themselves.\nIron Man\nIron Man represents The Robot.\u00a0Tony Stark is an alcoholic genius playboy who saves his own life by installing a reactor into his chest that also happens to power a mechanized exoskeletal war-suit. He represents external enhancement through prosthetic and computer augmentation. Without the suit, Stark is just a very flawed human being.\nThe Fears: Tony Stark is the most frighteningly human of all the Avengers. He is a drunk, a jerk, a slut, and astoundingly arrogant. Though he invents the suit, he is also utterly dependent upon the arc-reactor that powers it to keep himself alive. Alternatively, when he is in the Iron Man suit, he\u2019s trying to be clean and be a good guy. And that\u2019s when Stark seems the least like himself. The suit that makes him a hero also flattens his personality.\nThe other fear is related to how the Robot reflects science as a pursuit of the wealthy individual. Tony Stark doesn\u2019t build a fleet of suits for the elderly or disabled. Nope, just one really amazing suit for himself \u2013 a sovereign entity by virtue of his riches and knowledge.\nViews Science as Gizmos and Gadgets: Stark is a tycoon. The Robot represents science as a product of the individualist. Transhumanism will be a capitalist pursuit in which we mechanically upgrade ourselves like computers and cars.\nThe Hopes: Stark, the living embodiment of the military-industrial complex, rejects warmongering for peacemaking. Furthermore, his invention saves his life and enables him to move beyond his personal demons. In the films, the Iron Man suit is the result of a near-death experience and an exposure to the emptiness of his vice-riddled life. His personality isn\u2019t flattened, it\u2019s elevated. Thus, the Robot represents the hope that only the negative aspects of our personalities will be brought under control.\nBottom Line: Iron Man, the Robot, represents the view that transhumanism will trade biology for engineering. The fear is that our human qualities will be repressed for the sake of the \u201cgood\u201d of society, resulting in bland automatons. The hope is that enhancement will not quell the human spirit but create a sense of duty to a higher calling. The Robot is torn between personal desires and societal needs.\nCaptain America\nCaptain America represents The Soldier. Captain America, taken purely as an example of enhancement, represents the ideal. He is slightly better than the best human in any category: strength, smarts, endurance, and health. The result of a one-off experiment (as is his shield), Captain America takes his sworn duty to protect the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic seriously.\nThe Fears: Captain America is a hyper-nationalist soldier. His name is Captain America for chrissake. Forget the latent fears of racism you associate with Thor; Captain America only loves you if you love America. Furthermore, he\u2019s a product of a military experiment. By nature and design, he\u2019s a warrior and sees violence as a solution.\nViews Science as a branch of the Military: Captain America is government property. The Soldier represents the view that scientific progress is something that happens behind closed doors and in secret. Or at least at the whim of our elected officials. The benefits are used to keep citizens \u201csafe,\u201d but not to better the citizens themselves.\nThe Hope: Captain America is a perfect human. Not superhuman, but a Homo sapiens sapiens with all his stats maxed out. He isn\u2019t tortured by a sordid past, he doesn\u2019t really have vices, and is a good guy through and through. He represents what enhancement could really be and what it might look like, instead of the caricature of enhancement portrayed by the other Avenger archetypes. He isn\u2019t American only, so much as he is a defender of our dearest values: liberty, truth, and justice.\nBottom Line: Captain America, The Soldier, represents what transhumanism might really look like. Stronger, healthier, and slower-aging, he is a human with almost no biological flaws. The fear is that enhancement will be used generate jingoistic military zealots at the bidding of the State. The hope is that enhancement will improve human health and quality of life. The Soldier is torn between America and the ideals for which America stands.\nThere you have it: The Monster, The God, The Robot, and The Soldier each represent the fears, hopes, and views of science associated with transhumanism and human enhancement.\u00a0One archetype alone may not capture your thoughts.\u00a0Just as the Avengers are a team that \u201cfights enemies no one hero can face,\u201d these different ideas can be mixed and matched. You may fear the God and hope for the Soldier but worry The Monster is reflective of how science might actually be.\nThe key is that enhancement isn\u2019t itself scary, but the way we think science and society work color our views of progress. Of course, this list isn\u2019t exhaustive, but it gives as a good start. My comics knowledge is limited, so feel free to suggest some others. So the next time you think about genetic engineering or augmented reality goggles and feel a twinge of concern, ask yourself which of the Avengers is framing your thoughts.\n*Comic geeks: I apologize for treating the films as canon here. For folks like me still newer to comics, the films have provided a great gateway to enjoying comics.

He has been one of the strongest characters in my home game so far.", "explanation": null, "document": "First Impressions and unanswered Questions\nby RandomThoughts \u00bb Tue May 01, 2012 7:07 pm\nSo, I got my copy of the core rulebook last night (courtesy to Amazon), and after some deep reading, I'd like to share my first impressions and my open questions.\nFirst of all, I like the general approach taken by the game, as a fast paced action RPG meant to capture the essence of comic book action. I don't expect to actually get a chance to play the game, but I've always had a soft spot for superhero RPGs, and I wanted to see how this one turned out.\nLike I said, I like the approach. I kind of worry that the actual decisions faced by the players during combat (and the game seems to focus pretty strongly on combat and little else - again, keeping in tone with the genre it deals with, so that's not a bad thing) will resolve more around abstract game mechanics than actual in-character decisions.\nWhat I mean is this: You're Ms Marvel. You're fighting someone. In-character decisions would be, for instance, whether to blast the character from afar, go into melee, try a flying ram attack, etc. As a player, none of these decisions really matter. Generally speaking, you'd always end up rolling the same dice, no matter what your character ends up doing, unless of course you decide for the blast attack, which essentially means one of your dice is stepped down from a D10 to a D8. The actual decisions faced by the players, as far as I can see so far, will resolve around the proper use of plot points and how to get the best out of them - something completely alien to your character. As a result, immersion into the game and the character is facing hurdles.\nOn the other hand, neither does combat seem very tactically challenging. Leaving PPs aside for the moment, you pretty much figure out which combination of Powers gives you the best dice pool (\"BDA\" - Best Dice Available), and make sure you get to use said dice pool as much as possible. Which is, pretty much always, unless the GM brings up a specific counter for your combo.\nLet's take Spiderman as an example, for the moment. Leaving Affiliation and Distinctions out, the BDA on offense are pretty much Specialty (Combat Expert) and the best available powers for both powersets, so most likely Reflexes and Webshooters combined (for a total of D10+D8+D8+misc). In the comics, Spiderman used to punch and kick his foes a lot, most likely because his physical power is higher than the impact of gooey webfluid. Doesn't matter, in the game any attack that doesn't make use of the webbing looses a dice and thereby power / effect.\nIn other words: Again, making a decision that makes sense in-character (punching the other guy to deliver more damage) actually has the opposite effect in game terms. And worse, there isn't really much of a decision in game terms, as one of them is Strictly Better (to borrow a term from another game).\nNow, clever use of PPs might change all of that, I guess, providing a tactical depth that isn't there otherwise, but I haven't really had time to get into PPs and their impact yet.\n---\nThe next thing that bothered me, generally speaking, was the selection of characters. I get it, the book is built around a specific Event, so the players will find everything they need for that Event in a single tome (rules, characters, the necessary game master information, etc). And the selection isn't bad, generally speaking:\nThere have been four pillars/corners of the Marvel universe for a long time: The X-Men, the FF, the Avengers and the New York City street level characters. All of those are presented - but it seems a weird choice to me to focus exclusively at the line-up at a specific point in time. Armor? Really? With far more iconic characters like Thor and Hulk missing? Honestly, which do you think players care more about? Third tier characters they probably don't even know if they didn't follow the specific series at the time, or first tier icons with a huge fan base?\nIt's even worse for the villains. Carnage is pretty much the only villain in the whole book I'm vaguely familiar with or interested in. I just think ... if you want to focus on events, make scenario books for those, but I'd treat the core rulebook as the tool-box with all the common tools players want to use most.\n---\nMoving on, I'd like to share my thoughts on some of the characters provided in the book:\nCaptain America\nBDA Offense of 10+8+8 (Combat Master, Reflexes, Weapon) and BDS Defense of 12+10+8 (Combat Master, Reflexes, Duration 12 from shield). Really? That's better offense and better defense than anyone else in the book, and we're talking about a guy in human peak condition standing next to:\nThe Thing and Collossus\nBoth share BDAs of 12+8 on both Offense and Defense (Combat Expert and either Strength or Duration), making them the most physically powerful characters after Cap. Feels pretty right, I believe, except that they should both take second row compared to:\nSentry\nPretty much Marvel's grittier version of Superman, far more powerful than anyone else in the book, but somehow he ends up with less Strength and Durability than both the Thing and Collossus. Sure, he can boost both of them (at a price), but even with that boost he ends up on the same level as those two (and somehow inferior to Cap). Also, what happened to the Energy Blasts mentioned in the flavor text right next to the stats? Somehow it didn't make it into the actual power list???\nI'm also still wondering how exactly you double a power. What does Unleash do? Do you double the result of the dice, or do you get to add another dice for free, or what does it mean?\nIronman\nIronman poses another set of problems. In order to become halfway decent (and live up to his reputation of one of the stronger heroes), he depends on some pretty \"creative\" combos.\nWithout a combat Specialty and no defensive power in his Weapon Platform Powerset, we end up with meager 8+8 BDA on offense (Reflexes and Repulsor) and 10 BDA on defense (Durability).\nA bit of creativity goes a long way in this case:\nCount Tech Master for every maneuver and stunt, with the justification that Tony constantly adjusts the armor systems, and you get a +10 on both BDAs. Next, explain the character uses his flight power to perform evasive aireal maneuvers, and you get another +10 on your defensive BDA, and add flying ram maneuvers (Flight + Strength) to your offensive arsenal, and suddenly we end up with a far more powerful Ironman (10+10+10 on both offensive and defensive), but we're bending the rules quite a bit now.\nHuman Torch\nThe situation is even worse for Johnny Storm. Like Ironman, he lacks a combat-suitable Specialty, and using Vehicle Expert seems just too far fetched to me; sure, a trained pilot would be able to execute evasive maneuvers better, but still...\nIn other words, Johnny ends up with a single D10 in both offensive and defensive BDA, and that again depends on Flight for aerial combat...\nCyclops\nApparently one of the weakest characters in the whole book. His offensive BDA is pretty much average with 10+8 (Combat Expert and Optic Blast), but what about his defense? If I read the rules correctly, he gets a single D8 for Weapon Expert (plus the usual from Affiliation and Distinction), which makes him pretty much a teeth-less glass cannon...\nAgain, I've got a \"creative\" solution: Allow Optic Blasts to be used defensively as well. Knock enemies back, deflect incoming missiles from their current vector, counterattack other guys with ranged powers by shooting them before they get to shoot you. Actually, I think this might work surprisingly well, making Cyclops the Master Blaster he was always portrayed as. Doesn't exactly make him more than average in power, but still, might be interesting to watch in game. Just, you know, it keeps breaking the rules...\nLast edited by RandomThoughts on Tue May 01, 2012 7:49 pm, edited 1 time in total.\n"}, {"score": 193.63583, "uuid": "62d76dc3-3874-53ef-909f-ee3e1f5f87a6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1504wb-27-09502", "target_hostname": "www.covenantchurch.net", "target_uri": "http://www.covenantchurch.net/pheart/2007/not-made-of-steel", "page_rank": 1.1749516e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Covenant Church - Not Made of Steel", "snippet": "Wise are those <em>who</em> hasten to the place of rest where angels minister and the Holy Spirit strengthens.

Not Popeye after a can of spinach. Not The Incredible Hulk, becoming indomitable when angry. Not Spiderman, being able to climb tall buildings and leap great distances.\nNot John Wayne, tough enough to handle the job by himself. Not Wyatt Earp with his six-shooter. Not the Lone Ranger with his silver bullet. Not Zorro with his sword.\nNot Solomon with his wisdom. Not Joshua with his military skill. Not Samson with his strength. Not Paul with his intellect.\nWanting to be like Jesus. More like. His love. His grace. His mercy. His patience. His wisdom. His focus. His heart. His purity.\nA preacher. Human being. Flesh and blood. Mortal. Not better than the best man or woman. Not worse.\nCalled. Called by God. Called to preach. Called to serve. Called to make a difference. Called to live a life that is focused on heaven. Called to point others to The Way, The Truth, and The Life\u2014Jesus Christ.\nThe burden. How to describe the burden. How to speak of that which has no math, no science, no academic language to define the subject. How to speak of an intangible as real as life itself. How to share with others what cannot be seen, but what is in the heart. The burden.\nWhat is it that can only be in the mind and in the heart, but keep one awake at night? What is it that can say \u201cno\u201d to important things seen, only because what cannot be seen is more important? What is it that can cause material things to have lesser value than the things never to be touched in this present life? What is it that can defer the immediate to seek that which is in another sphere, a future time, and another country?\nThe burden. The burden to care for others. To love them into the kingdom. To convince them that the very essence of life is Christ. To persuade men and women to turn from following the flesh and follow the Spirit.\nHow is it that so many are called to bear the burden, yet the burden is equally heavy for each individual? How is it that each has a common portion of the burden, yet each is called to a separate task? How is it that the task can be so different, yet each task in its difference has the same intent and purpose and common end?\nOh, for more wisdom. Oh, for more knowledge. Oh, to have answers for life\u2019s difficult questions. Oh, to be able to have the right words for each person who is in a crisis. Oh, to know how to comfort those who grieve. Oh, to know how to rejoice with those who have been blessed!\nBut the burden presses. The body languishes. The burden presses, while energy waxes and wanes. Cannot one see that the body and mind are in conflict? Cannot one see that the body is calling for the green pastures, even while the mind is seeking exquisite and lofty treasures? Can one see the burden that lies so heavy on the heart contends with the mind and body? The burden insists on investing in the eternal.\nNot steel. No, not steel. God does not always call the wise and noble. Sometimes God calls a shepherd to be a king. A sheepherder to be an Amos. Not a queen to be the Mother of Jesus, but a 15 year-old virgin. Not a rich man to adopt Jesus as his son, but a carpenter. Imagine a fisherman becoming one of Jesus\u2019 closest disciples. Imagine a swarm assassin becoming a disciple of Jesus\u2019 love. Imagine a murderer becoming Paul, the apostle.\nThe burden. Moses led God\u2019s people out of Egypt. Joshua led God\u2019s people to conquer Jericho. David established God\u2019s people in Canaan. Nehemiah led the people to rebuild walls of Jerusalem in 52 days.\nI have known hard work. I love hard work. Still there is a joy in swinging an axe to split wood, constructing a building, and laboring to see the completion of a physical project. Sweat can feel good. Tired muscles invigorate. Sleep is good after a long day of good work.\nBut the burden has no rest. Those who bear the burden are not made of steel. They must seek strength from the Burden Bearer. Wise are those who hasten to the place of rest where angels minister and the Holy Spirit strengthens. Those who allow Jesus to share the load are stronger than steel. Hell\u2019s most powerful demons cower in fear of those stronger by faith than steel, those who walk and live in the power of the Spirit.\nSweet reward.\n"}, {"score": 191.83739, "uuid": "40b565b1-054c-520f-8723-1e87e5779745", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1004wb-85-02030", "target_hostname": "www.mycomicshop.com", "target_uri": "https://www.mycomicshop.com/blog/post/top-10-must-read-comic-stories-of-all-time", "page_rank": 1.1794916e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Top 10 Must Read Comic Stories of All Time", "snippet": "The Judas Contract <em>is</em> just super hero comics at their very best.

Deathstroke the Terminator blames the Teen Titans for the death of his son, Ravager , and plots the teen heroes\u2019 downfall.\u00a0 Betrayed by one of their own, the next generation of heroes is systematically and utterly defeated by one of the most dangerous men alive.\u00a0 In this tale the reader sees the death of a Titan, the debut of a new member, and watches as Dick Grayson makes the transition from Boy Wonder to the adult hero known as Nightwing .\u00a0 The Judas Contract is just super hero comics at their very best.\nAll-Star Superman \u2013 Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely unite to tell quite frankly the greatest Superman story of all time.\u00a0 This is an awe-inspiring, mind-blowing adventure that grabs hold of the reader\u2019s imagination and never lets go.\u00a0 All the elements are here \u2013 Lois Lane , Jimmy Olsen , Lex Luthor , Bizarro , the Daily Planet, the Fortress of Solitude, the Kent Farm, Kryptonite, Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the unmistakable S shield of Superman!\u00a0 This tale explores Superman\u2019s mythos in a way rarely seen in comics and beautifully illustrates why the Man of Steel is the greatest super hero of all time.\u00a0 One minute the reader is gasping, the next he is laughing out loud, and the next he is cheering.\u00a0 All-Star Superman is a perfect comic book and a definite must read.\nThe Dark Knight Returns \u2013 This is the story that defined the Caped Crusader for a whole generation of comic readers.\u00a0 Set in the not too distant future, Dark Knight Returns shows a world without super heroes.\u00a0 Crime is at an all time high, the United States is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia, and there seems to be no hope in sight.\u00a0 Vicious gangs have taken over the streets of Gotham City and the police are powerless to stop them.\u00a0 It is at this moment that Bruce Wayne, now an old man, decides that he has had enough.\u00a0 Batman returns after a ten year hiatus, and he sets out to take back the night with a vengeance.\u00a0 As storyteller Frank Miller puts it \u201c\u2026this is the story that gave Batman his [cojones] back.\u201d\u00a0 This is the story that inspired Tim Burton\u2019s take on Batman and set the stage for the character-defining Batman: The Animated Series .\u00a0 Featuring the ultimate Batman/Superman showdown, Dark Knight Returns also went a long way in establishing the relationship between these two icons for the next two decades.\u00a0 Before this story, Batman was already an A-List super hero, but this tale made Batman a legend.\nPreacher \u2013 Preacher is a bold, in-your-face, and unapologetic epic that resonates with the reader long after the final page is turned.\u00a0 It is the ultimate road trip story of one man\u2019s literal search for God.\u00a0 How can I possibly describe a tale with vampires, angels, demons, clandestine paramilitary secret empires, gun-toting girlfriends, two-fisted heroes, underground Goth societies, voodoo, evil racist business men, super cops, serial killers, religious zealots, Texas Rangers, a war in the sun, the Word of God and last stands at the Alamo and possibly do it justice.\u00a0 Writer Garth Ennis is at his wicked best and artist Steve Dillon visually delivers a story for the ages.\u00a0 Be warned, this is not for the kids or faint of heart.\u00a0 Preacher is an over-the-top action/adventure that makes a Quentin Tarantino movie seem tame by comparison.\u00a0 Why this guilty pleasure has not been turned into a movie trilogy or HBO TV series is beyond me. Preacher is a tale the Odinson revisits at least once a year and the best adult comic book story produced since Watchmen .\nX-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga \u2013 The Dark Phoenix Saga is a great example of two creators at the height of their powers.\u00a0 Chris Claremont and John Byrne orchestrate the ultimate super hero story.\u00a0 The character-to-character interactions, the drama, the eye-popping action sequences, the mind-blowing displays of power and destruction make this tale unforgettable.\u00a0 They say that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u00a0 This is the challenge the Children of the Atom must face when Jean Grey, due in no small part to the manipulations of the vile Hellfire Club , loses control of her cosmic power known as the Phoenix .\u00a0 The heroes struggle with the dilemma of saving the universe at the cost of their beloved friend\u2019s life.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tale of ultimate sacrifice that does not talk down to its readers but rather invites them to experience the drama along with the X-Men as this modern day tragedy unfolds.\u00a0 I am not a big X-Men fan but this is, without a doubt, one of the must read comic book stories of all time. NOTE: It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the wonderful Kitty Pryde makes her debut in this story as well.\nMarvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars \u2013 Long before Fear Itself , Civil War , or House of M , long before big company crossovers and big event storylines became everyday humdrum in the comic industry, there was Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars .\u00a0 This twelve issue maxi-series featured the world\u2019s greatest heroes (the Avengers , Fantastic Four , X-Men , Spider-Man and the Hulk ) as they are kidnapped by a being of ultimate power and whisked to the far side of the cosmos to engage in mortal combat against a small army of the Marvel U\u2019s most dangerous super villains.\u00a0 Not only was Secret Wars one of the first Big Event stories but with its long lasting effects on the Marvel Universe, it encapsulated everything a Big Event should be.\u00a0 The Thing quits the FF and the She-Hulk joins the team, the next year for the Hulk is set-up, Colossus ends his romantic relationship with Kitty Pryde, we are introduced to a new hero ( Spider-Woman ) and new villains (Volcana and Titania ), the Absorbing Man gets a girlfriend whom he is with to this very day, Magneto sides with the White Hats, and Spider-Man gets his black costume which later joins with Eddie Brock to become Venom .\u00a0 One of my favorite things about this story is the character-to-character interactions.\u00a0 This was at a time in Marvel\u2019s history when the Marvel Age was still young enough where all the heroes didn\u2019t know each other inside and out and quite frankly didn\u2019t necessarily get along.\u00a0 Friendships and bonds that exist today can be traced back to this original ultimate team-up.\nCrisis on Infinite Earths \u2013 Crisis is the biggest, best, most influential Big Event to ever be produced.\u00a0 It literally changed the landscape of the DC Universe.\u00a0 Heroes died, whole galaxies crumbled, and the DCU has never been the same since.\u00a0 When an unstoppable force starts to rip through the multiverse and destroy everything in its path, every single hero and villain on every single remaining parallel Earth in every single time era, from the dawn of mankind to the far-flung future, must unite to save all reality.\u00a0 Marv Wolfman and George Perez deliver the most epic super hero story ever told.\u00a0 And by the end of it, the DCU re-launched stronger and better than ever.\u00a0 For the next twenty-five years this would be known as the Post-Crisis DCU.\u00a0 Much like DC Comics is doing now with the New 52, Superman , Wonder Woman , SHAZAM , Aquaman , Flash and the Justice League all restarted from number one and reintroduced and revamped their characters for a whole new generation, my generation. Batman: Year One told the tale of how a young rooftop vigilante outlaw became a hero.\u00a0 And it was all set up by the mega-event that is Crisis on Infinite Earths .\u00a0 Crisis features the greatest super heroes in the world fighting against the greatest threat the world has ever seen.\u00a0 It\u2019s just epic and a classic comic book story that absolutely must be read.\nOther tales of great note include: Rom the Spaceknight , Avengers: Under Siege , JLA: Rock of Ages , The Sinestro Corps War , and Annihilation .\nAs I said, these are the tales that the Odinson revisits time and time again.\u00a0 They are the tales that inspire and thrill me to no end.\u00a0 Whether you are a new reader or a longtime fan, these are the Top 10 Must Read Comic Stories of All Time!\nThis is Odinson bidding thee farewell\n"}, {"score": 191.73502, "uuid": "97bf6617-3cae-525f-8be8-4627002c00ee", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1005wb-36-24014", "target_hostname": "www.mycomicshop.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mycomicshop.com/blog/post/top-10-must-read-comic-stories-of-all-time", "page_rank": 1.1795005e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Top 10 Must Read Comic Stories of All Time", "snippet": "The Judas Contract <em>is</em> just super hero comics at their very best.

Deathstroke the Terminator blames the Teen Titans for the death of his son, Ravager , and plots the teen heroes\u2019 downfall.\u00a0 Betrayed by one of their own, the next generation of heroes is systematically and utterly defeated by one of the most dangerous men alive.\u00a0 In this tale the reader sees the death of a Titan, the debut of a new member, and watches as Dick Grayson makes the transition from Boy Wonder to the adult hero known as Nightwing .\u00a0 The Judas Contract is just super hero comics at their very best.\nAll-Star Superman \u2013 Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely unite to tell quite frankly the greatest Superman story of all time.\u00a0 This is an awe-inspiring, mind-blowing adventure that grabs hold of the reader\u2019s imagination and never lets go.\u00a0 All the elements are here \u2013 Lois Lane , Jimmy Olsen , Lex Luthor , Bizarro , the Daily Planet, the Fortress of Solitude, the Kent Farm, Kryptonite, Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the unmistakable S shield of Superman!\u00a0 This tale explores Superman\u2019s mythos in a way rarely seen in comics and beautifully illustrates why the Man of Steel is the greatest super hero of all time.\u00a0 One minute the reader is gasping, the next he is laughing out loud, and the next he is cheering.\u00a0 All-Star Superman is a perfect comic book and a definite must read.\nThe Dark Knight Returns \u2013 This is the story that defined the Caped Crusader for a whole generation of comic readers.\u00a0 Set in the not too distant future, Dark Knight Returns shows a world without super heroes.\u00a0 Crime is at an all time high, the United States is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia, and there seems to be no hope in sight.\u00a0 Vicious gangs have taken over the streets of Gotham City and the police are powerless to stop them.\u00a0 It is at this moment that Bruce Wayne, now an old man, decides that he has had enough.\u00a0 Batman returns after a ten year hiatus, and he sets out to take back the night with a vengeance.\u00a0 As storyteller Frank Miller puts it \u201c\u2026this is the story that gave Batman his [cojones] back.\u201d\u00a0 This is the story that inspired Tim Burton\u2019s take on Batman and set the stage for the character-defining Batman: The Animated Series .\u00a0 Featuring the ultimate Batman/Superman showdown, Dark Knight Returns also went a long way in establishing the relationship between these two icons for the next two decades.\u00a0 Before this story, Batman was already an A-List super hero, but this tale made Batman a legend.\nPreacher \u2013 Preacher is a bold, in-your-face, and unapologetic epic that resonates with the reader long after the final page is turned.\u00a0 It is the ultimate road trip story of one man\u2019s literal search for God.\u00a0 How can I possibly describe a tale with vampires, angels, demons, clandestine paramilitary secret empires, gun-toting girlfriends, two-fisted heroes, underground Goth societies, voodoo, evil racist business men, super cops, serial killers, religious zealots, Texas Rangers, a war in the sun, the Word of God and last stands at the Alamo and possibly do it justice.\u00a0 Writer Garth Ennis is at his wicked best and artist Steve Dillon visually delivers a story for the ages.\u00a0 Be warned, this is not for the kids or faint of heart.\u00a0 Preacher is an over-the-top action/adventure that makes a Quentin Tarantino movie seem tame by comparison.\u00a0 Why this guilty pleasure has not been turned into a movie trilogy or HBO TV series is beyond me. Preacher is a tale the Odinson revisits at least once a year and the best adult comic book story produced since Watchmen .\nX-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga \u2013 The Dark Phoenix Saga is a great example of two creators at the height of their powers.\u00a0 Chris Claremont and John Byrne orchestrate the ultimate super hero story.\u00a0 The character-to-character interactions, the drama, the eye-popping action sequences, the mind-blowing displays of power and destruction make this tale unforgettable.\u00a0 They say that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u00a0 This is the challenge the Children of the Atom must face when Jean Grey, due in no small part to the manipulations of the vile Hellfire Club , loses control of her cosmic power known as the Phoenix .\u00a0 The heroes struggle with the dilemma of saving the universe at the cost of their beloved friend\u2019s life.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tale of ultimate sacrifice that does not talk down to its readers but rather invites them to experience the drama along with the X-Men as this modern day tragedy unfolds.\u00a0 I am not a big X-Men fan but this is, without a doubt, one of the must read comic book stories of all time. NOTE: It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the wonderful Kitty Pryde makes her debut in this story as well.\nMarvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars \u2013 Long before Fear Itself , Civil War , or House of M , long before big company crossovers and big event storylines became everyday humdrum in the comic industry, there was Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars .\u00a0 This twelve issue maxi-series featured the world\u2019s greatest heroes (the Avengers , Fantastic Four , X-Men , Spider-Man and the Hulk ) as they are kidnapped by a being of ultimate power and whisked to the far side of the cosmos to engage in mortal combat against a small army of the Marvel U\u2019s most dangerous super villains.\u00a0 Not only was Secret Wars one of the first Big Event stories but with its long lasting effects on the Marvel Universe, it encapsulated everything a Big Event should be.\u00a0 The Thing quits the FF and the She-Hulk joins the team, the next year for the Hulk is set-up, Colossus ends his romantic relationship with Kitty Pryde, we are introduced to a new hero ( Spider-Woman ) and new villains (Volcana and Titania ), the Absorbing Man gets a girlfriend whom he is with to this very day, Magneto sides with the White Hats, and Spider-Man gets his black costume which later joins with Eddie Brock to become Venom .\u00a0 One of my favorite things about this story is the character-to-character interactions.\u00a0 This was at a time in Marvel\u2019s history when the Marvel Age was still young enough where all the heroes didn\u2019t know each other inside and out and quite frankly didn\u2019t necessarily get along.\u00a0 Friendships and bonds that exist today can be traced back to this original ultimate team-up.\nCrisis on Infinite Earths \u2013 Crisis is the biggest, best, most influential Big Event to ever be produced.\u00a0 It literally changed the landscape of the DC Universe.\u00a0 Heroes died, whole galaxies crumbled, and the DCU has never been the same since.\u00a0 When an unstoppable force starts to rip through the multiverse and destroy everything in its path, every single hero and villain on every single remaining parallel Earth in every single time era, from the dawn of mankind to the far-flung future, must unite to save all reality.\u00a0 Marv Wolfman and George Perez deliver the most epic super hero story ever told.\u00a0 And by the end of it, the DCU re-launched stronger and better than ever.\u00a0 For the next twenty-five years this would be known as the Post-Crisis DCU.\u00a0 Much like DC Comics is doing now with the New 52, Superman , Wonder Woman , SHAZAM , Aquaman , Flash and the Justice League all restarted from number one and reintroduced and revamped their characters for a whole new generation, my generation. Batman: Year One told the tale of how a young rooftop vigilante outlaw became a hero.\u00a0 And it was all set up by the mega-event that is Crisis on Infinite Earths .\u00a0 Crisis features the greatest super heroes in the world fighting against the greatest threat the world has ever seen.\u00a0 It\u2019s just epic and a classic comic book story that absolutely must be read.\nOther tales of great note include: Rom the Spaceknight , Avengers: Under Siege , JLA: Rock of Ages , The Sinestro Corps War , and Annihilation .\nAs I said, these are the tales that the Odinson revisits time and time again.\u00a0 They are the tales that inspire and thrill me to no end.\u00a0 Whether you are a new reader or a longtime fan, these are the Top 10 Must Read Comic Stories of All Time!\nThis is Odinson bidding thee farewell\n"}, {"score": 191.81047, "uuid": "317767b0-e6e1-5e6b-a399-34bb77b6f1d3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-76-00623", "target_hostname": "www.whiterose.org", "target_uri": "http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/006952.html", "page_rank": 1.1926291e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "The All-New All-Different Howling Curmudgeons: Future Classics", "snippet": "As for underground stuff -- <em>who</em> knows?

What will you re-read in five, ten, fifteen years? Books like Tom Strong or are you more invested in Y, the Last Man? Are you going to be demanding a hardback reprint of Michael Turner's work? What's good enough to get one of the Masterwork/Classics reprint treatment?\nFor myself, if you're asking me to name the books I think should get this treatment, I'll admit that I'm a sucker for Morrison's work on The Invisibles and JLA and think there should be a hardback library of Moore's work. For starters. I think Cerebus will be read for quite a while, even if I'm not a huge fan, and I think Simonson's Thor and Fantastic Four were extraordinary and deserve a lot more praise than they get, and Ostrander's Spectre should be collected. I'm also interested to see if Strangers in Paradise or David Lapham's Stray Bullets are still being read a decade or two from now, because both of them intrigued me. There are a lot more, of course, but I'll let you cover that in comments.\nYour turn: what are the deserved masterworks of the past two decades in comics?\nUpdate: Greg makes a good point in the comments, asking if I mean aside from obvious ones like Watchmen, so I figured I'd answer it here: no, not aside from that.

Those two publishers also comprise about 75% of the comic book market, as tracked through North American comic book stores, so if they\u2019re struggling, the entire industry struggles. For the first 3/4 of 2010, sales at comic book stores drifted away.\nSome retailers began to complain that Marvel and DC weren\u2019t providing any big high profile comics to bring readers in. Through much of the 2000s, both publishers had released big summer events that consumed much of their respective lines. These big crossover events, like DC\u2019s Identity Crisis (2004) and Marvel\u2019s Civil War (2006), garnered some headlines from mainstream media and definitely got fans talking. Most important, it got them buying. Soon, much of their publishing strategies were built around the next event, with comics devoted to teasers, prequels, accompanying mini-series, spin-offs, sequels and so forth. It got to the point where it would literally cost one or two hundred dollars to get every issue that was part of one single event, if one was that much of a compulsive completionist (and let\u2019s face it, plenty of superhero fans are just that). Toward the end of the 2000s, readers started to complain of what became called \u201cevent fatigue\u201d. The never-ending cycle of an earth-shattering, teeth-gnashing crisis leading right into the next bleak crisis was losing appeal. So DC and Marvel took a break from them, although they kept publishing smaller more contained mini-events. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, they didn\u2019t replace these sales magnets with compelling comics that would bring readers back (or, to dream the impossible dream, bring new readers in).\nSo to answer retailers\u2019 concerns, instead of innovating, they returned to the same trick: big line-wide crossover events. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work this time. Marvel\u2019s Fear Itself and DC\u2019s Flashpoint were largely met with lukewarm sales and reviews this summer. Meanwhile, Hollywood was showing that it could actually do halfway decent superhero stories, certainly more accessible, entertaining and populist than their current comics counterparts. All summer long, big screen audiences were hit by Thor, X-Men: First Class and Captain America: The First Avenger, with no compelling reason to carry any interest in the characters to comic book stores. Even DC Comics\u2019 valiant promotion of rolling back or holding cover prices at $2.99, instead of the increasingly common and excessive $3.99, didn\u2019t do much to turn losses around.\nSo it finally became clear something truly big had to be done. Waving arms around yelling \u201chey look!\u201d in the traditional fashion didn\u2019t get anyone to really notice or care, so it was time to bring back the old stand-by of adding in a hearty table flip. Just after their Flashpoint crossover had started, DC Comics announced that their entire superhero universe would be (sorta) reborn . Every series would be cancelled and an entirely new line-up of 52 comics would start over the next month. In many ways, it\u2019s the mother of all events, and similar to a move DC Comics made in 1985 with Crisis on Infinite Earths, where their entire universe was reset for the first time. The difference this time is that there would be a clean break. Starting August 31, every DC Universe comic book was set back to issue #1, with updated costumes and streamlined origin to create a younger, hipper world of superheroes. The New 52 got a lot of press. DC\u2019s chief executives and architects went on an aggressive tour of comic book stores to win over support of the massive gamble. They offered retailers great incentives and the ability to return unsold comics. They did interviews for radio, TV, newspapers, websites. They made TV commercials that airing on cable networks, played before movie trailers and streamed online. Yes, they did something almost unprecedented: they did real marketing to people outside of the current comics reading habit. Letting people know that something they might like exists is a foreign concept to most comic book publishers, but somehow it worked. Sales have been great. In many cases, sales of relaunched books doubled the first month of the launch. DC Comics\u2019 market share jumped to make them the #1 comics publisher of North America for the last quarter of 2011, after at least a decade of being #2 to Marvel. Some other publishers have even reported improved sales for their own unrelated comics as a possible side effect of the New 52.\nMiles Morales stars in Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #1\nSo the industry is saved, right? Well\u2026 not quite. Reviews have been mixed, the consensus seems to be that some books are good, some are OK, some are bad. There are concerns over excessive violence and objective depictions of females, just as there were before the relaunch. After five months, retailers are already seeing sales settling back down to how their stores were selling DC books before the New 52 launch. Unfortunately that has historically been the pattern with events. Initial enthusiasm reflects in temporary sales bumps. But without\u00a0 sustaining quality that speaks to larger audiences, it\u2019s always temporary until the next big event needs to be concocted.\nWhile Marvel hasn\u2019t done something quite as aggressive relaunching their entire line, they have been making changes, amid a series of layoffs and cutbacks. Probably their highest profile move was their new Spider-Man, the multi-racial Miles Morales , in their Ultimate Comics imprint, also first announced in USA Today. They\u2019ve also announced plans to release in 2012 a new line of original graphic novels updating the origins of their most popular characters. Previously swearing that original graphic novels just didn\u2019t make financial sense to them, the move is presumed to be a response to DC\u2019s successful Superman: Earth One original graphic novel, released in 2010.\nBoth Marvel and DC also stepped up their schedules in releasing digital comics. DC announced they would release their comics on the web and mobile devices the same day their print comics are released in comic book stores the same day their New 52 began, August 31. Marvel has been slowly rolling out a similar strategy instead of a line-wide shift all at once. They announced to Gizmodo in November that by March 2012, all of their titles would be on a simultaneous digital/print release schedule (excluding licensed comics and their mature MAX imprint). Marvel was the first of the two to experiment with this kind of release. Comic shop owners have been nervous about digital stealing away customers, and their vocal protests is believed to be the reason for the staggered pricing schedule that has become standard for day-and-date digital releases. For digital comics released the same time as their print counterpart, their price will match the print version\u2019s cover price (typically between $2.99 and $3.99). After a month, the price drops to $1.99. Both Marvel and DC tend to have sales that drop some prices to $0.99, and some issues are available for free.\nDid DC\u2019s New 52 just stall the inevitable? How will Marvel respond to regain their lost market share? How will retailers who rely on superhero comics deal with digital comics? 2012 will be an interesting year.\n"}, {"score": 187.84753, "uuid": "c3ce6b7e-8365-50af-842e-23a50ad22832", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0310wb-13-14319", "target_hostname": "blogs.starwars.com", "target_uri": "http://blogs.starwars.com/darthhiram1/100", "page_rank": 1.1779452e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Star Wars: Blogs | A Journey into The Force | Reluctant Heroes", "snippet": "But he had to accept it and be <em>who</em> he had to be, a very human trait.

I'm a guy who looks at milestones in life, who loves to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and who reflects on past achievements when reaching a milestone. I mean it takes a lot of time and effort to achieve a milestone, whatever it may be. Now I'm not the first person on here to reach Club 100 and I won't be the last, but for me it is a celebratory time. I've always loved writing and putting my thoughts out there for all to read, but joining Hyperspace allowed me to do it all in a much more public forum, so it's very satisfying to reach 100. And I couldn't have done it at all without the support and encouragement from you all.\nBut one fellow blogger in particular has become a good friend, and has always been supportive of my blogs and lent her guidance to me along the way. That is why I have invited the talented and respected amidalooine to help me write this blog, to bring her inspiring style of the written word in to help celebrate my milestone. In this entry, ami's words are italicized and mine are not.\n...Every once in a long while in our lives, we meet someone who thinks like we do, who sees life in a similar light. I have been incredibly fortunate in this blogosphere, and such is the case with Darth_Hiram. Deep and thoughtful and considerate, DH is a gifted writer who has gifted me with his friendship, and I am humbled to be a part of his milestone.\nWe've had several discussions on one particular topic that we feel is relevant today, both in our real world and in the fictional world, be it Star Wars or otherwise. And that is the topic of superheroes.\nWhen Anakin Skywalker was a little boy, I wonder what kind of Jedi he imagined himself as? The old Jedi Order wasn't so rigid that it didn't allow each knight or master to distinguish him or her-self in some way. Their robes, though similar, were unique. Their hairstyles varied. Even their weapons, their prized lightsabers, blazed in different colors, their hilts as individual as they were. Did little Ani dream of blue blades and light robes? Did he see himself in a dark, hooded cape and green saber? Who was Anakin Skywalker in his childhood dreams?\nAnd did Anakin imagine himself as a superhero? I think as he grew, he molded himself into what he believed to be a hero, but I don't think I would fit him into the classification of a superhero. He had these tremendous powers, he had the loftiness of being The Chosen One, and he had the awe of the citizens of the galaxy that looked at him as a hero ... a Jedi who saved lives and won battles. But he had other things that would hold him back too.\nWe've had superheroes on the big screen, on the small screen, in comic books, in novels and in our imaginations for many years. We've all seen many come and go and some stick around for the long haul. And in today's movie-making age we are seeing a brand of superhero, and likewise villains, emerge that are more real and more in tune with the condition that our world and our society is in. Gone seem to be the cheesy and colourful characters that graced the screens such as the 1960's Batman, 1980's TV specials (I seem to recall an old Spiderman TV movie from years back), and even the comic book portrayal of George Clooney's Batman.\nIn 1977, Darth Vader couldn't help but be campy. His look was pure science fiction with his shiny black suit and strange helmet, colorful blinking buttons on his suit's control box and awkward boots that caused him to clomp about more like Herman Munster in space than the galaxy's most feared presence. But there was never anything funny about Darth Vader.\nNow we are seeing more human characters ... ones that have real flaws and disappointments, just like our real lives can be. Just consider the most recent \"The Dark Knight\" installment. We are seeing Batman as a flawed hero, one who has to accept that he is a dark hero that nobody wants, but the city desperately needs. He's the opposite side of the coin from the Joker, but they are both on the same coin (to reference Two Face's character). The Joker tells him that they need each other ... they will always be locked in a dance that goes round and round because one will not exist without the other. I feel that the movie is absolutely brilliant in its portrayal of how vulnerable these characters can be, despite all the armour they wear or how protected by their weapons they appear to be. Deep down they are flawed, and in order to move on with life and protecting not only the city or their own interests, they have to accept this. And this rings true for all of us. We are flawed and imperfect. But to live with each other, and ourselves we must accept this ... or ultimately fail.\nAnd in Anakin's case he did fail. He was a flawed character as well and allowed his flaws to best him, whereas Batman used his flaws to strengthen him. Batman knew he must step back and let the city evolve, and protect it from the shadows. But Anakin wouldn't step back when he should have and ended up not protecting the galaxy from the shadows, but terrorizing it from them.\nWhy do our superheroes wear masks or armor or costumes and carry fancy weapons? Do superheroes feel they have to be something they're not? It was Bruce Wayne's heart that beat beneath Batman's cape, and the events that transpired in Bruce Wayne's life that created the Batman. Why hide? Why this need, as DH pointed out, to protect Gotham only from the shadows? Maybe Gotham would have accepted Batman's flaws. Maybe Batman underestimated the power of the truth to be redemption in its simplicity and realness. Maybe I just want Batman to be happy.\nIf Batman was the flip side of the Joker's scarred and twisted coin, then what of Anakin Skywalker, who lived as both hero and villain in the same persona, one buried deep beneath the other? Was Anakin even fully aware of the monster he was as Darth Vader, as Batman was aware of the inverse of his own heroics, or even more significantly, the Joker was aware of his opposite \"good\" side? Only through awareness can there be redemption. Redemption...\nWhy do our superheroes feel the need to be redeemed, and can Anakin still be considered a superhero because of his redemption? Optimus Prime, the autobot hero of Transformers, implies that he and his comrades on Earth must atone for their sins, but what sins? What can possibly be wrong about fighting violently against a much greater evil? Isn't that what all our superheroes do?\nAnd as I think about the Jedi, the superhero, that Anakin strove to be, I think about Superman. Superman is the epitome of what a hero should be ... strong, trustful, good-hearted and a protector of all that is good and fair and just. He fought for a world that he was not originally a part of. He accepted who he was, where he was and what he was capable of doing. And in the most recent Superman movie, he also showed that he was vulnerable to his feelings. He showed that he could be hurt where it is much harder to recover from, or be invincible from ... his heart. Lois Lane was his true love and it pained him that she moved on with her life when he left Earth for five years. But he had to accept it and be who he had to be, a very human trait. He had to lead his life with his heart for who he was and all that he did, not to save himself from it. And it made him stronger.\nAnd this is where Anakin failed. He couldn't accept what had to be, or what could come. He wanted to be Superman, with the girl. He couldn't lead a double life like Superman does ... his feelings and emotions took over to the point of personal failure by turning to the darkside.\nAaaahhhh, love. A superhero's Achilles Heel. Why is loving someone considered a character flaw? Why are superheroes forced to live without the passion and strength that love could give them? With the exception of the very married with children (and animated) Incredibles, our superheroes are forced to fight the forces of evil alone. Superman should have ended up with Lois Lane, the mother of his child. Batman's dark destiny was driven in part by the heartache of his lost love, a love that would have been unrequited at best. Superhero or not, Anakin's love for Padme killed her...and his dreams (and so many more) with her. At least there's hope for Spiderman, who appeared poised to reunite with his Mary Jane when last we saw them on the big screen.\nMaybe Iron Man is the one who got it right in every respect. Utterly flawed and human, Tony Stark reaped the rewards of a life spent using his brilliant mind (one of a superhero's sexiest traits, by the way) to exploit the needs of warring nations, even America's most diligent enemies, drowning any doubts he had in booze, and building himself up in the arms of beautiful but vapid women. It wasn't until the harshest of experiences that Tony found who he was meant to become. Even then, however, Tony remained completely human inside his iron armor, an armor that was in itself, a depiction of who Tony Stark had become...strong, brilliant, using the powers it was given, far from indestructible, and most importantly, driven by his heart. Even Tony's Iron Man's exterior very clearly exposed his heart. I suspect that Iron Man 2 will give us much more of Tony and his love, Pepper Potts and the opportunity to see what happens when the world DOES know whose humanity powers the superhero within.\nami brings up excellent points with Spiderman and Iron Man: their hearts rules many of our favourite superheroes. They didn't choose to be the superhero, nor imagined themselves as one. In fact, do any of our beloved superheroes start out their secret life with that intention? Did Batman? Did Spiderman? Did Iron Man? Did even Superman? I think they were all thrown into their lives for a reason, and because they have good hearts. They are reluctant heroes. They all have had moments of contemplation about where their life is headed, and doubts about who they are and what they can do. Iron Man was literally ruled by his heart ... his device is what keeps him alive and his power is derived from his heart, as ami points out. What greater muscle is there than that to figuratively power a person's life and give them strength?\nAnd of course, Anakin was powered by his heart too. The difference with him is that he also let it rule his thoughts and actions in a selfish way, to his detriment. He let his heart over-power him to the point that he couldn't stop himself from avoiding pain and heartache and ended up hurting others. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, his son Luke let his heart be his guide and paid the ultimate price: he sacrificed himself to save not only his own turn to the darkside, but saved his father, his friends and the galaxy at large. And became a hero alongside his father in Anakin's own act of heroism in saving Luke.\nWhat a wonderful genre of movies, are the superhero movies. What once was perceived as children's comics or Saturday morning cartoons are now complex, detailed and emotional stories of characters that are seemingly invincible, but utterly human. They have the gifts and qualities many of us strive for: strength to help us fight out of tough situations, humanity to know themselves and others, and heart to know that what we do, we do for good and pure reasons. Even The Hulk, given all his brute strength and lack of cognizant abilities could comprehend those he didn't want to hurt and appeared to make decisions where it counted most ... with his heart. They also teach us that it is ok to have flaws and to know them. That is part of our human condition ... to have the strength and ability to know our flaws and still succeed.\nami pointed out to me, not on this blog but in conversation, that Anakin's humanity and his heart are what saved him, as well as Luke. He was a man with a human heart. And I couldn't agree more. He wasn't a superhero like we see in Batman or Superman or Iron Man or Spiderman. He went down a much different path than any of those characters, but what he does have in common with them is his humanity and that his heart is at the centre of his actions. He fought himself as Vader, but Anakin's heart won out in the end.\nAnd he fulfilled his own hero's quest.\nMy personal thanks to amidalooine for joining me in writing this blog, this milestone for me.

For those of you who are new here, I am Starman. I've been writing about various geeky things on-line for over a decade now, mostly writing about comics for Fanzing , 411 Mania , Comics Nexus and my old comics blog, Looking To The Stars . Recently, I became part of the staff for No Flying, No Tights .\nThis blog is about comics but it's also about much more than comics. It is a chronicle of my various hobbies - my geeky, geeky ways. I\u2019m a cosplayer , a shadowcaster , a Who-ligan , a gamer - a veritable Renaissance Fan, if you will. I hope you have as much fun reading this as I have writing it.\nMonday, July 5, 2004\nLooking To The Stars: Spider-Man 2 - A Review\nI started writing these words at 2:42 AM, CST on June the 30th. I\u2019ve just arrived home from a midnight showing of Spider-Man 2. I need to be at work before 9 AM tomorrow and part of me thinks it wise to go to bed now, be refreshed for work and worry about writing down my thoughts on this movie later. The other part of me can\u2019t sleep. And it thinks that I should get these thoughts down while they are fresh on my mind, and while I am too excited by the amazing, spectacular and astonishing sights that have filled my eyes for the past two hours to contemplate sleep or indeed, anything else but writing.\nSo please forgive me, Gentle Reader, if my description of the movie should miss certain details that you wish to see discussed. I have seen this film but once so far and plan to see it many, many more times so that I can see everything that I missed the first time. Maybe then I\u2019ll write more. But for now, here are my thoughts, such as they are, upon my first viewing of Spider-Man 2.\nI enjoyed this film as both a comic geek and a film geek. Sam Raimi\u2019s direction has never been better and the script was everything you could hope for, offering a fine balance of action, drama, romance and comedy. Raimi\u2019s love of the characters is obvious and every frame of this film screams of his desire to take his favorite comic book as a kid and translate it to the silver screen.\nA dedicated fan of the original Stan Lee books could have a field day picking apart the various references hidden in this film. Among the ones I can remember spotting with little trouble are\u2026\n1. Harry\u2019s alcoholism in the wake of his father\u2019s death (although he was something of a drinker and druggie beforehand in the comics)\n2. Numerous references to Amazing Spider-Man #50 (aka \u201cSpider-Man, No More!), up to and including the infamous scene in the alley with the trashcan and J. Jonah Jameson being given the Spider-Man costume later.\n3. Peter trapped under a collapsing wall, struggling to move it to save a loved one resembles Amazing Spider-Man #31.\n4. Peter loosing his powers temporarily in the wake of some illness or crisis of faith refers to numerous stories, including one of his earliest battles with Doctor Octopus. (Amazing Spider-Man #12)\nRaimi also sneaks in some literary allusions amidst all the comic references, using \u201cThe Importance of Being Earnest\u201d as a counterpoint to Peter\u2019s situation with Mary Jane. To quote the play, and the lines of MJ\u2019s character, \u201cI hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.\u201d\nThe first Spider-Man movie housed a number of cinematic references to the first film adaptation of DC Comics\u2019s greatest hero; Superman. Spider-Man 2 continues that trend and is full of echoes to another famous superhero sequel: Superman 2.\n1. Both sequels opened with a credits sequence that showed the events of the first movie. This time, rather than seeing selected scenes from the movie played to the music of John Williams, we get to see painter Alex Ross\u2019 renditions of selected scenes from the first movie to the music of Danny Elfman.\n2. Both movies also centered around the plot of a hero giving up his identity and loosing his powers in the wake of trying to win the love of his life and having to reclaim his identity in the wake of a new super-powered threat to the world.\n3. Both movies feature the hero having a conversation with a dead parent in arguing with themselves over whether or not they should quite their life as a hero.\nThe performances are top-notch, all-around. Tobey Maguire continues to be the perfect Peter Parker and is now a Spider-Man worthy of the name. I heard some complaints about the first movie and how clumsy Maguire seemed when doing the scenes as Spider-Man. This was, I believed, an intentional choice, showing him slowly easing into the role of a hero. It is also worth noting that Peter didn\u2019t crack wise much in his first year as Spider-Man in the original books, you know? But crack wise he does here. And he does well, proving a worthy Parker and Spider-Man.\nI doubt anything I can stay about Kirsten Dunst will change the minds of those hell-bent on deriding her casting as Mary Jane. In my opinion, she did the part total justice in the first film and does so again here, making MJ out for the spitfire she is in the comics. This was limited to one scene in the original movie, where she fought off the mob trying to pin her before being overpowered. This was still proof of her fiery spirit. It is less subtle this time around, with MJ making it clear that she is not going to sit around and wait for Peter to figure out what he wants. She also, in true Spider-Man fashion, struggles, insults the bad guy and tries actually fighting back when she is taken hostage.\nThe rest of the supporting cast succeeds in maintaining the high level of quality. James Franco brilliantly portrays Harry Osborn\u2019s descent into an alcohol-fueled downward spiral. Rosemary Harris is given a chance to give much more depth to Aunt May than in the first film and conveys the kindly wisdom of Peter\u2019s foster mother perfectly. And J.K. Simmons plays the boss we all love to hate, once again offering the biggest laughs in the whole movie as Jolly J. Jonah Jameson.\nThis brings us to my favorite bad guy, and doubtlessly the character that has everyone the most worried: Doctor Octopus. Without giving too much away, I will say that any worries I had going in about too much being changed and the arms looking cheesy were groundless.\nYes, the origin of Octavius here does play fast and loose with the original Stan Lee one. Yes, he is a married man and his \u201cevil\u201d is caused by the independent AI controlling the arms and not a brain injury or any predisposition towards being an evil guy. Various elements from the Ultimate Universe version of Octavius seem to have been used here and I can already hear the Spider-Man purists\u2026 the same ones who held the idea of organic webbing as proof of the absence of a just and loving god-like being watching over us\u2026 whining about how Sam Raimi just doesn\u2019t get it.\nBullocks! Doc Ock is here in all his glory and the origin isn\u2019t important. The character is there and once more, his purpose as a dark mirror to Peter is made all the stronger in this incarnation (See last week\u2019s Looking To The Stars for the full Dark Mirror theory). Whereas Peter gives up what he wants in order to save the woman he loves, Octavius is so blinded by his goals that he does not even notice his wife is in danger because of him until it is too late. Alfred Molina does the part perfectly and things are left open enough that Doc Ock returning is unlikely, but not impossible. (C\u2019mon Sinister Six Movie!)\nSpeaking of Doc Ock, I should mention that the arms look amazing. The special effects are greatly improved since the first film; no surprise considering the leaps and bounds that have been made in computer animation even in just two years. Whereas the last time the CGI was obvious at times, it flows much more smoothly here so that while there are still scenes that are obviously computer-made, it is only because of the sheer physics involved that you know this. There are just as many which could have been done as stunts but it is hard to say one way or the other.\nOverall, this is not only one of the rare sequels that is better the original. This is quite easily the greatest comic book adaptation ever, in any medium, and the new standard for any comic book movie after to follow. 10 Out Of 10, Five Stars Out Of Five.\nTune in next week. Same Matt time.

While we\u2019ve already recently looked at big gambles that failed to pay off and resulted in notoriously- squandered opportunities , it seemed like a good time to talk about the other side of that coin\u2013what of the big gambles that have paid off for creators and publishers, resulting in more readers, a richer storytelling experience or long-term changes for the better? There have certainly been some.\nThe New 52 would certainly make the list, except for the DC\u2019s universe-wide reboot and digital day-and-date move are what inspired the list\u2013so other than that, what are our picks?\n10. The DC Universe Comes to Smallville\nYears before Iron Man ushered the Marvel Universe into film, characters like Green Arrow and Impulse were appearing on the small screen, courtesy the WB/CW\u2019s Smallville (the adventures of Superman when he was a boy). Over the years, everyone from Aquaman to Zatanna would appear in the show, which would introduce millions of viewers to characters like Blue Beetle and Booster Gold, some of the greatest heroes they\u2019d never heard of. Those viewers, often, fell in love with those characters, even making Green Arrow an intrinsic character to the show\u2019s success in its later years and arguably raising Cyborg\u2019s profile to the point where he could be considered as a replacement for the absent Martian Manhunter on the new Justice League series by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee. And with a failed Aquaman pilot and a Booster Gold script in development, the move seems to have paid off for DC Entertainment.\n9. Savage Dragon: This Savage World\nErik Larsen has been writing, drawing and reinventing the adventures and backstory of The Savage Dragon since he was a kid, but never as publicly or dramatically as he did with This Savage World, a story in which Dragon finds himself in a dark, desolate, dystopian alternate timeline he inadvertently created by killing a time-traveling villain. After 75 issues in which Savage Dragon had been a solid and entertaining (but not overly ambitious) superhero book, this dramatic change to the status quo set off a series of stories that have left many readers fumbling for years to find their footing, and set up an overall vision for the series whereby every so often, the rules go completely out the window. The book has been stronger for it. It also laid the groundwork for the last couple of years of Savage Dragon stories, which saw the world destroyed (again) and saved (again), only to have Darklord (the villain whose death set off the whole sequence of events) apparently kill Dragon and then restore him to life\u2013in space.\nYeah, there\u2019s no such thing as a status quo in that book anymore. And it\u2019s awesome.\n8. Francine\u2019s Wedding\nIn a wildly divisive move among the readers of his hit indie book Strangers In Paradise, Terry Moore decided (ten years into the series\u2019 run) to marry off Francine Peters, one of the two women at the heart of the story and arguably the most relatable character in the book for many fans.\u00a0The move was controversial not only because it isolated her from Katchoo, David and most of the rest of the supporting cast\u2013and not just because of the notorious flash-forward sequences showing a potential (and profoundly depressing) future for Francine and the rest\u2013but because at the heart of much of the Strangers in Paradise fandom was a deeply-felt belief that Katchoo and Francine belonged together. And given Francine\u2019s often conservative, even provincial moral code it was difficult for many readers to see a situation where she would be the same character coming out the other side of a divorce\u2013if one was even in the cards.\nThe rift between the characters lasted for nearly twenty issues\u2013much of the remainder of the series\u2019 run\u2013and Francine\u2019s disappointing marriage became the catalyst for much of what happened from the moment she realized \u201cI\u2019m running out of time\u201d to have children until the end of the series.\n7. Man of Steel\nNo, not the upcoming movie (although hopefully that will be good and we can talk about it in a future list). We\u2019re talking about the 1986 miniseries in which John Byrne revamped the Superman mythology to fit DC\u2019s post-Crisis on Infinite Earths editorial philosophy. Wildly controversial from the time it was published all the way to today, Man of Steel features a stripped-down Superman who\u2019s still one of the most powerful beings on the planet\u2013but who may not be able to juggle that planet and two others. A more human, relatable approach to Superman proved a success for years, and set the stage for massively popular stories like The Death of Superman.\nEven after more than two decades and a number of revamps, restarts and reinventions, elements of Byrne\u2019s take on the Last Son of Krypton remain vital and interesting, and it seems likely that we\u2019ll see more of this particular iteration of Superman when Dan Jurgens, who wrote and drew the character for years following Byrne\u2019s departure, takes over as co-writer and penciler on the Superman monthly in March following the departure of George P\u00e9rez.\n6. The Golden Age\nJames Robinson\u2019s reinvention of Golden Age heroes may have been nominally an Elseworlds story (DC\u2019s \u201cWhat If\u2026?\u201d line), but it had ramifications that were felt throughout the DC Universe and the comics economy for years to come. Many credit the story\u2013which shows older superheroes who retired as a result of the McCarthy trials and have trouble adjusting to modern, civilian life\u2013as the kickoff for JSA, the popular Geoff Johns-written series that incorporated elements of the story into it and which has made not just the Justice Society but several of the lower-tier Golden Age characters into viable properties in the years since.\nA terrific story in its own rite, this comic would fall into the Kingdom Come or New Frontier territory\u2013great, but not necessarily a gamble\u2013except that the characters used here were not really marketable. Attempts to revitalize the Justice Society had been made time and again over the years, and never met with any sustained success, so a prestige-format miniseries featuring a number of characters unrecognizable to readers as well as some who had even fallen into the public domain was a chance DC took in hopes of paying off big.\nIt would also give Robinson, Johns and others opportunities to explore a number of Golden Age characters and their younger counterparts as \u201clegacy\u201d characters, something we\u2019ll get into a little bit more in a minute.\n5. The Ultimate Universe\nWhile it\u2019s not as ambitious as some of DC\u2019s relaunches, which have actually removed beloved characters, concepts and titles from the shelves and replaced them with the revamped versions on a permanent or at least semi-permanent basis, The Ultimate Universe was a big investment of capital for a Marvel Comics that didn\u2019t have a lot of it to go around, and it was far from a sure thing when it launched. The comics industry was slumping following the deflation of the collector\u2019s bubble in the 1990s and the remaining readership was largely composed of die-hards who had been around for years and didn\u2019t really need an introductory course in Spider-Man as told by the guy who wrote Torso.\nStill, the publisher went into it with guns a-blazin\u2019, putting top-tier talent on art and investing in a number of ongoing titles right off the bat, in spite of having recently been burned by the Heroes Reborn fiasco. The result? Ten years later, the Ultimate Universe is still going strong, and has become a profit center for Marvel outside of the direct market. Ultimate Spider-Man has not only become a mainstay of their publishing line, but it currently being used as a big part of Barnes & Noble\u2019s Nook Tablet promotional campaign to play up their relationship with Marvel, who is providing Barnes & Noble early access to digital graphic novels not yet available in iBooks or on the Amazon Kindle. And the more \u201crealistic\u201d and down-to-earth design elements of the Ultimate Universe have allowed for easy transition to film, with Hollywood\u2019s Thor and Captain America more closely resembling the Ultimate versions than their traditional Marvel Universe counterparts.\n4. DC\u2019s Legacy Books\nEvery so often one of these books comes along, but it seems fair to lump them together since, in recent years, they\u2019ve all been informed by the same source material: Roy Thomas\u2019s Infinity, Inc. and James Robinson\u2019s The Golden Age.\nThe two examples that stand out the most are James Robinson\u2019s Starman and Marc Andreyko\u2019s Manhunter, although the success of properties like this and the \u201clegacy\u201d culture of JSA has allowed for characters like Jaime Reyes (Blue Beetle III) to have their own shot at ongoing, monthly glory as well as characters like The Spectre and The Question getting high-profile reinventions.\nThe key here, in terms of being a gamble, is that the characters mentioned above aren\u2019t Wally West stepping into the Flash\u2019s road-worn boots or Dick Grayson putting on the cowl for the first time. Their precursors aren\u2019t wildly popular or even entirely recognizable to many readers, and the idea of giving Starman an ongoing series spinning out of Zero Hour (a \u00a0high-profile DC event where most of the Justice Society was decimated and Jack Knight acted like a jerk) seemed a lot like giving Steel his own monthly when The Reign\nof\u00a0Doomsday began earlier this year: It makes a kind of sense, sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will last very long.\nThe success of Starman on both a commercial and critical level shocked everyone, and made titles like H-E-R-O and later Manhunter seem like something the publisher might be willing to try. All it takes is one success out of every five or so attempts and a good pitch can calm the bean counters and convince editorial and corporate that some property they own might actually be worth taking off the shelf.\nAn upside to these titles even if (like H-E-R-O or Manhunter) they don\u2019t last as long as you would hope? Books like this\u2013with great high concepts, fewer connections to the larger universe of stories and a sense of history that makes readers want more\u2013are great, addicting entry points for readers who are a little older and more mature (read: who have more money) but who may not have considered comics seriously in the past after having seen one too many terrible superhero movies. Anything new and clever that can hook readers into the vast and interconnected world of mainstream superhero comics is good because once there, they may find out that they love more about comics, superheroes or both than they ever expected.\n3. Crisis on Infinite Earths\nSince the beginning of the Silver Age, both DC and Marvel had brought their universes closer together and created a complex and engaging character history within them for years. By the 1980s, fans were fiercely loyal to the characters they had followed sometimes for decades, but comics was becoming an increasingly difficult thing for new readers to wrap their heads around. It\u2019s surprising, then, that something like an Ultimate Universe didn\u2019t happen back in 1985 but instead, what superstar creators Marv Wolfman and George P\u00e9rez gave us was Crisis on Infinite Earths. It fed on and built on the established mythology that rewarded longtime readers, but the goal of the story was to bring down that mythology with a wrecking ball, to reduce it to its barest foundation so that creators could start building again and fans could walk right in on the ground floor, not to belabor the metaphor.\nCrisis reinvented the DC Universe by forcing creators to completely re-evaluate what the priorities were in their books. It reinvented the comics marketplace by introducing the idea of the massive crossover event as not merely a storytelling tool but a financial tentpole. It reinvented continuity by taking it from something that rewarded longtime readers to something that held the shared universe of these characters together.\n2. Marvel Joins Their Books Into a Universe\nWhile there had been some interaction between Marvel\u2019s characters as early as the 1940s, it was one single comic that in many ways set the stage for the DC and Marvel Universes as we know them today: Amazing Spider-Man #1 took the chance of launching a new series based on a character who\u2019d only been seen once before, and which guest-starred the Fantastic Four, Marvel\u2019s most popular characters at the time and a group which (it must have crossed someone\u2019s mind at some point) could well have stolen the show and put the brakes on Spider-Man as a character before he ever truly had a chance to get his feet under him.\nInstead what it did was send a loud, clear message that not only were Marvel\u2019s characters sharing a universe, but it wouldn\u2019t require the artificial structure of a team book in order to see them interacting together. Yes, we would have The Avengers soon, but here we saw something markedly different: That characters from other Marvel titles could appear in one another\u2019s solo titles, creating a unity of their world and great opportunities for cross-promotion that define the two universes to this day.\n1. The Image Revolution\nWhen you talk about taking big risks in comics, and then reaping big rewards, can there be any clearer example than that of seven top-tier artists who left big money on the table at DC and Marvel to start their own company and take their chances with unproven characters and an unproven business model in the hopes of getting a fairer shake than they were from their corporate employers? It\u2019s the American Dream in four colors.\nLike any startup, Image has had growing pains but the fact that not only have many of their characters and properties endured, but many of the original creators are enjoying phenomenal success (media mogul Todd McFarlane, anyone? DC Co-Publisher Jim Lee?) and others (Erik Larsen and Marc Silvestri) continue to have a day-to-day impact on the characters they created almost twenty years ago now.\nVN:F [1.9.11_1134]\nRating: 10.0/ 10 (2 votes cast)\nVN:F [1.9.11_1134]\nRating: +2 (from 2 votes)\nTen Comic Book Gambles (That Paid Off), 10.0 out of 10 based on 2 ratings\nRelated posts:\n"}], [{"score": 181.3924, "uuid": "eaa51d61-22d6-5531-935c-e9b623273e05", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0800tw-05-08470", "target_hostname": "www.politedissent.com", "target_uri": "http://www.politedissent.com/archives/date/2009/06", "page_rank": 2.9448488e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Polite Dissent &raquo; 2009 &raquo; June", "snippet": "Your Weekend Moment of Psychic Nosebleed Zen: Deep in the Cambodian Jungle An evil Soviet psychic <em>is</em> attempting to locate the members of Team 7 deep within the jungles of Cambodia.

They find Catherine just in time to rescue her from an attack by goons from the Hellfire Club \u2014 immediately afterward, Catherine Bradley suffers some significant vaginal bleeding. The doctor who examines her diagnoses her with placenta previa and places her on bedrest.\nPlacenta previa occurs when the placenta, instead of its normal location along the side or top of the uterus, implants along the bottom of the uterus, covering up the opening to the birth canal. It is a fairly common cause of vaginal bleeding during later pregnancy, but is very, very rare in the first trimester (the first three months of pregnancy).\nMore common causes of first trimester bleeding include implantation bleeding , miscarriage or threatened miscarriage , or an ectopic pregnancy . Trauma can play a role as well, as can non-uterine causes of vaginal bleeding.\nThere is nothing a physician or mother can do to cure placenta previa. Minimizing the recurrence of bleeding from the previa is wise, so that is why bed rest is recommended. Luckily, most placenta previa resolve by themselves \u2014 as the uterus grows during pregnancy, it pulls the placenta up higher. For a placenta previa discovered during the second trimester, there is a 90% chance it will resolve by the delivery date.\nCurrently, a cesarean (c-section) is the preferred method in the United States for delivering the baby when there is placenta previa. If c-section is not an option \u2014 for instance, in certain more remote parts of the world, or at the turn of the 20th century \u2014 the baby can be delivered vaginally, but it is a bloody mess. While there is a risk the mother may die due to placenta previa, it is the baby who faces the greatest risk of death. Currently in the United States, the maternal mortality rate from placenta previa is 0.03% (I don\u2019t have the data, but I suspect the risk was several orders of magnitude larger in 1906).\nDating the Pregnancy: Mrs Bradley tells her husband the news that she is pregnant on or about April 18th. She is suffering morning sickness at the time. She delivers the child on December 1st. Most first-time mothers deliver a few days later than their expected due date \u2014 but on the other hand, half of pregnancies complicated by placenta previa deliver early \u2014 so I\u2019m going to assume these two cancel each other out, and Catherine delivers when expected. This places Catherine in her seventh week of pregnancy during the main part of the story (and means that she is experiencing morning sickness a little earlier than expected \u2014 classically it begins around the 12th week, but it\u2019s certainly not uncommon to see it start earlier).\nEthical Questions and SPOILERS (highlight to read)\nTaking as given the standard ethical warning about a physician treating a member of their own family, this scenario opens up a couple of intriguing questions, questions that were for some reason not covered in my Medical Ethics class in medical school.\n1. Since James Bradley already knows that Catherine dies in childbirth, is he \u2014 consciously or sunconsciously \u2014 not going to try as hard to save her life as he should?\n2. If the situation comes down to the life of the mother versus the life of the child (not uncommon when dealing with placenta previa), and since he himself is the child, wouldn\u2019t his medical decision making be severely compromised?\n(I guess part of the ethics depends on your opinion on time paradoxes and whether or not the past is immutable)\n"}, {"score": 179.87485, "uuid": "9657633b-9ccb-5d17-a420-24d14407be85", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1900tw-08-07517", "target_hostname": "blog.newsok.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.newsok.com/nerdage/2012/04/18/bionic-woman-returns-in-comics/", "page_rank": 1.1773365e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Bionic Woman returns in comics | Nerdage", "snippet": "Jaime <em>is</em> bionically enhanced, which gives her enhanced hearing in her right ear, a <em>stronger</em> right arm, and faster and <em>stronger</em> legs.

Austin intervenes with the Office of Scientific Intelligence to save her life. Jaime is bionically enhanced, which gives her enhanced hearing in her right ear, a stronger right arm, and faster and stronger legs.\nThe character was reintroduced in Dynamite\u2019s current \u201cBionic Man\u201d series. That series is an update of the Steve Austin character as conceived by filmmaker Kevin Smith. The \u201cBionic Woman\u201d series is written by Paul Tobin and drawn by Leno Carvalho.\nThe Bionic Woman ongoing series is licensed through NBCUniversal Television Consumer Products Group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big booming blast of a look at the woman behind the bionics,\u201d said Tobin in a news release. \u201c\u2026a chance for myself and Jaime Sommers to team up, cut loose, knock some things around and then high-five when the dust is still settling.\u201d\nThe first issue is set in Paris, as the Bionic Woman is on the trail of the Mission, high-priced surgeons who have been murdering OSI\u2019s bionic prototypes.\nIn 2010, Wagner and Richard Anderson, who played Oscar Goldman on \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d and \u201cBionic Woman,\u201d spoke at the Austin Comic Con about the TV series.\n\u201cI took it very seriously,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat was one of the things, when I accepted the role as an ongoing thing, I had to contractually be able to be involved in the development.\u201d\nWagner said the Bionic Woman didn\u2019t just win by being stronger \u2014 she had to think her way out of situations.\n\u201cIf you look at the time Jaime (Sommers, the Bionic Woman) hit somebody, it\u2019s actually so small,\u201d she said. \u201cHave her use her head. Let someone knock themselves over with their own force.\u201d\nTobin said at his website, www.paultobin.net, that the show would follow up on themes from the series.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be dealing with extensions of the original television show, for the most part,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cWe\u2019re going classic with the Bionic Woman, but there are quite a few surprises on the way.\u201d\nJaime Sommers was first introduced in the two-part episode \u201cThe Bionic Woman\u201d of \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man.\u201d Sommers, a professional tennis player, was a girlfriend of Steve Austin, and the two rekindle their relationship. But a skydiving accident leaves her near death. Goldman and Dr. Rudy Wells (Martin E. Brooks) are persuaded to rebuild her.\nWagner said her show wasn\u2019t originally intended to be a spinoff, as her character dies during the two-parter. But that wouldn\u2019t be the end of the Bionic Woman. Fan response resulted in the character\u2019s returning in \u201cThe Six Million Dollar Man\u201d episode \u201cWelcome Back, Jaime.\u201d\n\u201cThat was just crisis control,\u201d Wagner said.\nShe said the response to that episode led the board of directors of ABC to demand \u201cThe Bionic Woman\u201d receive her own series. The show debuted in January 1976.\nThe series ran on ABC for two seasons and was picked up by NBC for its final season.\nThe character starred in her own comic book series and toy line during the run of the TV show.\nAll three seasons of \u201cThe Bionic Woman\u201d are now available on DVD.

Today I will be reviewing Uncanny X-Force #10. Please leave a comment to let me know what you think.\nSo let\u2019s talk about the book. Amahl Farouk, the Shadow King, brings some incriminating evidence to a new reporter on Warren and how he\u2019s a cold blooded killer. When Warren finds out, the Archangel persona takes over and tries to kill anyone with the evidence. Luckily Wolverine and X-Force are there to stop him. They get him back to their base and imprison him. In order to save him, X-Force frees Dark Beast to ask for his aid. He informs them that Warren is being taken over by a death seed, created by the Celestials, and implanted by Apocalypse into Warren. Only a life seed can cure him. The only one in existence that Dark Beast knows of is in his lab in his dimension. To save Warren, X-Force has to travel to the Age of Apocalypse. And that\u2019s the book.\nSo let\u2019s talk opinions. Another incredible installment of drama and action. This time around its all about Warren and his struggle against the monster living inside of him. A monster that he has no hope of beating, it seems. I like the way Warren kept on getting more and more evil. His fight with Wolverine was pretty cool. I really enjoyed the way X-Force rescued Dark Beast. Very funny. This one was incredibly well paced and really got me revved up for next issue. I am as excited as a little boy on Christmas eve. I know what\u2019s happening soon and I can\u2019t wait for it to come. Billy Tan drawing Age of Apocalypse should be amazing. He really did an incredible job this issue. The Dark Beast final image was very ominous. The Wolverine/Archangel battle was incredible. Warren\u2019s pinion knives look amazing. In fact, everyone looked really great. The lines and colors and details all meshed together in a wonderful symphony of music. This was a perfect intro into the next story arc. I\u2019m pretty sure Dark Beast has some ulterior motives and a double cross waiting for X-Force but we\u2019ll deal with that when it comes. Maybe he might just request to stay in the Age of Apocalypse dimension once this mission is over. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. That\u2019s my opinion folks.

It means thank you. I really know only a few words of the Russian language, but what little I do know I learned about twenty years ago. I was taught by a man named Piotr Rasputin. I didn\u2019t know him very well, and never asked if he was related to the czar\u2019s infamous \u201cMad Monk,\u201d but I do remember that he had the curious ability to turn his flesh into a sort of impervious living steel. Very cool, really.\nOne of my earliest geology lessons came when I was about ten years old. Like my smattering of Russian, it wasn\u2019t a full, formal lesson. But I did learn some interesting and scientifically sound facts, including that because limestone in the earth is partially water-soluble it often creates caves and sinkholes. I overheard a young duck without pants discussing this.\nI don\u2019t recall if it was Huey, Dewey, or Louie, but, in any event, they were searching a cave for hidden treasure on behalf of their avaricious great uncle, Scrooge McDuck. (In the same comic I also learned that Scots are tight with a penny, but perhaps that was a stereotype I shouldn\u2019t have picked up.)\nI learned scads of (mostly accurate) factoids from my youthful reading, following the adventures and exploits of Encyclopedia Brown, Tintin, Tom Swift, Doc Savage (and his band of scientists including a chemist and an electrical engineer), and, of course, comic-book superheroes.\nThe world of comics is not just for kids anymore, with complex storylines and very adult graphic novels. Comic- book heroes have jumped from colored splash panels to the big screen in blockbuster films such as Batman, Superman, X-Men, and, of course, the Spider-Man franchise (Spider-Man 3 was recently released in theaters on May 4).\nVisitors to the Spider-Man swing can hang by a super-strong thread.\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that many of the superheroes who have repeatedly (albeit fictionally) saved the world are scientists: Spider-Man (Peter Parker) is an accomplished science student; the Incredible Hulk (in his human form, Bruce Banner) is a nuclear physicist; Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards) holds doctorates in physics and electrical engineering; and so on. Most Marvel Comics superheroes have some strong link with science or technology (for example, Peter Parker invented his own web-slinging mechanism, and engineer Tony Stark created his own Iron Man exoskeleton). (For an in-depth look at science and superheroes, see The Science of Superheroes, by Lois Gresh and Robert Weinberg.)\nMarvel Comics founder Stan Lee had created dozens of superheroes to populate his comic books, each with amazing and wondrous powers. He had heroes who could do amazing things rarely if ever seen in the real world. They could fly, walk through walls, teleport, turn invisible, and so on. But Lee had a problem: coming up with the powers was the easy part; coming up with a reason why they had those powers was tricky. So Lee\u2014whose grasp of science is admittedly shaky\u2014used science to ground and lend a sense of validity to the characters. Thus, many heroes gained their powers through scientific, naturalistic (if not wholly realistic) processes. The Fantastic Four were exposed to cosmic rays; Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider; and so on.\nA couple watch themselves through a thermal imaging camera.\nThis worked for a while, but, finally, Lee just got lazy. Once he read about the process of genetic mutation, that opened up a whole new world where mutations could be used as a blanket cause of myriad abilities ranging from psychic powers to teleportation to weather control. Thus, the X-Men were born.\nOf course, the veneer of science only goes so deep; children wishing to climb walls and have superhuman Spider-Man strength can stop taunting their radioactive spiders. (And where do you get radioactive spiders, anyway?)\nPart of the reason the comics had an educational element was that Stan Lee did not believe in talking down to his audience. He wrote his scripts and dialogue at a college level, unafraid of making his readers reach for a dictionary now and then.\nRecently, Marvel Comics launched an educational science exhibit using many of its most popular comic-book superhero characters. The goal was to educate children and the public about scientific principles in a fun and interesting way. The exhibit introduces the public to many scientific topics and principles, including magnetism, engineering and hydraulics, acoustics and the physics of sound waves, chemistry, genetics and evolution, visual perception, and arachnology. Instead of dry display panels, the thirty action stations are geared toward hands-on demonstrations and learning. Among them:\nDoctor Octopus, a veteran Spider-Man foe who has four robotic tentacle-arms, serves to introduce a fascinating discussion of prosthetic limbs. Photos and artifacts illustrate the evolution of prosthetics from rudimentary hook hands to modern mechanical limbs.\nThe Spider-Man display explains that the tensile strength of spider\u2019s silk is higher than any artificial material, and allows people to hang from hair-thin fibers, eight times stronger than steel.\nA station featuring Professor X, who trains his band of mutants to become crime-fighting X-Men, explores how mutations come about. Visitors are given three examples of living organisms, and then asked to guess the percentage of DNA that the three share.\nDaredevil, a blind superhero, is used as an example of how blind creatures can navigate using echolocation and acoustics.\nThe X-Men exhibit discusses the science behind evolution and mutation.\nOther superheroes who took time off from ridding the world of evildoers in order to educate kids for the exhibit include the Hulk, Iceman, Wolverine, the Human Torch, Storm, Banshee, and Iron Man. While some of the exhibits and displays are a bit silly (does matching the Hulk\u2019s angry facial expressions help us understand the physiology of anger?), overall, the exhibit is very well-designed, fun, and informative. Any exhibit that educates as it entertains is well worth a visit, and this is one of the best. Excelsior!\nThe Marvel Superheroes Science Exhibition premiered at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Canada, and will be at the St. Louis (Missouri) Science Center from April 28, 2007, until September 4, 2007.

The streets are the same as are the seedy bars and pizza places, but in Joe Pitt's world there are also vampyres. Now normally vampires or in this case vampyres aren't something I go in for but Joe Pitt is just too good of a character to pass up on. Pitt is infected with something called the vyrus which requires blood to sustain before it eats him alive. There are some positives though, the vyrus makes Joe stronger and faster than a normal human and able to take ungodly amounts of damage. The negative reaction to sunlight is still there but these vampyres can and do go outside during the daylight, they just use protection.. But what you get is a noir fairytale with tough guy Pitt caught between the Society, a politicly correct commune where everyone is A OK to the mafia style Coalition who rules most of Manhattan. It makes for some fun reading. Rounding out the supporting cast is Evie, Joe's love interest who is HIV positive who Joe could cure in an instant as the vyrus destroys anything harmful to the host, to the Enclave who are a cult like group that live in a fortress in the meat packing district where the train in a bone breaking martial art and prepare for a savior to be able to walk into the daylight.\nThese books won't be for everyone. They are bleak and they are ultra violent. But if you like alternate takes on seemingly played out ideas, give this noir vampyre series a shot.\nLarry's Pick of the Week:\nJOIN ME by Danny Wallace.\nSubtitled \"The True Story of How One Man Started a Cult... by accident,\" journalist Danny Wallace placed an ad in a small London newspaper as a bit of a goof. JOIN ME, it said, with contact info. Asked for a recent photo, just to prove your were a person. No other info.\nJust, you know, as a lark. To see what would happen.\nAnd then. From all over the world. People did. They had no idea what they were joining, and yet, that sort of didn't matter. Equal parts of hope and humor, inspiration and despair, good deeds and bad curry, imagine a book written by Monty Python about that one time when they found themselves in control of an army of believers, who were looking to them for inspiration.\nIt goes from a joke, to... well:\n\"His Royal Highness applauds the initiative taken to establish Join Me and is thrilled that so many good deeds have been done as a result...

Starting with 2000's X-Men, Hollywood started paying attention to the medium in a way it never did before. Sure, there were the Superman and Batman franchises but those seemed to be the exception and definitely not the rule (as Steel, Supergirl, Tank Girl and many others proved.) Now, this summer we have got one of the best superhero movies ever made in Iron Man, a big budget Hulk reboot and two upcoming (and excellent-looking) others: Hellboy II - The Golden Army and The Dark Knight, along with another one that should have been a comic book (specially if it had been produced by John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke) in Hancock.\nIf those weren't enough, Hellboy II is Guillermo Del Toro latest effort. Guillermo \"MY NEXT MOVIE IS THE HOBBIT\" Del Toro, which I'd assume played a part (along with his good-beyond-words Pan's Labyrinth) in getting him into the director's chair to direct the story of Bilbo Baggins.\nIt's a good time to be a nerd, particularly a comic book nerd.\nErin's Pick of the Week:\nRaymond K. Feist's Riftwar Saga: I know I might be letting my nerd show, but this fantasy series is not to be missed. Complete with magicians, invasions from other worlds, monsters, sleeping princesses and zombies, Feist's Riftwar books take us to the world of Midkemia and focus primarily on the Kingdom of the Isles with visits to the planet Kelawar. We're introduced to this world in Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master, the story of a young boy discovering his magical abilities between being kidnapped by aliens and fighting a war at, like, fourteen. The story continues with a focus on the Kingdom's royal family in Silverthorn (see: sleeping princess) and A Darkness at Sethanon, which features lots of creepy zombies. And who doesn't love creepy zombies? An oldie, but a goodie, I'm going to recommend this to any lovers of High Adventure out there.\nAsh's Pick of the Week:\nAsh is off in sunny Orlando this week, but were he here, he'd be extolling the virtues of Primavera's ProSight application. As an Enterprise Portfolio Management solution, ProSight is easily and infinitely customizable to your company's portfolio management needs. Prioritization is a snap with customizable investor maps, \"what-if\" scenario building and constraint analysis, and Primavera supports integration with key enterprise solutions like MS Project Server. ProSight is fully customizable out of the box, but Primavera also supplies \"Fast Track\" configurations, allowing organizations to leverage industry best practices for the foundation of their configuration, and then tweak to meet their individual needs.\nRich's Pick of the Week:\nY The Last Man Vol 10 Whys And Wherefores TP. This is it, trade-waiters. The conclusion to Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra's excellent post-apocalyptic sci-fi epic about Yorick Brown, the last man on earth, is finally collected in this new trade paperback.

This summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other cinematic offering from Marvel Comics, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, tackles the atom bomb through an angry, green metaphor, but IRON MAN goes at it direct.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an unusual premise to hoist a superhero movie on\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit was one of the many themes playing out in the over-stuffed SPIDER-MAN 3, for example\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the writing team that also gave us last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CHILDREN OF MEN, having something more bleak in mind. In trying to have both, Tony Stark ends up having neither. His weapons are used by the very people he made them to destroy, and his aura of invincibility is easily shattered when he is taken prisoner.\nWhether we should be at war with\nIraq\nor not\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe point of motives is kind of moot, at this point\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe fact remains that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our fault there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason to be there at all. Forget the current administration and its culture of fear: the seeds of the\nMiddle East\nanger were planted decades ago, back when we had to defeat the Communists at all costs. Which meant selling weapons to their enemies. And now, here we are, slowly being torn apart by war we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re responsible for, with an enemy who despises us for the culture excess that has become our trademark. Is it too much to ask for both? Some people who have neither option might say yes. And so it is with Tony Stark, kept alive by dirty, oily car battery and some wires sticking out of his chest, someone else pointing his own guns at his head.\nHulk may be the personification of the atom bomb, but Stark, the innovator who gets damaged by the very chaos he created and finds his life of excess no comfort, gets be\nAmerica\n, broken heart and all.\nSo if IRON MAN, the film, fails in any way, it is that its resolution doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through with the beautiful metaphor it creates in the first half. Stark response to his awakening is to take personal responsibility for his action, by defending those in a war zone his weapons created. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also an implication that the future of Stark Industries isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weaponry, but alternative energy sources. But neither of these are followed through within the timeline of the film. Iron Man saves one village in\nAfghanistan\n, but the violence rages on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Arc Reactors,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the device that keeps the red and gold suit of armor in the air, may be the future, but apparently only Stark can build them. The options are there, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see them through when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only got 2 hours and boss battle to contend with.\nI will say, however, that the villain of this film is perfectly chosen, being a dark mirror of Stark himself, i.e. the America that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about what happens to the rest of the world, as long as his oversized vehicle has plenty of fuel.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how a film could address these issues in a reasonable way by the end of the last reel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a superhero story, and those stories work less as allegories for big ideas than about explorations of human failing made huge and brightly colored. Even Superman is just trying to live up to the expectations of his old man (either of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem). Thematically, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough for Tony Stark to realize that his actions do have consequences, and to face them, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to need some help.\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to see the hero succeeding by accepting that he neither has be respected or feared. Just do the right thing.\nIt\u2019s What Philo Farnsworth Would Have Wanted\nDecember 20th, 2007, posted in Essays\nAt the first sci-fi convention I was a guest at, I spoke at length about how the new generation of sci-fi authors were more realistic then their processors. A lot of this had to do with cumulative knowledge, sure, but also from a post-modern sensibility of taking basic sci-fi tropes and turning them inside out. I was pressed for examples of this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new realism,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and the first thing that came to mind was a BATTLESTAR GALACTICA episode, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Water,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d where our space operatic heroes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 water supply is sabotaged in the emptiness of space.\nThis was laughed at. To my fellow panelists, science fiction meant books. TV was a wasteland of matinee idols and silly special effects. The idea of a Serious Adult Science Fiction Drama on TV was unheard of.\nSerious Adult Science Fiction Drama on television is an elusive beast. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to do right, and has become almost anthemia to sci-fi television in general. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich I believe has now almost eclipsed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s source material; I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New BSG\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in quite some time\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcomes very close, even if it routinely fails the \u00e2\u20ac\u009dOne of two things\u00e2\u20ac\u009d test. However, I will fault no series that gives Michelle Forbes work.\nEver since she gave Majel Barret the stink-eye way back when , I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a fan of our Ms. Forbes.\nBut that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be it, can it? One show? Surely, there are more Serious Adult Science Fiction Dramas out there, that can be held up against the best TV dramas out there, right? I mean, it has been eight years since DEEP SPACE NINE ended. Something should fill that void.\nI feel like sci-fi is little more than a genre, and as such, deserves the deluxe treatment cowboys, cops, and spies have gotten. One of the greatest television shows known to man is THE SANDBAGGERS. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a spy thriller that cuts at the meat of what spy thrillers should be about; namely, the people who do horrible things in unfriendly lands, and the people who send them there to do them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not James Bond, something Roy Marsden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Director of Operations makes abundantly clear in the first episode. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a genre story that stands above the genre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal trappings, and looks all the better for it.\nTORCHWOOD was supposed to that, as well. That was the hype, leastways. A serious, adult look at the weird and wonderful world of DOCTOR WHO was supposed to be a contender for BSG\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crown, but ends up looking more like BUFFY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s castoffs. I suppose in the attempt to prove itseld as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with its barely-bloody violence and its nippleless sex and its oh-so-naughty language, TORCHWOOD forgot that what makes a story adult is consequences. Childhood fantasy doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother itself with consequences; they have a tendency to ruin the fun. And quite frankly, that seemed to be where TORCHWOOD wanted to go. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to fit consequences in a 40 minute episode when you also have to expound about alien races and secret technology and have a sex scene or three in there too. Only two of the episodes\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ghost Machine\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Out Of Time\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dseem to have integrated the concepts of consequences into the story proper, while others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cyberwoman,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking at you\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust latch them on at the end. Not that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anything intrinsically wrong with having a woman in bionic-bikini-briefs battle a pterodactyl, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not pretend its anything more than that. With it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloomy setting and constantly arguing characters, TORCHWOOD is in fact the perfect adolescent fair for the kid who thought Buffy was too touchy-feely. But it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Serious Adult Science-Fiction Drama any more than FARSCAPE or STARGATE are.\nThis is not knocking either of those shows, or even TORCHWOOD. They are what the are, and what they are is perfectly enjoyable. But they are not up to SANDBAGGERS, or even LAW & ORDER levels of adult drama. But they are fun. As I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said in the past, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t knock a tv show that gives us bondage outfits and muppets.\nThe Patrick Stewart vehicle 11TH HOUR tries harder to get its S.A.S-F.D. on, and for the first two episodes actually makes good. 11TH HOUR is hard sci-fi\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor, at least, as close as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten on TV yet\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand its first episodes about cloning and a viral outbreak do what TORCHWOOD can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, complete with sex scenes and dirty words. Unfortunately, the second half of this 4-episode series can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t measure up to the standard set up by the first half. Stewart does his best, but even he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn stories about global warming and a cancer-curing spring into exciting television.\nThe producers seem marginally aware of that, and Roy Marsden of THE SANDBAGGERS shows up to add some weight and menace to the final episode. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change the script any, but he is fun to watch as a foil for Stewart.\nObviously, the first thing we can take away from this is Serious Adult Genre Drama requires Roy Marsden in one shape or form.\nI feel like sci-fi needs more than one Serious Adult Drama, especially with BSG bowing out after next season. My fellow panelist on at that convention years ago scoffed at the idea, but the fact remains that television is where our culture still forms its ideas about genres. The internet is too unregulated, and movies are too specific. But television is just broad enough to hit the sweet spot of the public consciousness. For good or for ill, STAR TREK has become a far stronger culture touchstone than LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really no reason that another show, one that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t based on a program from the 70s or a spin-off of a popular family show, can\u2019t have that impact today.\nAlso, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d really, really, really like to watch it.\n"}, {"score": 170.65207, "uuid": "f080cb30-e38b-5d14-9c56-1182c443333b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1804wb-99-20609", "target_hostname": "seekeronos.blogsome.com", "target_uri": "http://seekeronos.blogsome.com/2006/09/", "page_rank": 2.1092195e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Seeker&rsquo;s Jar :: September :: 2006", "snippet": "In fact, he was probably overdone in his hypermasculinity, save only for the outrageous ultra-muscularity of selected characters like <em>Hulk</em> <em>or</em> Juggernaut.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Ten Percent Rule, Take 2\nYa gotta love surveys.\nJust when we thought that the much publicized* \"statistic\" that circulated much in gay pop culture and/or GLAAD/PLAG literature about how 10% of men are gay had finally been sealed up and buried away alongside the remains of Mr. Ed (the horse, of course), we have another \"ten percent\" issue coming to the surface.\nTo wit, I give you:\nA survey of New York City men finds that nearly one in 10 who identify themselves as \"straight\" have sex only with other men.

The flip side of that is that most likely very few of those men would have actively identified themselves\u00a0as gay, and probably did not have a preference for men over women: their choice in the matter was rather limited. Moreover, I would say that they were performing (forcible prison rape) their roles more to establish their power structure than for sexual release.\n"}, {"score": 164.44121, "uuid": "78b57a91-d60d-597e-9e75-070cf322af1c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1701wb-14-27339", "target_hostname": "www.uafsunstar.com", "target_uri": "http://www.uafsunstar.com/archives/9404", "page_rank": 1.2166684e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Duly Noted: 6 unusual class offerings | UAF Sun Star", "snippet": "From the course catalog: \u201cHave you ever wondered if <em>Superman</em> could really bend steel bars?

For those of you who are new here, I am Starman. I've been writing about various geeky things on-line for over a decade now, mostly writing about comics for Fanzing , 411 Mania , Comics Nexus and my old comics blog, Looking To The Stars . Recently, I became part of the staff for No Flying, No Tights .\nThis blog is about comics but it's also about much more than comics. It is a chronicle of my various hobbies - my geeky, geeky ways. I\u2019m a cosplayer , a shadowcaster , a Who-ligan , a gamer - a veritable Renaissance Fan, if you will. I hope you have as much fun reading this as I have writing it.\nMonday, November 28, 2005\nLooking To The Stars: The Future of DC\nJust when I try and get out, they pull me back in.\nNo, I'm not still going on about my job with the comic store. I'm talking about DC Comics. My abandonment of most of Marvel Comics is well known by this point. And with all the upcoming news about bold new directions and characters dying and bland non-specific hype coming out of DC recently, I wasn't seeing myself buying much more from DC either.\nAnd then came the good news. A whole spattering of good news, in fact. Good news that has assured me that I won't be completely turning into an indy comics guy anytime soon.\n1. Kurt Busiek and Geoff Johns writing Superman.\nI've never been a big Superman fan. As a kid, I always preferred the more cerebral heroes who didn't punch their way through everything. And back then, Superman didn't do much but punch his way through every little thing. More recently, but rarely, many writers have been able to balance the simplicity of Truth, Justice and the American way with more complex storylines that tested Superman's spirit as well as his muscles. And with two of the writers who are the absolute best at maintaining the mix of Silver Age sensibility with modern storytelling at the helm, it looks like Superman will be a very good book to recommend to new readers when the new Superman movie hits the big screen this summer.\n2. James Robinson on Batman.\nMy favorite Batman story of all time is a little story called Blades. Barely a story about Batman at all, the focus is upon a new Gotham vigilante dubbed The Cavalier who winds up teaching an inexperienced Bruce Wayne something about good intentions and heroism. It was the first thing I ever read by a writer who would quickly become one of my favorites and the indirect source of my nickname.\nSo it is with a good deal of joy that I can note that Starman author James Robinson, after an extended stay in Hollywood, is apparently returning back to DC to write not one, but two titles; Batman and Detective Comics. Batman has suffered from some truly horrible writing in the last two years and I haven't bought a Batman book since the time when Jean Paul Valley was still up and kicking because of it. So yeah... I'll be giving both these titles a shot.\n3. Ron Marz on Ion.\nLongtime readers will know that it was Green Lantern, and Kyle Rayner in specific, that got me into reading comics as an adult. Now as much as I am loving Geoff Johns bringing the GLC back, and what he is doing with all the characters... I've been kind of sad seeing Kyle shoved to a supporting role, even if he does hold a post as teacher in The New Corps. And a lot of people, who STILL can't get over the fact that Kyle still draws breath even though they have Hal back in a position as a respected hero AND a Green Lantern, are still insisting that Kyle will die during Infinite Crisis.\nSo here, in order, is my news for anyone who is a fan of Kyle Rayner.\nGOOD: Kyle will be surviving Crisis.\nBETTER: Kyle will be getting his own solo title under the nom de plume Ion.\nBEST: Ron Marz is coming back to write it.\nIn short: Eat it, H.E.A.T.!\n4. Supergirl and the Legion of Superheroes.\nOn that note, not only is the new, non-confusing REAL Supergirl going to survive Infinite Crisis...\nNot only will her book be continuing...\nBut she will be getting a second title, apparently paired with The Legion.\nHmmm... come to think of it, isn't Superboy Prime still alive and kicking and just begging to go to a place where heroism as an ideal is very much needed?\nI'm not suggesting anything here... save that this may be a very good time to be an old-school Silver Age comics fan.\n5. Keith Giffen on Blue Beetle.\nRumored for a while, but now confirmed. Glad to see there's still some room at DC for a little levity. I'd hate to have the only thing I see from Giffen be the amusing, but impossible for me to get at my store Defenders.\nSo yes. I'll be around a while longer. Much to the chagrin of El Editor Grande Daron, who will be quite disappointed to know that despite his predictions of doom last week, I did not get a single bit of hate mail in the past week over my statement that Gail Simone has the best grasp of the Ollie Queen/Dinah Lance relationship of any writer at DC and that anyone who dares disagree with me is arguing against solid fact, not opinion.\nHey that wasn't Daron, that was ME, your most vertical editor, Kevin S Mahoney! I write in a thick blue font, very unlike Daron's!\nBut more on that, and how Gail has indirectly made my life as a Green Arrow enthusiast much more difficult, next time...\nTune in next week. Same Matt time. Same Matt website.\n"}, {"score": 160.97983, "uuid": "a9e5dfa8-eade-587b-a2f6-653bd110bd91", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0110wb-12-23193", "target_hostname": "www.graphicnovelreporter.com", "target_uri": "http://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/happy-birthday-wonder-con-review-show-feature-stories", "page_rank": 1.1870259e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Happy Birthday, Wonder-Con: A Review of the Show | Graphic Novel", "snippet": "Other early guests included Will Eisner, Jim Salicrup, Marvel\u2019s editor of The Amazing Spider-Man, Peter David, writer of The Incredible <em>Hulk</em>, and a young Todd McFarlane, <em>who</em> was also working on The <em>Hulk</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Printer-friendly version\nHappy Birthday, Wonder-Con: A Review of the Show\nWonderCon, held at San Francisco\u2019s Moscone Center April 1-3, 2011, celebrated its 25th birthday with 40,000 of its closest friends. Before blowing out the candles, attendees snaked through lines of animated comic, sci-fi, and pop culture fans as flash bulbs blinded even the most intrepid. Costumed superheroes posed with mere mortals creating postcards of Captain America, Wolverine, and the Bay Area Ghostbusters, or pinup calendars of Poison Ivy, Elektra, and Batgirl. But before heading out to the exhibition floor, a birthday cake needed cutting.\nWonderCon is more than just comic books, toys, and T-shirt booths; it\u2019s also the world\u2019s greatest trade show featuring panels of the best and the brightest in the pop culture industry.\nWonderCon\u2019s 25th Anniversary panel featured its three founding fathers, Joe Field, owner of the Eisner Spirit Award Winning comic store Flying Colors Comics in Concord, California; Mike Friedrich, who in the 1980s ran a talent agency and organized trade shows for retailers; and Bryan Uhlenbrock, former branch manager of the comics distributor Capital City. The panel also included David Glanzer, the show\u2019s director of marketing and publicity, and was moderated by the (in)famous Mark Evanier, writer and director for comics and television.\nIn 1987, the Wonderful World of Comics kicked off its inaugural season at the Oakland Convention Center, where 1,800 comic book fans turned out. Early WonderCons included appearances by Stan Lee, who came to celebrate Spider-Man\u2019s bachelor party, a party crashed by the Green Goblin as he popped out of a present to attack his archrival. After a choreographed brawl, the two decided they could be pals for a night. Other early guests included Will Eisner, Jim Salicrup, Marvel\u2019s editor of The Amazing Spider-Man, Peter David, writer of The Incredible Hulk, and a young Todd McFarlane, who was also working on The Hulk.\nWhen asked about the best moments of their WonderCon tenure, Friedrich reminisced about meeting Michael Chabon, whose Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay begins at WonderCon. Chabon, also a writer of Golem comics, agreed to appear at the 2001 WonderCon, but four days prior won the Pulitzer Prize. A worried Friedrich thought the award-winning author would cancel, but instead Chabon made his first post-Pulitzer appearance at WonderCon. On the other hand, Uhlenbrock\u2019s favorite moments consisted of playing in the Saturday night geek rock-and-roll band made up of artists, writers, and promoters, while Field enjoyed the warm feeling he got from being around people who like what they\u2019re doing. Field recently posted a twelve-minute video on YouTube entitled 1988 WonderCon Review, which includes footage of Stan Lee and Will Eisner. The founders agreed their low point occurred during the Cherry Pop Tart look-alike contest, a contest that was demeaning to women, and everyone else for that matter, sparking one reporter to ask, \u201cThis is what your kids are reading?\u201d\nDuring that first year, Richard Brunnin, then a Midwestern graphic designer and now a vice president at DC Comics, developed the star and tornado logo where the comics are the \u201cstar\u201d and everything else spins out from that. According to Field, the star is \u201cthe nexus of all that\u2019s cool.\u201d\nComicCon\u2019s David Glanzer said the comic giant purchased WonderCon 10 years ago because of its relaxed, friendly, and intimate atmosphere, as well as its bellweather showcase quality for the comics industry in general. The promoters didn\u2019t want a comic convention to drop from the circuit and consolidating promotions for ComicCon, WonderCon, and the Alternative Press Expo enabled promoters to maintain a full-time staff of 15. He denied rumors that ComicCon was moving, saying they had signed a contract until 2015, and there are no current plans for an international ComicCon.\nAfter blowing out the birthday cake candles, \u201cThe Sergio and Mark Show\u201d heated up with Mad Magazine\u2019s Sergio Aragon\u00e9s and Mark Evanier. Evanier has worked with Aragon\u00e9s on Groo the Wanderer \u201cfor more years than either will admit or can believe.\u201d Dark Horse\u2019s Groo vs. Conan takes place in Groo\u2019s universe, which occasionally includes the naked \u201chealthy, not obscene,\u201d Sergio. According to Evanier, Aragon\u00e9s is the only artist who draws himself looking worse than he really does, \u201cstupid and unattractive.\u201d His 1967 Viva Mad sold more than 1,200,000 copies and Evanier believes that Aragon\u00e9s personally signed every copy ever sold\u2014even Evanier\u2019s mailman has one. The good-natured Aragon\u00e9s is still going Mad, currently working on a \u201cHoarders\u201d strip after watching a televisionmarathon of the same name and becoming depressed. Why? He discovered he too is a hoarder of \u201ccomics, newspapers, and figurines.\u201d His next projects include \u201cA Mad Look at Famous People\u2019s Living Styles\u201d, a national yogurt campaign, and Mad\u2019s TV show for children. Mark Evanier is working on The Garfield Show, appearing on the Cartoon Network (the world\u2019s most watched television show), a new Jack Kirby-inspired comic, and, oddly enough, serves as an expert witness.\nAt the \u201cCreator Rights\u201d panel, Mike Friedrich, Marv Wolfman, Joe Field, Michael Lovitz, and Mark Evanier reminded artists and authors that publishing is a \u201cdog-eat-dog world.\u201d Evanier led off with a quote from the late, great Jack Kirby, \u201cI\u2019ve done about as well as you can do in comics. It ain\u2019t that great.\u201d Newbie authors and writers are especially susceptible because they just want to break into the industry and are willing to allow certain unscrupulous houses (too bad they didn\u2019t name names) to publish a piece, if only for their portfolio. Evanier reminded audience members that there is a thriving market for people who exploit newcomers in the pop culture market, whether it is an unscrupulous publisher or a voice coach. \u201cBeware of unfinanced producers. They should have the money; writers and artists supply the talent.\u201d Lovitz talked about piracy and how it is costing the entertainment industry billions, and while it has been severely curtailed, it is still a huge problem.\nSomething most people don\u2019t know about WonderCon, or ComicCon for that matter, is that there is also an academic side to the halls of popular culture called The Comics Arts Conference. In \u201cLife After Trauma\u2014To Be a Superhero or Supervillain?\u201d the panelists questioned how trauma affects superheroes. Robin Rosenberg (Psychology of Superheroes), Andrea Letamendi (UC San Diego), and Travis Langley (Henderson State University), psychologists all, explored trauma\u2019s effect on superheroes and why most failed to manifest PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). They also looked at why some comic book characters choose to become heroes and others villains. According to Rosenberg, the three traumatic events (large scale, unintended, and personal) sometimes lead to manifestations of PTSD, such as intrusive recollection, or heightened startle response and can be seen in characters like Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne.\nLetamendi asked how reasonable is comic book trauma and concluded that it is \u201cfairly realistic.\u201d One superhero quality, and a psychologically realistic result of trauma, is to continue to put oneself in harm\u2019s way for the greater good, as illustrated by some soldiers in Iraq\u2014Letamendi treats returning soldiers with PTSD. But how do superheroes endure routine daily exposure to violence? Is it resilience? Letamendi points to social support and/or empathy and compassion, think Justice League, and also self-efficacy as illustrated by Bruce Wayne. There is a difference between superheroes who are always \u201con call\u201d and superheroes who get a break from violence like Peter Parker, who can go home after a hard night of web spinning. But what happens when they don\u2019t get a break? Well, for Batman, it depends on who\u2019s writing the comic.\nBut how does trauma transform one into a superhero or a supervillain? Rosenberg points to post-traumatic growth as a catalyst for transformation. This is clearly illustrated by the young Bruce Wayne\u2019s witnessing of his parents\u2019 murder catapulting him into the role of Batman\u2014a warrior against all crime. But even before trauma there is a belief in justice. Tony Stark believes his weapons project keeps world peace, but after his trauma he halts his company\u2019s arms manufacture. Post-trauma individuals believe they are stronger for having survived; they have an increased empathy for others, and an altered philosophy of life (more spiritual, bad things sometimes happen to good people). In other words, Stark finds meaning in life. The trauma progression could be seen as: victim, survivor, superhero\u2026or supervillain. After trauma, supervillians believe life is short, can become greedy, hedonistic, and live life for pure enjoyment.\nTravis Langley reminded the audience that when you reach tragedy or trauma, you have already developed a certain amount of your personality. The Punisher is a sociopath before the mob kills his family and he begins his quest for vengeance. While most superheroes experience the loss of a parent at the hands of criminals, most supervillians lose a parent or guardian to cops, as exhibited by the anti-Batmen: Prometheus, Owlman, and the Wraith. Some \u201cother\u201d has shaped their being, and comics focus on nurture, not nature. It wouldn\u2019t be as fun to say a supervillain has bad genes. On the other hand, you can\u2019t just say it\u2019s either nature or nurture, because it\u2019s both. As Langley says, there isn\u2019t a DSM definition for \u201cEvil Disorder.\u201d There are predictors of long-term criminal behavior, such as preadolescent antisocial actions, lack of empathy, poor problem-solving skills, impulsivity, and fearlessness. But in comics, it\u2019s the traumatic origin that is the standardized storyline.\nSpeaking of disorders, Marvel\u2019s \u201cCup O\u2019Joe\u201d panel featuring Joe Quesada showcased the trailer for the upcoming Captain America, in theaters July 22, 2011. Fear Itself, Marvel\u2019s crossover comic featuring Thor, Spider-Man, Cyclops, Hulk, Captain America, and Iron Man, showcases heroes who come face-to-face with the god of fear, as he spreads dread. Red Skull: Incarnate will explore the Nazi rise to power and how one becomes a villain and is scheduled to coincide with the release of Fear. Hulk versus Dracula will feature a high body count, while Secret Avengers will be unleashed in August. X-Men anime-style has just been released in Japan (see the trailer on Google) featuring a \u201chot\u201d Dark Venus, while there is a 2012 possible return of Runaways. Quesada left the audience wondering if there will be a Runaways television show.\nOne of WonderCon\u2019s highlights was the release of the trailer for The Immortals scheduled to hit theaters on 11/11/11. Immortals, directed by Tarsem Singh (The Fall), stars Henry Cavill (Superman), Luke Evans, and Isabel Lucas. Drew McQueenie moderated the panel. Singh views immortality in two ways: Mortals can do great deeds that will make one immortal or one can spread their seed. For Singh, his movies are his children and he repeatedly reminded the audience that he wanted to stamp his DNA onto as many films as he could. The immortals choose how they want to live, and they would choose to live youthfully. He describes Immortals as \u201cCaravaggio meets Fight Club\u201d and the visuals as a \u201cCaravaggio painting strip, not a comic strip.\u201d 3D works for him because he tends toward tableaus, not Bourne Supremacy-type action. When asked what it was like to direct Mickey Rourke, Singh replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t direct Mickey; he\u2019s a loose cannon with a spear.\u201d Singh\u2019s inspirations, \u201cEverything. Artists\u2014mostly dead, bad TV, porn, and the Discovery Channel.\u201d What\u2019s next? Snow White.\nActor Luke Evans saw Zeus as a father/king and lawgiver\u2014a god with flaws and insecurities alongside lots of other layers. The fight sequences were \u201cvery exhausting, but exciting\u2014they got the adrenaline pumping without any threat of real death.\u201d Henry Cavill wanted to play Theseus as a man, not a demi-god, \u201ca man with a softer side; not too aggressive or angry,\u201d but able to take out the enemy when needed.\nMeanwhile, back in the Exhibit Hall, DC was promoting The Green Hornet alongside Dark Horse, Marvel, and plenty of smaller publishing houses. The fan tables featured some long time greats, including Lou Ferrigno, whose biceps still bulge, and Elvira \u2013 who looks great! Lee Meriwether (Catwoman, Munsters Today) was indulgent of the 50-year-old who gushed, \u201cI loved you in the Batman movie when I was a kid.\u201d Outside Moscone Center, Jaleen\u2019s birthday party featured pseudo-heroes Sarcasto and Mother Superior, as well as others who were having way too much fun being photographed.

If you\u2019ve got a comics fan on your shopping list, there\u2019s a pretty good chance they already own these next two comics\u2026 but if they don\u2019t have \u2018em yet, it\u2019s a fairly sure bet that they want them.\nAlex Ross, a comic-book painter who actually grew up here in Lubbock, has produced a lot of great comics, but these are some of his best.\nMarvels\nRoss exploded onto the comics scene in 1994 with \u201cMarvels,\u201d which focused on a newspaper photographer named Phil Sheldon and his views of Marvel\u2019s superheroes. The comic, written by Kurt Busiek, let Sheldon take a front row seat at battles between the Sub-Mariner and the Human Torch, at the Fantastic Four\u2019s epic battle against Galactus, and at the death of Spider-Man\u2019s girlfriend Gwen Stacy.\nSheldon is a bit of a hero-worshipper \u2014 he\u2019s constantly frustrated by the cynical view most citizens have of superheroes. In the Marvel Universe, superheroes are celebrities, and they get a lot of celebrity media coverage. One week, everyone loves the Fantastic Four and loves the fairy-tale wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm \u2014 the next week, everyone hates \u2018em and thinks they made up the battle against Galactus to boost their Q-ratings. Sheldon sees the heroes, a bit unrealistically, as the greatest, most noble people in the world, and public reaction to heroes drives him up the wall. But he\u2019s also dead terrified of mutants, and in the best chapter of the book, he has to confront his own prejudices about mutants when his daughters meet and befriend a mutant on the run.\nThe artwork Ross produced was certainly a revelation for folks used to normal comic book art. There\u2019s no painted-on spandex here \u2014 the clothing is realistically rendered, with wrinkles, folds, and everything. Faces are just gorgeous, expressive and realistic. And the lighting \u2014 Ross understands light sources, and some of his most beautiful paintings \u2014 the Silver Surfer reflecting blasts of fire, mutant-hunting Sentinels hovering over a city at night, Dr. Octopus sitting in a dim jail cell \u2014 are so striking solely because he uses lighting effectively and dramatically.\n\u201cMarvels\u201d is available in softcover \u2014 you should be able to pick it up at your friendly neighborhood comic shop or at your average chain bookstore for about twenty bucks.\nKingdom Come\nAfter \u201cMarvels,\u201d DC really wanted to get Ross on board for a miniseries of their own. So they got him to collaborate with Mark Wait to produce 1996\u2032s \u201cKingdom Come.\u201d Where \u201cMarvels\u201d was rooted in Marvel\u2019s early comics, \u201cKingdom Come\u201d focused on a possible apocalyptic future for DC\u2019s heroes. About 20 years in the future, Superman and other superheroes retire as more violent heroes start to take over. The Spectre, foreseeing the end of the world coming soon, takes Norman McCay, a minister (based on Ross\u2019s own father), as his human anchor to help him view the final days and render his judgment.\nJust about everyone in the DCU gets some major changes \u2014 Batman has to wear an exoskeleton to move, the Flash is a constantly moving blur, Hawkman is a bird-human hybrid, Captain Marvel has been brainwashed by Lex Luthor, etc., etc. The forces are divided between multiple different factions, including Superman\u2019s Justice League, the new violent superheroes, Lex Luthor\u2019s Mankind Liberation Front, and a few others. Every step, no matter how well intentioned, moves everyone closer to the metahuman war prophesied to destroy the world.\n\u201cMarvels\u201d is the book with the stronger emotional impact, but \u201cKingdom Come\u201d is all about epic, world-shattering action. I always find myself comparing it to epic, big-budget, widescreen action movies.\n\u201cKingdom Come\u201d is also available in softcover. It\u2019ll set you back about 15 bones.\nAnd if you\u2019d like something a bit more traditionally Christmasy, you might try to track this next one down.\nSuperman: Peace on Earth\nThis is an oversized coffee-table book about Superman trying, with only limited success, to feed all the hungry people in the world. It\u2019s basically a great big, lushly painted Christmas card. Unfortunately, it\u2019s out of print right now, so there\u2019s not much of a chance of you being able to buy this one before the holidays are over.\nIf you can find \u2018em, go pick \u2018em up.\n"}, {"score": 159.2181, "uuid": "2bb2e300-a8a5-5e66-9d39-68a5a921a71f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-06-28461", "target_hostname": "www.fascinationplace.org", "target_uri": "http://www.fascinationplace.org/tag/salvation-run/", "page_rank": 1.2067961e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Salvation Run &laquo; Fascination Place", "snippet": "<em>Who</em> has <em>Superman</em> fought before?

This entry is for comic books I bought the week of 14 November 2007:\nAll-Star Superman #9, by Grant Morrison & Frank Quitely ( DC )\nBooster Gold #4, by Geoff Johns, Jeff Katz, Dan Jurgens & Norm Rapmund (DC)\nCountdown to Final Crisis #24 of 52 (backwards), by Paul Dini, Justin Gray, Jimmy Palmiotti, Tom Derenick & Wayne Faucher (DC)\nFables #67, by Bill Willingham, Mark Buckingham & Steve Leialoha (DC)\nSalvation Run #1 of 7, by Bill Willingham, Sean Chen & Waldon Wong (DC)\nSuicide Squad: Raise the Flag #3 of 8, by John Ostrander, Javier Pina & Robin Riggs (DC)\nWelcome to Tranquility #12, by Gail Simone & Neil Googe (DC/Wildstorm)\nNova #8, by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning Wellington Alves & Scott Hanna ( Marvel )\nThor #4, by J.

These days it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s a Countdown tie-in (like this) and what\u2019s not (like Countdown to Adventure and Countdown to Mystery, whose lead stories both have nothing to do with Countdown). Score another one for DC editorial in the ongoing fiasco that is Countdown.\nAnyway, Salvation Run is loosely based on a decade-old idea by George R. R. Martin , which \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 has nothing to do with my decision to pick it up. No, instead I was mainly interested in the artwork of Sean Chen (who\u2019s art is the reason I started picking up Nova), and I figured the sardonic writing of Bill Willingham (Fables) might work well with the book\u2019s premise, that being that the United States gets tired of all the super-villains stealing, killing, and generally disrupting society, so it decides to start shipping the repeat offenders out to an alien world, to fend for themselves. A world full of super-villains is sure to be a powderkeg \u2013 especially since most villains tend to be men \u2013 and the moral question of exiling villains to another world seems worth exploring. Anyway, there seems to be a lot of promise here.\nThe first issue is okay. Chen\u2019s artwork is dynamic but not as detailed as I think it\u2019s been in the past. The story mainly focuses on the Flash\u2019s rogues gallery surviving on the world for some weeks \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty hostile and bizarre place \u2013 before meeting up with a large number of second-string villains who have just arrived (plus the Joker). The issue ends with the hint that someone\u2019s been tricked in this whole setup, but leaves open the question of why.\nSo it seems worth following for a 7-issue run, but I hope they do something worthwhile with it. I suspect it would have worked better in Martin\u2019s original Elseworlds configuration.\nMan, does Nova have some of the blandest covers in comics these days? I mean, the renderings by Adi Granov are pretty good, but the designs are bo-ring! (I assume these are designs created by editorial and not by Granov.) If they actually reflected the contents of the book, I think they could really help sales.\nAnyway, in the wake of his ill-considered Annihilation Conquest storyline, Nova has ended up at the edge of the universe \u2013 literally. Unable to escape, he ends up being stranded on a giant space station, which seems nearly deserted except for a few extremely powerful \u2013 and somewhat crazed \u2013 super-beings, and a talking Russian dog, Cosmo. Cosmo gets the best line of the series so far: \u201cYou have seen end of universe and met space zombies, and talkink dog is what freaks you out? Bozshe moi.\u201d\nSo there\u2019s something nasty going on on this space station, the station itself has a surprising nature, besides being outside the edge of the universe, and Nova\u2019s powers are significantly diminished because the Worldmind that powers him is still spending most of its energy fighting off the Phalanx\u2019s techno-virus. Our hero looks to be in for a rough time \u2013 which means this book ought to be back on track now that Nova\u2019s not dealing with the conquest, which he wasn\u2019t really participating in meaningfully anyway.\nThor is now officially combining the world elements of J. Michael Straczynski\u2019s comic book writing: Not only is the story moving at a glacial pace, as Thor gradually tries to reconstruct Asgard, but it\u2019s got Straczynski\u2019s tedious tendency to try to highlight real-world problems through a brief encounter by his larger-than-life protagonist. In this case, Donald Blake goes to a war-torn African nation and ends up in the middle of a civil war. Ya-a-awn. This book went horribly wrong when it became a \u201cvisit a problem area somewhere in the world\u201d travelogue, and I\u2019m rapidly running out of confidence that Straczynski can salvage it. Honestly, there\u2019s just not much story here. Coipel\u2019s art is still pretty, though.\nWell, I was a little off in my prediction of how World War Hulk would end , but it\u2019s still be a fun ride \u2013 a big smash-fest. There was a nifty little surprise regarding what exactly happened to send the Hulk back to Earth looking for revenge, and the Hulk comes to a certain closure at the end of the story. It basically ended the way it had to, but of course this being a superhero comic it\u2019s not really the end. We\u2019ll get back to the status quo sometime.\nI do wish that this book had been used to show Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic how wrong they\u2019d been in their treatment of the Hulk and that they were on the wrong end of the Civil War, but Marvel is inexplicably committed to casting two of their long-standing heroes in the roles of villains, so that was clearly too much to hope for. Oh well.\nThe Black Dossier is the third volume in Alan Moore and Kevin O\u2019Neill\u2019s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series, and it\u2019s easily the worst one to date. The problem is that there\u2019s not much story in it, and what there is is both dull and not much fun.\nVolume 1 was the best volume to date, because it seemed primarily inspired by the Justice League, assembling a group of 19th century heroes to tackle a threat. The characters and setting made it very different from a Justice League story, but it still had a solid narrative with a lot of tension and a concrete resolution. It also had a lot of little asides referring to other Victoriana, but they were just bonuses and not central to the story.\nVolume 2 was enjoyable, but was a big step down from Volume 1. The core idea of the League dealing with H.G. Wells\u2019 Martian invasion was nifty, but it took a turn into the no-fun zone with its rather explicit sex and its brutal resolution. Plus, while the first volume had a text backup story featuring Alan Quatermain, Wells\u2019 time machine, and some H.P. Lovecraft creatures, this volume had a very self-indulgent and tedious travelogue of the League\u2019s world, filled with lots of references to extremely obscure people and places. Little bits of it were entertaining, but mostly it didn\u2019t really add anything.\nThe Black Dossier goes for the clever references in spades, with extended text sequences featuring characters like Orlando, Fanny Hill, and various other historical background for the League. And most of that stuff is very, very boring, not least because this is supposed to be a graphic novel, and nothing takes the edge off a graphic novel like throwing big blocks of text into it. Honestly, I didn\u2019t even read the bulk of the text sections for that very reason. Snooze. I agree with Johanna Carlson\u2019s observation that the book feels too much like homework much of the time, and that\u2019s no fun. It feels very self-indulgent.\nThe core story involved Allan Quatermain and Mina Murray \u2013 who have both become young again \u2013 capturing the Black Dossier from post-Big Brother Britain (the 1950s) so they can learn just how much their government knows about what they\u2019ve been up to for the last decade or two. The Dossier contains the backstory of the League dating back for centuries, and it is reproduced within the main story and accounts for the text segments of the book. The main story has its moments mainly as our heroes are pursued by James Bond, Hugo Drummond and Emma Peel as they try to escape from Britain, but the end of the book is extremely disappointing, making the whole thing feel rather pointless.\nI wonder whether this will be the last LoeG book. It\u2019s hard to imagine the series getting much worse from here, though another festival of clever references would probably do the trick. The series has fallen an awful long way from its promising beginnings, so I can\u2019t say it would be a great loss if this is the last installment. This was pretty mediocre stuff.\nAnyway, if unlike me you really enjoy all the references \u2013 obscure or otherwise \u2013 Jess Nevins has posted his annotations for the book so that should keep you busy for a while. I think the joke is long past its sell-by date, personally.\nLeave a comment\nRecent Comments\nSubrata Sircar in Before Watchmen : I saw the ads and was nonplussed.

Presumably this relaunch is being explained in story terms due to the current event series Flashpoint, in which the DC Universe as we know it has been altered into a twisted version of itself, and that the untwisting will cause everything to be different.\nAs a longtime reader of DC Comics, I don\u2019t have a strong reaction to this. My first thought is, \u201cThis is what they should have done in 1986 after Crisis on Infinite Earths!\u201d In 1986 I was reading almost every title that DC printed (I was also 17 years old), and would have been very excited if they\u2019d done something like this. (I\u2019ve heard that they considered it but that editorial got cold feet and couldn\u2019t pull the trigger.) 25 years later, this feels like little more than a gimmick, one tacked on to what was originally pushed as a Flash-centric event series. Now it feels like Flashpoint was just a means to reboot the continuity, which feels like it cheapens the story.\n(I wonder if DC was emboldened to make this move by the success of 2009\u2032s Star Trek film, which did the same thing for that franchise.)\nIt also makes the next few months worth of DC Universe titles feel irrelevant, too. J. Michael Straczynski \u2013 who has recently been pilloried for leaving the Superman and Wonder Woman titles in mid-story \u2013 had words in a similar vein on his Facebook fan page :\nSo I felt confident that it was coming soon (which is one reason why I felt there wouldn\u2019t be a problem in the long run leaving the monthly books, since most of the things done in Superman and Wonder Woman would be erased by the reboot anyway, so ultimately it didn\u2019t matter whether I stayed or left). I just couldn\u2019t say anything at the time because I wanted to respect Dan\u2019s privacy and his desire to do what he thought was right when he thought it was right to do it.\nSuperman and Wonder Woman are wrapping up major story arcs, the three Green Lantern titles are in the middle of a major crossover story, \u201cWar of the Green Lanterns\u201d, the Batman status quo has been upset by Grant Morrison\u2019s Batman Inc. set-up, and various developments have occurred due to Brightest Day. Now, all of these stories may have been good reads in their own right, but for people who care about the ongoing story developments, that means that everything that happened in them will now be swept away?\nThat\u2019s another way in which events like this support my maxim that \u201ca good jumping-on point for new readers is a good jumping-off point for old readers.\u201d I\u2019ve been losing interest in the Green Lantern titles since the plot has been getting ever-more grandiose and the character elements are vanishing, so this makes the reboot an excellent time for me to drop those books.\nAs far as whether I\u2019ll buy any of the new first issues, what I usually do is follow the creators: I\u2019ll buy the books by writers I like (and artists I really like, although even the presence of George P\u00e9rez wasn\u2019t enough to persuade me to buy the Flashpoint tie-in mini-series Secret Seven this week), and probably pass on the rest unless the premise of one sounds unusually interesting. But I\u2019m not going to pick up, say, a new Hawkman or Aquaman series just because. Of the first ten series announced , I might pick up Firestorm (Gail Simone, Yildiray Cinar), but that\u2019s about it (I\u2019ll stay far away from Flash, as I cannot stand Francis Manapul\u2019s art these days).\nI\u2019ll also likely pass on the previously-announced Justice League title by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee, as I\u2019m not really a fan of Lee\u2019s art, and I find Johns\u2019 writing to be increasingly pedestrian these days. (Johns and Lee on Justice League is about twenty steps down from Kurt Busiek and George P\u00e9rez on Avengers a decade ago.) Honestly the only books Johns has written that really stand out in my mind are his first Flash run (with Scott Kolins and Howard Porter), and his Booster Gold run.\nSo my reaction to all of this on the creative side is basically one of \u201cwhatever\u201d. When they announce that Ed Brubaker or Kurt Busiek or Mark Waid or a writer I similarly admire is writing one of the new titles, then I\u2019ll be excited. Otherwise it\u2019s just more superhero comics, reboot or no reboot.\nIf they\u2019re really going to relaunch the industry\u2019s long-standing titles \u2013 Action Comics and Detective Comics \u2013 with new first issues, that\u2019s a little sad (Action just hit #900, and it\u2019d be neat to see it hit #1000 in about 8 years without ever going through a numbering change), but I have no doubt that many books will revert to their historical numbering for their next major milestone issues (et tu FF, n\u00e9e Fantastic Four?).\nBuried in the announcements \u2013 but called out by a few bloggers \u2013 was the parallel announcement that DC would be releasing new comics digitally on the same day of the print release . (For some reason they\u2019re calling this \u201cdigital day-and-date\u201d, which must be some term I\u2019ve just not heard before, but it sure sounds stupid. \u201cDay and date\u201d? What would \u201cday or date\u201d be? What about just \u201cday\u201d? They couldn\u2019t call it \u201csame day\u201d or \u201csimultaneous digital release\u201d or something clearer?) This makes various people happy or mad depending (as far as I can tell) on their take on whether digital comics indicate the impending doom of print comics or not, and whether they think that\u2019s a good thing.\nI have little interest in digital comics myself, though I expect that over the next 20 years or so we\u2019ll see the monthly comic industry (mostly) die in favor of digital comics. Whether I\u2019ll go along to the new medium I don\u2019t know \u2013 I probably will, although I\u2019ll likely still prefer print comics (after all, I know I\u2019ll be able to read print comics in 40 years; whether any particular digital format will still be supported then, who can say?). It is interesting to see DC so fully embracing digital comics; whether their major competitors other than Marvel can keep up will be a good question, since if this move spells death for any of Dark Horse, Image, IDW, and the like, that\u2019s a good thing for DC. It\u2019s a bad thing for readers, of course. Though there\u2019s plenty of innovation going on in the really small presses, not to mention in the webcomics community, arguably more than we see from any of the major comics companies, so for people like me motivated to seek out good reading material, I\u2019m sure it will always be out there. Just in a different form \u2013 and maybe not from your local comics shop.\nUltimately, I think that where printed reading material is concerned, we really are entering a singularity: I don\u2019t think anyone can truly say what the book and comic industries will look like in 20 years. Maybe it\u2019ll be all digital, maybe it\u2019ll be mostly digital with a smattering of print companies and stores mostly for collectors (this is my guess), maybe the digital and print industries will coexist in similar sizes and compete with each other. 20 years is a long way out, and we\u2019re at the very beginning of the transition. But I would not be at all surprised to see 50% or more comic book stores go out of business within 10 years. (Sad, but not surprised.)\nLots of people are predictably cynical about this. I\u2019m trying to be realistic rather than cynical (although I am cynical where DC\u2019s editorial direction is concerned; annual crossover events tend to do that to me). Ryan , the owner of the comic shop I go to, Comics Conspiracy , is pretty excited, though, and is a bit disappointed in some of his fellow retailers:\nPeople fear change. People especially fear change that threatens to disrupt their livelihood. I bet a few retailers would say that Ryan is a brave man to embrace it.\nI agree with Ryan that the reboot is a big opportunity for retailers \u2013 but in the short term. I can also understand Brian Hibbs\u2019 reaction , which seems centered around \u201cHoly crap! 52 first issues in one month?\u201d But this is an opportunity to try to bring in some new readers in the back third of 2011. After that, though, I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence in DC to be able to actually take their line anywhere, or let their better creators follow through on their own visions. DC\u2019s been flitting from crossover event to crossover event for a decade now, and the company has seemed to just be meandering around like some kid with ADD in a store full of shiny objects. Will anyone care about the reboot a year from now? Will it have made any difference? How about 2 years from now?\nThe long-term aspect of this announcement is how digital downloads will change the industry \u2013 and the publishers\u2019 dispositions to the direct market \u2013 over the next decade. That\u2019s where the big changes are going to come. And whether that will be a golden opportunity for retailers remains to be seen.\n"}, {"score": 158.10709, "uuid": "5e0f0a37-43f3-517e-8f65-00aaa94852ad", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1904wb-90-13405", "target_hostname": "lawandthemultiverse.com", "target_uri": "http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2011/04/", "page_rank": 3.3734575e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "April | 2011 | Law and the Multiverse", "snippet": "But <em>Superman</em> renouncing his citizenship <em>is</em> a little more complicated than you <em>or</em> I doing so.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted on April 11, 2011 by Ryan Davidson | 17 Comments\nWe looked at She-Hulk # 1 last week. Moving on to issue # 2, She-Hulk is plaintiff\u2019s counsel for Dan \u201cDanger-Man\u201d Jermain, given atomic powers as part of an industrial accident. Mr. Jermain wants to sue his former employer for \u201cbodily injury,\u201d despite the fact that the only effects seem to be that he is \u201clarger, stronger, and more powerful.\u201d Okay, he\u2019s also capable of causing small nuclear explosions, but hey, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to hurt him any. Defense counsel points out the fact that one needs to stretch the definition of bodily injury way past the bounds of credulity to include imbuing someone with superpowers. She-Hulk thinks she can get around it by arguing that \u201cDanger-Man\u201d and \u201cDan Jermain\u201d are actually two separate entities, and that the latter ceased to exist when the former came into being. When asked \u201cDo you really think this will work?\u201d she responds \u201cI think I can sell it to a jury.\u201d\nThere are a number of problems here, so let\u2019s take a look.\nI. Workers Compensation\nFirst, whatever happened to workers\u2019 compensation ? The rise of the Industrial Era was accompanied by the rise of workplace injuries, as people started working around machines more often, sometimes incredibly dangerous ones. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was commonplace for factory workers to lose fingers, even limbs, to exposed machinery. Legal reforms favoring labor began in the late nineteenth century, and by 1949, every state and the federal government had instituted a workers\u2019 compensation regime.\nWorkers\u2019 compensation operates by creating a system for compensating workers for workplace injuries regardless of fault. What this means is that if you are injured while serving your employer, you get paid the vast majority of the time, even if your employer was completely without fault. This may seem very favorable to the workers, so to even things out, i.e. to make sure that employers weren\u2019t bankrupted every time someone broke an arm, compensation was limited in three ways.\nFirst, compensation for injuries is computed based on actuarial tables created by state agencies rather than by juries. This rationalizes and limits compensation. Whereas a jury can award a basically arbitrary amount of money, workers\u2019 compensation payouts are known ahead of time and are thus a lot easier to plan for and insure. Second, compensation is limited to purely economic damages, i.e. medical bills, lost wages, lost future earnings, etc. There is very little provision for non-economic damages like \u201cpain and suffering,\u201d which really drive up verdicts in liability cases. Third, workers\u2019 compensation is an exclusive remedy, i.e. employees cannot choose to forgo participation in the workers\u2019 compensation program and sue their employers. Workers\u2019 compensation is their only way to recover. So employees benefit because they almost always get paid, even if the accident was their fault, and they usually get paid in a fraction of the amount of time they\u2019d have to wait if they sued. But employers benefit because their costs are controlled and employees can\u2019t turn around and sue them. Workers\u2019 compensation coverage is mandatory in just about every state for just about every employee. There are, of course, certain exceptions, but a worker in an industrial plant working with radioactive materials, e.g. Dan Jermain, would definitely be covered.\nSo what happened to Roxxon\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier? How is Jermain able to sue at all? Sure, GLK&H might act as plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the workers\u2019 compensation case (coverage can be disputed, leading to litigation, but this is much\u00a0simpler than suing in open court), but workers\u2019 compensation is largely limited to economic damages. Danger-Man is basically uninjured, and even if we want to go with She-Hulk\u2019s argument and say that Dan Jermain is \u201cdead,\u201d (more on that in a minute), workers\u2019 compensation only pays out a couple of hundred grand\u2014at best\u2014for wrongful death. Not $85 million, which is the settlement reached at the end of the issue.\nOf course, the whole issue goes away if Jermain wasn\u2019t an employee. If the writers had him be some random schmo who happened to get in a wreck with a Roxxon tanker truck, covering him in radioactive goo, he would not be covered by the workers\u2019 compensation regime and thus would be free to sue like he does in the comic. Oh well.\nII. Questions of Law v. Questions of Fact\nNow we\u2019re going to get really nit-picky. She-Hulk says that she thinks she can \u201csell\u201d Dan Jermain\u2019s death to a jury. Unfortunately, whether or not \u201cDan Jermain\u201d legally died during the accident is probably not a question of fact . Nor is whether giving someone superpowers counts as \u201cbodily injury\u201d. These would be questions of law . The difference is, in part, who gets to answer such questions and the basis for answering them.\nQuestions of fact are answered by the finder of fact, generally the jury, though judges are the finders of fact in bench trials . Questions of fact are answered on the basis of the evidence. The questions of fact here would be things like \u201cWhat are the nature and extent of Dan Jermain\u2019s injuries?\u201d \u201cWhat caused those injuries?\u201d \u201cDid Roxxon\u2019s negligence lead to Jermain\u2019s injuries?\u201d \u201cDid Jermain\u2019s?\u201d She-Hulk would try to get these questions answered in her favor by investigating the scene of the accident, having experts evaluate Jermain\u2019s condition, deposing witnesses, etc.\nQuestions of law are answered by the judge on the basis of the law alone. The questions of law here include \u201cDo Jermain\u2019s symptoms constitute \u2018bodily injury\u2019 under the law?\u201d \u201cIs \u2018Danger-Man\u2019 legally the same entity as Dan Jermain?\u201d \u201cIs Dan Jermain legally dead?\u201d These questions would be answered by looking at existing legal precedent to see what it says about the definitions of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cdeath,\u201d and seeing if the facts, when interpreted in the light most favorable to Roxxon, can be made to fit the legal definitions she needs.\nHere we\u2019ve got some problems. \u201cBodily injury\u201d is generally understood to be a bad thing. Federal law defines it as\n(A) a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, or disfigurement;\n(B) physical pain;\n(D) impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or\n(E) any other injury to the body, no matter how temporary.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(h)(4)\nWhether or not Danger-Man\u2019s condition counts as any of those is going to be a question of law for the court. And it\u2019s not entirely clear that it does. He hasn\u2019t been cut, abraded, bruised, burned, or disfigured, at least not in any way shown in the comics. He doesn\u2019t appear to be in any pain, nor to have experienced any as part of the process. Superpowers probably don\u2019t constitute an \u201cillness,\u201d though there may be something there, especially if the powers can\u2019t be controlled. He does not appear to be suffering any impairment of his bodily functions or mental faculties. And calling superpowers \u201cinjuries,\u201d when they don\u2019t fit into any of the other definitions, is a stretch, to say the least. Given that Jermain can do just about everything he could before the accident, and can do a lot more now, this is going to be a tough sell.\nThough there is another claim that the authors seem to have forgotten: loss of consortium . This is a claim for loss of the affection and companionship of a family member, typically a spouse, and typically a particular kind of companionship, if you catch our meaning. Jermain seems to have been affected in a substantial way, here. Even sharing a bed with his wife is physically dangerous for her. That\u2019s the kind of change in a relationship that a jury might well be willing to award damages for.\nIII: Conclusion\nThere was more legal meat in this one. Missing the difference between questions of law and questions of fact is understandable, though. That one even trips up experienced attorneys from time to time, as the two can blend into each other pretty easily (so-called \u2018mixed questions of law and fact\u2019). So we\u2019ll give them a pass on that one. But missing the workers\u2019 compensation angle was a pretty big mistake. Even most laymen are at least aware of workers\u2019 compensation, even if they aren\u2019t entirely aware of how it works. \u00a0Maybe we can chalk this one up to most comic book authors and illustrators rarely making use of workers\u2019 compensation; comic book publishers are not exactly hotbeds of industrial accidents. Still, all they\u2019d need to do is change a single panel, making the plaintiff a bystander instead of an employee, and the rest of the story is more-or-less okay.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 157.38889, "uuid": "76498478-7261-5590-8aaf-5087eb599436", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1713wb-30-28137", "target_hostname": "www.zanaducomics.com", "target_uri": "http://www.zanaducomics.com/statues/single-gallery/14205543", "page_rank": 1.1954739e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Zanadu Comics - Shop for Statues - White Queen Emma Frost Diamond", "snippet": "originalSize=true&quot;, &quot;Earth X: <em>Hulk</em> and Banner Bust&quot;, &quot;Designed and painted by Alex Ross\\nSculpted by Joe Devito\\nBigger <em>is</em> not only better, it\\&#x27;s way better!

I\u2019ve had the pleasure of seeing it and, while it\u2019s not quite perfect, it does a deft job of managing the ingredients from five different solo films and blending them into one fairly coherent narrative. It\u2019s a big event, and it has sparked a considerable amount of on-line discussion and anticipation.\nArguably the most interesting piece comes from Tom Hiddleston himself. The young British actor earned a lot of praise for his portrayal of Loki last year, and he brings a certain grace a less nuanced portrayal of the character in The Avengers. Writing for The Guardian, Hiddleston has made a very strong and heartfelt argument against those who would dismiss superhero cinema, suggesting that the superhero narrative is the spiritual descendent of the ancient myths and legends.\nIt\u2019s a very good piece , but here are some highlights:\nBig talk for someone in a silly superhero film, I hear you say. But superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out. Ancient societies had anthropomorphic gods: a huge pantheon expanding into centuries of dynastic drama; fathers and sons, martyred heroes, star-crossed lovers, the deaths of kings \u2013 stories that taught us of the danger of hubris and the primacy of humility. It\u2019s the everyday stuff of every man\u2019s life, and we love it. It sounds cliched, but superheroes can be lonely, vain, arrogant and proud. Often they overcome these human frailties for the greater good. The possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we have to earn it.\nThe Hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive consequences, its consuming fire. There\u2019s not a soul on this earth who hasn\u2019t wanted to \u201cHulk smash\u201d something in their lives. And when the heat of rage cools, all that we are left with is shame and regret. Bruce Banner, the Hulk\u2019s humble alter ego, is as appalled by his anger as we are. That other superhero Bruce \u2013 Wayne \u2013 is the superhero-Hamlet: a brooding soul, misunderstood, alone, for ever condemned to avenge the unjust murder of his parents. Captain America is a poster boy for martial heroism in military combat: the natural leader, the war hero. Spider-Man is the eternal adolescent \u2013 Peter Parker\u2019s arachnid counterpart is an embodiment of his best-kept secret \u2013 his independent thought and power.\nThis is by no means an original idea. Stan Lee has confessed to thinking something similar when he coopted Thor from Norse mythology into the Marvel Universe. Hell, it\u2019s hard to deny the influence of mythic figures on the creation of Superman. \u201cJust as other genres of comics have appropriated existing narrative mythologies (the Wild West, anthropomorphism, horror),\u201d Richard Reynolds explains at the start of the third chapter of Super Heroes: A Modern Mythology, \u201cso Seigel and Shuster created Superman from existing material already to hand: the myths of Samson, Hercules and so on.\u201d\nThere are cynics out there would decry this connection as a desperate attempt at sophistication from a very childish genre, an attempt to justify an adult interest in grown men in tights knocking the stuffing out of one another. Some might even argue that Hiddleston, an indie darling for roles in films like Deep Blue Sea, is trying to explain a decision to \u201csell out\u201d by appearing in a gigantic big-budget epic.\nI can\u2019t help but find that idea a little offensive. After all, Hiddleston opens the piece by telling a story. Apparently Christopher Reeve was mocked by his fellow thespians for taking a role in Richard Donner\u2019s Superman. Lalla Ward recalls with a sense of impish glee the fact that Patrick Stewart used to make fun of the Doctor Who actors when he worked at RADA . It\u2019s interesting how elitish and snobbish people can get about such things, and I do feel very sorry for Hiddleston if any of his colleagues believe that a well-played role somehow diminishes him in the eyes of his peers.\nBut still, Hiddleston raises some interesting points about the nature of the superhero stories that we tell. If you accept his argument, The Avengers represents the first time that we\u2019ve truly captured a \u201cpantheon\u201d on screen together. (I\u2019d be reluctant to consider the X-Men, if only because Wolverine is perhaps the only member known outside the team itself.) It\u2019s interesting to look at many of the iconic comic characters as the spiritual descendents of these mythic figures :\nMarvel Comics\u2019 The Mighty Thor, really is the Norse God of myth but with superhero updates.\nCaptain Marvel has powers which are gifts from mythical gods and heroes every time he utters the magic word SHAZAM (an acronym for names of the gods he derives power from, wisdom from Solomon, strength from Hercules, stamina from Atlas, power from Zeus, courage from Achilles and speed from Mercury). His origin is that of a young boy, Billy Batson meeting a divine personage (drawn to look like the ancient of days from children\u2019s Christian catechism books) who names him his successor and grants him the power of the gods to \u2018right wrongs and crush evil everywhere\u2019. One could even suggest that in his origin story, Captain Marvel, by taking over from the aged (senile?) mythic personage that he is taking over the mythic mantle for his age. The superheroes of Namor, Aquaman, Flash and Hawkman are just some examples of modern mythic figures derived from past gods and legends. The Flash is a derivative of the Greco-Roman gods of Hermes/Mercury while Hawkman can be likened to the bird-headed Egyptian gods of Horus and Ra and the Greek story of Icarus. Namor and Aquaman, created by Marvel and DC comics respectively, could be said to have taken over the role of Poseidon/Neptune. Aquaman is \u2018King of the Seven Seas\u2019, the undisputed ruler of Earth\u2019s oceans and its inhabitants.\nI have to say, I\u2019m quite attached to the idea, suggested above that the SHAZAM origin story represents the passing of the torch from the old gods to the new gods. It\u2019s a topic that has been explored at length, and is something of a cornerstone of the work of Grant Morrison, who even released a recent book titled Supergods. The writer even hosted a discussion with Deepak Chopra about the idea of the super-hero-as-modern myth at a recent Comic Con .\nThere are, of course, those who reject the central idea, either dismissing it as pretentious twaddle or finding serious logical flaws with the argument. Some would argue that this position ignores the original purpose of these stories and legends :\nThe biggest flaw of the \u201csuperhero as myth\u201d argument is its confusion of the myth\u2019s form for its function. Myths and superhero fiction may share the feature of being allegorical stories, but the contexts in which they serve as extended metaphors are entirely different. Beyond the entertainment inherent in the telling of myths, myths were primarily used by pre-industrial societies to provide magical/mystical explanations for naturally-occurring and even historical events (for want of better interpretations). Superhero narratives serve no such function in the post-industrial, post-atomic, Information Age, where scientific knowledge and a more refined understanding of politics, economics, and history have largely supplanted magical, mystical, and fantastical accountings for the origin of real-world phenomena.\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m convinced by such logic. It seems like a fairly rigid definition of what a myth must be \u2013 that it must explain some natural aspect of the world that is beyond our comprehension. That\u2019s not to suggest it isn\u2019t true \u2013 for example, the Greeks believed that the Titan Atlas held up the sky or the Inuit people believed that the moon god chases the sun goddess around the planet. But it does seem like an overly specific definition.\nWhat natural truths, for example, does the myth of King Arthur teach us? Or the legend of Robin Hood? Neither story exists to rationalise a scientific principle that our ancestors failed to understand. Of course, those tales tell us something about ourselves and the world we occupy, but it doesn\u2019t need to explain a physical proof. I think there\u2019s a lot of writing to support such an assumption :\nMyths are stories that are based on tradition. Some may have factual origins, while others are completely fictional. But myths are more than mere stories and they serve a more profound purpose in ancient and modern cultures. Myths are sacred tales that explain the world and man\u2019s experience. Myths are as relevant to us today as they were to the ancients. Myths answer timeless questions and serve as a compass to each generation. The myths of lost paradise, for example, give people hope that by living a virtuous life, they can earn a better life in the hereafter. The myths of a golden age give people hope that there are great leaders who will improve their lives. The hero\u2019s quest is a model for young men and women to follow, as they accept adult responsibilities. Some myths simply reassure, such as myths that explain natural phenomena as the actions of gods, rather than arbitrary events of nature.\nIf you look at it through that lens, I think it\u2019s a lot easier to understand how superheroes constitute such a mythology. Everybody recognises Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America. And, regardless of whether they watch the films or read the comics, people can relate the moral at the core of each. Batman is the spirit of urban vengeance, provoked by the murder of a child\u2019s parents. Spider-Man is the weak suddenly given power and trusted to use it responsibly. The X-Men are the disenfranchised that sit at the cusp of society, victim to petty prejudice and hatred.\nThese stories evoke basic archetypes and ideals, all tweaked for modern living. There\u2019s a reason that everybody knows \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d, even if it\u2019s not quite what Stan said. Such a lesson might not have been too important in the era before individual rights, but it is very important now. Similarly, the X-Men represent a post-Civil Rights cautionary tale about how we treat people different than ourselves. Such a moral would not have been deemed essential to most cultures a century or two ago, but it\u2019s indispensable to ours.\nThere is another argument that rejects this comparison, and it is probably a stronger one. Perhaps best stated by Alan Moore, the argument suggests that myths generally have endings, which conventional superhero stories lack by virtue of being serialised monthly adventures. Such a simple premise was at the heart of Moore\u2019s rejected Twilight of the Superheroes pitch, which proposed to close the DC mythology :\nMoore recognizes that superheroes, while arguably our modern mythological\u00a0 characters, usually lack mythological resonance in the actual stories because\u00a0 superhero stories rarely have an end. He cites DKR as one of the few that has\u00a0 this resonance because it does provide an end to Superman and Batman, while at\u00a0the same time making it irrelevant whether any creators after Miller ever\u00a0actually fill in the gaps to make DKR the \u201creal\u201d, in-continuity end to Superman and Batman after all. It doesn\u2019t matter.\nIt\u2019s a fair point. After all, most people would be familiar with the story of King Arthur\u2019s death, with Excalibur and the Lady in the Lake. Robin Hood apparently fired off an arrow to mark the spot where he would die. We know how Achilles died, despite the stories of his heroism. There are stories that are open-ended (for example, the Inuit story of the moon chasing the sun), but it\u2019s generally a fair point.\nThis is probably why stories like Kingdom Come or Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow? or (most obviously) The Dark Knight Returns have endured as essential superhero reading. Brian Michael Bendis has described how Frank Miller\u2019s last Batman tale \u201cbecame continuity through sheer force of will.\u201d\nI\u2019ll accept that this is perhaps a flaw in the argument, even if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fatal one \u2013 at least not yet. These myths are still being written and are still calcifying. While the origins have ingrained themselves on the public imagination, there\u2019s still room for more to happen. Besides, I tend to think that, like the stories of figures like Hercules, most casual members of the public are more familiar with the figures and what they represent than in any individual stories featuring them.\nIt\u2019s an interesting and fascinating argument, and it\u2019s great that Hiddleston provoked it. I do hope that people will read the article with an open mind, because it does offer an interesting reading of conventional superhero narratives, outlining the role that they play in our shared public imagination.\nShare this:\n"}, {"score": 153.05702, "uuid": "ceb5ad80-043b-5a1d-96b5-c89655d15fc0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0205wb-79-16207", "target_hostname": "www.movies.com", "target_uri": "http://www.movies.com/movie-news/39the-dark-knight-rises39-countdown-batman39s-got-you-covered/6165", "page_rank": 1.2311627e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "'The Dark Knight Rises' Countdown: Batman's Got You Covered | Movie", "snippet": "The artist <em>is</em> the highly talented and humanistic penciler Gary Frank (Incredible <em>Hulk</em>, Action Comics).

As Jett explained at BOF, with all due respect to Collider, he didn\u2019t want to run with it on BOF because he questioned the factual accuracy of their report. Last week, on January 2nd, Collider issued a retraction to their original piece, getting confirmation from IMAX themselves. They stated, \u201cI feel it\u2019s important to own up to your mistakes rather than just forget about them. I\u2019m sorry for any confusion.\u201d\nThis is a perfectly understandable mistake and one that Collider is to be commended for rectifying. The debate about Bane\u2019s voice, though, continues to drag on. By the time July 20th rolls around, we\u2019ll have to see if any changes are made to Bane\u2019s audio mix, or if the tact behind allowing his voice to remain as-is becomes clearer after our first full viewing.\nAlthough there is a mild amount of controversy surrounding this, that doesn\u2019t mean some fun can\u2019t be had with it! Take a look below at Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s take on the whole mess, including a parody of the recently released trailer.

His Blackest Night, DC's big event series for 2009/2010 is wrapping up, with the final issue appearing in late March, just before WonderCon. Johns' take on the big universe-spanning stories he's been involved in, plus what comes next with a series of original graphic novels and the resurrection of Barry Allen as the Flash, are just a couple of things touched on in this exclusive interview, which was conducted on January 28, 2010, about three weeks before the announcement from DC Entertainment that Johns had been named to the new position of chief creative officer. This is an extended version of the interview which appeared in the Winter 2010 issue of Comic-Con Magazine.\nCCM: What's the secret origin of Geoff Johns?\nGJ: The secret origin of Geoff Johns, wow. Well if you're talking about comic books or how I got here...I was born in Detroit, grew up in Grosse Pointe and Clarkston in Michigan. But when I was really young I found a box of old DC comics in my grandma's attic. There were a few Marvels in there too but I never really sparked to Marvel, I don't know why. I always liked the DC characters. My brother and I found this old box of comic books that belonged to my uncle and we just tore through them. We loved going over there because we'd go up in the attic and just go through the comics. And I just started to love those characters. I eventually discovered that there was a comic shop up in Traverse City, which is way up north in Michigan. One summer my brother and I and my family went up there and all we did was buy old comics and read old comics. I started collecting them and I gravitated towards DC and later Vertigo. And I actually used to draw all the time.\nCCM: Do you remember some of the books that were in that box that was your uncle's?\nGJ: Oh, Flash, Superman, Green Lantern, Batman.\nCCM: And were they 1960s era?\nGJ: Yeah, they were '60s and '70s. There were some Metamorphos in there. When I started to buy new comics, the first new comic I bought was Crisis on Infinite Earth number 3 or 4. I had had a few others but when I started to really collect comics I bought those and I bought Flash, I think 349 or 348, and Flash is my favorite character. But then I was just starting to get into comics and Crisis. I didn't understand it but I just liked it because there were so many characters.\nCCM: Were you stunned when they killed off the Flash?\nGJ: Yeah, but I was so young that I just kind of went with it. I was like \"Wow,\" I couldn't believe it. It was the craziest thing I ever read. And as soon as Wally West put on that costume, I was like \"Cool!\" I think as a kid you're more open to change. And so I just kind of followed along. I just liked the Flash. I remember when I was waiting for Wally West. When I first saw Legends I bought that because Flash was in that and I remember, I don't know why, I was grounded, when Flash number 1 came out. And I remember my friend came to the window and I gave him 75 cents to go to the drugstore and he bought Flash number 1 and came back and gave it to me. That's one of my earliest memories of comics.\nI got into comics and then I got more into film and I went to college and then I moved out to L.A. I worked for Richard Donner. I've told this story many times but I cold-called his office because he's my favorite director. He did Superman and The Goonies and all those great films. They transferred me around when I called. I was looking for an internship and nobody wanted to talk to me, to this kid. And then Donner picked up the phone by accident and he said \"Hello\" in this real deep voice. I said yeah I'm looking for an internship and he put the phone down and I heard him yell, \"Someone get this kid an internship,\" and everyone picked the phone up at the same time. So he said can you come in tomorrow because someone quit today, and I said sure. So I went in. I was wearing a tie, like I didn't really know what I was getting into but I went to Warner Brothers, which was to me amazing. I went to the office and I'm sitting there copying scripts and they have X-Men in development and I'm looking at all the X-Men stuff and I was really excited about that. I was an intern there for probably about two months and then I got hired as what was called a runner, which is essentially a production assistant, but I just delivered stuff all day long. I'd drive around town. It actually gave me a great knowledge of Los Angeles. In the summer of 1996 my sister died in the TWA Flight 800 plane crash. And it was obviously a very difficult time. When it happened I was very out of it, I was kind of in shock. Donner actually paid for my plane ticket home, he paid for a friend to fly with me and he was so amazing. That company took care of me at that time. That was when I realized how fortunate I was to work for people like that.\nEventually I came back to work and I kept working and then I got hired as his assistant. I went to New York and we shot a film called Conspiracy Theory. And Donner invited my parents to the set and he put them in the movie! He was a really great guy. I probably worked 90 hours a week but that's where I met some people--Eddie Berganza, specifically from DC Comics--and that's when I started to get back into comics. I met Eddie when I was shooting in New York. And I don't know what his job was. He was probably an editor at that time, maybe an associate editor and I was just an assistant, I was like 22 or 23. And I was talking about DC Comics and they had come to the set because it was a Warner Brothers film. I just talked their ears off about DC Comics because I loved DC. (Eddie) invited me to DC Comics and I went there for kind of a tour on one of my days off and met a bunch of people and really had an amazing time. And he said if you have any ideas to pitch us, let me know. About a year later I finally had some time. I worked so much on the film front I didn't really have a lot of time to do anything else. And I pitched DC Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. to an editor there named Chuck Kim, who later became a writer on Heroes. He liked it and put it through the system and it got approved. I started doing that and I thought I was going to (write comics) on the side and then I met David Goyer and James Robinson who were working on JSA. And James had taken a look at Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E and I owe him a lot--him and Mike Carlin--for helping to shepherd me into the business. James asked if I wanted to co-write JSA and I started to get more and more into comics and eventually a couple years later, I'd worked for Donner for four years and I had been writing comics for two and comics started to take over full time. And so I just went full time into writing.\nCCM: Who are your biggest influences as a writer?\nGJ: It's very weird because my mix of influences is probably very modern and very, very '60s, because I didn't know who wrote comics when I was a kid. I just read them and I liked the characters and the stories. (All the original stuff) was going to be by Gardner Fox and John Broome. But then in the modern era when I started to really pay attention to who was writing comics, I really liked Mark Waid, Grant Morrison, all the guys I work with now. Keith Giffin, John Ostrander. Ostrander was one of my absolute biggest influences in comics, specifically with villains. What he did on Suicide Squad redefined what a super villain was to me. Marv Wolfman, of course, Alan Moore. Peter David was the first writer I ever looked for. I read a Hulk comic. It was a standalone issue of Hulk Gray. I can't remember what number it was, like 334 or something. And I finished reading this story and that was the first time I ever said \"who wrote this comic?\" And I turned to the credits and it said Peter David. That was the first time I ever cared about who wrote a comic. That's when I got into writers, because I had always been reading for the characters and the art and I never really paid that much attention. And then I would follow these guys. I'd follow Peter David to Aquaman and I'd read whatever Waid or Morrison wrote. James Robinson later became an influence with Firearm and Starman and The Golden Age. Oh, Karl Kesel, too. Oh, man...he was great on Superboy. I loved the Mike Baron Flash re-launch; I loved the Keith Giffin Justice League. John Stewart was Green Lantern at the time I bought Green Lantern. I remember buying an issue of Justice League and it had Gypsy and Vibe in it and I didn't quite know who any of those characters were. But then they re-launched everything after Crisis and that was really when I got on board with comics. I think if I started reading comics maybe five years before I don't know if I would have gotten into DC as much as I did, because when I first got into comics it was John Byrne's Man of Steel number 1 and Justice League number 1 and Flash number 1. It was really easy to pick up those books because they were re- launching everything and kind of doing a new universe. That post Crisis era was what really got me into comic books. I think that was a really interesting time for DC. I bought a lot of DCs because I could buy them at the drug store. I bought a lot of DC number ones because there was a new one every week. And then they did Justice League Europe. Bart Sears was my absolute favorite artist.\nCCM: Have you ever worked with him?\nGJ: I've never worked with him. I don't even know what he's doing now. I remember going to a show in Novi, Michigan and he was there and Graham Nolan was there and I went with my friend and I was probably 16 or 17. I remember just hanging out with Bart Sears and talking to him for like three hours. He was so nice and such an amazing artist. That Justice League Europe stuff was beautiful. It was funny, it was dramatic, and it was really good.\nCCM: Over the years you've written many, many books for DC including Blackest Night. Where does an idea like Blackest Night start for you? Did it start just as a story arc in Green Lantern?\nGJ: It started way back when on Green Lantern Rebirth. I remember pacing back and forth in my office and thinking I was missing a piece of the Rebirth story. I couldn't wrap my head around how I could write a Green Lantern book about a guy who killed all these people and then comes back to life and gets a second chance. It was going to be a book about redemption and I didn't want to write a book about redemption. I wanted to write a Green Lantern title because Green Lantern's not a book about redemption. It's a book about overcoming fear. So I thought the whole concept of Rebirth had to be overcoming fear. I kept thinking about Parallax, and at that point I decided it's going to be some kind of fear-based entity. And I suddenly started to try and tie it in to emotions with the powers. If green is courage and will, then yellow is fear. It made sense that yellow was fear. I thought there's that moment where Hal Jordan goes into the power battery in Emerald Twilight and he comes out with gray hair and he's all nuts. The white hair to me was always kind of a trigger of fear. You get scared and you get a streak of white in your hair. And it all kind of came together. It was the yellow impurity in the power battery that had never really been explained or touched upon. I thought it could be a living entity of fear and that it had been imprisoned. I started to come up with the idea that we give off this energy and the idea is that these power batteries can collect energy from all sentient beings. In life there's an emotional spectrum and there's all these powers. We're not just life forms, we actually have emotional resonance with the universe and we give off these emotions. You can walk in a room and tell somebody's angry because they give off that vibe. I thought you can collect all these powers and I would slowly introduce these other colors and the emotional spectrum, with the Red Lanterns and Blue Lanterns and everything else, and pulling the Star Sapphires in and creating this celestial core.\nI thought if there could be a big war between all these guys--because emotions struggle against each other inside us. And I thought if there's a big conflict between emotions, what's the one thing that can destroy emotion? Death is something that cancels everything out. It doesn't have emotion, it just is. It happens no matter if you're happy, sad, angry...it just happens. I thought the ultimate battle between these core emotions and death itself would be the Blackest Night. I came up with the concept of the black rings raising the dead because emotionally I thought these things would feed emotion. I just got the scene of black rings plunging into graveyards all across Earth and I thought it was a pretty visceral scene. That's kind of where the idea developed, but it was always about an analyzation of emotion because I've had Sinestro say a couple times that Green Lantern can deal with fear but all the other emotions are like everybody else. We struggle with everything. And Hal Jordan is somebody who buries his emotions. The Guardians do it to such an extent that they became completely distant from humanity. And when we bury our emotions, it always will end up tearing us apart from the inside or affecting our lives in other ways. So it just became an analogy and a story about confronting your emotions head on because that's what Green Lantern really is. It's all about confronting and overcoming fear and I thought we'll tackle that on all levels.\nAnd we are all [filled with] emotions. Some days we're Red Lanterns, some days we're Blue Lanterns, some days we're Sinestro. It changes and I think that's why those symbols--you see them all over the place at Comic-Con--because people can relate to that. And it's something I'm really happy with with those characters. I think those characters have taken off because they're fun and they're different and they're relatable. Even though they're aliens, they're still relatable.\nBut anyway, that's where the idea generated. For me it resonates personally because it deals with a lot of things like emotion and death and fear. I think fear holds a lot of people back. I think it's important to face your fears and overcome your fears because fear is not real. It's a survival instinct but a lot of the stuff that we're afraid of isn't life or death.\nCCM: So where does it go from being a Green Lantern story to being a story that encompasses the entire DC universe?\nGJ: I always knew it would affect the DC Universe. It was to draw (the characters) in much like Sinestro Corps did, but in Sinestro Corps they're all in the background because it's first and foremost a Green Lantern story. I have to give credit to Dan Didio because he said in Sinestro Corps you had all your eyes on Green Lantern and Blackest Night has the potential because the dead rise to affect the entire DC Universe. I had always had an ending for Blackest Night in mind that would affect the DC Universe. Dan asked do you want a bigger stage to do this on? And we talked about it and I said that'd be great. Out of that, instead of doing it just through Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps, was born the Blackest Night series itself. I met with Eddie Berganza who's my editor and the only guy that could pull this off. We talked about how big we could make this in the crossovers and what made sense emotionally. We wanted to make it big but not too big. We didn't want to swallow every title. So you know obviously the Superman books and the Batman books they're moving on on their own. And Wonder Woman is moving along on its own so we didn't have to interrupt other books to do this big story but we could still use those characters in a miniseries. That's how it got big. It kind of grew organically just because there was story to do it. It would have been a shame if we didn't see some of these confrontations. I'm especially happy with what Greg Rucka has done on Blackest Night Wonder Woman. Issues 2 and 3 are really dynamite.\nCCM: But you'd just come out of Infinite Crisis and 52. Were you up for doing another epic story like this?\nGJ: Well, Infinite Crisis was kind of me being thrown into the deep end and learning how to do these crossovers and how it works. That was a great experience and Eddie and I look back on that and saw the things that worked and things that didn't and things that were challenges. Blackest Night presented all these new challenges that we also were able to tackle with that experience. Infinite Crisis was a very different beast from 52. 52 was an entirely different kind of storytelling. It didn't work the same as an event because you're working with three other writers. It was a grind because it was every week but it was focused in on its own universe. When I was doing 52 I actually was kind of retreating back to just doing Green Lantern and Justice Society of America. And then I took about a year off and I did Sinestro Corps, which required some coordination with Dave Gibbons. But really it was a pretty self-contained story. It didn't really affect any books beyond the Green Lantern ones. When Blackest Night came up, I like this kind of stuff so I didn't have any hesitation because it was an event. I really enjoyed it so I'm going to do another one in probably 2011. I'll take a year off and then do another one in 2011 because they're fun to write and they're big and colorful. It's fun to work with all those DC Universe characters. Though it'll be a different kind of event just like Blackest Night was different from 52 and Brightest Day. Brightest Day is an event, but it's a cool event because it's contained and it's big and it's character driven. It's doesn't require the same amount of coordination and scheduling like Blackest Night or Infinite Crisis did.\nI moved to New York for three and a half months to insure that we were as connected and as tied in as possible (on Blackest Night) because I think the devil is in the details. The best thing about working on things like Infinite Crisis and 52 and even Sinestro Corps was I could take all those mistakes and challenges and try to improve upon them. I'm really happy with the result so far. Ivan Reis is drawing the last issue of Blackest Night right now, so we're in the home stretch.\nI had this story in my head for so long. The details changed, but all the major beats are still the same as they were when I first thought of this thing. One of the things I really wanted to do with Blackest Night was to do the build up in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps. Do the series and then do the aftermath and be involved with the next level or the next story that happens after this and how does it affect everything. I wanted to follow through with it. And that's a major difference from Infinite Crisis.\nCCM: And that next story is Brightest Day?\nGJ: Yeah, it's Brightest Day. The whole concept of Brightest Day I think right now is a little esoteric and vague and I think people just think--mistakenly so--it's a call to arms to shiny, bright, colorful superhero comics and that's not necessarily what we're doing. Some of it is but what \"brightest\" actually means will become clear at the end of Blackest Night.\nCCM: And you're co-writing that with Pete Tomasi. When you do something like this and 52, how do you break it up writer wise?\nGJ: Usually by character. On 52 we plotted everything together but we broke it up by character. And occasionally you'd switch out a scene. Occasionally I would write a Question scene--even though Greg Rucka really wrote all the Question stuff--just because it would either be a team-up with Black Adam or whatever. But we'd really divide it by character and Brightest Day is going to be the same kind of thing. It's much, much easier because A, it's biweekly and B, it's also just me and Pete. So there's only one other writer to work with. It's easier to coordinate, even just phone calls and brainstorming sessions and working with (editors) Eddie Berganza and Adam Schlagman, who are on Blackest Night and carrying Brightest Day through too, which is great. But it'll be kind of the same way we did 52. We'll be plotting everything together.\nCCM: You've been dealing with the \"Secret Origins\" and \"Rebirths\" of a number of DC's biggest characters including Superman, Flash, and Green Lantern. What's it like working on these iconic characters and how important is it to maintain the details of their histories while updating and adding to their origins for a new audience?\nGJ: You have to find a balance. There are certain things in Green Lantern Secret Origin that have been around since he was created and there are certain things that are brand-new, the same thing with Superman. The thing I do is I try and look at what resonates emotionally and what's visceral to people when they think of Green Lantern. You know...he's got to charge that ring. He's got to say the oath and he's got to be there when Abin Sur crashes in the desert. There are certain things that have to happen. I decided to incorporate Hector Hammond into Hal's origin. I thought he was a good counterpoint to who Hal Jordan was, as Hal Jordan is kind of this extraverted over-the-top guy and Hector Hammond's much more an introvert and intellectual. I thought they played off each other nice. And then bringing in Sinestro as Hal's trainer, which was introduced in both Emerald Dawn series way back when. But there are other things that obviously I changed from certain interpretations. I think it's all a creative choice. For me I always read everything and do my research first and then I kind of make an aesthetic choice of what I want to keep due to his character. It's more about his character than anything else.\nCCM: Was there any kind of silent little thrill you got with the fact that as a kid you read the Flash being killed in one of the first comics you collected and then you brought him back?\nGJ: I think I'm more excited about the stories coming up then the actual rebirth. It's a little bit like Hal Jordan. I really enjoyed Rebirth even though I kind of grew up with John Stewart as Green Lantern, but I really enjoyed writing Green Lantern Rebirth because I felt it was a good story in getting the Green Lantern mythology back up and running. But the stuff I'm really excited about is the stuff going on now: the Green Lantern Corps being back stronger than ever and all these new ideas coming and the same things with the Flash. It's a thrill to bring him back. It's a thrill to see him running around again. It's great and I think he has a lot of weight. You can feel Barry Allen's weight in Blackest Night. He's just a different character. One of my favorite scenes is with him and the Atom and Mera in the 911 office and they're both saying we need to call in Superman and Wonder Woman. Flash kind of tells them look right now you're Superman and you're Wonder Woman. And he takes off and Mera says well, if I'm Wonder Woman and you're Superman, who's he and the Atom says he's the Flash. There's something that gives it a lot of weight and I think Barry Allen as a character has that weight and that resonance. Flash number 1 really captures that and I'm really excited for that book to start. I've been waiting and waiting to start that book ever since I started Rebirth.\nCCM: Is there a Flash Secret Origin coming up in that title?\nGJ: Yes, there is. I will be doing the Flash Secret Origin. He's never had a secret origin book. You forget as a fan who's read comics for years and years and you say they just did Green Lantern Secret Origin. Well, Emerald Dawn was like back in the mid '80s, I think 25 years ago now. This is obviously for people today. I think sometimes people forget that there is a new generation coming in and this stuff has to be for a new generation. To a lot of people Hal Jordan is the new Green Lantern, and Barry Allen will be the new Flash. But with Green Lantern Secret Origin, it's a book now and that book actually outsells the other GL trades because you look at it if you're in a bookstore or whatever and that's the first one you'll pick up because it looks like that's the first volume. That's why I want to do a Flash Secret Origin because I like those origin stories. I think they're timeless and I also think that the Flash Secret Origin will be one of those books that you can hand to anybody.\nCCM: With Superman Secret Origin we see a really strong influence of the Richard Donner films in the books.\nGJ: It's obvious with Donner being my mentor that I hold his vision of Superman in high regard. His films were my favorite movies of all time and he captured the essence of Superman and it hasn't been captured quite right since then. Gary Frank obviously is channeling that as well. But part of the thing I miss is I love the humor in the Daily Planet. Every time we were at the Daily Planet in the films it was always fun and in the comics it's not always fun. So I wanted to try to bring some levity and some humor into that environment. I particularly like what Gary Frank has done with Lois Lane, because she's fun and strong, sexy, witty, really intelligent, cynical as hell to start with. And our take on the Daily Planet is that it's dilapidated like most newspapers. You know it's struggling right now. What I wanted to do was kind of turn the dial back. The Daily Planet is the greatest newspaper in Metropolis but let's see what it was like before, let's see what it was like when they couldn't afford the power to keep the globe turning so it got rusted shut and there are pigeons all over it, and nobody knows Jimmy Olsen's name and Lois Lane can't get a front page article to save her life. Lois was focused on finding the truth but to the detriment of anything positive. She doesn't believe that anything's good just to be good. She cuts right through the BS and gets to the core and tries to drag it out and expose things for what they really are. And that comes from cynicism. When she meets Superman and she looks in his eyes for the first time she suddenly believes in something. Like when he says I'm here to do good. A lot of people today if they showed up and said I'm just here to help, people would go I don't know...what's your angle?\nI wanted all the other newspaper in town to be very suspicious. And Lex Luthor is there and he's manipulating the media as well as he always does. So all the other newspapers are warning people and being speculative about what he's really here for and who he is and where he's from and what this is all really about. But Lois Lane and the Daily Planet go against the grain. Lois Lane and the Daily Planet embrace this new savior of Metropolis, this potential hero that's come to the city. And when he says I'm just here to help, Lois Lane for once believes him. She writes her first article and Perry White can't believe that she wrote it because it doesn't have one negative word in it. You see the fact that the Daily Planet embraces Superman, and that starts to feed over into Metropolis. And then the whole city starts to change. You get to Metropolis now and you see in Superman Secret Origin number 3 that the first time Superman gets there, people just walk down the street, they don't look each other in the eye, they don't smile. Somebody drops something and nobody stops to help. It's just a very self-centered city. And Luthor's created this lottery essentially. Every morning people line up at his gates like Willy Wonka waiting for him to come down and choose one person to help. Luthor's trying to create a city of parasites that are leeching off of him and relying on him to help them. And Superman shows up and Lex assumes he wants them to rely on him and Superman says no that's not what I want. I want you to help each other, help yourselves. I'm here to help but I'm not here to help solve everything, which is what Lex wants to do. But that's obviously on the surface. You'll see a lot of influence from the films, but beneath it it's a new story. It's a new emotional story and I wanted to just kind of again dial it back a little bit and see how Metropolis became this wonderful city, how the Daily Planet grew, how Lois Lane grew, how Jimmy Olsen grew.\nOne of my favorite scenes is in issue 4 with Jimmy Olsen up on the roof. Nobody remembers his name and he's up on the rooftop and he's contemplating moving back home and he looks over and Superman's there. Superman's on the rooftop contemplating too, because he doesn't know why people are rejecting him when he says I'm just here to help. Nobody believes him. And they have this conversation and Superman says, \"What are you doing up here?\" Jimmy says, \"I'm thinking about moving home. You know I came here to be a photographer and it's not working out the way I wanted. The city chews you up and spits you out.\" And Superman says, \"Yeah I know. I'm not sure I made the right choice coming here either.\" Jimmy looks at him and says, \"Well, if a man who can fly can't make it, what chance do I have?\" And Superman kind of realizes I have to make it. And Jimmy says, \"Man, my parents are going to say I told you so. They can't wait.\" Superman says, \"Your parents said that?\" He goes \"Yeah, what did your parents say?\" And you cut to this quick image and he says, \"I'll try and make you proud.\" Ma and Pa Kent say, \"You already do, son.\" And he's got the support there and he looks at Jimmy and says, \"I'd hate for you to move home because I don't have many friends in Metropolis yet and I don't want to lose the only one I do have.\" And he starts to fly away and Jimmy says, \"Hey, wait, wait, wait.\" And he flies back and he says, \"Before you go can I get a picture?\" And Superman says I'm really trying to avoid that. Jimmy goes, \"Yeah I know, nobody has, but it would mean so much to me, mean everything.\" And he says well okay and he flies back down and he stands there and Jimmy looks through the lens and he says, \"Put your hands on your hips.\" Superman says it feels weird and Jimmy says, \"Trust me it looks great,\" and takes the picture. And then the next time you see Lois and Perry talking about they just need a picture, they just need one picture for this article, and then--WHAP!--this kick-ass picture of Superman with his hands on his hips looking incredible is thrown on the desk and they both look up and it's Jimmy Olsen. And he says, \"The name's Jimmy Olsen.\" And Lois throws her arm around him and says, \"Hey, chief...take a look at your new dream team.\"\nAnd then you cut to Luthor reading all the negative headlines and enjoying the hell out of them because he's like good they're keeping this guy down, whoever he is and then he gets really upset when we reveal the last paper is the Daily Planet and it says,\u00a0 \"Meet Superman, Metropolis' New Savior,\" with that big picture on it (and an article) by Lois Lane. To me that's brand-new but it feels familiar, you know what I mean? It's that Jimmy Olsen and Superman relationship people know but they haven't quite seen it like this with what Gary Frank brings to it. And that's something that I try and do in these Secret Origin books is that it feels familiar, but it's new. And emotionally it is new and a little bit different than what we've seen before. Visually, we don't need to change Superman's costume. We don't need to make the Daily Planet a web paper. We don't need to do any of that stuff. It's the emotion that I want to get into and the emotion that I want to explore, more like in Green Lantern Secret Origin or the Flash Secret Origin. It's going to be all about the emotional exploration of these characters and the subtleties behind that and how they got to where they are and who they are underneath the uniform. But that Jimmy Olsen-Superman scene up on that rooftop says more to me about their relationship and about how it was born and how it grew on both of their ends then anything I could say today because it's that beginning spark that I find incredibly compelling. It's like why did these two galvanize? Why do they like each other...just because they're in the same office? There's got to be a better reason. And the better reason is that they're both feeling beat down by Metropolis and they both find a way to pick each other back up.\nCCM: One of your 2010 projects is a Batman original graphic novel drawn by Gary Frank. You haven't written very many Batman stories. What's it like working on the character and what is going to be different about your and Gary's take on Batman?\nGJ: I've written Batman here and there but I've never got to write a Batman story. I just got done babbling about Superman Secret Origin, but I love working with Gary Frank and he's one of those few collaborators that you want to chain yourself to forever because when we talk and work together it clicks and I'm really happy with the product. I've really been fortunate to work with Gary on all this stuff and Batman is something that we're both excited about because we're fans of the character but we've never worked on a big Batman project. Batman: Earth One is going back and looking at really the beginnings of Batman and a different take on Batman. It's a little early to get into exactly how it's different. And it's not like we're going to say he can fly or he kills people or whatever. It's still Batman, it's still Gotham City. We're just going to take a different look at it and again it's going to be all about emotions. It's going to be about how you overcome loss. Bruce Wayne copes with it very, very differently than most people. He gains his strong sense of not wanting anyone to feel the pain he feels every day by becoming Batman. I want to explore Jim Gordon and Batman's relationship in a different way and how that comes together and what that means. Alfred's actually very different because of the emotional resonance that we're going for with Bruce and the aftermath of his parents' death. And we're looking at that in a very different way with what Alfred is and where he comes from and what he represents to him.\nCCM: Is the process of writing a graphic novel different for you from writing a five- or six-issue story arc within a series?\nGJ: It is because it's one big story. The way we're tackling Batman, it's a graphic novel series but each story will be a complete arc with emotional and character subplots and some other ones that continue to every book. So the first arc has one big story in it and it's really the first time Batman gets seen in the spotlight and gets involved in a big case and meets Jim Gordon.\nCCM: Do you think original graphic novels are the future of comics?\nGJ: I think it's an outlet of comics. I think a lot of people want to say the future is all digital or it's all graphic novels. I think it's a lot of different things. I think if the market wants original graphic novel series, we'll find out. I feel really privileged to be a part of the launch with J. Michael Straczynski and Shane Davis on Superman: Earth One. I'm really excited about being a part of a new publishing model and we'll see how it goes and hopefully it does very well and they can keep doing them. I don't think DC is going to suddenly say we're only going to publish graphic novels. You look at comics and there's always going to be comic shops because they're collectibles. People want those issues. There'll be single issues, but I think as digital grows and as the bookstores continue to grow --which they have immensely--you'll see all these different outlets. And there will be changes to the content and to the way it's delivered but we'll probably have a lot of different models of comic books I think. I think we'll still have some form of monthlies, even if digital takes off huge, I think we'll still have some form of monthlies out there.\nCCM: What makes a great writer/artist team?\nGJ: Synergy. You look at Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely or Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. There's just synergy and there's not a lot of teams like that that work together consistently. Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon are another one of my favorite pairings, both on Preacher and Punisher. I love when those two work together, it's just magic for me. The same thing goes for Loeb and Sale and Morrison and Quitely. I look at what I've done with Gary Frank. We click creatively. And the same thing can be said for myself and Ivan Reis, from Green Lantern into Blackest Night.\nCCM: Let's run down some of your collaborators and ask what they bring to the page each time you work together. Let's start with your fellow WonderCon guest Ethan Van Sciver who you've done Green Lantern Rebirth and Flash Rebirth with, and who just finished a brand new piece of art featuring Flash and Green Lantern for the WonderCon Program Book cover.\nGJ: Ethan's a mad genius. He's the kind of guy that gets deeper and deeper into the mythology and the character. His art really is reflective of his personality. He's so detail-oriented and he gets so in-depth on things. He's incredibly meticulous. I've probably created more characters and concepts with Ethan--between Sinestro Corps and Rebirth in the Green Lantern world-- than anybody else. We kind of grew up together too. We started on the Flash: Iron Heights one-shot and then we continued on Green Lantern Rebirth and Sinestro Corps and Flash Rebirth. He's somebody that I love working with and really, he's insane. He's insane in the best way possible, but he's insane.\nCCM: Blackest Night artist Ivan Reis.\nGJ: I started working with Ivan back on a miniseries called The Vision in, I think 2002 or 2003, and I just knew he was going to be amazing. He had an amazing style, kind of an Alan Davis/Neal Adams look with his own insanity laced in. Nobody can touch Ivan in terms of epic superheroes, especially if you look at the schedule he keeps and the amount of art he does per year and the quality to it. There's no one who can compare to Ivan. I think he owns the superhero epic.\nCCM: Green Lantern artist Doug Mahnke.\nGJ: Green Lantern 50 will be out by now and it's an amazing issue. It's the best issue we've had since I think 43, our first issue. He's much like Ivan in that he's epic and big but he has kind of a real grittiness to his art, even though it's clean superhero art. There's a power behind it and an energy behind it that's raw. Like there's something in there that's visceral and primal but it's some of the cleanest art you'll ever see. I think what he does with his imagination--and you've seen it on Superman Beyond and Green Lantern--what he pulls out and how far he pushes it, is beyond what people think. Every second his pencil's touching that page his mind just must be working at 100 mph.\nCCM: Adventure Comics and upcoming Flash artist Francis Manapul.\nGJ: Francis is probably one of the most emotional artists I work with. That Superboy story (in Adventure Comics) was all built on emotion, but for me, very open, clean, and pure emotion. I've loved his work on the Flash so far. It's breathtaking because it's clean and modern and it's all about speed and color but it's still about character. At the core Francis is all about character. You see a close-up shot of Wonder Girl and her eyes say everything. If you notice, I don't do any narration on Francis' work because it doesn't need it. It's much like Gary Frank because I have to pull the narration out because their emotions resonate so much my words get in the way.\nCCM: And that's the next one, Superman Secret Origin artist Gary Frank.\nGJ: Gary Frank is far and away one of the best artists, draftsmen, and storytellers in the business. I talk with Gary a lot and we talk about the emotional content of the scene and where the characters are going and what they're thinking or feeling. The details of their internal journeys are so important to Gary. He focuses so much on character and conveying that emotion and what that character's going through every time. You can see it on the page when he lays it out. He's very conscious of what's important and integral to the scene. He doesn't just do a shot because it's cool, he does it because it's important to the story from the character's point of view. He draws the best Superman of this generation by far. I don't think anyone can touch him. The only other Superman artist I think that is in the same league is Curt Swan.\nCCM: You've written a number of scripts for the Smallville TV show including ones that brought both the Legion of Super-Heroes and the JSA to the small screen. What's it like translating those characters to another medium?\nGJ: That's probably one of my greatest thrills and greatest goals all around: getting the DC Universe out to the mass public. The Legion of Super-Heroes is in one episode of Smallville and suddenly 3 million people know who they are, which is probably more than did before. And the same thing for Dr. Fate and Stargirl and Hawkman and the concept of the Justice Society of America. But this is just one of many opportunities for DC in 2010 with the Green Lantern and Jonah Hex films, with all this stuff that they've got in the pipeline.\nCCM: Are you involved with the Green Lantern film at all?\nGJ: I am. I've been consulting on the film.\nCCM: IMDb also mentions you in connection with both a Flash and Shazam movie. Are you involved with those?\nGJ: Yeah, I wrote the story for the Flash film and I'm a producer on that and the same thing with the Shazam movie. I'm hoping the Flash is going to be a film that will move ahead pretty soon. The great thing about Green Lantern is that it opens the door up for every other DC character out there. I'd love to see a Wonder Woman film. I hope that that happens. I think she's a fantastic character that people already know and want to see. But you know it's hopefully just the beginning of what DC's going to do. They've got the characters, they've got that treasure box.\nCCM: What's it's like owning your own comic book store, Earth-2 Comics in Northridge, CA?\nGJ: It's one of the best things in the world because obviously I love comics and I always wanted to own a store. But I love going in there and just talking to everybody and learning more about the retail business. What it does is it informs me as a writer and with working for DC Comics how I can better help support the retail business because it's a very important business. Obviously it's what keeps us alive in publishing these books. Carr D'Angelo and Jud Meyers--who run the store and co-own it with me--are incredible retailers and very active in the community and very smart about how the business works. And DC has a long history of trying to work with the retailers and helping the retailers and if I can help in any way then I like to do that. That's really what my main goal is, to learn the business from every angle. It's important for me because I love this business and I love comics and these characters and I want to see this business continue to thrive.\nCCM: So you're down there every Wednesday helping to unpack the books?\nGJ: Well, we get books on Tuesday nights, so I get my books early. But I still like going to the shop every week and getting my books. And I think owning a store also helps somebody have to put their money where their mouth is. For me I have to be responsible with everything and with what I do. I look at Blackest Night and the things we've done and how big we can make the event. And I can't wait to get into my store and see did we do it properly? Is it too big? Is it too small? Is it the perfect size? And so far I'm very, very happy with the size of it. I think it's just right. Obviously it's one store so the opinions will differ from store to store but we're by Northridge College and our clientele is pretty young and diverse and I think it's a pretty good store to look at.\nCCM: What do you like best about doing conventions like WonderCon?\nGJ: Well, I like WonderCon because it feels like a big convention but it's manageable, it's more intimate. You get to spend more time with the fans and it's more relaxing but it's still a big convention. You get a chance to enjoy yourself at Wonder-Con. And San Francisco is a great city. I always love going down to Fisherman's Wharf and getting a crab sandwich.\nCCM: We're going to steal a round from Dan Didio's DC Nation panel playbook and do a little lightning round here to end the interview. Let's start with favorite DC hero you have yet to write?\nGJ: Well, I guess Batman, but since I'm writing Batman, Wonder Woman.\nCCM: Artist you haven't worked with but most want to?\nGJ: Steve McNiven.\nGJ: Favorite comic book right now or ever?\nCCM: Let's do both. Right now?\nGJ: I really enjoyed Straczynski's Thor run. I thought it was fantastic.\nCCM: And ever?\nGJ: Probably The Flash because I own every single issue. I mean, that's a massive run. The story I probably go back and read the most is The Golden Age by James Robinson. And I like the Golden Age characters enough but I didn't love them until that book; that book made me love those characters. I don't know if I would have jumped on the JSA if I hadn't read that book.\nCCM: What's your favorite TV show?\nGJ: Dexter.\nCCM: If you weren't writing comics what would you be doing?\nGJ: If I wasn't writing comics I guess I can't say I'd be writing film and TV because I'm doing that too. So if I wasn't in the entertainment business, I probably would do forensic science. That was something I considered briefly before film and comics.\nCCM: Superboy Prime, love him or hate him?\nGJ: Love him. He needs love, the poor kid. He needs all the love he can get.\nCCM: Have we seen the last of him?\nGJ: For a while.\nCCM: And finally, which ring color are you?\nGJ: Green.\nGJ: Yeah, no doubt. No fear, that's how you have to live life.\nFollow Us\n"}], [{"score": 151.69806, "uuid": "7c7d6b40-608c-50e2-9d56-1d4e72205170", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0105wb-82-16276", "target_hostname": "www.comic-con.org", "target_uri": "http://www.comic-con.org/common/2010_geoff_johns.php", "page_rank": 1.181347e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Comic-Con International :: Geoff Johns Conquers the Universe", "snippet": "I read a <em>Hulk</em> comic.

His Blackest Night, DC's big event series for 2009/2010 is wrapping up, with the final issue appearing in late March, just before WonderCon. Johns' take on the big universe-spanning stories he's been involved in, plus what comes next with a series of original graphic novels and the resurrection of Barry Allen as the Flash, are just a couple of things touched on in this exclusive interview, which was conducted on January 28, 2010, about three weeks before the announcement from DC Entertainment that Johns had been named to the new position of chief creative officer. This is an extended version of the interview which appeared in the Winter 2010 issue of Comic-Con Magazine.\nCCM: What's the secret origin of Geoff Johns?\nGJ: The secret origin of Geoff Johns, wow. Well if you're talking about comic books or how I got here...I was born in Detroit, grew up in Grosse Pointe and Clarkston in Michigan. But when I was really young I found a box of old DC comics in my grandma's attic. There were a few Marvels in there too but I never really sparked to Marvel, I don't know why. I always liked the DC characters. My brother and I found this old box of comic books that belonged to my uncle and we just tore through them. We loved going over there because we'd go up in the attic and just go through the comics. And I just started to love those characters. I eventually discovered that there was a comic shop up in Traverse City, which is way up north in Michigan. One summer my brother and I and my family went up there and all we did was buy old comics and read old comics. I started collecting them and I gravitated towards DC and later Vertigo. And I actually used to draw all the time.\nCCM: Do you remember some of the books that were in that box that was your uncle's?\nGJ: Oh, Flash, Superman, Green Lantern, Batman.\nCCM: And were they 1960s era?\nGJ: Yeah, they were '60s and '70s. There were some Metamorphos in there. When I started to buy new comics, the first new comic I bought was Crisis on Infinite Earth number 3 or 4. I had had a few others but when I started to really collect comics I bought those and I bought Flash, I think 349 or 348, and Flash is my favorite character. But then I was just starting to get into comics and Crisis. I didn't understand it but I just liked it because there were so many characters.\nCCM: Were you stunned when they killed off the Flash?\nGJ: Yeah, but I was so young that I just kind of went with it. I was like \"Wow,\" I couldn't believe it. It was the craziest thing I ever read. And as soon as Wally West put on that costume, I was like \"Cool!\" I think as a kid you're more open to change. And so I just kind of followed along. I just liked the Flash. I remember when I was waiting for Wally West. When I first saw Legends I bought that because Flash was in that and I remember, I don't know why, I was grounded, when Flash number 1 came out. And I remember my friend came to the window and I gave him 75 cents to go to the drugstore and he bought Flash number 1 and came back and gave it to me. That's one of my earliest memories of comics.\nI got into comics and then I got more into film and I went to college and then I moved out to L.A. I worked for Richard Donner. I've told this story many times but I cold-called his office because he's my favorite director. He did Superman and The Goonies and all those great films. They transferred me around when I called. I was looking for an internship and nobody wanted to talk to me, to this kid. And then Donner picked up the phone by accident and he said \"Hello\" in this real deep voice. I said yeah I'm looking for an internship and he put the phone down and I heard him yell, \"Someone get this kid an internship,\" and everyone picked the phone up at the same time. So he said can you come in tomorrow because someone quit today, and I said sure. So I went in. I was wearing a tie, like I didn't really know what I was getting into but I went to Warner Brothers, which was to me amazing. I went to the office and I'm sitting there copying scripts and they have X-Men in development and I'm looking at all the X-Men stuff and I was really excited about that. I was an intern there for probably about two months and then I got hired as what was called a runner, which is essentially a production assistant, but I just delivered stuff all day long. I'd drive around town. It actually gave me a great knowledge of Los Angeles. In the summer of 1996 my sister died in the TWA Flight 800 plane crash. And it was obviously a very difficult time. When it happened I was very out of it, I was kind of in shock. Donner actually paid for my plane ticket home, he paid for a friend to fly with me and he was so amazing. That company took care of me at that time. That was when I realized how fortunate I was to work for people like that.\nEventually I came back to work and I kept working and then I got hired as his assistant. I went to New York and we shot a film called Conspiracy Theory. And Donner invited my parents to the set and he put them in the movie! He was a really great guy. I probably worked 90 hours a week but that's where I met some people--Eddie Berganza, specifically from DC Comics--and that's when I started to get back into comics. I met Eddie when I was shooting in New York. And I don't know what his job was. He was probably an editor at that time, maybe an associate editor and I was just an assistant, I was like 22 or 23. And I was talking about DC Comics and they had come to the set because it was a Warner Brothers film. I just talked their ears off about DC Comics because I loved DC. (Eddie) invited me to DC Comics and I went there for kind of a tour on one of my days off and met a bunch of people and really had an amazing time. And he said if you have any ideas to pitch us, let me know. About a year later I finally had some time. I worked so much on the film front I didn't really have a lot of time to do anything else. And I pitched DC Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E. to an editor there named Chuck Kim, who later became a writer on Heroes. He liked it and put it through the system and it got approved. I started doing that and I thought I was going to (write comics) on the side and then I met David Goyer and James Robinson who were working on JSA. And James had taken a look at Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E and I owe him a lot--him and Mike Carlin--for helping to shepherd me into the business. James asked if I wanted to co-write JSA and I started to get more and more into comics and eventually a couple years later, I'd worked for Donner for four years and I had been writing comics for two and comics started to take over full time. And so I just went full time into writing.\nCCM: Who are your biggest influences as a writer?\nGJ: It's very weird because my mix of influences is probably very modern and very, very '60s, because I didn't know who wrote comics when I was a kid. I just read them and I liked the characters and the stories. (All the original stuff) was going to be by Gardner Fox and John Broome. But then in the modern era when I started to really pay attention to who was writing comics, I really liked Mark Waid, Grant Morrison, all the guys I work with now. Keith Giffin, John Ostrander. Ostrander was one of my absolute biggest influences in comics, specifically with villains. What he did on Suicide Squad redefined what a super villain was to me. Marv Wolfman, of course, Alan Moore. Peter David was the first writer I ever looked for. I read a Hulk comic. It was a standalone issue of Hulk Gray. I can't remember what number it was, like 334 or something. And I finished reading this story and that was the first time I ever said \"who wrote this comic?\" And I turned to the credits and it said Peter David. That was the first time I ever cared about who wrote a comic. That's when I got into writers, because I had always been reading for the characters and the art and I never really paid that much attention. And then I would follow these guys. I'd follow Peter David to Aquaman and I'd read whatever Waid or Morrison wrote. James Robinson later became an influence with Firearm and Starman and The Golden Age. Oh, Karl Kesel, too. Oh, man...he was great on Superboy. I loved the Mike Baron Flash re-launch; I loved the Keith Giffin Justice League. John Stewart was Green Lantern at the time I bought Green Lantern. I remember buying an issue of Justice League and it had Gypsy and Vibe in it and I didn't quite know who any of those characters were. But then they re-launched everything after Crisis and that was really when I got on board with comics. I think if I started reading comics maybe five years before I don't know if I would have gotten into DC as much as I did, because when I first got into comics it was John Byrne's Man of Steel number 1 and Justice League number 1 and Flash number 1. It was really easy to pick up those books because they were re- launching everything and kind of doing a new universe. That post Crisis era was what really got me into comic books. I think that was a really interesting time for DC. I bought a lot of DCs because I could buy them at the drug store. I bought a lot of DC number ones because there was a new one every week. And then they did Justice League Europe. Bart Sears was my absolute favorite artist.\nCCM: Have you ever worked with him?\nGJ: I've never worked with him. I don't even know what he's doing now. I remember going to a show in Novi, Michigan and he was there and Graham Nolan was there and I went with my friend and I was probably 16 or 17. I remember just hanging out with Bart Sears and talking to him for like three hours. He was so nice and such an amazing artist. That Justice League Europe stuff was beautiful. It was funny, it was dramatic, and it was really good.\nCCM: Over the years you've written many, many books for DC including Blackest Night. Where does an idea like Blackest Night start for you? Did it start just as a story arc in Green Lantern?\nGJ: It started way back when on Green Lantern Rebirth. I remember pacing back and forth in my office and thinking I was missing a piece of the Rebirth story. I couldn't wrap my head around how I could write a Green Lantern book about a guy who killed all these people and then comes back to life and gets a second chance. It was going to be a book about redemption and I didn't want to write a book about redemption. I wanted to write a Green Lantern title because Green Lantern's not a book about redemption. It's a book about overcoming fear. So I thought the whole concept of Rebirth had to be overcoming fear. I kept thinking about Parallax, and at that point I decided it's going to be some kind of fear-based entity. And I suddenly started to try and tie it in to emotions with the powers. If green is courage and will, then yellow is fear. It made sense that yellow was fear. I thought there's that moment where Hal Jordan goes into the power battery in Emerald Twilight and he comes out with gray hair and he's all nuts. The white hair to me was always kind of a trigger of fear. You get scared and you get a streak of white in your hair. And it all kind of came together. It was the yellow impurity in the power battery that had never really been explained or touched upon. I thought it could be a living entity of fear and that it had been imprisoned. I started to come up with the idea that we give off this energy and the idea is that these power batteries can collect energy from all sentient beings. In life there's an emotional spectrum and there's all these powers. We're not just life forms, we actually have emotional resonance with the universe and we give off these emotions. You can walk in a room and tell somebody's angry because they give off that vibe. I thought you can collect all these powers and I would slowly introduce these other colors and the emotional spectrum, with the Red Lanterns and Blue Lanterns and everything else, and pulling the Star Sapphires in and creating this celestial core.\nI thought if there could be a big war between all these guys--because emotions struggle against each other inside us. And I thought if there's a big conflict between emotions, what's the one thing that can destroy emotion? Death is something that cancels everything out. It doesn't have emotion, it just is. It happens no matter if you're happy, sad, angry...it just happens. I thought the ultimate battle between these core emotions and death itself would be the Blackest Night. I came up with the concept of the black rings raising the dead because emotionally I thought these things would feed emotion. I just got the scene of black rings plunging into graveyards all across Earth and I thought it was a pretty visceral scene. That's kind of where the idea developed, but it was always about an analyzation of emotion because I've had Sinestro say a couple times that Green Lantern can deal with fear but all the other emotions are like everybody else. We struggle with everything. And Hal Jordan is somebody who buries his emotions. The Guardians do it to such an extent that they became completely distant from humanity. And when we bury our emotions, it always will end up tearing us apart from the inside or affecting our lives in other ways. So it just became an analogy and a story about confronting your emotions head on because that's what Green Lantern really is. It's all about confronting and overcoming fear and I thought we'll tackle that on all levels.\nAnd we are all [filled with] emotions. Some days we're Red Lanterns, some days we're Blue Lanterns, some days we're Sinestro. It changes and I think that's why those symbols--you see them all over the place at Comic-Con--because people can relate to that. And it's something I'm really happy with with those characters. I think those characters have taken off because they're fun and they're different and they're relatable. Even though they're aliens, they're still relatable.\nBut anyway, that's where the idea generated. For me it resonates personally because it deals with a lot of things like emotion and death and fear. I think fear holds a lot of people back. I think it's important to face your fears and overcome your fears because fear is not real. It's a survival instinct but a lot of the stuff that we're afraid of isn't life or death.\nCCM: So where does it go from being a Green Lantern story to being a story that encompasses the entire DC universe?\nGJ: I always knew it would affect the DC Universe. It was to draw (the characters) in much like Sinestro Corps did, but in Sinestro Corps they're all in the background because it's first and foremost a Green Lantern story. I have to give credit to Dan Didio because he said in Sinestro Corps you had all your eyes on Green Lantern and Blackest Night has the potential because the dead rise to affect the entire DC Universe. I had always had an ending for Blackest Night in mind that would affect the DC Universe. Dan asked do you want a bigger stage to do this on? And we talked about it and I said that'd be great. Out of that, instead of doing it just through Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps, was born the Blackest Night series itself. I met with Eddie Berganza who's my editor and the only guy that could pull this off. We talked about how big we could make this in the crossovers and what made sense emotionally. We wanted to make it big but not too big. We didn't want to swallow every title. So you know obviously the Superman books and the Batman books they're moving on on their own. And Wonder Woman is moving along on its own so we didn't have to interrupt other books to do this big story but we could still use those characters in a miniseries. That's how it got big. It kind of grew organically just because there was story to do it. It would have been a shame if we didn't see some of these confrontations. I'm especially happy with what Greg Rucka has done on Blackest Night Wonder Woman. Issues 2 and 3 are really dynamite.\nCCM: But you'd just come out of Infinite Crisis and 52. Were you up for doing another epic story like this?\nGJ: Well, Infinite Crisis was kind of me being thrown into the deep end and learning how to do these crossovers and how it works. That was a great experience and Eddie and I look back on that and saw the things that worked and things that didn't and things that were challenges. Blackest Night presented all these new challenges that we also were able to tackle with that experience. Infinite Crisis was a very different beast from 52. 52 was an entirely different kind of storytelling. It didn't work the same as an event because you're working with three other writers. It was a grind because it was every week but it was focused in on its own universe. When I was doing 52 I actually was kind of retreating back to just doing Green Lantern and Justice Society of America. And then I took about a year off and I did Sinestro Corps, which required some coordination with Dave Gibbons. But really it was a pretty self-contained story. It didn't really affect any books beyond the Green Lantern ones. When Blackest Night came up, I like this kind of stuff so I didn't have any hesitation because it was an event. I really enjoyed it so I'm going to do another one in probably 2011. I'll take a year off and then do another one in 2011 because they're fun to write and they're big and colorful. It's fun to work with all those DC Universe characters. Though it'll be a different kind of event just like Blackest Night was different from 52 and Brightest Day. Brightest Day is an event, but it's a cool event because it's contained and it's big and it's character driven. It's doesn't require the same amount of coordination and scheduling like Blackest Night or Infinite Crisis did.\nI moved to New York for three and a half months to insure that we were as connected and as tied in as possible (on Blackest Night) because I think the devil is in the details. The best thing about working on things like Infinite Crisis and 52 and even Sinestro Corps was I could take all those mistakes and challenges and try to improve upon them. I'm really happy with the result so far. Ivan Reis is drawing the last issue of Blackest Night right now, so we're in the home stretch.\nI had this story in my head for so long. The details changed, but all the major beats are still the same as they were when I first thought of this thing. One of the things I really wanted to do with Blackest Night was to do the build up in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps. Do the series and then do the aftermath and be involved with the next level or the next story that happens after this and how does it affect everything. I wanted to follow through with it. And that's a major difference from Infinite Crisis.\nCCM: And that next story is Brightest Day?\nGJ: Yeah, it's Brightest Day. The whole concept of Brightest Day I think right now is a little esoteric and vague and I think people just think--mistakenly so--it's a call to arms to shiny, bright, colorful superhero comics and that's not necessarily what we're doing. Some of it is but what \"brightest\" actually means will become clear at the end of Blackest Night.\nCCM: And you're co-writing that with Pete Tomasi. When you do something like this and 52, how do you break it up writer wise?\nGJ: Usually by character. On 52 we plotted everything together but we broke it up by character. And occasionally you'd switch out a scene. Occasionally I would write a Question scene--even though Greg Rucka really wrote all the Question stuff--just because it would either be a team-up with Black Adam or whatever. But we'd really divide it by character and Brightest Day is going to be the same kind of thing. It's much, much easier because A, it's biweekly and B, it's also just me and Pete. So there's only one other writer to work with. It's easier to coordinate, even just phone calls and brainstorming sessions and working with (editors) Eddie Berganza and Adam Schlagman, who are on Blackest Night and carrying Brightest Day through too, which is great. But it'll be kind of the same way we did 52. We'll be plotting everything together.\nCCM: You've been dealing with the \"Secret Origins\" and \"Rebirths\" of a number of DC's biggest characters including Superman, Flash, and Green Lantern. What's it like working on these iconic characters and how important is it to maintain the details of their histories while updating and adding to their origins for a new audience?\nGJ: You have to find a balance. There are certain things in Green Lantern Secret Origin that have been around since he was created and there are certain things that are brand-new, the same thing with Superman. The thing I do is I try and look at what resonates emotionally and what's visceral to people when they think of Green Lantern. You know...he's got to charge that ring. He's got to say the oath and he's got to be there when Abin Sur crashes in the desert. There are certain things that have to happen. I decided to incorporate Hector Hammond into Hal's origin. I thought he was a good counterpoint to who Hal Jordan was, as Hal Jordan is kind of this extraverted over-the-top guy and Hector Hammond's much more an introvert and intellectual. I thought they played off each other nice. And then bringing in Sinestro as Hal's trainer, which was introduced in both Emerald Dawn series way back when. But there are other things that obviously I changed from certain interpretations. I think it's all a creative choice. For me I always read everything and do my research first and then I kind of make an aesthetic choice of what I want to keep due to his character. It's more about his character than anything else.\nCCM: Was there any kind of silent little thrill you got with the fact that as a kid you read the Flash being killed in one of the first comics you collected and then you brought him back?\nGJ: I think I'm more excited about the stories coming up then the actual rebirth. It's a little bit like Hal Jordan. I really enjoyed Rebirth even though I kind of grew up with John Stewart as Green Lantern, but I really enjoyed writing Green Lantern Rebirth because I felt it was a good story in getting the Green Lantern mythology back up and running. But the stuff I'm really excited about is the stuff going on now: the Green Lantern Corps being back stronger than ever and all these new ideas coming and the same things with the Flash. It's a thrill to bring him back. It's a thrill to see him running around again. It's great and I think he has a lot of weight. You can feel Barry Allen's weight in Blackest Night. He's just a different character. One of my favorite scenes is with him and the Atom and Mera in the 911 office and they're both saying we need to call in Superman and Wonder Woman. Flash kind of tells them look right now you're Superman and you're Wonder Woman. And he takes off and Mera says well, if I'm Wonder Woman and you're Superman, who's he and the Atom says he's the Flash. There's something that gives it a lot of weight and I think Barry Allen as a character has that weight and that resonance. Flash number 1 really captures that and I'm really excited for that book to start. I've been waiting and waiting to start that book ever since I started Rebirth.\nCCM: Is there a Flash Secret Origin coming up in that title?\nGJ: Yes, there is. I will be doing the Flash Secret Origin. He's never had a secret origin book. You forget as a fan who's read comics for years and years and you say they just did Green Lantern Secret Origin. Well, Emerald Dawn was like back in the mid '80s, I think 25 years ago now. This is obviously for people today. I think sometimes people forget that there is a new generation coming in and this stuff has to be for a new generation. To a lot of people Hal Jordan is the new Green Lantern, and Barry Allen will be the new Flash. But with Green Lantern Secret Origin, it's a book now and that book actually outsells the other GL trades because you look at it if you're in a bookstore or whatever and that's the first one you'll pick up because it looks like that's the first volume. That's why I want to do a Flash Secret Origin because I like those origin stories. I think they're timeless and I also think that the Flash Secret Origin will be one of those books that you can hand to anybody.\nCCM: With Superman Secret Origin we see a really strong influence of the Richard Donner films in the books.\nGJ: It's obvious with Donner being my mentor that I hold his vision of Superman in high regard. His films were my favorite movies of all time and he captured the essence of Superman and it hasn't been captured quite right since then. Gary Frank obviously is channeling that as well. But part of the thing I miss is I love the humor in the Daily Planet. Every time we were at the Daily Planet in the films it was always fun and in the comics it's not always fun. So I wanted to try to bring some levity and some humor into that environment. I particularly like what Gary Frank has done with Lois Lane, because she's fun and strong, sexy, witty, really intelligent, cynical as hell to start with. And our take on the Daily Planet is that it's dilapidated like most newspapers. You know it's struggling right now. What I wanted to do was kind of turn the dial back. The Daily Planet is the greatest newspaper in Metropolis but let's see what it was like before, let's see what it was like when they couldn't afford the power to keep the globe turning so it got rusted shut and there are pigeons all over it, and nobody knows Jimmy Olsen's name and Lois Lane can't get a front page article to save her life. Lois was focused on finding the truth but to the detriment of anything positive. She doesn't believe that anything's good just to be good. She cuts right through the BS and gets to the core and tries to drag it out and expose things for what they really are. And that comes from cynicism. When she meets Superman and she looks in his eyes for the first time she suddenly believes in something. Like when he says I'm here to do good. A lot of people today if they showed up and said I'm just here to help, people would go I don't know...what's your angle?\nI wanted all the other newspaper in town to be very suspicious. And Lex Luthor is there and he's manipulating the media as well as he always does. So all the other newspapers are warning people and being speculative about what he's really here for and who he is and where he's from and what this is all really about. But Lois Lane and the Daily Planet go against the grain. Lois Lane and the Daily Planet embrace this new savior of Metropolis, this potential hero that's come to the city. And when he says I'm just here to help, Lois Lane for once believes him. She writes her first article and Perry White can't believe that she wrote it because it doesn't have one negative word in it. You see the fact that the Daily Planet embraces Superman, and that starts to feed over into Metropolis. And then the whole city starts to change. You get to Metropolis now and you see in Superman Secret Origin number 3 that the first time Superman gets there, people just walk down the street, they don't look each other in the eye, they don't smile. Somebody drops something and nobody stops to help. It's just a very self-centered city. And Luthor's created this lottery essentially. Every morning people line up at his gates like Willy Wonka waiting for him to come down and choose one person to help. Luthor's trying to create a city of parasites that are leeching off of him and relying on him to help them. And Superman shows up and Lex assumes he wants them to rely on him and Superman says no that's not what I want. I want you to help each other, help yourselves. I'm here to help but I'm not here to help solve everything, which is what Lex wants to do. But that's obviously on the surface. You'll see a lot of influence from the films, but beneath it it's a new story. It's a new emotional story and I wanted to just kind of again dial it back a little bit and see how Metropolis became this wonderful city, how the Daily Planet grew, how Lois Lane grew, how Jimmy Olsen grew.\nOne of my favorite scenes is in issue 4 with Jimmy Olsen up on the roof. Nobody remembers his name and he's up on the rooftop and he's contemplating moving back home and he looks over and Superman's there. Superman's on the rooftop contemplating too, because he doesn't know why people are rejecting him when he says I'm just here to help. Nobody believes him. And they have this conversation and Superman says, \"What are you doing up here?\" Jimmy says, \"I'm thinking about moving home. You know I came here to be a photographer and it's not working out the way I wanted. The city chews you up and spits you out.\" And Superman says, \"Yeah I know. I'm not sure I made the right choice coming here either.\" Jimmy looks at him and says, \"Well, if a man who can fly can't make it, what chance do I have?\" And Superman kind of realizes I have to make it. And Jimmy says, \"Man, my parents are going to say I told you so. They can't wait.\" Superman says, \"Your parents said that?\" He goes \"Yeah, what did your parents say?\" And you cut to this quick image and he says, \"I'll try and make you proud.\" Ma and Pa Kent say, \"You already do, son.\" And he's got the support there and he looks at Jimmy and says, \"I'd hate for you to move home because I don't have many friends in Metropolis yet and I don't want to lose the only one I do have.\" And he starts to fly away and Jimmy says, \"Hey, wait, wait, wait.\" And he flies back and he says, \"Before you go can I get a picture?\" And Superman says I'm really trying to avoid that. Jimmy goes, \"Yeah I know, nobody has, but it would mean so much to me, mean everything.\" And he says well okay and he flies back down and he stands there and Jimmy looks through the lens and he says, \"Put your hands on your hips.\" Superman says it feels weird and Jimmy says, \"Trust me it looks great,\" and takes the picture. And then the next time you see Lois and Perry talking about they just need a picture, they just need one picture for this article, and then--WHAP!--this kick-ass picture of Superman with his hands on his hips looking incredible is thrown on the desk and they both look up and it's Jimmy Olsen. And he says, \"The name's Jimmy Olsen.\" And Lois throws her arm around him and says, \"Hey, chief...take a look at your new dream team.\"\nAnd then you cut to Luthor reading all the negative headlines and enjoying the hell out of them because he's like good they're keeping this guy down, whoever he is and then he gets really upset when we reveal the last paper is the Daily Planet and it says,\u00a0 \"Meet Superman, Metropolis' New Savior,\" with that big picture on it (and an article) by Lois Lane. To me that's brand-new but it feels familiar, you know what I mean? It's that Jimmy Olsen and Superman relationship people know but they haven't quite seen it like this with what Gary Frank brings to it. And that's something that I try and do in these Secret Origin books is that it feels familiar, but it's new. And emotionally it is new and a little bit different than what we've seen before. Visually, we don't need to change Superman's costume. We don't need to make the Daily Planet a web paper. We don't need to do any of that stuff. It's the emotion that I want to get into and the emotion that I want to explore, more like in Green Lantern Secret Origin or the Flash Secret Origin. It's going to be all about the emotional exploration of these characters and the subtleties behind that and how they got to where they are and who they are underneath the uniform. But that Jimmy Olsen-Superman scene up on that rooftop says more to me about their relationship and about how it was born and how it grew on both of their ends then anything I could say today because it's that beginning spark that I find incredibly compelling. It's like why did these two galvanize? Why do they like each other...just because they're in the same office? There's got to be a better reason. And the better reason is that they're both feeling beat down by Metropolis and they both find a way to pick each other back up.\nCCM: One of your 2010 projects is a Batman original graphic novel drawn by Gary Frank. You haven't written very many Batman stories. What's it like working on the character and what is going to be different about your and Gary's take on Batman?\nGJ: I've written Batman here and there but I've never got to write a Batman story. I just got done babbling about Superman Secret Origin, but I love working with Gary Frank and he's one of those few collaborators that you want to chain yourself to forever because when we talk and work together it clicks and I'm really happy with the product. I've really been fortunate to work with Gary on all this stuff and Batman is something that we're both excited about because we're fans of the character but we've never worked on a big Batman project. Batman: Earth One is going back and looking at really the beginnings of Batman and a different take on Batman. It's a little early to get into exactly how it's different. And it's not like we're going to say he can fly or he kills people or whatever. It's still Batman, it's still Gotham City. We're just going to take a different look at it and again it's going to be all about emotions. It's going to be about how you overcome loss. Bruce Wayne copes with it very, very differently than most people. He gains his strong sense of not wanting anyone to feel the pain he feels every day by becoming Batman. I want to explore Jim Gordon and Batman's relationship in a different way and how that comes together and what that means. Alfred's actually very different because of the emotional resonance that we're going for with Bruce and the aftermath of his parents' death. And we're looking at that in a very different way with what Alfred is and where he comes from and what he represents to him.\nCCM: Is the process of writing a graphic novel different for you from writing a five- or six-issue story arc within a series?\nGJ: It is because it's one big story. The way we're tackling Batman, it's a graphic novel series but each story will be a complete arc with emotional and character subplots and some other ones that continue to every book. So the first arc has one big story in it and it's really the first time Batman gets seen in the spotlight and gets involved in a big case and meets Jim Gordon.\nCCM: Do you think original graphic novels are the future of comics?\nGJ: I think it's an outlet of comics. I think a lot of people want to say the future is all digital or it's all graphic novels. I think it's a lot of different things. I think if the market wants original graphic novel series, we'll find out. I feel really privileged to be a part of the launch with J. Michael Straczynski and Shane Davis on Superman: Earth One. I'm really excited about being a part of a new publishing model and we'll see how it goes and hopefully it does very well and they can keep doing them. I don't think DC is going to suddenly say we're only going to publish graphic novels. You look at comics and there's always going to be comic shops because they're collectibles. People want those issues. There'll be single issues, but I think as digital grows and as the bookstores continue to grow --which they have immensely--you'll see all these different outlets. And there will be changes to the content and to the way it's delivered but we'll probably have a lot of different models of comic books I think. I think we'll still have some form of monthlies, even if digital takes off huge, I think we'll still have some form of monthlies out there.\nCCM: What makes a great writer/artist team?\nGJ: Synergy. You look at Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely or Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. There's just synergy and there's not a lot of teams like that that work together consistently. Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon are another one of my favorite pairings, both on Preacher and Punisher. I love when those two work together, it's just magic for me. The same thing goes for Loeb and Sale and Morrison and Quitely. I look at what I've done with Gary Frank. We click creatively. And the same thing can be said for myself and Ivan Reis, from Green Lantern into Blackest Night.\nCCM: Let's run down some of your collaborators and ask what they bring to the page each time you work together. Let's start with your fellow WonderCon guest Ethan Van Sciver who you've done Green Lantern Rebirth and Flash Rebirth with, and who just finished a brand new piece of art featuring Flash and Green Lantern for the WonderCon Program Book cover.\nGJ: Ethan's a mad genius. He's the kind of guy that gets deeper and deeper into the mythology and the character. His art really is reflective of his personality. He's so detail-oriented and he gets so in-depth on things. He's incredibly meticulous. I've probably created more characters and concepts with Ethan--between Sinestro Corps and Rebirth in the Green Lantern world-- than anybody else. We kind of grew up together too. We started on the Flash: Iron Heights one-shot and then we continued on Green Lantern Rebirth and Sinestro Corps and Flash Rebirth. He's somebody that I love working with and really, he's insane. He's insane in the best way possible, but he's insane.\nCCM: Blackest Night artist Ivan Reis.\nGJ: I started working with Ivan back on a miniseries called The Vision in, I think 2002 or 2003, and I just knew he was going to be amazing. He had an amazing style, kind of an Alan Davis/Neal Adams look with his own insanity laced in. Nobody can touch Ivan in terms of epic superheroes, especially if you look at the schedule he keeps and the amount of art he does per year and the quality to it. There's no one who can compare to Ivan. I think he owns the superhero epic.\nCCM: Green Lantern artist Doug Mahnke.\nGJ: Green Lantern 50 will be out by now and it's an amazing issue. It's the best issue we've had since I think 43, our first issue. He's much like Ivan in that he's epic and big but he has kind of a real grittiness to his art, even though it's clean superhero art. There's a power behind it and an energy behind it that's raw. Like there's something in there that's visceral and primal but it's some of the cleanest art you'll ever see. I think what he does with his imagination--and you've seen it on Superman Beyond and Green Lantern--what he pulls out and how far he pushes it, is beyond what people think. Every second his pencil's touching that page his mind just must be working at 100 mph.\nCCM: Adventure Comics and upcoming Flash artist Francis Manapul.\nGJ: Francis is probably one of the most emotional artists I work with. That Superboy story (in Adventure Comics) was all built on emotion, but for me, very open, clean, and pure emotion. I've loved his work on the Flash so far. It's breathtaking because it's clean and modern and it's all about speed and color but it's still about character. At the core Francis is all about character. You see a close-up shot of Wonder Girl and her eyes say everything. If you notice, I don't do any narration on Francis' work because it doesn't need it. It's much like Gary Frank because I have to pull the narration out because their emotions resonate so much my words get in the way.\nCCM: And that's the next one, Superman Secret Origin artist Gary Frank.\nGJ: Gary Frank is far and away one of the best artists, draftsmen, and storytellers in the business. I talk with Gary a lot and we talk about the emotional content of the scene and where the characters are going and what they're thinking or feeling. The details of their internal journeys are so important to Gary. He focuses so much on character and conveying that emotion and what that character's going through every time. You can see it on the page when he lays it out. He's very conscious of what's important and integral to the scene. He doesn't just do a shot because it's cool, he does it because it's important to the story from the character's point of view. He draws the best Superman of this generation by far. I don't think anyone can touch him. The only other Superman artist I think that is in the same league is Curt Swan.\nCCM: You've written a number of scripts for the Smallville TV show including ones that brought both the Legion of Super-Heroes and the JSA to the small screen. What's it like translating those characters to another medium?\nGJ: That's probably one of my greatest thrills and greatest goals all around: getting the DC Universe out to the mass public. The Legion of Super-Heroes is in one episode of Smallville and suddenly 3 million people know who they are, which is probably more than did before. And the same thing for Dr. Fate and Stargirl and Hawkman and the concept of the Justice Society of America. But this is just one of many opportunities for DC in 2010 with the Green Lantern and Jonah Hex films, with all this stuff that they've got in the pipeline.\nCCM: Are you involved with the Green Lantern film at all?\nGJ: I am. I've been consulting on the film.\nCCM: IMDb also mentions you in connection with both a Flash and Shazam movie. Are you involved with those?\nGJ: Yeah, I wrote the story for the Flash film and I'm a producer on that and the same thing with the Shazam movie. I'm hoping the Flash is going to be a film that will move ahead pretty soon. The great thing about Green Lantern is that it opens the door up for every other DC character out there. I'd love to see a Wonder Woman film. I hope that that happens. I think she's a fantastic character that people already know and want to see. But you know it's hopefully just the beginning of what DC's going to do. They've got the characters, they've got that treasure box.\nCCM: What's it's like owning your own comic book store, Earth-2 Comics in Northridge, CA?\nGJ: It's one of the best things in the world because obviously I love comics and I always wanted to own a store. But I love going in there and just talking to everybody and learning more about the retail business. What it does is it informs me as a writer and with working for DC Comics how I can better help support the retail business because it's a very important business. Obviously it's what keeps us alive in publishing these books. Carr D'Angelo and Jud Meyers--who run the store and co-own it with me--are incredible retailers and very active in the community and very smart about how the business works. And DC has a long history of trying to work with the retailers and helping the retailers and if I can help in any way then I like to do that. That's really what my main goal is, to learn the business from every angle. It's important for me because I love this business and I love comics and these characters and I want to see this business continue to thrive.\nCCM: So you're down there every Wednesday helping to unpack the books?\nGJ: Well, we get books on Tuesday nights, so I get my books early. But I still like going to the shop every week and getting my books. And I think owning a store also helps somebody have to put their money where their mouth is. For me I have to be responsible with everything and with what I do. I look at Blackest Night and the things we've done and how big we can make the event. And I can't wait to get into my store and see did we do it properly? Is it too big? Is it too small? Is it the perfect size? And so far I'm very, very happy with the size of it. I think it's just right. Obviously it's one store so the opinions will differ from store to store but we're by Northridge College and our clientele is pretty young and diverse and I think it's a pretty good store to look at.\nCCM: What do you like best about doing conventions like WonderCon?\nGJ: Well, I like WonderCon because it feels like a big convention but it's manageable, it's more intimate. You get to spend more time with the fans and it's more relaxing but it's still a big convention. You get a chance to enjoy yourself at Wonder-Con. And San Francisco is a great city. I always love going down to Fisherman's Wharf and getting a crab sandwich.\nCCM: We're going to steal a round from Dan Didio's DC Nation panel playbook and do a little lightning round here to end the interview. Let's start with favorite DC hero you have yet to write?\nGJ: Well, I guess Batman, but since I'm writing Batman, Wonder Woman.\nCCM: Artist you haven't worked with but most want to?\nGJ: Steve McNiven.\nGJ: Favorite comic book right now or ever?\nCCM: Let's do both. Right now?\nGJ: I really enjoyed Straczynski's Thor run. I thought it was fantastic.\nCCM: And ever?\nGJ: Probably The Flash because I own every single issue. I mean, that's a massive run. The story I probably go back and read the most is The Golden Age by James Robinson. And I like the Golden Age characters enough but I didn't love them until that book; that book made me love those characters. I don't know if I would have jumped on the JSA if I hadn't read that book.\nCCM: What's your favorite TV show?\nGJ: Dexter.\nCCM: If you weren't writing comics what would you be doing?\nGJ: If I wasn't writing comics I guess I can't say I'd be writing film and TV because I'm doing that too. So if I wasn't in the entertainment business, I probably would do forensic science. That was something I considered briefly before film and comics.\nCCM: Superboy Prime, love him or hate him?\nGJ: Love him. He needs love, the poor kid. He needs all the love he can get.\nCCM: Have we seen the last of him?\nGJ: For a while.\nCCM: And finally, which ring color are you?\nGJ: Green.\nGJ: Yeah, no doubt. No fear, that's how you have to live life.\nFollow Us\n"}, {"score": 150.988, "uuid": "96d98927-65c9-50b6-9500-62e37a8f0553", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1712wb-99-29824", "target_hostname": "www.zanaducomics.com", "target_uri": "http://www.zanaducomics.com/statues/single-gallery/13933258", "page_rank": 1.1898479e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Zanadu Comics - Shop for Statues - Conan: Valeria Bust", "snippet": "Valeria <em>is</em> a must-have for any collector of statues <em>or</em> Robert E.

All that I write here may make me come off like a jerk but I say this because I like the idea! Soul-Train is a very cool character that certainly deserves her own comic and it would be EPIC! I believe that Soul-Train could and should be a super hero who is walking power house who once she gets rolling she would be damn near unstoppable.\nSoul-Train\u2019s catch phase could be, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stop a train, baby!\u201d\nOkay\u2026 her name is Soul-Train, why would you use any other power. I completely disagree with the others on a 'Green Lantern-ish' visual locomotive or train energy blast; way on the corny side and unless there is some telepathic and light generation part to her powers, I don't see how that would work. But a rumbling noise, Earth shaking and visual shock wave like a train passing/moving the air when she gives off her power would be cool. I\u2019m assuming and hoping that she has super dense skin making her impervious to most conventional weaponry.\nI also disagree with the limiting of the destructive force of her power to that of a \"tactical cannon shell\". Now, my physics maybe way off here, but it\u2019s my understanding that a 100 car train has the diluted force/mass of an small atomic bomb. With total concentration Soul-Train should/could be able to duplicate the effect of the mass of a 100 car train focused to a single point, hitting someone or something, head on or falling out of the sky hitting a central area; All At Once! This would put Soul-Train in the fighting class/power wise that of Superman or the Hulk and make other heroes like Wonder-Woman a She-Hulk be outmatched or at least out gunned. I know in the movie Hancock, he was able to stop a train just by standing there, but as I said that force/mass was diluted, stretch over half a mile, but what if Soul-Train was capable of generating a force that equaled the same mass of that train moving at the same speed and was focused into a single point, the size of a basket ball\u2026 KABOOM!!\nHere\u2019s something that would be cool; an inability to 'pull' her punches. Soul-Train walks up to a lock door, uses her kinetic shock power to knock it down and takes out the whole wall as well. The least she would be able to do is a kinetic force \u2018push\u2019, but it would be like an actual train pushing something out of its way. A train is NOT subtle thing. Even standing still, inactive you feel its power. Soul-Train is not ninja or at lease should try to be. The only way she should be able to sneak up on you is if you were not paying any attention to your surroundings at all; like those people who get hit by trains in their cars.\nAs I said earlier, I think Soul-Train is a epic cool character and I think you should let her run as fast and hard as a train!\n--\n"}, {"score": 149.32782, "uuid": "f7bfb6bb-2b8f-5962-9742-1a40d33bd64c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-70-18790", "target_hostname": "www.majorspoilers.com", "target_uri": "http://www.majorspoilers.com/wizworldtoronto12-jeri-ryan-and-others-to-appear-at-convention", "page_rank": 1.2024507e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "WizWorldToronto&rsquo;12: Jeri Ryan and others to appear at convention |", "snippet": "Doctor <em>Who</em> <em>is</em> the longest running science fiction series in the world.
