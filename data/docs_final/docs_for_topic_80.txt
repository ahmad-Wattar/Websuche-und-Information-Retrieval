Depending on your reasons for deciding to be a vegetarian, the difference matters quite a bit!\nLacto vegetarians eat cheeses and other dairy products.\nVegetarian Diet\nVegetarians usually don\u2019t eat any form of meat: pork, beef, chicken or fish. But there are a lot of variants on the vegetarian diet, since people become vegetarian for a wide range of ethical and health reasons.\nFor example, some vegetarians consume milk products and eggs . These guys follow the ovo-lacto vegetarian diet (ovo for the eggs, lacto for\nEggs are fine for the ovo-lacto vegetarian and ovo vegetarians.\nthe milk products). But someone who\u2019s lactose-intolerant might shun the milk but stick with the eggs. That would make them ovo vegetarians. There are others who don\u2019t mind animal products so much, but don\u2019t consume any form of meat, and consider eggs meat. Those would probably favor a lacto vegetarian diet.\nVegan Diet\nThe strictest vegetarian diet is the vegan diet. That\u2019s right, the vegan diet is a sub-diet of the vegetarian diet. Vegans shun all animal products, and not just milk products. They often avoid honey and even yeast. However, many vegans lead a vegan lifestyle, and this is a bit different from the vegan diet. Vegan lifestylers don\u2019t use any animal products in their daily lives at all, such as leather, some glues and beeswax.\nIf You\u2019re Considering a Vegetarian Diet\u2026\nKeep in mind that cutting animal meats and products out of the diet means a substantial reduction in protein . Vegetarians have to make sure they get complete proteins from other sources, such as nuts, beans and rice. Ovo-lacto vegetarians get some protein from milk and eggs as well.\nHealthy fats are also crucial\u2014your body can\u2019t survive without them. One of the most important fats to include in the diet (since it can\u2019t be produced in the human body) is Omega 3 fatty acids. While it is found in high amounts in wild fish, free-range eggs and grass-fed animals, people on a vegetarian diet often need to supplement to make sure they\u2019re getting enough. But Omega 3\u2019s are also found in flax, walnuts, avocados , almonds and olive oil, so adding these to the diet will help.\nLeave A Reply (1 comment So Far)\nName (required)\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\nWebsite\nSign up to our newsletter!\nWelcome to i-eat-smart.com!\nYou need to eat healthier and lose weight but you don't know how.

It should be a challenge, but not a big fight, and it certainly shouldn\u2019t be exhausting. It should make your life better, not harder.\nAs you say, you don\u2019t have just yourself to think of, which would be challenge enough.

IMHO, a Happy Mom is a Good Mom. If you can\u2019t take care of yourself, how can you take care of all those other people? I\u2019m not talking about being selfish or self-centered. I\u2019m talking about self-love. You not only have to re-program yourself to accept that, but also your family. It doesn\u2019t have to be a fight or a struggle, but it does need to happen. You could get some help with that \u2013 a neutral, yet empathetic person you can talk to, yoga or meditation practice, whatever works for you. Make time for yourself. It\u2019s important.\nSecond: Don\u2019t worry about going fully vegan or even vegetarian at this point. Keeping the Big Picture in mind, take practical baby steps toward your goal.\nIntroduce one plant based dish at a time to family meals, with the least disruptive timing and frequency. Give some thought to what your family will eat, but make it something you want to eat. It should be something they can eat with their meal, as a side. Like a salad, soup, veggie or grain dish (e.g. plain rice or noodles).\nPitch the changes as part of a campaign to make your family\u2019s diet healthier, more nutritious, more balanced. Don\u2019t force them, involve them in the process, and aim for acceptance of each step. Progress over time to a meatless meal, say once a week.\nGradually reduce or eliminate red meat from your diet and the family diet first, and progress to the smaller animals. Don\u2019t substitute tofu or other exotic foods yet. Serve more familiar foods involving beans or even eggs & cheese \u2013 e.g. bean based soups, salads, chili, sloppy joes, burritos with refried beans. After some time, try out things like tofu burgers or stir fry with fried tofu. Make vegan desserts \u2013 they\u2019ll never know the difference.\nSavvy Veg has lot\u2019s of kid friendly recipes !\nAlso, read the Savvy Veg report, Veg and Non-Veg Eat Together , for more in-depth suggestions for blending veg and non-veg eating styles.\nProbably I\u2019ve said more than enough for now!

It is usually the non vegan family or friends that make the biggest fuss over it, thinking that serving a vegan is so difficult, when it actually isn't, but your right, they won't eat just anything.\nA lot of people ask.. \"What DO you eat then???\" If you aren't vegan, look at your own meals.... do you only eat meat??? I didn't think so. What else is on your plate?? Potatoes, spaghetti, refried beans, rice, vegetables, salad, fruit, peanut butter......... (Check the menu page for a lot more ideas, and the substitutions page for what else to use. There is also a page that lists prepared vegan foods you already might buy. Check the nutrition page for more information on nutrition myths and concerns. )but putting it simply, for most people, just give up the meat and you will get enough protein, from the rest of your food. (Besides being healthier for it!)\nThe easiest way for a non-vegan to cook for a vegan is to just serve your vegan guest bigger portions of these \"side dishes\", and they will be happy! Or simply substitute a fried or baked piece of tofu in place of the meat, (Check out Tofutips.com ) and top with whatever sauce you are making... (vegan of course...) Or check out the recipes and other food and meal ideas for easy vegan cooking and your vegan guest will be thrilled! As you should be too! Simple substitutions will make your whole meal vegan. Vegetable broth, plain soymilk (only soybeans and water on the label!) Olive oil... or vegan margarine... Click here for more help information and ideas\nIf you want to go beyond the basics, fruits, vegetables, rice, etc... start looking, you will be amazed at all the vegan foods out there! You must already be aware that virtually ALL grocery stores have a \"health food section\" with several vegan and vegetarian items, plus you have seen non-cholesterol options in the freezer section. Plus most cities have several specialty \"health food stores\" that carry primarily organic, local, and vegetarian foods. Visit one of these and you will see you have almost infinite options, such as TV dinners, several types of burgers, hot-dogs, spicy jerky, fancy side dishes, soups, chocolate cake, etc etc....\nBesides having lots of vegan foods ready made on the market, simple substitutions can be made to virtually any recipe to convert it to a vegan one.\nOf course, it is difficult sometimes when locating restaurants with a lot of choices for vegans, (most restaurants still don't cater to people for health reasons, albeit moral ones) but you will find that most do have something, and/or a chef or option to make it vegan&. It might be as simple as served without Mayo, or cheese&. Or a salad served with oil and vinegar.\nEATING or TRYING VEGAN FOOD\nLike all recipes and items there are many different styles and tastes and finding the \"best\" for your taste buds sometimes takes time. There are so many different choices now in stores than just a few years ago, and more appear every year that you will be amazed at what actually can be done with a soybean or wheat gluten.\nSome people expect or want a meat substitute to taste exactly like that meat. Often this can be done since every single meat product is altered by cooking and spices. No one eats plain unadulterated meat. It is how it is cooked and what is put in with it that gives it the most flavor.\nIt should be noted though, that not all meat substitutes are made to be exactly like their meat counterpart. Most meat analogs on the market are made so they can be USED in place of the meat product most people are familiar to, not as an exact copy. For example, you will find several varieties of burgers, some you will like some not&. Some, like an original \"Boca burger,\" when topped with all the fixings: ketchup, mustard, onions, pickles, etc& you will have a hard time telling it from, say, a \"Burger King\" burger, where as a \"Garden Burger\" is made to be very different, with mushrooms, and peppers and intends to be nothing like a \"Burger King\" burger. There are substitutions for pretty much any style of meat, and unless served side by side with meat, they are very difficult to tell apart.\nA lot of vegans actually don't like meat substitutes, whereas they are too reminiscent of meat and what \"meat\" actually entails.\nDairy substitutes are a bit harder to copy and must be looked at as their own product and flavor completely. Things like soy milk, rice milk, almond milk etc. and each brand have unique flavors, but can easily be used in place of milk. People often have to \"get used\" to going from whole milk to skim milk, and it will probably take time to get used to a different flavor here too. There are sweetened and unsweetened options, vanilla, plain, chocolate, etc... so depending on what you are doing with it, putting it on cereal or making a cream sauce, will initiate you to try different ones.\nFor ice cream altrnatives, there are some wonderful flavors of Soy Delicious brand that are incredible!\nCheese seems to be the most difficult item to give up when becoming vegan for a lot of people. As far as I know there is no \"perfect\" cheese substitute out there yet, but the best one I have found is the Vegan gourmet, Follow your heart brand. Companies are coming up with new products all the time too, so keep up with the new brands and give them a try.\nIt is interesting to note, though, that most people are, in fact, some how allergic to, are lactos intolerant or do react to milk products in some negative way, Causing eczema, asthma, and gastro-intestinal problems yet they simply ignore it. People also know it is healthier to not eat meat, and that smoking is terrible, but they do it anyway, and hope for a pill to cure them of the disease, or problem. That is hard for me to understand. Shouldn't we all take a personal responsibility for our health and the health of the planet too? and not force animals to suffer on farms and in laboratories just because we choose to, say, keep smoking, or to be glutens at the the table?\n"}, {"score": 2126.5593, "uuid": "6869b7b8-0bed-51be-8546-71bb746b0745", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1909wb-24-11086", "target_hostname": "www.not-just-recipes.com", "target_uri": "http://www.not-just-recipes.com/Health-Invitation.html", "page_rank": 2.872973e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> Health - Being <em>Vegetarian</em>&#x2F;<em>Vegan</em> <em>and</em> <em>a</em> healthier YOU!", "snippet": "Has being <em>a</em> <em>vegetarian</em> or <em>vegan</em> had <em>a</em> positive impact on your health?

However, they do consume eggs and dairy products.\nVegan\nIn addition to not eating meats of any kind, vegans do not eat eggs, dairy products, or processed foods that contain these or other animals byproducts. Usually, vegans also do not eat foods that were produced using animal products or byproducts even though the produced foods do not contain any animal products. For example some wines use fish in their production.\nFlexitarian\nThis is a growing group of people who are not vegetarians but love and often eat vegetarian foods, though they have no objections to eating meat and its byproducts.\nPescatarian\nThis is a term that is just coming into mainstream use to describe those vegetarians who abstain from eating all other meats and animal flesh except fish.\nMacrobiotic\nThe main identifier of this vegetarian option is its emphasis on the eating of Asian vegetables like Daikon and sea vegetables such as seaweed. This diet also includes the unprocessed vegan food options of whole grains, fruits and vegetables. It also permits the occasional use of fish. However, all honey and refined oils are prohibited. This diet is thought to have superb healing qualities.\nWhy do people become Vegetarian?\nWith this mass of information and choices that could seem overwhelming and the range of DOs and DON'Ts that mark each category of vegetarianism, non-vegetarians might wonder or ask why people become vegetarians.\nGenerally, people who adopt and follow the vegan,vegetarian lifestyle do so for a range of differing reasons - from personal beliefs to medical restrictions. Usually, most vegetarians will give one or more of the following reasons for their choice of lifestyle.\nHealth benefits\nSome individuals might go veggie because this diet will decrease the associated symptoms of a particular illness and the likelihood of them suffering immensely or dying from the disease.\nReligious convictions\nPeople who belong to a religion (such as Hinduism, Seventh-Day Adventism, or Buddhaism), that frown on the eating of animal flesh, were either socialized as vegetarian or become vegetarian on their own in order to conform to the dogma or doctrines of that religion or spiritual belief.\nAnimal rights activism\nThis group do not eat meat because they feel it is cruel and unethical to rear animals deplorable, unhealthy, unnatural conditions, then subject them to cruel methods of slaughter just to satisfy unbridled human consumption preferences and patterns.\nSafety\nSome people adopt the stance 'better be safe than sorry' when it comes to eating animal flesh as thousands of people die annually due to food borne diseases, and there have been recalls of contaminated meat and incidents where restaurant patrons have been made ill by consuming meat and eggs that were not properly cooked.\nPsychological reasons\nSome people just cannot get past the fact that they are eating flesh that was once moving, breathing, and perhaps, thinking of how good it was to be alive. This vegan or vegetarian group find meat-eating disgusting and might even become sick by the thought of doing it.\nThis is a basic overview of what Vegetarians & Vegans are.

These beneficial microorganisms assist with normal digestion and benefit our immune system. Probiotic-rich foods include yogurt and kefir, miso and tempeh, sauerkraut and kimchi, and kombucha, the wildly popular fermented tea.\nProbiotics can be identified by their specific strain, such as acidophilus, bifidus, or rhamnosus. Dozens of different strains of bacteria have been identified, and often they are listed on a label as colony-forming units (CFUs), the number of bacterial cells estimated to colonize the GI tract per serving.\nPrebiotics are unique carbohydrates found in certain foods that our bodies cannot digest (similar to fiber). The prefix \"pre\" is a hint: They are \"foods\" that nourish good probiotic bacteria. Food sources of prebiotics include sunchokes (also called Jerusalem artichokes), onions and garlic, whole grains, honey and maple syrup. Both prebiotics and probiotics also are available as a dietary supplement.\nThere is no established recommendation for our daily intake of probiotics or prebiotics, but regular consumption of both is a good idea. These good bacteria benefit our immune system in a variety of ways. First, once probiotic bacteria take up residence in our GI tract, they can prevent other (potentially pathogenic) bacteria from colonizing the same space. Second, many species of good bacteria can increase the production of immune cells in the intestines. Third, some strains even secrete proteins that kill foreign bacteria that otherwise would make us sick.\nProbiotics really come to our rescue during cold and flu season. Researchers have shown that children supplementing with a combined prebiotic and probiotic have fewer colds and fewer sick days from school.\nProbiotics to boost immunity\nBoost your immune system naturally by eating foods rich in probiotics. Our health and body care department also offers high-quality probiotics in supplement form.\nYogurt \u2014 PCC's entire selection features live active cultures that promote healthier digestion and nutrient absorption. Choose from yogurt made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats, coconuts, almonds, soybeans or rice, from a variety of producers.\nFermented condiments \u2014 Find the robust flavor of locally made Firefly Kitchens feremented raw vegetables at all PCC locations.

Vegan (pronounced: vee-gun) diets do not include any animal products at all--no meat, eggs or dairy products.\nWhy Vegetarian?\nThere are many reasons that people decide to make the switch to a vegetarian diet.\nFor the animals\nThe federal Animal Welfare Act specifically excludes farmed animals from its protection and most state anti-cruelty laws exempt standard agricultural practices, no matter how painful. A vegetarian or vegan in the United States saves the lives of around 83 farm animals each year.\nFor your health\nAccording to the Surgeon General, nearly 70% of all disease in the US is diet-related. The American Dietetic Association states that \"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada that appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.\"\nFor the environment\nThe meat industry causes more water pollution in the U.S. than any other industry. Raising animals for food requires more than one-third of all raw materials and fossil fuels used in the U.S.\nLuckily, it is easier than ever to try a vegetarian diet. Here are a few helpful hints:\nTry new foods\nThere is literally a whole world of foods out there for veg-minded people; not just Chinese or Italian, but Ethiopian, Indian, Middle Eastern--try them all! Some of my all-time favorite comfort foods are items that I had never even heard of until I went vegan. Try new brands of foods that you have already tried. The same type of item, made by different companies, can vary wildly in taste. Some people hate veggie burgers because they tried one once and it didn\u2019t like it. If they never try another brand, they will be missing out on some great veggie burgers. My personal favorite is Boca Burger Vegan Original saut\u00e9ed in a little olive oil and soy sauce. Yummy!\nVegetarians can enjoy variety\nYou don\u2019t need to go far to try vegetarian convenience foods. Although stores like Whole Foods are a little slice of heaven for us vegan/vegetarian folk, most major grocery stores now have large health foods sections with everything from fake burgers to fake sour cream. They usually do cost a bit more at the large chain stores, so if you find something you like, look for it at Trader Joe\u2019s or Whole Foods to see if you can get a better deal.\nVegetarians can eat out\nMost restaurants today offer at least a few vegetarian options. If you a trying a new restaurant, it helps to call the restaurant ahead of time to check what they offer. That way, if the vegetarian options are limited, you can pick another restaurant before you are stuck with an iceberg lettuce salad for dinner.\nVegetarians can visit friends\nIf you are invited to a dinner party, be sure to let the host or hostess know that you are eating a vegetarian diet and offer to bring a dish. By contributing to the party, you ensure that there is at least one thing you can eat, you take the pressure off the host/hostess, and you give others at the party an opportunity to sample delicious vegetarian food. If you aren't a great cook, buy something delicious from the local Whole Foods deli or a vegetarian-friendly restaurant in the area.\nYou don't have to go cold-unturkey\nKeep in mind that this is an ongoing process. If you can't live another day without eating a hamburger (or cheesecake, or whatever your particular culinary Achilles heel may be), that\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t have to feel like you are a failure if you succumb to your cravings once in a while. You will be surprised at how, the longer you eat a plant-based diet, the less tasty animal products are, despite how good you remember them being.\nVegetarian in Phoenix\nYou can find vegetarian options almost everywhere. We've already mentioned Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods markets. There are even several all-vegetarian restaurants in the Phoenix area ! Veggie Fun, The Vegetarian House, Udupi Caf\u00e9, and the Desert Greens Caf\u00e9 all offer completely vegetarian menus. You'll also find a growing community of vegetarians that participate in monthly potlucks, restaurant outings and other networking opportunities.\nWhether you are a life-long vegetarian, or have decided to try to incorporate one vegetarian meal a week into your life, Phoenix has a growing number of dining options and vegetarian resources for you.\n- - - - - - - - - -\nKari Nienstedt is the founder of AZVegan.com.

And if they add \u201cWe must be realistic,\u201d they mean they are going to make money out of it.\n\u2014Brigid Brophy (1929\u20131995)\nAnimal Rights\n[I]t is difficult to picture the great Creator conceiving of a program of one creature (which He has made) using another living creature for purposes of experimentation. There must be other, less cruel ways of obtaining knowledge.\n\u2014Adlai Stevenson, American statesman (1835\u20131914)\nThere is no fundamental difference between man and the higher animals in their mental faculties.\u2026 The lower animals, like man, manifestly feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery.\n\u2014Charles Darwin, naturalist and author (1809\u20131882)\nThe difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind.\n\u2014Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man\nEven in the worm that crawls in the earth there glows a divine spark. When you slaughter a creature, you slaughter God.\n\u2014Isaac Bashevis Singer, writer and Nobel laureate (1902\u20131991)\nAs long as people will shed the blood of innocent creatures there can be no peace, no liberty, no harmony between people. Slaughter and justice cannot dwell together.\n\u2014Isaac Bashevis Singer, writer and Nobel laureate (1902\u20131991)\nI don\u2019t hold animals superior or even equal to humans. The whole case for behaving decently to animals rests on the fact that we are the superior species. We are the species uniquely capable of imagination, rationality, and moral choice \u2013 and that is precisely why we are under an obligation to recognize and respect the rights of animals.\n\u2014Brigid Brophy (1929\u20131995)\nThe love for all living creatures is the most noble attribute of man.\n\u2014Charles Darwin, English naturalist (1809\u20131882)\nWild animals never kill for sport. Man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow creatures is amusing in itself.\n\u2014James A. Froude, English historian (1818\u20131894)\nIf you visit the killing floor of a slaughterhouse, it will brand your soul for life.\n\u2014Howard Lyman, author of Mad Cowboy\nA man can live and be healthy without killing animals for food; therefore, if he eats meat, he participates in taking animal life merely for the sake of his appetite. And to act so is immoral.\n\u2014Leo Tolstoy, Russian novelist (1828\u20131910)\nIn fact, if one person is unkind to an animal it is considered to be cruelty, but where a lot of people are unkind to animals, especially in the name of commerce, the cruelty is condoned and, once large sums of money are at stake, will be defended to the last by otherwise intelligent people.\n\u2014Ruth Harrison, author of Animal Machines\nThe beef industry has contributed to more American deaths than all the wars of this century, all natural disasters, and all automobile accidents combined. If beef is your idea of \u201creal food for real people,\u201d you\u2019d better live real close to a real good hospital.\n\u2014Neal D. Barnard, MD, President, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine\nAbout 2,000 pounds of grains must be supplied to livestock in order to produce enough meat and other livestock products to support a person for a year, whereas 400 pounds of grain eaten directly will support a person for a year. Thus, a given quantity of grain eaten directly will feed 5 times as many people as it will if it is eaten indirectly by humans in the form of livestock products.\u2026\n\u2014M.E. Ensminger, PhD\nNow I can look at you in peace; I don\u2019t eat you anymore.\n\u2014Franz Kafka, while admiring fish in an aquarium\nPoor animals! How jealously they guard their pathetic bodies\u2026that which to us is merely an evening\u2019s meal, but to them is life itself.\n\u2014T. Casey Brennan (1948\u2013)\nLife is life \u2013 whether in a cat, or dog or man. There is no difference there between a cat or a man. The idea of difference is a human conception for man\u2019s own advantage.\n\u2014Sri Aurobindo (1872\u20131950)\nHumanity\u2019s true moral test, its fundamental test\u2026consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals. And in this respect humankind has suffered a fundamental debacle, a debacle so fundamental that all others stem from it.\n\u2014Milan Kundera, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, 1984\nWhat is it that should trace the insuperable line?\u2026 The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\n\u2014Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832)\nCan you really ask what reason Pythagoras had for abstaining from flesh? For my part I rather wonder both by what accident and in what state of soul or mind the first man did so, touched his mouth to gore and brought his lips to the flesh of a dead creature, he who set forth tables of dead, stale bodies and ventured to call food and nourishment the parts that had a little before bellowed and cried, moved and lived. How could his eyes endure the slaughter when throats were slit and hides flayed and limbs torn from limb? How could his nose endure the stench? How was it that the pollution did not turn away his taste, which made contact with the sores of others and sucked juices and serums from mortal wounds?\u2026 It is certainly not lions and wolves that we eat out of self-defense; on the contrary, we ignore these and slaughter harmless, tame creatures without stings or teeth to harm us, creatures that, I swear, Nature appears to have produced for the sake of their beautyand grace. But nothing abashed us, not the flower-like tinting of the flesh, not the persuasiveness of the harmonious voice, not the cleanliness of their habits or the unusual intelligence that may be found in the poor wretches. No, for the sake of a little flesh we deprive them of sun, of light, of the duration of life to which they are entitled by birth and being.\n\u2014Plutarch\nI abhor vivisection. It should at least be curbed. Better, it should be abolished. I know of no achievement through vivisection, no scientific discovery, that could not have been obtained without such barbarism and cruelty. The whole thing is evil.\n\u2014Charles Mayo, founder of the Mayo Clinic\nTruly man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds them. We live by the death of others. We are burial places.\n\u2014Leonardo Da Vinci (1452\u20131519)\nAs long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap the joy of love.\n\u2014Pythagoras\nWhen a man wants to murder a tiger, he calls it sport; when a tiger wants to murder him, he calls it ferocity.\n\u2014George Bernard Shaw, writer and Nobel laureate (1856\u20131950)\nIt is my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.\n\u2014Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955)\nA human being is a part of the whole, called by us the \u201cUniverse,\u201d a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest \u2013 a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.\n\u2014Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955)\nWhen a human being kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why then should man expect mercy from God? It is unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give.\n\u2014Isaac Bashevis Singer, writer and Nobel laureate (1902\u20131991)\nA dead cow or sheep lying in the pasture is recognized as carrion. The same sort of carcass dressed and hung up in a butcher\u2019s stall passes as food.\n\u2014J. H. Kellogg, American physician (1852\u20131943)\nIt ill becomes us to invoke in our daily prayers the blessings of God, the Compassionate, if we in turn will not practice elementary compassion towards our fellow creatures.\n\u2014Mahatma Gandhi (1869\u20131948)\nActivism\nThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\n\u2014George Bernard Shaw, writer and Nobel laureate (1856\u20131950)\nThere may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.\n\u2014Elie Wiesel, writer and Nobel laureate (1928\u2013)\nThe fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed, in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more often likely to be foolish than sensible.\n\u2014Bertrand Russell, Marriage and Morals, 1929\nNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\n\u2014Margaret Mead, American cultural anthropologist (1901\u20131978)\nEach snowflake in an avalanche pleads not guilty.\n\u2014Stanislaw Jerzy Lec, Polish poet and aphorist (1909\u20131966)\nIn matters of conscience, the law of majority has no place.\n\u2014Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869\u20131948)\nTo forgive and accept injustice is cowardice.\n\u2014Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869\u20131948)\nThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929\u20131968)\nThere are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the roots.\n\u2014Henry David Thoreau, Walden, 1854\nIt takes two to speak the truth: one to speak, and another to hear.\n\u2014Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862)\nLoyalty to a petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.\n\u2014Mark Twain, American author (1835\u20131910)\nThere is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action.\n\u2014Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, German writer (1749\u20131832)\nWhat would we do if we didn\u2019t try?

If you live in an area that doesn\u2019t have any restaurants with veggie or vegan options, what should you do? First step, DON\u2019T PANIC. Whether you\u2019re like me and trying something new, or dining with a friend who has vegetarian or vegan needs, it\u2019s fairly easy to find menu items that will work.

To put it simply, I was AMAZED.\nShe started by ordering a Cookie Dough Peanut Butter Shake (which our waiter informed us won the Best Shake in Chicago Award a couple of years ago).

To put it simply, it was scrumdiddlyumptious. Even the tofu (which I usually avoid because I\u2019ve only ever had the kind that is wet, jiggly and altogether bland) was firm, warm and bursting with flavor.

I cannot remember the last time I didn\u2019t add something to a dish (salt, pepper, Tobasco, ketchup, ranch, ranch, RANCH, etc.) but friends, this dish was wonderful exactly as it came.

It\u2019s basically processed gluten. If you do an internet search and land on the Wikipedia listing for this ingredient you will find the words \u201celastic mass\u201d in the first two sentences. (Barf, right?) But, to really get a sense for this whole vegan thing, I asked to sample a piece. I promised to include my fabulous waiter\u2019s caveat here which is this: seitan is wildly diverse and the flavor changes drastically depending on how you prepare it. The Chicago Diner uses it in \u201croast beef\u201d sandwiches, \u201cchicken wings\u201d and much more. It\u2019s also a popular addition in some of the best veggie burgers out there. I was assured that there are plenty of delicious ways to prepare this ingredient.

Here\u2019s my advice: don\u2019t be brave like I was and try this by itself. Stick with how it\u2019s prepared on the menu and you\u2019ll be a happy vegan wannabe.

B12 deficiency is extremely rare amongst both vegans and non-vegetarians alike, but is a serious issue when it does occur.\nThere are a few things vegans should know about B12.\nYour body has the ability to store B12 for a number of years, so if you\u2019re newly vegan, you may have sufficient reserves for another decade, but unless you have your B12 levels tested regularly there is no way of knowing.\nNutritional yeast is the best food source for B12, although miso and some seaweeds contain a minimal amount as well.\nAlthough nutritional yeast is a great source and an incredibly tasty addition to just about everything, some doctors suggest its best not to rely on a single source and recommend taking a vitamin supplement at least once a week, even if you regularly eat nutritional yeast. So if you\u2019re vegan, please be better safe than sorry and take a supplement at least once a week.\nOnce again, if you\u2019re a smoker, your body will lose nutrients, so you need extra B12.\nExpectant mothers and infants have special B12 needs as well. If you\u2019re vegan and expecting, take a supplement everyday.\nRelated recipe: Macaroni Casserole with Nutritional Yeast\nRemember, eating a healthy vegetarian diet is one of the best things you can do for your short-term and long-term health. As a vegetarian or vegan, you will lower your cholesterol and have a greatly reduced risk for colon cancer, heart disease and high blood pressure. There is a big difference, however, between eating a vegan diet of french fries and soda, and a well-balanced plant-based diet. If you\u2019re still exploring how to be vegetarian or vegan, its likely that you\u2019re not as familiar with your body\u2019s nutritional needs so its a good idea to take a multi-vitamin. A B12 supplement is always a good idea for vegans and those who eat a mostly vegan diet.\nLike this article?\nSign up to receive free vegetarian and vegan recipes, resources and tips in a weekly email newsletter.

If the two main risk factors (diet and smoking) were noted and acted upon, it is estimated that two thirds of cancers could be prevented. In 1981 Professor Sir Richard Doll estimated that 35% of fatal cancers are linked to diet. He currently estimates that 20-60% of cancers might be reducible by practicable dietary means (66).\nAccording to the WHO, evidence suggests a direct relationship between the risk of certain cancers and the level of total fat in the diet and that it may prove necessary to lower the upper limit for total fat [intake] from 30% to 25% or perhaps even 20% (67).\nThe EPIC (European Prospective Investigation on Cancer) Project initiated in 1993 is a multi-centred prospective study designed to investigate the relation between diet, nutrition, various lifestyle factors and the risk of cancer. Prospective studies record the diets of subjects and track their health over the coming years. The EPIC study is set against the background that the most consistent result of epidemiological (population) studies on food choices and cancer is that a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and more generally, in plant foods is associated with a reduced risk of many cancers (59). The study has 480,000 subjects in nine European countries including 60,000 participants in the Oxford Study for the UK element of the project. Data is now being prepared for analysis and the results will be compiled over the next year (86). (See section under Colorectal Cancer below for interim results from EPIC studies.)\nMEAT & CANCER\nWay back in 1892, Scientific American asserted that \u0093cancer is most frequent among those branches of the human race where carnivorous habits prevail.\u0094 (68). More recently it has been found that the very process of cooking meat, particularly at high temperatures for long periods, produces carcinogens which are thought to increase certain cancers (69). As animal proteins are heated, they produce cancer-causing chemicals called heterocyclic amines. This phenomenon occurs in all meats and the level of heterocyclic amines is 15 times higher in chicken than beef (70), suggesting that chicken can no longer be viewed as a healthy food option.\nHeterocyclic amines are most strongly linked to colon cancer but have also been linked to cancer of the breast, ovary and uterus. A 24-year Finnish study of nearly 10,000 people found that fried meat consumption was linked to higher risk of these hormone-related cancers in women (71).\nFAT & CANCER\nIn 1996, researchers at the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) presented new evidence on how fat affects cancer. Dr Laurence Kolonel from the University of Hawaii Cancer Research Centre and his team believe that fats (mainly of animal origin) in the diet produce bile acids in the intestinal tract that seem to promote colon cancer. Apparently eating high-fibre foods like fruits, cereals and vegetables can reduce the concentration of these bile acids and help prevent colon cancer (72).\nHigh-fat diets also increase the amount of oestrogens (female sex hormones) in the blood. It is known that many breast tumours are fuelled by an excess of oestrogen. When women begin a low-fat diet, their oestrogen levels drop sharply and vegetarians have significantly lower oestrogen levels than omnivores (63,73,74).\nResearchers in New York tested the effect of low-fat diets on immunity and found that people with a low-fat diet had more 'natural killer' cells than those on a high-fat diet. These cells seek out and destroy any abnormal cells that may turn cancerous. The authors of this paper state: \u0093The enhanced natural cytotoxicity may be one of the factors contributing to the lower cancer risk shown by vegetarians.\u0094 (75).\nTYPES OF CANCER\nBREAST CANCER\nBreast cancer has now taken over lung cancer as the most commonest cancer in the UK. In 1980 there were 25,000 cases each year but now there are 40,000 women each year being diagnosed with the disease. Asian countries have a much lower rate of breast cancer than Western countries but when Japanese girls are raised on Westernised diets, their rate of breast cancer increases dramatically. In the 1940s when breast cancer in Japan was rare, less than 10% of calories came from fat while today's Western diets have up to three or four times that amount (78). A Japanese study found the risk of breast cancer was eight and a half times higher in affluent women consuming meat every day than poorer women who did not eat meat daily (16).\nResearchers in Buffalo, New York calculated what they believed to be the degree of risk posed by fat in the diet. For a woman with metastatic breast cancer where the disease has spread to other parts of the body, the risk of dying from the disease at any point in time increases 1.4-fold for each 1000g of fat consumed monthly (79). This means that the typical Western diet could lead to about a 40% higher risk of dying of breast cancer at any given point, compared to a low-fat vegetarian diet (80). The relationship between dietary habits and breast cancer was studied in 240 women aged 50-65. Results suggested that diets that are low in fat, high in fibre, carbohydrates and Vitamin A seem to help the prognosis while alcohol slightly worsens it (81). The World Cancer Research Fund echoes this view. The advice given in their information leaflets is that research has shown that cancers of the breast are more common in overweight women and a diet to lower cancer risk is low in fat, high in vegetables, fruits and wholegrains (82). Well-balanced vegetarian diets typically incorporate this way of eating as a matter of course. A diet rich in vegetable products, especially fibre, may lead to a later menarche (onset of menstruation) which is thought may lessen the risk of developing breast cancer later in life (83).\nThe association of cooked meat and thus exposure to heterocyclic amines formed during high-temperature cooking may also play an important role in the risk of breast cancer. This was the conclusion of a paper by Zheng et al who conducted a case-control study among members of the Iowa Women's Health Study. This study looked at a group of 41,836 women who had been followed over the years from 1986 for mortality, cancer incidence and diet eaten. During 1995 to 1996 Zheng and colleagues looked at all members of the original group who had been diagnosed with breast cancer (the cases), compared them to a random sample of women from the original group who were free of cancer (the controls) and looked at the intake and preparation of meats consumed by both groups over the years. This analysis found that risk of breast cancer was elevated with increasing intake of well done to very well done meat (56).\nThe role of cow's milk as a possible risk factor for breast cancer has also been investigated. There is increasing speculation that one particular hormone \u2013 Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) \u2013 may have a major role to play. IGF-1 is a naturally occurring compound that stimulates growth in children and declines as a child ages. IGF-1 also encourages breast cancer cells to multiply and cow's milk contains about 30 micrograms of IGF-1 in every litre (84). A recent paper published in 1997 in Medical Hypotheses put forward the view that regular cow's milk ingestion after the age of weaning may produce enough IGF-1 in mammary tissue to cause the cell cycle to supersede its boundaries of control, thus increasing the risk of breast cancer (18). A study published in The Lancet found that pre-menopausal women with even small increases in blood levels of IGF-1 have up to seven times the breast cancer risk of women with lower levels (85).\nProfessor Jane Plant was diagnosed as having breast cancer in 1987 and had five recurrences. She began to research the disease and came to the conclusion that cow's milk had a major part to play. Seven years on, and after removing dairy products from her diet, the cancer has never returned. Her book on the subject presents the argument that cutting out cow's milk dramatically reduces the body's exposure to antibiotics, biologically active chemicals and a powerful cocktail of hormones thought likely to promote breast \u2013 and prostate \u2013 cancer (19).\nCOLORECTAL CANCER\nColorectal cancer (also called bowel cancer) refers to cancer in the colon (first part of the large intestine) and rectum (last part of the large intestine). In 1991 in England and Wales over 27,700 people had large bowel cancer (248). In the Harvard Nurse's Health Study, it was found that women who ate more animal fat had a greater risk of bowel cancer (76) and similar results have been found for men. In one prospective study the dietary risk factors for colorectal adenomas \u2013 precursors of cancer \u2013 found a positive association with saturated fat but a negative association with fibre (77).\nContrary to claims that white meat is somehow healthier than red meat a 1998 prospective study (whereby subjects diets are recorded and their health tracked over the coming years) identified both red meat and white meat (fish and poultry) intake as important dietary risk factors for colon cancer. Researchers at Loma Linda University examined eating habits of 32,000 men and women between 1976 and 1982 and monitored cancers over the six years. Among those who avoided red meat but ate white meat less than once a week, colon cancer risk was 55% higher than for those who avoided both kinds of meat. Those who had white meat at least once a week had more than a three-fold risk of suffering colon cancer. Conversely eating legumes such as beans, peas or lentils at least twice a week was associated with 50% lower risk compared to never eating these foods (21). A paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 1998 makes two very interesting points. Firstly that it is the overall dietary intake pattern that is important with greater emphasis on fruits and vegetables that is associated with lower risk for colon cancer. Secondly that 'substituters' (people who use low-fat dairy products instead of high-fat ones, margarine instead of butter, poultry instead of red meat and wholegrains instead of refined grains) were at reduced risk for colon cancer but the reduction was not significant. The authors conclude that this was because many adopting these 'substituter' so-called 'healthier' diets were not increasing their vegetable consumption and this aspect of the diet is important in significantly reducing colon cancer risk (55).\nFibre or non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are major constituents of a plant-based diet and it has been long thought that high-fibre diets offer a measure of protection against colon cancer. The reason for this centres around the digestion of dietary fat. Fat is broken down in the body by the secretion from the gallbladder of bile acids made in the liver. Bacteria in the intestines turn these bile acids into cancer-promoting substances (mutagens) called secondary bile acids. Meat \u2013 unlike plant foods \u2013 fosters the growth of bacteria that cause these disease-causing acids to form. Fibre actually changes the type of bacteria that are present in the intestine so the production of carcinogenic (cancer-causing) secondary bile acids is reduced (88). Fibre may also help both by diluting the presence of such harmful acids in the faeces and by greatly speeding up their passage through the colon.\nJerome J DeCosse, a surgeon at Cornell Medical Centre in the US gave a high-fibre grain supplement to patients with recurring polyps of the colon. Polyps are small growths that may go on to become cancerous but within six months in this study, the polyps became smaller and fewer in number (90). Virtually every food that comes from a plant contains fibre while food from animal sources contains no fibre at all.\nHowever it may not be simply a matter of increasing fibre and still eating meat that will help reduce risks of colon cancer. A study by O'Keefe et al in 1999 found that the low prevalence of colon cancer in black Africans was not so much explained by dietary 'protective' factors including fibre but may be influenced by the absence of 'aggressive' factors such as excess animal protein and fat as well as differences in colonic bacterial fermentation (57).\nPreliminary results from the EPIC study on the link between meat consumption and colorectal cancer are showing that a high intake of red meat and particularly of processed meat, are associated with a moderate but significant increased risk of colonic cancer (89). Overall first results suggest that frequent consumption of beef, veal, pork and lamb is associated with a 20-40% increase in colorectal cancer risk (87). This contradicts a recent review paper by Key, Davey and Appleby which found no association between a vegetarian diet and a reduced risk of colonic cancer (225).\nENDOMETRIAL CANCER\nA population-based case-control study of dietary factors and endometrial cancer published in 1993 revealed that women eating the most animal fat and animal protein had more than three times the risk of developing this particular cancer. High consumption of meat, eggs and fresh fish were all associated with elevated risk (105).\nNON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA\nNon-Hodgkin's lymphoma \u2013 a form of cancer \u2013 occurs more frequently in individuals with a suppressed immune system. Some types of dietary fat and protein have been linked with a decreased immunological response. A recent study published in 1999 found that greater dietary intake of certain meats and fats was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of this form of cancer. Intakes of beef, pork or lamb were all implicated (113).\nOVARIAN CANCER\nDr Daniel Cramer of Harvard University found that in a case-control study a higher intake of dairy products was linked to a higher risk of ovarian cancer. In particular the milk sugar found in cow's milk \u2013 lactose \u2013 was thought to be the problem when it is broken down in the body to galactose. It is thought that the galactose damages the ovary (94). This of course means that if it is the milk sugar not the milk fat causing this particular problem a switch to low-fat cow's milk products may not help to lessen ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer also seems to be more common in countries with a higher total fat intake (95).\nPANCREATIC CANCER\nRisk factors for pancreatic cancer were evaluated in a 20-year cohort study between 1966 and 1986. A cohort study is one in which two groups of people are selected on the basis of differences in their exposure to a particular agent \u2013 in this case dietary habits including meat consumption. This study of over 17,500 men in the United States revealed \u2013 after adjustment for other risk factors \u2013 that those who ate meat were three times more likely to develop cancer of the pancreas than those with low meat consumption (96).\nInternational comparison studies have shown that as Japan's diet has Westernised, so the incidence of pancreatic cancer has increased. One particularly pertinent aspect of this Westernised diet is in terms of animal fat consumption that previously was very low. Consumption has steadily increased from a daily level of 6.5 grams of animal fat per person in 1955 to 27.6 grams in 1987 and animal protein consumption has doubled in these 30 years (98).\nPROSTATE CANCER\nOne in 12 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives. The number dying from the disease has almost tripled in the past 30 years to 9,500 in 1998. By 2015, it is expected to overtake lung cancer to become the most common male cancer. Professor Jonathan Waxman who founded the Prostate Cancer Charity believes that dietary factors are very strongly implicated. The rise in meat consumption since World War Two is the main culprit but eating dairy products can also increase your chances of getting it due to the hormones in cow's milk. Vegetarians are half as likely to get it as non-vegetarians (91).\nResearch has shown that men who consume diets based on animal products tend to have more testosterone and oestrogens compared to men who eat plant-based foods. This increase may be due to over-production of these hormones in the body or, since fibre in the diet is essential for the normal excretion of sex hormones, a lesser ability to get rid of them. This hormonal boost can affect the prostate and, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, is probably the reason for increased cancer risk among those on a meat-based diet (101).\nIGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1) \u2013 found in cow's milk \u2013 is already known to encourage breast cancer cell growth and may also be a risk factor for prostate cancer. A very recent study reported in the British Journal of Cancer found that vegan men had a significant 9% lower IGF-1 concentration compared to meat eaters and that this might reduce their risk of prostate cancer (97). Other studies have likewise found that cow's milk consumption is also very strongly implicated as a risk factor for prostate cancer (256, 257, 258).\nAn important study published in 2001 in the prestigious American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also gives weight to the theory that dairy products are risk factors for prostate cancer. A high calcium intake, mainly from dairy products, may increase risk by lowering concentrations of a form of vitamin D (actually a hormone) thought to protect against cancer of the prostate. Results here showed that men consuming two and a half or more servings of dairy products (a serving being 140 grams of cheese, 170 grams of yoghurt or 75 mls of cow's milk) a day appeared to be almost a third more likely to develop prostate cancer then those eating the lowest amounts (less than half a serving per day). The authors concluded that their results supported the hypothesis that dairy products and calcium are associated with a greater risk for this particular cancer (269).\nEarlier in 1999 Grant used an ecologic (multi-country analysis) approach. Here mortality data from a particular year for various age groups in a number of countries (41 in this example) were compared with national consumer macronutrient supply values for a range of foods. Grant found that the non-fat portion of cow's milk had the highest association with prostate cancer. For an association to be causal (ie in this instance that the non-fat portion in milk actually causes prostate cancer) a number of criteria need to be satisfied including strength of the association, consistency and most important of all a likely mechanism to link the suspected agent with the observed effect. Grant concluded that for cow's milk the most likely mechanism may be related to calcium with high intakes suppressing conversion of one form of vitamin D to another form which has an anti-tumour effect for prostate cancer (270).\nIn 1993, American researchers analysed data from the prospective cohort Health Professionals Follow-up Study looking at diet and subsequent disease patterns. Of all the foods studied red meat represented the food group with the strongest positive association with advanced prostate cancer (99).\nA lower risk of prostate cancer is associated with diets higher in rice, soya bean products and green and yellow vegetables (100). Not surprising then that vegetarians have been found to have low rates of prostate cancer (102) and increasing consumption of beans, lentils, fruits and vegetables are all associated with significantly decreased prostate cancer risk (103).\nUTERINE CANCER\nUterine cancer is linked to diets that are high in fat and obesity (104). Vegetarians have been shown to eat a diet that is lower in dietary fat and have lower body weights than non-vegetarians (107).\nTHE ROLE OF FIBRE IN CANCER PREVENTION\nEating high fibre foods can reduce the concentration of destructive bile acids and help prevent cancer from developing by sweeping away toxins in the intestines before cancers can form. The link between higher fibre consumption and lower cancer risk is clear and has been reaffirmed in many studies. Fibre first received worldwide attention in the 1970s when international studies showed that in countries where diets included large amounts of fibre, there were fewer cases of colon cancer, diverticulitis and other intestinal diseases, haemorrhoids, hiatus hernia, appendicitis, varicose veins, gallstones and heart disease. Since then, many scientists have reached similar conclusions and have also found that diets high in soluble fibre (eg oats, soya beans, fruits and vegetables) appear to lower the risk of diabetes and may reduce levels of cholesterol in the blood. The World Cancer Research Fund recommends adults introduce children to fibre-rich foods at an early age to ensure they grow up enjoying and eating these foods (106).\nTHE PROTECTIVE NATURE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\nFruits and vegetables contain antioxidants such as beta-carotene (the precursor to vitamin A), and vitamins C & E which protect body cells against damage. The evidence is overwhelming that an abundant intake of fruits and vegetables can play an important role in reducing cancer risk (108). Members of the cruciferous family \u2013 broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower \u2013 are widely regarded as potentially cancer preventative foods. A number of papers have looked at the issue and found strong evidence to support these beliefs (92, 93).\nFor these reasons, it is recommended we all eat at least five portions of different fruits and vegetables per day as well as more starchy carbohydrates. One portion is equivalent to one medium fruit like an apple, banana or orange, two smaller fruits like kiwis or plums, a cupful of berry fruits, a large bowlful of green salad or two\nserving spoonfuls of most cooked vegetables and pulses like beans and lentils.\nThe World Cancer Research Fund (WRCF) states: \u0093The emphasis of our meals needs to be reversed; it is plant foods that should be the focal point of our dinner plate, not meat and dairy products.\u0094 (109).\nThe WCRF also has this to say about some important vitamins and minerals from fruits and vegetables:\n\u0093Beta-carotene is the pigment that gives dark green, yellow and orange fruit and vegetables their colour. In the body it is converted to Vitamin A, which may well lower our risk of developing cancer, especially lung cancer (167).\nVitamin C is believed to protect against cancer of the oesophagus and stomach. It is found almost exclusively in fruits and vegetables (167).\nVitamin E may help in the prevention of stomach and throat cancers as well as other serious illnesses. It is present in moderate levels in most fresh fruits and vegetables and at higher levels in cereals (167).\nSelenium is a mineral that can probably protect against colon, breast and possibly other cancers. Scientists say an adequate amount passes into fruit and vegetables from the soil in which they are grown\u0094 (167).\nSOYA PRODUCTS\nThere has been much publicity in the lay press \u2013 both negative and positive \u2013 surrounding soya products and their effects on the body \u2013 no less so than in the area of cancer. Some studies point to the chemo-preventative nature of soya whilst other studies seem to point to the opposite effect. On balance research seems to be suggesting that soya foods can be a very valuable part of a varied vegetarian diet.\nSoya beans contain all eight essential amino acids (building blocks of protein), have strong antioxidant properties, are very rich in soluble fibre, contain no cholesterol and are high in the essential fats which are often lacking in many people's diets. Studies have also demonstrated that soya lowers cholesterol levels and the large amount of evidence linking soya to good heart health has even led the FDA (the US Food and Drug Administration) to allow health claims on food products containing soya.\nSoya beans are rich in a class of compounds called isoflavones. These act as weak oestrogens \u2013 hence the name also given to isoflavones \u2013 phytoestrogens or 'plant hormones'. Phytoestrogens appear to have both antioestrogenic and oestrogenic effects in the body \u2013 thus they act as oestrogen modulators. The prevailing thought is that these plant hormones exert antioestrogenic effects in a high-oestrogen environment (such as that exists in pre-menopausal women) and oestrogenic effects in a low-oestrogen environment (such as that existing in post-menopausal women). Thus phytoestrogens appear to normalise oestrogen in the body. At the present time the data so far produced is insufficient to conclude that soya is protective against cancer but the data certainly warrants further investigation of this relationship. Indeed one important researcher in the field of soya states that: \u0093given the nutrient profile and phytochemical contribution of legumes, nutritionists should make a concerted effort to encourage the public to consume more beans in general and more soya foods in particular.\u0094 (110).\nA study published in The Lancet in 1991 of women in Singapore found that soya protein had a significant protective effect against breast cancer. This was in strong contrast to the finding that red meat consumption was a significant predisposing risk factor for this type of cancer (111). Soya beans are a mainstay of Asian diets and may be one factor why cancer levels are lower than in the West (112).\nTHE VERY BEST ANTI-CANCER DIET\nA landmark study published in 1994 in the British Medical Journal found that vegetarians suffer 40% less cancer mortality than the population average, even with controls for smoking, body weight and socio-economic status (114). In the words of Professor Jane Plant a completely plant-only diet may confer even greater advantages: \u0093Undoubtedly, the best anti-cancer diet would be completely vegan.\u0094 (58).\nCORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD)\nCoronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the cause of nearly a quarter of all deaths in England and persists as the UK's number one health problem with one in three men and one in four women dying from it. Treating CHD costs the NHS \u00a3500 million each year (115). According to the WHO's report on diet, nutrition and disease published in 1991, dietary factors clearly play a role in CHD: \u0093All the available evidence suggests that, for cardiovascular disease and cancer, diet has an influence throughout the life cycle, even though the end-points are manifested in the adult.\u0094 (116).\nWorld renowned heart surgeon Christiaan Barnard performed the world's first heart transplant in 1967. After 30 years of surgery he has come to the conclusion that most heart attacks are unnecessary \u2013 we have the power to prevent them. He states that our diet lacks sufficient fruits and vegetables, is not properly balanced and that we should live like the people of Crete. Here heart disease is almost unknown, and along with other dietary norms fruit and vegetables are the mainstay of the diet and their consumption of meat is 32% less than in northern Europe (121). This is of course the typical 'Mediterranean' diet that has many elements to it that support a far more healthier way of eating. Indeed two recently published articles in the British Medical Journal detailing the results of the WHO World Health Report 2000 clearly show that many of the countries performing best in terms of health of their populations are characterised by such diets (265, 266). A well-balanced vegetarian diet \u2013 by its very nature \u2013 is very much along the lines of a Mediterranean-type diet typified as it is by higher intakes of plant foods especially fruits and vegetables and of course zero meat consumption.\nA number of studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet can lead to a much reduced risk of heart disease. A key paper published in 1998 concluded from a collaborative analysis of 76,000 men and women in five prospective studies that vegetarians have a lower risk of dying from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) than non-vegetarians (122). A similar review study in 1999 actually put a figure to this decreased risk. Here, compared with non-vegetarians, Western vegetarians were found to have a lower BMI, a lower plasma cholesterol concentration and lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease by about 25%. These findings led the authors to state that the evidence available suggests that widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet could prevent approximately 40,000 deaths from IHD in Britain each year (123). Faced with such clear evidence as this and a cash-strapped NHS it is a surprise that a vegetarian diet is not available by prescription! Indeed a recent comprehensive review of the beneficial and adverse effects of vegetarian diets in various medical conditions makes this exact point. The authors conclude that: \u0093The burden of modern lifestyle diseases is enormous when the costs of investigation, diagnosis, treatment and primary and secondary prevention are included. Thus, dietary intervention with a vegetarian diet seems to be a cheap, physiological and safe approach for the prevention, and possibly management of modern lifestyle diseases.\u0094 Dr M Segasothy, NT Clinical School of Medicine of Flinders University, Australia (239).\nA new piece of research published this year in the Journal of Clinical Pathology gives a clue as to one of the reasons why a vegetarian diet may lead to lower heart disease risk. Scottish researchers found that levels of salicylic acid in the blood of vegetarians were up to one and a half times significantly higher than in meat eaters. Some vegetarians had levels up to 12 times higher (253). Salicylic acid is the main component of aspirin \u2013 widely prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks \u2013 which helps fight the inflammation that causes most cardiovascular illness. Salicylic acid is also present in fruits and vegetables suggesting a high dietary intake may produce some of the same good effects as aspirin. Dr John Paterson who helped conduct the research states there is also evidence that aspirin can protect against bowel, breast and lung cancer as well as Alzheimer's disease. \u0093It may be that salicylic acid in the diet can help prevent these diseases.\u0094 (252).\nAnother reason why vegetarians have a reduced risk of heart disease is thought to be caused by factors in the diet having a beneficial effect on vascular dilatory responses. Impairment of the ability of blood vessels to dilate or relax is an important early event in the lead up to plaques forming in vessels. A recent study reported in Atherosclerosis found that the vascular dilatory responses of vegetarians are better than omnivores. Just as importantly these effects are dependent on diet alone, independent of other known risk factors for atherosclerosis (clogged up arteries) such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension and ageing (261).\nCHOLESTEROL & SATURATED FAT\nWhilst not the only factor in the causation of CHD cholesterol is still considered a prime indicator of risk for this disease. Dietary cholesterol is not an essential nutrient since the liver can make all that it needs. Cholesterol is transported in the bloodstream and supplied to different body tissues by five major classes of lipoprotein, (fat and protein complexes) the two most important being low-density lipoproteins (LDL-cholesterol) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL-cholesterol). LDL-cholesterol transports cholesterol to the arteries and plays a significant role in the metabolic processes leading to atherosclerosis. HDL-cholesterol \u2013 'good cholesterol' \u2013 carries cholesterol to the liver so the body can get rid of it. Since LDL-cholesterol accounts for most of the total cholesterol in the blood, elevated total serum cholesterol is therefore regarded as a reliable indicator of the risk for developing atherosclerosis and CHD (120).\nThe foremost dietary determinant of total serum cholesterol is the intake of saturated fat. This type of fat is found principally in foods of animal origin and is particularly rich in the fatty portion of meat, eggs and milk products. Studies have suggested that whereas saturated fats elevate serum cholesterol levels, polyunsaturated fats (and possibly monounsaturated fats) actually lower levels (124). This is echoed by research showing that replacement of saturated fatty acids with almonds or walnuts (typical vegetarian staples which are high in polyunsaturated fats) lowers both total cholesterol levels and LDL-cholesterol levels. Compared with a reference population this study found that there were significant reductions of 7% and 10% respectively with almonds and 5% and 9% reductions respectively when walnuts were used in place of saturated fat (267). Saturated fat encourages the body to make more cholesterol than it needs and seems to prevent it from getting rid of the excess, leading to the narrowing of the arteries (118). Approximately 15% of dietary energy (calories) in the UK diet comes from saturated fat. Experts recommend that this be reduced to just 11% (125). A very recent literature review makes the point that the advice to reduce consumption of eggs \u2013 a major source of dietary cholesterol \u2013 may still be important in the prevention of coronary heart disease. The paper's authors also state that other major sources of dietary cholesterol \u2013 dairy fats and meat \u2013 are already considered as increasing the risk of heart disease because of their saturated, cholesterol-rich profiles and should likewise be reduced (268).\nThe WHO report in 1991 states: \u0093Population data clearly associate a decrease in saturated fatty acid intake with a progressive fall in cardiovascular disease mortality... A value of 10% of energy has thus been fixed as the maximum upper limit for saturated fatty acids... Saturated fatty acids are not essential nutrients... The lower limit for saturated fatty acids is therefore zero.\u0094 (127).\nThis statement is lent support when one considers that from a public health standpoint, 'lean' red meat diets and white meat diets are both largely ineffective in reducing serum cholesterol concentrations. Hardly suprising when one considers that unlike fat, cholesterol is located mainly in the lean portion of meat. Low-fat vegetarian diets that forgo all meats can achieve serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentration falls of 23% and 32% respectively. These stand in stark contrast to many cholesterol-lowering programs that see serum cholesterol concentrations fall by only 5 to 6% (126). A recent study by Ashton and colleagues also highlights the greater benefits of plant sources of protein compared to protein from lean meats. Replacement of lean meat with tofu (soya bean curd) in this study found significantly lower total cholesterol and triglyceride (fat) levels compared with the lean meat diet (237).\nThere is increasing evidence to suggest that vegans may have an even greater advantage. Thorogood et al found that differences in total cholesterol concentration suggest that not only the incidence of coronary heart disease may be 24% lower in lifelong British vegetarians but 57% lower in lifelong vegans (131).\nCOW'S MILK AND CHD\nThere is increasing speculation that cow's milk products may be playing a role in the high rates of CHD in Western countries. Research by Sacks et al has found that dairy products were the major sources of dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and that ingestion of fatty dairy products raises the LDL-cholesterol levels in the subjects followed (128). Way back in 1982 Segall made the compelling point that in Switzerland a falling cardiovascular mortality rate has been associated selectively with a fall in milk consumption, amounting to 46%, between 1951 and 1976 (129).\nThe theory that plasma homocysteine levels are directly associated with cardiac disease risk is one gaining considerable ground. This too may therefore be another factor why plant-based diets reduce CHD risk. Homocysteine is an amino acid found in high levels in foods of animal origin. A straightforward hypothesis would be that a vegetarian diet and more so vegan diet would have lower levels of this potentially damaging protein. Very recently DeRose and colleagues in Preventive Medicine published a study clinically demonstrating such an effect. In just one week on a vegan diet, as well as lifestyle interventions, subjects mean homocysteine levels fell 13% (130).\nA study by Grant into possible dietary associations with CHD in 1998 found that milk carbohydrate (lactose) had the highest statistical association for CHD for males aged 35+ and females aged 65+. Non-fat milk was found to have the highest association for CHD for males aged 45+ and females aged 75+, while for females 65-74, milk carbohydrates (and sugar) had the highest associations. A number of possible mechanisms have been put forward for this, the most prominent of which is the plasma homocysteine hypothesis. Animal proteins contribute to homocysteine (Hcy) production and cow's milk lacks adequate B vitamins (vitamin B6, B12 and folic acid) to convert Hcy to less harmful products. Lactose and calcium in conjunction with Hcy from consumption of non-fat milk may also contribute to calcification (hardening) of the arteries (132).\nA VEGETARIAN DIET CAN REVERSE CHD\nNot only can a vegetarian diet lower the risks of getting heart disease in the first place it can also halt and reverse even severe CHD. Dr Dean Ornish and colleagues have demonstrated that a near-vegan diet (no animal products allowed except egg white and one cup per day of non-fat milk or yoghurt) caused a significant overall regression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with moderate to severe coronary heart disease (119, 211).\n\u0093The Reversal Diet is a very low-fat vegetarian diet.. This is what the patients in our study consumed, whose coronary heart disease began to reverse. I am convinced that this is the world's healthiest diet for most adults, whether or not they have heart disease.\u0094 Dr Dean Ornish, Director of Preventive Medicine Research Institute, California, and the first clinician to offer proof that heart disease can be halted or even reversed on a vegetarian diet (282).\nThe evidence for a protective effect of a vegetarian diet for heart health is very clearly documented in an on-going landmark study \u2013 The China Health Study. This is a comprehensive survey of diet and mortality characteristics in 65 counties in rural China overseen by Professor Colin Campbell. All the evidence points to the conclusion that even small intakes of foods of animal origin are associated with significant increases in plasma cholesterol concentrations, which are associated, in turn, with significant increases in chronic degenerative disease mortality rates (117).\nFIBRE AND CHD\nFibre or NSP (Non-Starch Polysaccharides) is a collection of indigestible substances found in all plant cells. Hence virtually every food that comes from a plant will contain it and is why vegetarians have greater intakes than non-vegetarians do. Food from animal sources contains no fibre whatsoever. There are two types of fibre \u2013 soluble and insoluble. Soluble fibre is found in fruits and vegetables and the richest sources are vegetable protein foods like lentils, peas and beans. Oats are also rich in this type of fibre. Soluble fibre dissolves in the fluid of the gut and helps to maintain even blood sugar levels. It is also known to reduce cholesterol levels in the body. Insoluble fibre found in cereals, breads, rice, pasta as well as fruits and vegetable adds bulk to waste products ensuring easy passage of this waste through the digestive system.\nAccording to the National Food Survey the average intake of fibre in the UK diet is 11.9 grams per person per day (133). Nutritionists are in agreement that adult diets should contain an average for the population of 18 grams of fibre per day (134).\nNot surprisingly, vegetarian diets are found to be far richer in fibre than average meat-based diets (254).\nDIABETES\nNon-Insulin Dependent Diabetes (NIDDM) is much more common than the childhood-onset variety (IDDM). It is estimated that 150 million worldwide people have NIDDM with 5% or 22.5 million adults in Europe affected, including two million in the UK. The WHO estimates that by 2025 there will be at least 300 million sufferer's worldwide. The cost implications are truly staggering. In Europe and the US 10-15% of total health care expenditure goes on NIDDM and associated complications. This amounts to \u00a32bn a year in the UK (216). By maintaining an appropriate weight, the risk of developing the disease is greatly diminished. Once again vegetarians \u2013 who as a group are typically leaner than omnivores \u2013 have a particular advantage in this aspect of health.\nNIDDM, which usually starts in middle adulthood, is strongly associated with an increased risk of CHD as well as kidney, nerve and eye disorders. In pregnant diabetics the disease may have an adverse effect on the foetus. Approximately 80% of NIDDM sufferers are obese. The incidence rate is close to double in people who are only moderately overweight (226).\nVegetarians and vegans are less at risk from diabetes than meat-eaters as a 21-year study in America found. Over 25,000 adult Americans were studied and the results showed that people on meat-free diets had a 45% reduced risk of developing diabetes compared to the population as a whole. Meat consumption was positively associated with self-reported diabetes in both males and females (140).\nNIDDM often improves with the right kind of diet and exercise. There is now very clear evidence that high-fibre, low-fat diets improve diabetic control (142, 228, 229) and can also lower insulin requirements (143). Significant reductions in fasting serum glucose (sugar) concentrations and body weight on a vegan diet can even occur in the absence of recommendations for exercise (141).\nDiabetic neuropathy is characterised by numbness and shooting or burning pains in the lower limbs. 21 diabetics suffering this condition volunteered to follow a vegan, wholefood diet and exercise program for 25 days. Within four to 16 days, 17 of the patients reported that the characteristic pain of neuropathy had been completely alleviated and although the numbness persisted it was noticeably improved within the 25 days of the program (144).\nA low-fat diet helps insulin work better because too much fat in the blood, or stored in the body, seems to inhibit absorption of insulin. A diet rich in complex carbohydrates and fibre means that the absorption of sugar is slow and steady, allowing it to pass into the bloodstream a little at a time rather than all at once. Thus dietitians recommend that wholegrain pasta, rice, bread and other complex carbohydrates as well as vegetables form the main part of any diabetic diet. All animal products contain a significant amount of fat and have no complex carbohydrates or fibre. A vegetarian diet is ideal for diabetics and can help minimise the doses of insulin needed and reduce the complications of the disease (28).\nDIVERTICULAR DISEASE\nDiverticular disease is one of the most common disorders of the colon among elderly people in Western societies where small pouches (diverticuli) form in the wall of the intestine and become inflamed. Aldoori et al examined the association between diet and this disease using data from a prospective cohort of nearly 48,000 US men and a four-year follow up. A combination of total fat, red meat and a diet low in total dietary fibre was found to increase risk. The hypothesis for this was that under the influence of red meat, bacteria might produce a 'toxic metabolite' that weakens the wall of the colon and favours the formation of diverticuli. This may explain why vegetarians have a lower prevalence of diverticulosis than expected based solely on their higher fibre intake (238).\nFIBROMYALGIA\nFibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder whereby muscle pain and tenderness occur over much of the body. Approximately 3 to 4% of women have the condition and the cause is likely to be in the unusual way the nervous system reacts to normal sensations. It occurs much less frequently in men (240). A Finnish group of sufferers when put on a vegan diet found that this animal-free diet alleviated the symptoms of fibromyalgia. It seems that certain foods aggravate the disease symptoms, the most common of which include chocolate, coffee, citrus fruits, alcohol and meat (241).\nFOOD POISONING\nAlthough food poisoning is particularly serious for children, adults too of course can also be affected by contaminated food. Salmonella, Listeria, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are all harboured in animal products. A well-publicised case of an E. coli outbreak occurred at the end of 1996 in Lanarkshire, Scotland. There were 272 confirmed cases and 450 people were thought to be affected. 27 people died as a result of this outbreak which was eventually traced to a butchers shop (35). As more meat and cow's milk is consumed and farming becomes more intensive, so the number of people being poisoned continues to rise. Way back in 1989, in response to national epidemics of foodborne infection with Salmonella and Listeria, the Secretary Of State for Health and the then MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) set up a study to investigate infectious intestinal (gut) diseases (IID). One important finding of this study was that a group of six foods was associated with a very consistent and statistically significant lower risk of IID \u2013 up to 70% less risk. Four of these foods would be everyday constituents of a vegetarian diet \u2013 pulses, salad, fruit and rice. Causal mechanisms for such an effect could include food consumption changing the intestinal flora (by exposure to other micro-organisms and fibre) or boosting general or specific immunity. Specific immunity could be boosted by repeated exposure to low dose of micro-organisms in food whilst general immunity could be boosted by ingestion of micronutrients, particularly antioxidants, in foods like fresh fruit andvegetables. This committee concluded by saying that the sorts of food already recommended for the prevention of heart disease and cancers \u2013 such as pulses, salads and fruit \u2013 may also have a protective effect against Infectious Intestinal Diseases (224).\nGALLSTONES\nGallstones are composed chiefly of cholesterol crystals and are formed when bile becomes saturated with cholesterol. Women are far more likely to develop them than men and obese people are four times more likely to suffer (145).\nThe condition is far more common in affluent societies and in people who consume meat and dairy foods. In women, prevalence increases steadily from around 5 per cent in young adulthood to around 30 per cent in old age. Approximately one quarter of cases will require either surgical removal of the gallbladder or physical or chemical dissolution of the stones (146).\nHowever, diet can prevent such drastic action. Fibre intake is effective in reducing cholesterol saturation of the bile since fibre can block the recycling of the bile acids from the intestine and increase the amounts of bile and metabolites excreted in the faeces. The WHO therefore recommends a starchy diet as a protective measure for this reason and because it may help reduce the problem of excessive weight (147).\nA study in the British Medical Journal confirms this advice. This research found that non-vegetarians have about a two fold increase in risk of developing gallstones than vegetarians, even after controlling for potentially confounding factors. The main risk factors appear to be low fibre intake, saturated fat and cholesterol intake and obesity (148).\nHYPERTENSION\nHypertension (high blood pressure) has a number of possible causes including stress, alcohol, obesity and diet and increases the tendency for blockages to form in the arteries. Many people with high blood pressure do not even realise they are suffering from this condition. In 1997 one in 10 men and women aged 45 to 54 and four in 10 men and five in 10 women aged 75 and over in England had high blood pressure (249). Vegetarians suffer much less from hypertension than omnivores and adopting a vegetarian diet significantly lowers blood pressure in both normal and hypertensive individuals (149, 150, 151, 152). According to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine: \u0093This effect is independent of changes in body weight and salt or fat intake and is not fully accounted for by the presence or absence of any nutrient or group of nutrients.\u0094 (154).\nTwo studies looking at blood pressure changes that occur with vegan diets illustrate the exciting potential of plant-based diets in controlling hypertension.\nAs long ago as 1984, Lindahl and colleagues demonstrated the sort of changes that can occur on a vegan diet. 29 patients who had suffered from hypertension for an average of eight years, all of whom were taking medication, were put on a vegan diet for one year. In almost all cases medication was withdrawn or drastically reduced. A number of reported symptoms disappeared and there was significant decrease in both systolic (contraction of the heart) blood pressure and diastolic (resting period between heartbeats) blood pressure (153).\nMuch more recently in 1995 a study on the blood pressure-lowering effects of a vegan diet found that in just 12 days on such a diet beneficial changes in blood pressure were found. Blood pressure for all patients fell from 128/75 to 119/71 mm Hg (mercury) on average representing a 6% fall. Participants with higher blood pressures at the beginning of the trial had even greater reductions in blood pressure (155).\nA study published in 2001 in Archives of Internal Medicine makes the compelling point that high blood pressure needs to be tackled early in life. This research tracked a cohort (group) of over 10,000 men aged 18 to 39 years from the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry. The authors concluded that in young adult men, blood pressure above normal was significantly related to increased long-term mortality due to CHD. Thus, population-wide primary prevention, early detection and control of hypertension are indicated from young adulthood on (219). A vegetarian diet can undoubtedly play a major role in helping to reduce the incidences of hypertension in the general population.\nINFERTILITY\nLactase enzymes allow the digestion of lactose (milk sugar) to galactose and glucose (sugars). Whilst the majority of the world's adult population do not possess sufficient of these enzymes (see also under Lactose Intolerance section below), some populations are still able to break down lactose. There is clinical and experimental evidence that galactose arising from this breakdown may be toxic to ovarian germ cells. Dr Daniel Cramer of Harvard University has found significant correlations between a greater ability to digest lactose, greater cow's milk consumption, lower fertility rates and greater decline in fertility with ageing. The mechanism hypothesised for this is that the galactose resulting from the break down of lactose damages the ovaries (157). Whilst Dr Cramer's work makes no claims of causality between cow's milk consumption and reduced fertility it does highlight possible links, suggesting that lactose consumption and digestion may have potent negative effect's on human ovarian function. Cow's milk is indispensable for calves but its affect on human reproduction may not be so beneficial.\nKIDNEY DISEASE\nAccording to the American Dietetic Association: \u0093A well-planned vegetarian diet may be useful in the prevention and treatment of renal [kidney] disease. Studies... suggest that some plant proteins may increase survival rates and decrease proteinuria [proteins in the urine]... and histological renal damage [kidney tissue damage] compared with a non-vegetarian diet.\u0094 (160).\nKidney stones affect three times more men than women and more whites than blacks or Asians. Between 30 and 50 per cent of people who have had a kidney stone will suffer a second one within five years but diet can reduce those odds dramatically. Drinking plenty of water and adopting a high potassium, low sodium (salt) diet can help. Plant foods such as fruits, beans and vegetables are all naturally high in potassium and low in sodium. Salt, sugar and animal protein are all implicated as problem foods. As Dr Neal Barnard states: \u0093Animal protein is the worst enemy of people with a tendency toward kidney stones, or any kidney disease for that matter.\u0094 (161).\nAnimal protein tends to overwork the kidneys which in turn can cause a gradual decline in their ability to carry out their function in filtering waste from the body in the form of urine. Animal protein is high in sulphur-containing amino acids and these tend to leach calcium from the bones where it is excreted in the urine and may form stones. Meat and eggs contain two to five times more of these sulphur containing amino acids than are found in grains and beans (163). Vegetarian diets would therefore be expected to show less wear and tear on the kidneys than meat-based ones. A Harvard study found that intake of animal protein was directly associated with the risk of kidney stone formation. Researchers here found that an increase in animal protein from less than 50g per day to 77g per day was associated with a 33% increased risk of stones in men (164).\nResearch published in 1996 found that a vegan diet can be regarded as a valid alternative to the standard conventional low-protein diet (CLPD) that is the nutritional treatment for patients with chronic renal failure. The authors concluded that not only could the problems of poor palatability and high costs of the CLPD be solved by the vegan diet but that additional advantages came from such a diet too. Compared with the conventional diet the vegan diet offered a high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, the absence of cholesterol and lower net acid production (165).\nLACTOSE INTOLERANCE\nLactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose \u2013 the sugar found in cow's milk. Whilst infants, by necessity, nearly always have the lactase enzymes necessary to digest their mother's milk, these enzymes gradually diminish as they are weaned. This is the norm. Adults therefore have very little lactose and can experience a whole range of unpleasant digestive symptoms such as bloating and diarrhoea if cow's milk is drunk but not tolerated. Current estimates put a figure of some four to five million people in the UK being lactose intolerant (158). In the US it affects as many as 25% of the adult population (50 million) and a staggering 75% of the population worldwide are thought to be lactose intolerant! (159). Far from being an illness, lactose intolerance is now regarded as simply normal whilst those adults who retain the infant enzymes to digest milk are called \u0093lactase persistent\u0094 (230). Far from being the most natural food in the world cow's milk is beginning to be seen as implicated in a whole host of disease conditions. Indeed very recent research is now suggesting that in a large majority of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients \u2013 a commonly diagnosed functional bowel disorder \u2013 lactose intolerance is the primary cause of this debilitating condition. This led the authors of this piece of research to strongly recommended that lactose malabsorption is excluded before diagnosing IBS (259).\nOVERWEIGHT & OBESITY\nNot only can being overweight affect a patient's self-esteem and psychological state, it can kill. Obesity is a \u0093risk factor for CHD and stroke and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in many other diseases.\u0094 (166). Currently, over half of women and about two thirds of men are overweight or obese.\nAlong with CHD, the WHO states that obesity is linked to hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, gallstones and other gastrointestinal disorders. Fat deposited abdominally is thought to be of particular concern. In addition, obese women face an increased risk of cancers of the gallbladder, breast (after menopause), and uterus; in men, obesity may increase the risk of cancers of the prostate and kidney. The importance of these health risks increase according to the severity of the obesity (168).\nThe advice to follow a low-fat, high-fibre diet and to embark on regular exercise does not seem as simple to follow as it is to prescribe. Psychologically, dieting has caused problems in many thousands of people and eating disorders have become associated with the dis-satisfaction felt with one's body. The WHO recognise the difficulty in encouraging obese people to slim: \u0093In view of the great difficulty of treating obesity, a preventative policy seems the only long-term solution.\u0094 (169).\nEncouraging children to eat a healthy diet all their lives is the best prevention against obesity and associated diseases. A vegetarian or vegan diet provides every nutrient necessary and plenty of complex carbohydrates without the excess fat \u2013 particularly saturated animal fat \u2013 that is so clearly associated with this condition. Quite simply non-meat eaters are thinner than meat-eaters! (260).\nOSTEOPOROSIS\nOsteoporosis \u2013 porous or brittle bones \u2013 is the major cause of bone fractures in the elderly and is characterised by loss of bone mass. The number of hip fractures in the elderly is increasing, reaching epidemic levels in many affluent countries. After the age of 50 osteoporosis will affect a staggering one in three women and one in 12 men in the UK. Worldwide about 1.7 million people, mostly post-menopausal women, suffer hip fractures annually.\nBone density increases in all parts of the skeleton during childhood and adolescence, with peak bone mass being reached by your mid-thirties. The normal rise in bone density is governed by genetic, hormonal, activity and nutritional factors and it is these factors that may prove very important in determining whether an individual will eventually develop osteoporosis (170).\nDifferent sources of dietary protein have differing effects on bone metabolism. In 1992, Abelow proposed that acid production in the body from a high animal protein diet might lead to bone buffering and dissolution. His team found a strong, positive association between hip fracture rates and intakes of dietary animal protein in different countries (171). This reflects research findings from nearly 30 years ago which found that North Alaskan Eskimos that are very highly dependent on animal foods had an earlier onset and greater intensity of bone loss compared with a non-Alaskan reference population (172).\nMore recently in 2001, Sellmeyer et al carried out a prospective cohort study and likewise found that elderly women with a high dietary ratio of animal to vegetable protein intake had a greater risk of hip fracture than those with a low ratio. The authors concluded that this suggests an increase in vegetable protein intake and a decrease in animal protein intake may decrease bone loss (173).\nThe mechanism by which plant proteins \u2013 unlike animal proteins \u2013 seem to protect bone health is thought to centre around not only plant proteins having a lesser acidifying effect but also on the role of phosphorus. Zemel demonstrated that the lower level of sulphur amino acids coupled with the higher phosphorus content of soya for instance has a positive effect on calcium excretion such that calcium balance is maintained even when calcium intakes are modest (179).\nThe benefits of a greater emphasis on plant foods were demonstrated by a study published in 1999. This research observed that greater potassium and magnesium intake from high intakes of fruit and vegetables was associated with less decline in bone mineral density (BMD). These results suggest that alkaline-producing dietary components from a diet rich in fruit and vegetables contribute to the maintenance of BMD (174).\nDespite our fixation with drinking cow's milk (principally for calcium) to prevent osteoporosis, comparisons between countries show that those with the highest calcium intakes actually have the highest risk of osteoporosis. Once again it seems that dairy products act in the same way as meat, being as they are acid-causing protein foods which may cause the loss of the very calcium that they supply (175). A number of studies have lent support to the view that drinking cow's milk may actually increase the risk of fracture. A study in 1994 of elderly men and women in Sydney, Australia showed that higher dairy product consumption was associated with increased fracture risk. Those with the highest dairy product consumption had approximately double the risk of hip fracture than those with the lowest consumption (176). The Harvard Nurses' Health Study followed over 77,000 women, aged 34 to 59 for 12 years. This piece of research found that those who derived more calcium from cow's milk actually had slightly, but significantly, more fractures than those who drank little or no cow's milk (177).\nA study comparing more than 1,600 vegetarians and meat-eaters found that meat-eating women in their 80's had lost twice as much mineral content from their bones as had the vegetarians (178).\nThere are many excellent sources of calcium apart from cow's milk which don't have the disadvantages of this food \u2013 such as high protein content (decreasing the fat content of milk simply increases the protein content) and saturated fat. Dark green vegetables provide calcium which, except for spinach, appear to be of greater or equal bioavailability than that of cow's milk. Calcium absorption from kale for instance is higher than from cow's milk (180). Other good sources of calcium are watercress, broccoli, pulses, tofu, dried fruit (especially figs), nuts (especially almonds) and sesame seeds (tahini is sesame seed paste and an easily usable source of calcium). Natural daylight also helps the body produce Vitamin D, which encourages the storage of calcium. Being out in the sun is therefore important, as is keeping active which is vital for helping to keep bones strong. It is also very likely that a more plant-based diet will need less calcium in the first place. A paper by Nordin in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition recently calculated that a reduction in animal protein intake from a reference value of 60 to 20 grams per day reduces the theoretical calcium requirement from about 750mg per day to 550mg per day (262). This reflects the view that high intakes of protein \u2013 in particular animal protein \u2013 encourage loss of calcium from the bone. If the animal protein is removed from the diet then less calcium will be required in the first place. Indeed in a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that subjects on a vegetarian diet had less then half the calcium losses than those on a typical meat-based diet (162).\nPREMATURE DEATH\nThe Oxford Study \u2013 part of the EPIC study \u2013 published results in 1994 of its examination of the diets of 11,000 people over a period of 13 years and found that vegetarians have a 20% lower premature death rate than meat-eaters (181). Vegetarians live longer!\nThe American Dietetic Association states: \u0093Studies indicate that vegetarians often have lower morbidity and mortality rates from several chronic degenerative diseases than do non-vegetarians\u0094 (182).\nThe people of Okinawa, a Japanese group of islands, are the longest-lived healthiest population in the world. Dr Makoto Suzuki, Professor and Head of Gerontology at Okinawa International University is the principal investigator on a 25-year study into diet, health and longevity. He, along with other scientists, have been investigating why the people of this island enjoy such good health. One of the keys to their longevity, apart from exercise and lifestyle factors is a diet based on wholegrains, vegetables, fruit and soya products. Indeed the islanders have one favourite recipe the scientific experts call 'immortal pat\u00e9'. No surprises here \u2013 the pat\u00e9 is vegan and doesn't contain a speck of animal fat \u2013 meat or dairy! It is based simply on tofu (soya bean curd), miso (fermented soya bean paste), mushrooms and garlic (271).\nRHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS\nRheumatism is the term given to any painful state of the supporting structures of the body \u2013 bones, ligaments, joints, tendons or muscles. Arthritis is a form of rheumatism in which joints have become inflamed and refers to many different diseases. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease whereby the immune system of the body attacks its own tissues \u2013 here its own cartilage and joint linings. Meat, dairy produce and eggs can all be triggers for arthritis and can also encourage hormone imbalances that may contribute to joint pain (183).\nSeveral studies have looked at the effects of meat-free and dairy-free diets on RA. In one of the earliest studies, 60% of patients put onto a vegan diet felt better as a result. They experienced less pain and reported improved functional capacity (187). Kjeldsen-Kragh et al, assessed the effect of a vegetarian diet on RA in a randomised, single-blind controlled trial. This means that the participants in the trial are randomly allocated by a process equivalent to the flip of a coin to either one intervention (here, a vegetarian diet) or another (in this case the control group being 26 patients who ate an ordinary mixed diet throughout the whole study period). Single-blind normally means that subjects do not know which treatment they are receiving. In the case of dietary interventions this is obviously not possible, thus for this study single-blind refers to the fact that the clinical examinations done after starting the diet were performed by a single physician who did not know the group to which the patient had been allocated. 27 arthritic patients ate a gluten-free (gluten is a protein principally found in wheat) vegan diet for three and a half months after an initial seven to 10 day fast, then a lactovegetarian (vegetarian diet where cow's milk is included) diet for the remainder of one year. After just four weeks, patients on the vegetarian diet showed significant improvements in pain levels, number of tender and swollen joints, morning stiffness, grip strength and several blood chemistry parameters. In the control group of patients (ie those on the mixed diet), only pain scores improved. When the two groups were compared after 13 months, a statistically significant improvement was seen in the diet group for all indices except platelet count and haemoglobin (184).\nA recent systematic review of controlled studies on vegetarian diets and RA supports the view that a short period of fasting followed by a vegetarian diet can cause clinically relevant long-term improvement in patients with RA. A systematic review is a summary of relevant literature in which evidence on the topic has been analysed in a systematic (ie standardised and objective) way and is given the greatest weight in the order of relative merit of the different types of study that can be carried out. The authors of this review concluded that vegetarian diets might be useful in the treatment of RA (185).\nA recent paper in the British Journal of Nutrition took the ecological approach to study the links between diet and RA. Here, a measure of disease at the national level is compared statistically with various components of national consumer food supply for a number of countries. Fat from meat and offal was found to have the highest statistical association with the prevalence of RA. The statistical correlations for meat and offal were almost as high as those for their fat. Three possible factors that may contribute to the inflammation of RA were fat, iron and nitrite. The author concluded that \u0093it is hypothesised that meat and offal may be a major factor contributing to the inflammation in RA.\u0094 (186).\nSTROKES\nA stroke is sudden damage to brain tissue caused either by a lack of blood supply or rupture of a blood vessel. The affected brain cells die and the parts of the body these cells control cease to function. A major reason why blood supply to the brain may be interrupted is due to the furring or hardening up of the arteries. This atherosclerotic process is accelerated in particular by hypertension and diabetes. As we have previously seen saturated animal fat is a prime cause of furred up arteries. Strokes cause about 12% of all deaths in England and about 30% of all people who have a stroke die within a few weeks. Of the remainder, about half will have significant continuing disabilities. It is estimated that approximately \u00a31.6 billion is used in treating, rehabilitating and providing care for people who have suffered strokes in the UK (188). Since vegetarians typically suffer less from high blood pressure than meat-eaters and this is a major risk factor for a stroke, it would seem a sensible policy to encourage the adoption of such a diet in order to reduce the risk of this condition.\nCHILDREN'S EATING HABITS\nWhilst it is vitally important to determine the sorts of foods children should be encouraged to eat it is also important to look at why children may or may not eat certain foods. Three major determinants that affect children's food choice are parental food choices, food advertising and parental income.\nPARENTAL FOOD CHOICES\nHealthy food habits learnt early in childhood form the basis for continued healthy eating throughout life. Earlier experiences of a particular food are one major factor that affects children's food acceptance patterns. In other words teach children the importance of eating healthily when young and they are more likely to continue with their healthy eating pattern throughout life. Conversely, let children eat nutrient-poor foods from an early age and it is far more difficult to switch food preference patterns towards healthier options. It is interesting to note that humans seem to have a built-in bias to respond negatively to new foods but this can be reduced by repeated exposure to the novel food (189). So the message to parents is clear \u2013 it may well take a dozen or so attempts to get a child to accept an unfamiliar food but never give up introducing fresh fruits and vegetables into the diet!\nFOOD ADVERTISING\nNo one can be in any doubt about the enormous influence that advertising has on everyone's life. Advertisers claim that adverts do not create a demand for product groups \u2013 ie a preference for high-fat foods over low-fat foods \u2013 rather they are designed instead to encourage brand switching by consumers. However, even at the tender age of three children demonstrate high recognition rates of brand logos for products \u2013 for instance properly matching the McDonalds arches to a hamburger! (190).\nSustain (formerly The National Food Alliance) published two reports concerning the issue of food advertisements and children. They found that in 1992 the advertising industry spent \u00a3523 million on advertising food and soft drinks. They also found that food advertising on television, particularly during children's programming, presents a grossly imbalanced nutritional message. Fatty and sugary foods account for a disproportionately large percentage of all food advertising while there are few adverts for healthier options (191, 192). And the link between television viewing and consumption of certain foods seems to be robust. Hitchings and Moynihan found that there was a relationship between foods for which children could remember the adverts of and the number of foods which the child ate (231). Of course television is not the only medium where food messages are displayed. Food advertising is found everywhere and increasingly schools are a rich avenue of indirect and direct food advertising.\nPARENTAL INCOMES\nBuying fresh fruit and vegetables can be costly for parents on low incomes and it is therefore not surprising that this limits intake. However, a healthy start in life is essential to the long-term well-being of children and new patterns of shopping may need to be learned. A major report published in 1994 concerning nutrition in low income families states: \u0093It is widely recognised that members of poorer households in the UK and other European countries, in the United States and Australasia, are more likely to be ill, or to die in infancy, or at an early age when adult, then those in richer households.\u0094 (193). A good diet for children is clearly crucial.\nThe report went on to say that \u0093Those who regularly cooked from fresh or raw ingredients, rather than opening packets or jars, or having 'something on toast' achieved healthier dietary variety for themselves and their children... Those who aimed to keep their children happy by buying what they like to eat had very unhealthy dietary patterns.\u0094 (194). This shows that despite what children may think, they don't always know what is best for them and sometimes a healthy diet must be encouraged or even insisted upon.\nThe report also discovered that those parents who expressed concern about providing a healthy diet for their children did make a considerable difference to their diet, despite being on a low income. That \u0093even lone parents who were in the poorest categories but who said they looked for 'fresh' food in shopping had higher variety and healthy diet indices than those who did not.\u0094 (195). So, even on the lowest incomes, it is possible to make vast improvements in the diets of children. However, it has been shown that many low-income families simply cannot afford to risk changing their diets as the food may not be eaten. The ironic consequence of this is that children from low-income families often see themselves as eating more of what they enjoy than their affluent peers as mothers provide foods which they like in order to prevent waste (196). Whilst acknowledging this, strategies to help achieve healthier diets could include buying seasonal fruits and vegetables which are cheaper, buying from markets instead of supermarkets, buying basic raw ingredients (such as rice, pasta, beans and bread) instead of pre-packaged meals, limiting the amount of junk foods eaten (eg chips and burgers) and limiting more expensive foods eaten \u2013 for instance by substituting pulses like beans (soya, baked beans, kidney beans, chickpeas) lentils and peas in place of expensive meat and dairy products.\nBUT EATING MEAT IS NATURAL, ISN'T IT?\nNot so! Take a look at how we have evolved alongside our close relative, the vegan gorilla, and then compare us to obligate carnivores such as tigers. We have no claws for ripping flesh, we do not have the type of canines necessary to tear flesh from bones and our jaw shape is entirely wrong for capturing and killing live prey. Very few of us have the speed necessary to catch any prey even if we wanted to but the truth is that most of us don't have that bloodlust either.\nProfessor Sanders Head of Nutrition at Kings College London states: \u0093...meat is an optional rather than an essential constituent of human diets.\u0094 (255).\n\u0093Although human beings eat meat, we are not natural carnivores. No matter how much fat carnivores eat, they do not develop atherosclerosis [clogged up arteries]. When we kill animals to eat them, they end up killing us because their\nflesh, which contains cholesterol and saturated fat, was never intended for human beings, who are natural herbivores.\u0094\nWC Roberts MD editor-in-chief of the American Journal of\nCardiology (278).\nOur intestines are certainly not appropriate for a meat-based diet. They are very long in relation to our body and this is because vegetable matter takes a long time to digest. The entire human digestive track (alimentary canal) is roughly eight to nine metres in length, most of its length taken up by the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) which are about six metres in length. In the course of its passage along the gut, food will typically spend three to five hours in the stomach, four hours travelling along the small intestine and from six to 20 hours in the large intestine. Carnivores on the other hand have a very short intestine, designed to absorb all the nutrients in the meat as quickly as possible.\nAmerican doctor, Neal Barnard, has looked at how humans have even survived the evolutionary change in our diet. If the dangers of meat-eating affected people before the age of reproduction, he says, we as a species would have to adapt to it but since its damage is usually done after the age of reproduction there is no imperative to change. Each generation must face its dangers over again as we do not seem to learn (197).\nZoologist Desmond Morris wrote in The Naked Ape: \u0093We were driven to become flesh eaters only by environmental circumstances, and now that we have the environment under control, with elaborately cultivated crops at our disposal, we might be expected to return to our ancient primate feeding patterns.\u0094 (198). Meat eating is thought to have begun only in the last one-and-a-half million years. Colin Spencer \u2013 expert vegetarian cookery writer and one-time food columnist for The Guardian \u2013 puts this into context: \u0093Contrasted with the life of an 80-year old human being it means that only in the last 15 years would meat have been eaten. For 65 years we were vegetarian.\u0094 And even when early humans started eating meat the bulk of the diet would still have been plant foods (250). One thing is certain, never in human history have we eaten as much meat as we routinely eat today and the consequences of this are all too apparent.\nDrinking the milk of another species obviously could not occur until after animals were domesticated. The first evidence of milk production comes from about 4000 BC and so actually represents a very recent acquisition to the diet in evolutionary terms (217). Milk from a lactating mother is meant for babies \u2013 it's an odd concept for adults to drink it at all \u2013 and from another species too! Why not eat regurgitated food like many baby animals are weaned onto \u2013 an equally bizarre notion!\nNo mammal, including humans, are meant to drink milk after weaning. Therefore it is not surprising that lactose (milk sugar) maldigestion is the norm for adults of all mammalian species, including our own. The few who can digest cow's milk may be able to cope in the short-term with its digestion but may not be so well adapted to cope with the many possible long-term consequences \u2013 ovarian problems due to galactose, insulin dependent diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease and obesity. It's a catalogue of disasters and yet we feed food designed for calves to children whenever possible because we are told it is good for them. The evidence does not support that view.\nVEGETARIAN VITALITY\nThe WHO recommends a diet that \u0093is characterised by frequent consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals and legumes, and contrasts sharply with current diets drawing substantial amounts of energy from whole-milk products, fatty meats, and refined sugars.\u0094 (200).\nEvery macronutrient \u2013 protein, carbohydrate, essential fats and fibre and every micronutrient \u2013 vitamin and mineral \u2013 can easily be gained from a meat-free, milk-free diet \u2013 it is, after all, how we are designed to live. How would Martina Navratilova and nine-time gold medal Olympic runner Carl Lewis have attained the very highest sporting achievements if it were not perfectly possible \u2013 and a whole lot healthier \u2013 to get by without meat and cow's milk?\nPROTEIN\nThe Western diet consists of far too much animal protein and this is linked to many different diseases. Traditional rural Chinese diets consume far less animal protein than do Western countries. For example the proportion of total protein in China as animal protein is approximately 11% whereas in the USA it is roughly 70%. The reduced incidence of a number of common Western degenerative diseases seen in China appear to reflect this much lower intake of animal protein (201).\nVegetable protein is everywhere and it is impossible to suffer a deficiency, unless you go out of your way to do so! Protein can be found in all pulses (beans of all sorts, peas and lentils); grains and grain products such as breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, rice and oats; nuts and seeds. The WHO states: \u0093Protein requirements are readily met in children and adults eating a varied diet based predominantly on cereals and pulses.\u0094 (202). Such diets typically provide 10-15% of their energy in the form of protein and are perfectly adequate. The humble soya bean \u2013 used in many soya products such as soya burgers, soya milk and tofu (soya bean curd) \u2013 is nutritionally equivalent to meat, containing as it does all the building blocks (amino acids) of protein.\nCARBOHYDRATES\nCarbohydrates are our main and most important source of energy. There are basically three types of carbohydrate: fast-releasing (simple sugars) such as refined processed foods like table sugar, white flours, sweets and syrups; slow-releasing or complex carbohydrates such as wholegrains (oats, bread, rice, pasta, rye) and fibre \u2013 the indigestible part of fruits, vegetables and grains, essential for the digestive system to work properly. The WHO suggest we should all be eating far more carbohydrates (mainly slow-releasing ones) than we do \u2013 55 to 70 per cent of our diet should ideally be made up of them. The WHO state that: \u0093Studies have consistently shown that diets rich in starchy carbohydrates favour a lower incidence of several cancers, limit the occurrence of hyperlipidemia, and assist in the management of diabetes and other metabolic diseases. These diets also help to limit excessive weight gain... Foods rich in complex carbohydrates have beneficial effects on intestinal function, on the chemistry of the gut and on the physiology of the gut wall. In addition, starch foods from plants are an especially rich source of many minerals and vitamins, including essential fatty acids, calcium, zinc, iron and a variety of water-soluble vitamins, all known to have a clear and positive effect on health.\u0094 (218). A vegetarian diet \u2013 based as it is on carbohydrate-rich plant foods \u2013 is the perfect choice for providing the large amounts of carbohydrate human bodies need for good health.\nFIBRE (NSP)\nAlso known as non-starch polysaccharide (NSP), dietary fibre is an essential component of the diet. It refers to the carbohydrates that escape digestion in the mouth, stomach and small intestine and thus pass on to the colon. Although we gain no nutrients from it directly, it is essential for sweeping out the bowels and keeping them healthy. Through its effects on stool bulking, fibre helps to prevent constipation and haemorrhoids. By speeding up intestinal transit time, fibre may reduce the duration of exposure of intestinal tissues to noxious agents in the diet or secreted in the small intestine. Fibre also affects the rate of release and absorption of glucose and therefore has a role in the treatment of diabetes. Because fibre-rich food prolongs the time for gastric-emptying, and because fibre-rich foods tend to have a lower calorific density, diets rich in fibre may decrease the urge to eat and hence assist in appetite control (199). Fibre may also help reduce blood cholesterol. It isn't hard to find fibre \u2013 just eat a vegetarian diet and you will eat it in abundance. Fibre is only found in foods of plant origin \u2013 fruit, vegetables and wholegrains such as cereals, breads, pasta, rice and oats. Meat and dairy produce contain none.\nFATS\nAlthough fat is an essential component of the diet most Western diets contain far too much. Around 15 to 30 per cent of our energy should come from fat but the WHO states that it may prove necessary to lower the upper limit for total fat from 30 per cent of energy to 25 per cent or perhaps 20 per cent (204). Too much fat in the diet can cause excessive weight gain and there is no biological need for saturated (mainly animal) fat in the diet. Saturated fats increase cholesterol levels and can lead to heart disease and cancers. What we do need in the diet are the unsaturated, so-called essential fats. Vegetarian and vegan diets are rich in these essential fats \u2013 found abundantly in seeds, nuts, beans, avocados and vegetable oils.\nCALCIUM\nCow's milk does not have a monopoly on calcium. There are plenty of excellent sources of calcium from the plant kingdom and they have the added advantage that they don't come packaged with saturated fat. Good plant-derived sources of calcium are tofu (soya bean curd whereby cooked soya beans are precipitated with calcium sulphate), green leafy vegetables such as watercress, broccoli and parsley, nuts (especially almonds) and seeds (especially sesame). White flour is fortified with calcium in the UK so white bread can be an important source of this mineral and people living in hard water areas also obtain some calcium from tap water.\nMcCance and Widdowson's food tables provide details of exactly how much calcium is contained in these foods. Per 100g, dried, boiled soya beans contain 83mg of calcium; soya flour 210mg; tofu (steamed) 510mg; almonds 240mg; sesame seeds 670mg and tahini (sesame seed paste) 680mg. This compares to a calcium content per 100g of 57mg for eggs and 115 \u2013 120mg for whole, semi-skimmed, skimmed or pasteurised cow's milk (203). Most calcium-enriched soya milks contain an equivalent level of calcium to cow's milk.\nIRON\n750 million people worldwide suffer from iron deficiency anaemia which usually occurs when the amount of iron absorbed by the body is insufficient to meet the body's demands. This can be due to insufficient iron in the diet, chronic blood loss or the most important factor \u2013 poor iron absorption (205). The American Dietetic Association and the British Medical Association both state that vegetarians are no more likely to suffer from iron deficiency anaemia than omnivores (208, 220). Indeed the China Health Study found that Chinese adults consume twice as much iron on their predominantly vegetarian diets than do American adults on their meat-based diets and iron status is not compromised (209). Care however must be taken whatever diet is consumed to ensure adequate iron status and this is especially so for women of childbearing years.\nIron-rich plant sources include wholegrains (such as wholemeal bread or brown rice), nuts, dark green leafy vegetables, pulses, dried fruits, seeds and black treacle. Many breakfast cereals are also fortified with iron. The absorption of plant sources of iron is also increased by vitamin C. Meat and dairy foods contain no vitamin C but of course this vitamin is abundant in vegetarian diets from fruits and vegetables.\nIron status is also affected by the consumption of cow's milk. A review of published work relating to the association between feeding infants cow's milk and intestinal bleeding was carried out by Sullivan in 1993. He concluded that in some subjects whole cow's milk induced gastrointestinal blood loss appears sufficiently great to be nutritionally significant and may contribute to the development of iron deficiency anaemia (232). Other studies have also led researchers to state that cow's milk may increase the risk of poor iron status in young children (233, 234). High levels of calcium in dairy products are also known to interfere with the absorption of iron from the diet. Hallberg et al investigated this effect and found that milk and cheese can reduce iron absorption by around half (235). As far as iron status is concerned therefore dairy products can amount to a negative triple whammy \u2013 milk contains no iron itself, it can lead to intestinal bleeding and the calcium in dairy foods can reduce the amount of iron absorbed from those foods in a meal that do contain iron.\nWhilst iron from plant sources (non-haem iron) has always been viewed as an inferior source to haem iron from meat, there may in fact be an advantage in deriving dietary iron from plants rather than meat. Red blood cells need some iron to carry oxygen but excesses can be risky and it may not necessarily be the case that the more iron we consume the better. Iron is known to act as a potent free radical that can damage body cells and may increase the risk of plaque formation in the arteries. A number of studies have found support for the hypothesis that excess dietary iron intake is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (206, 207). A team from Harvard investigated the type of dietary iron that may be a problem. Researchers here found an increased risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) among men with higher intakes of haem iron \u2013 largely from red meat \u2013 and higher body iron stores. There is clearly a level at which body iron stores are at an optimum. Haem iron is absorbed regardless of iron status, potentially encouraging iron overload. Non-haem iron from plants on the other hand is efficiently regulated such that absorption is increased or decreased depending on body stores at any particular time (210). This means the body can absorb more iron when it needs it and less when it doesn't rather than having it pass straight into the bloodstream to excess.\nIODINE\nIodine is needed for the thyroid gland. This gland produces hormones that are essential for normal growth and physical and mental development. Cow's milk provides vegetarians with iodine partly because cattle feed contains this mineral. For vegans, dark green vegetables and Vecon vegetable stock supply iodine and sea vegetables such as dried seaweed are very rich sources.\nZINC\nZinc is involved in a huge number of enzyme systems. These include growth, immunity, protein synthesis, energy metabolism, red-blood cell synthesis and antioxidant functioning. Good sources of zinc are pulses, wholegrains, leafy green vegetables, nuts and seeds.\nVITAMIN A\nVitamin A is needed for the growth and normal development of tissues, vision and healthy skin. This vitamin comes in two forms \u2013 as the pre-formed vitamin A and as beta-carotene \u2013 a pre-cursor form of vitamin A which has antioxidant \u2013 disease-busting \u2013 properties. The beta-carotene form of vitamin A is only found in foods of plant origin especially orange, red and green-coloured fruit and vegetables \u2013 it is not found in foods of animal origin. Vegetarian and vegan diets therefore have ample amounts of beta-carotene and the body converts beta-carotene to vitamin A when required. Excess vitamin A e.g. from liver, can be toxic but vitamin A toxicity can never occur where it is derived from plant sources as the body regulates how much beta-carotene needs to be converted to vitamin A.\nB VITAMINS\nB1 (Thiamin) is found in plenty of plant foods including wholegrains such as wholemeal bread, yeast extract, brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, oats, black treacle and fortified breakfast cereals. When wheat flour is refined to make white flour, thiamin is lost which is why white flour in the UK is fortified with this vitamin. It is needed by the body to release energy from carbohydrates and fats.\nB2 (Riboflavin) is also widely available in plant foods such as yeast extract, wholegrains including wholemeal bread, almonds, seeds, black treacle and dates. Riboflavin is also needed by the body to help release energy from fats, carbohydrates and protein. The UK recommended daily intake is 1.3 mg, although the average Chinese daily intake is 0.8 mg and there is no evidence of deficiency (212).\nNiacin is another B-vitamin also needed to release energy from foods and for maintaining skin health. It is found in yeast extract, wholegrains including wholemeal bread, dates, nuts and seeds, peas and potatoes.\nB6 (Pyridoxine) is required for protein metabolism and the production of red blood cells. It is easily obtained in the diet from wholegrains including wholemeal bread, avocados, bananas, prunes, beans, dried fruits, seeds and nuts.\nFolate (Folic Acid) is required for protein synthesis, formation of blood, metabolism of DNA (the human genetic blueprint) and helps prevent neural tube defects in the developing foetus. It is found widely in a vegetarian diet in dark green leafy vegetables, pulses, avocado, nuts and beansprouts. A 1993 study found that children in all age and sex groups appeared to have lower intakes than recommended (213). A vegetarian diet can easily provide all that is needed. In fact, the American Dietetic Association states that vegetarian diets often have higher concentrations of folate (214) \u2013 hardly surprising since the major sources of folate are from plants.\nVitamin B12 (Cobalamin) is required for the maintenance of a healthy nervous system and normal blood formation. The recommended daily intake in the UK is just one and a half micrograms per day and a whole lifetime's requirement adds up to about one seventh the size of an average aspirin tablet (215). Deficiency is actually very rare. It is synthesised naturally only by micro-organisms (mainly bacteria) in the soil and in the intestines of ruminant animals, such as cattle and sheep. The liver has stores of B12 lasting up to 3 years and the body is also very efficient at reabsorbing it so little is lost from the body. This vitamin is therefore partly supplied by dietary intake and partly by this recycling.\nTraces of this vitamin may be found on poorly washed vegetable produce where bacteria in the soil particles are found but this is obviously not a reliable source in developed countries. However it is easily obtained in a vegetarian diet and in a vegan diet as many everyday food items such as breakfast cereals, yeast extracts, some margarines and soya milks have been fortified with this vitamin. New research from the Framingham Offspring Study \u2013 a prospective study into risk factors for heart disease \u2013 makes a very interesting point about best sources of vitamin B12. Results suggest that vitamin B12 from fortified breakfast cereals, supplements and dairy products may be more efficiently absorbed in the body than foods traditionally viewed as the best sources \u2013 meat, poultry and fish. The theory put forward here is that such foods are cooked before eaten and the heat effectively destroys the vitamin (272).\nVITAMIN C\nPrimates (including humans) \u2013 along with guinea-pigs \u2013 are the only animals which cannot synthesise vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in the body and a daily dietary source is therefore essential. It is required for healthy skin, teeth, bones and connective tissue, an aid to iron absorption, wound healing and proper functioning of the immune system. In a vegetarian diet ensuring adequate vitamin C intake is no problem whatsoever as it is found abundantly in all fruits and vegetables. Especially good sources are dark green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, berries and blackcurrants, kiwi and citrus fruits. Potatoes contain useful amounts of this vitamin in the average diet also. Since cooking destroys this vitamin, vegetables should be only lightly cooked or better still steamed and eating some raw vegetables is advised. Meat and dairy foods contain no vitamin C whatsoever.\nVITAMIN D\nVitamin D acts as both a vitamin and a hormone (a chemical messenger) that helps keep blood calcium at optimal levels and supports bone health during growth and throughout life. Along with vitamins A, E and K, vitamin D is fat-soluble which means there must be a source of fat in the diet for these vitamins to be absorbed. The main source of vitamn D is not actually from food but that manufactured inside the body from the action of sunlight on the skin. In the UK, vitamin D is made during the sunnier months of April and October and stored in the liver, thus ensuring adequate amounts of it are available year round. Although certain algae produce the vitamin the main food sources are margarines and breakfast cereals which have been fortified with it. Cow's milk is another source of the vitamin \u2013 not because it is naturally present but because cow's milk also has this vitamin added to it (275).\nFREE RADICALS\nDiscovered in the 1980s, free radicals are thought to play a part in causing some 60 diseases and are capable of wreaking havoc on healthy cells. Free radicals are unstable molecules, produced by everyday processes such as breathing and digestion whereby an electron is removed from the molecule, destabilising it. This molecule tries to regain its stability by snatching an electron from another molecule but this sets off a chain reaction in which the DNA may be damaged. Free radicals can also be created as a result of cigarette smoking, pollution, ultraviolet light, stress and cooking, in particular cooking red meat. The remedy for free radicals is antioxidants.\nANTIOXIDANTS\nBeta-carotene, vitamins C and E have antioxidant properties and are vital in preventing a whole range of diseases. None of them can be found in meat or cow's or goat's milk but are available abundantly in plant foods. Flavenol has also been added to the list of antioxidants and again this cannot be obtained from meat but rather only from red fruits and vegetables. A particular example is lycopene found in tomatoes \u2013 especially rich when tomatoes have been processed into tomato paste.\nTHE ADEQUACY OF VEGETARIAN DIETS FOR CHILDREN\nThis report makes it abundantly clear that a vegetarian diet is amply able to provide all the nutrients the body requires and may confer significant health advantages over diets predominantly based around animal products. For parents, of course, the number one consideration will be whether vegetarian diets are safe. With this in mind a look at published research concerning vegetarian diets and children should put every parents mind at rest.\n\u0093Children who grow up getting their nutrition from plant foods rather than meats have a tremendous advantage. They are less likely to develop weight problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, and some forms of cancer.\u0094 Dr Benjamin Spock, (1904-1998) Paediatrician, Medical Teacher and Researcher and author of \u0093Dr Spock's Baby and Child Care\u0094 which has sold 50 million copies worldwide since its first publication in 1946 (280).\nAn early review of the literature on vegetarian diets and children was published in 1988 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. This review found that infants who are breast-fed by women eating balanced vegan and vegetarian diets thrive in early infancy. Appropriate vegetarian diets were also found to adequately provide for each phase of growth in children. Unsurprisingly this review went on to say that such diets during childhood, where they are low in total and saturated fats, may be beneficial in reducing the risks associated with high blood fat levels and also help children maintain their ideal body weight (242).\nO'Connell et al reported in 1989 on a study to examine the effects of a vegetarian diet on child growth, height and weight of children aged four months to 10 years \u2013 known as The Farm Study. The actual vegetarian diet the children followed was a vegan one with the authors concluding that the growth of these children was similar to that of the reference (comparison) population and that there was no evidence of abnormality (243).\n\u0093The vegetarian diet is adequate for the nutritional needs of infants.\u0094 British Medical Association Report 1986 \u2013 Diet, Nutrition and Health (220).\nA more recent review of the diets and growth of children reared on vegetarian diets was carried out in 1995 by Sanders. Not only did the author find that children can be reared successfully on vegetarian and vegan diets but that such diets of schoolchildren were found to have a similar nutrient content to meat-based diets. An analysis of the data comparing vegan and omnivorous children revealed some interesting results. The vegan children had energy, protein, vitamin D and B-vitamins (including vitamin B12) intakes that were virtually the same. The differences in nutrient content illustrate the potential benefits a plant-based diet can have. Fat intake was lower in the vegan children, vitamins A (as beta-carotene), C and E intakes were higher and fibre, iron and folate intakes were nearly double. Although lower rates of growth have been reported in some vegan children during the first few years of life catch-up growth occurs by the age of 10. Thus the author states that: \u0093A vegetarian diet, if properly selected, can meet all of the requirements of the growing child.\u0094 (244).\nAnd more recently in a 1999 paper Professor Sanders states that: \u0093Well-balanced vegetarian diets are able to support normal growth and development.\u0094 (255).\nNathan, Hackett and Kirby conducted a one-year observational case-comparison study of the growth of vegetarian children (seven-11 years) compared with a matched control group of omnivorous children. Height, weight, upper arm skinfold thickness and mid-upper arm circumference measurements were taken and results suggested that children who followed a meat-free diet grew at least as well as children who ate meat (245). A review by two of these authors \u2013 Nathan and Hackett \u2013 and Burgess in 1998 concluded similarly that vegetarian diets can be adequate for children. Lacto-ovo-vegetarian children were found to consume diets closer to recommendations than omnivores and their pre-pubertal growth was at least as good. An important point made in this paper was that anaemia is probably the main risk of poor dietary selection but that this applies also to children brought up on an omnivorous diet. The authors also note that although vegetarian diets need to be well planned to ensure all nutrients are provided this comment is equally applicable to omnivorous diets (246).\nThe growth and physical fitness of Flemish vegetarian children, adolescents and young adults was assessed in a recent 1999 study and found that vegetarian children were physically as fit as the reference group and that the growth and maturation status of the vegetarian population were within the normal range. An interesting result from this study was that the vegetarians performed better in a step test than did the reference group. This test is used to predict maximal oxygen consumption capacity and led the authors to suggest that the vegetarian subjects had better cardio-respiratory endurance (247).\nThe most recent research on plant-only diets for infants and children was published in the June 2001 issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. The first of these papers on vegan infants stated that appropriately planned vegan diets can satisfy nutrient needs of infants. Further that the American Dietetic Association and The American Academy of Paediatrics both state that vegan diets can promote normal growth (263). The second paper dealing with vegan children takes this one stage further by stating that diets of vegan children meet or exceed recommendations for most nutrients and vegan children have higher intakes of fibre and lower intakes of total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol than omnivore children. The authors conclude that not only can vegan diets be adequate for children at all ages but that such diets may reduce the risk of some chronic diseases of adulthood that have their origins in childhood. Finally the authors state that since vegan children are exposed to a greater variety of whole plant foods this may help to establish healthful lifelong eating habits (264).\nCONCLUSION\nAll the evidence suggests that not only is an animal-free diet the healthiest diet for children (and adults) but that animal products are positively an unhealthy choice and can increase the risk of many fatal diseases and conditions.\nProfessor Colin Campbell, Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University and long time senior science advisor to the World Cancer Research Fund and organiser of the largest study into diet and health \u2013 The China Health Study \u2013 couldn't put it any plainer. He believes that humans are a vegetarian species whose risk of disease is increased by eating meat and animal products. And it's not simply good enough to put some elements of a vegetarian diet into practice \u2013 \u0093the closer one approaches a total plant food diet, the greater the health benefit.\u0094 (279). That: \u0093Animal foods, in general, are not really helpful and we need to get away from eating them.\u0094 (221).\nA diet free from animal produce is perfect for every stage of life: pregnant mothers, babies, toddlers, children, adolescents, teenagers and adults of all ages. It can prevent many diseases, cure many more and extend life. And why? Because it is the most natural diet in the world \u2013 it's how we're meant to live.\nRecommend foods for lifelong vitality, not foods to die for.\nWHAT DOES the VVF GAIN?\nOrganisations providing consumer information on meat and dairy foods are there for one reason and one reason only \u2013 to make money. As a charity VVF exists solely for an entirely different reason \u2013 to educate. VVF provides access to the mass of scientific research \u2013 much of which is little-publicised \u2013 concerning the potential health problems of diets based on animal products. In so doing, consumers are then able to make informed choices as to the diet best able to support good health throughout life. Parents, guardians and healthcare professionals have of course an additional reason as to why they need to get this choice right \u2013 others are under their care. The promotion of this report will not serve to increase the profit margins of a humble charity but will, if translated into sound nutritional advice, save lives \u2013 your own and those under your care. The same cannot be said of the huge and powerful bodies promoting meat and dairy products which are profit \u2013 not health \u2013 driven.\nREFERENCES\n1. Hoppu U et al, 2000.

Alzheimer's Disease... Bad Fat\nPeople with high cholesterol levels in mid-life are more likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s than those with low cholesterol, according to new research from California. From a group of 9,752 people (whose cholesterol had been measured in their 40s) 504 developed Alzheimer\u2019s. Those with high cholesterol levels in mid-life were 50 per cent more likely to develop this disease later in life.\n9. Calcium in Dairy Linked to Dementia\nToo much calcium may lead to dementia in the elderly, new research reveals. Scientists found that excess calcium in the diet can narrow the blood vessels in the brain leading to tissue damage (lesions) that may cause cognitive impairment, dementia, depression and stroke. The brains of 79 men and 153 women aged between 60 and 86 were scanned, and all were found to have a number of lesions. The findings, presented at the Experimental Biology meeting in Washington DC, suggest that the calcium in dairy foods may be responsible.\nThe same US team previously showed that people who consume high levels of fatty dairy produce have more lesions but fat intake alone was not a factor. This study provides support to the growing number of researchers concerned about the effects of too much calcium, particularly in older adults.\n10. Alzheimer's and the Link with Meat\nSymptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s are very similar to the brain-destroying infection Creutzfeltd Jakob disease (vCJD), the human form of mad cow disease. And there\u2019s little difference between them according to a recent book by Dr Murray Waldman, Toronto\u2019s coroner, who claims that Alzheimer\u2019s may well be caused by a rogue protein called a prion in much the same way that vCJD is. More than this, he believes the source of vCJD and Alzheimer\u2019s is identical \u2013 meat!\nWaldman sets out his reasons. In all prion diseases the brain is affected by dense deposits and dementia is the major symptom. In most cases these symptoms don\u2019t show until later in life and prior to that there are no indications that people are incubating the disease. There is no way of reversing it once it starts. Prion diseases were first described in medical literature around the start of the 20th century. The majority of cases are in the developed world with very few in countries such as India, Bangladesh and Nigeria. All these factors are true for Alzheimer\u2019s also.\nWaldman charts the growth of the meat industry and meat eating and relates this directly to the number of cases \u2013 the more meat, the more cases of Alzheimer\u2019s. The World Health Organisation\u2019s figures for meat consumption correlate almost exactly with Waldman\u2019s theory.\nThe organisations which were set up to represent AD victims must surely have made a similar connection? It seems not. \u201cBoth diseases involve proteins in the brain that somehow change shape and cause damage,\u201d says Dr Susanne Sorensen, head of research for the Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u201cBut they are different proteins and the diseases have a different biochemistry and a different pathology.\u201d\nSo what is the cause? \u201cMany of the risk factors for heart disease also apply to Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\nIt still puts meat squarely in the frame as those risk factors are saturated fat, cholesterol, high levels of a substance called homocysteine and high blood pressure, all caused largely by animal products.\nSuch an immediate rejection of the idea that prions may be involved seems a little arrogant considering that the man who discovered them, and won a Nobel Prize for his efforts, Professor Stanley Prusiner, believes they may well be. If this eminent scientist\u2019s instincts are correct then the way to avoid Alzheimer\u2019s entirely is to stop eating meat. If he\u2019s wrong and Dr Sorensen is right, the way to dramatically reduce your risk is to stop eating not just meat but dairy products also, along with seafood and eggs.\nDr Margaret Rayman (Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing \u2013 Optima) has brought together all this advice into a recommended diet to avoid the devastating disease that is Alzheimer\u2019s. It is, of course, entirely vegan and contains no animal products at all.\nFurther Resources\nTo obtain copies of the resources listed in this information sheet, contact the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation: 0117 970 5190; www.vegetarian.org.uk or by post: VVF, 8 York Court, Wilder Street, Bristol BS2 8QH\nReferences\nLancet. 369 (9557) 208-16.

On the same day, the VVF held a public talk \u2013 Why You Don\u2019t Need Dairy \u2013 with speakers:\nProfessor T. Colin Campbell: For more than 40 years Colin has been at the forefront of nutrition research. His legacy, the China Study, is the most comprehensive study of health and nutrition ever conducted. He is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University and Project Director of the China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project.\nJuliet Gellatley: founder and director of the largest vegetarian and vegan organisation in Europe, Viva!, and of the health charity, the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation.\nDr Justine Butler: health campaigner of the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation and author of the White Lies report.\nProfessor Jane Plant CBE: top scientist and author of best sellers \u2018Your Life in Your Hands \u2013 Understanding, Preventing and Overcoming Breast Cancer\u2019 and \u2018Prostate Cancer\u2019.\nThe VVF have produced an extensive report called White Lies investigating the links between the consumption of cow\u2019s milk and dairy products and health. White Lies includes forewords by Professor T. Colin Campbell PhD , Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and Professor Jane Plant CBE , (DSc, CEng), Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and Professor of Applied Geochemistry at Imperial College in London. The VVF\u2019s 40,000-word report includes over 200 references from the peer-reviewed scientific literature. The report describes the evidence linking a diverse range of health problems and diseases to dairy including some of the UK\u2019s biggest killers such as heart disease , diabetes , breast cancer and prostate cancer as well as osteoporosis , eczema , asthma , Crohn\u2019s disease , colic , constipation and even teenage acne .\nThe White Lies campaign is supported by\u2026.\nProfessor Jane Plant CBE (DSc, CEng), Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine Professor and Professor of Applied Geochemistry at Imperial College in London\u2026\u201c This report exposes the nature of the modern industrialised dairy industry and the serious implications that this has for our health. I do hope that White Lies receives the recognition it deserves and that this will embolden politicians to take a stand against the dairy industry \u201d.\nHeather Mills is a patron of the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation and supported us in the launch of White Lies on May 24, 2006. Quotes from Heather include :\nWhite Lies is the first review of its kind. The evidence is overwhelming \u2013 cow\u2019s milk and dairy products are neither natural nor healthy, in fact they are harmful to health and have been linked to a wide range of illnesses and diseases. Many of the key findings were discussed at the public talk on May 24 2006. Hot topics that the campaign and report cover include:\nHeart disease \u2013 What it is in milk and dairy products that can cause heart disease and how following a plant-based diet can reduce cholesterol and even reverse heart disease.\nDiabetes \u2013 Research shows that drinking cow\u2019s milk at an early age is strongly linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible people. Several different theories have been suggested that attempt to unravel the actual mechanism by which cow\u2019s milk causes diabetes; they all share a common theme.\nCancer \u2013 Nutrition plays a major role in cancer; a poor diet is the second largest preventable risk factor for cancer (coming close behind smoking) and an increasing body of evidence now links the consumption of cow\u2019s milk to certain cancers. What it is about modern dairy farming practices that concerns scientists studying certain cancers including cancers of the breast, ovaries, colon and prostate? And which types of food can protect against these, and other, diseases?\nObesity\nIn 2004 the UK Foods Standards Agency reported that 25 per cent of men and 20 per cent of women were classified as obese. The British Medical Association warns that childhood obesity levels have soared in the UK. Part of the problem is the increasing lack of physical activity but diet plays a major role in the obesity epidemic. The World Health Organisation blames the rise in obesity on a shift away from diets high in complex carbohydrates towards diets high in saturated fats and sugars. How do dairy foods contribute to the rising levels of obesity and what is the difference between \u2018good\u2019 fats and \u2018bad\u2019 fats?\nOsteoporosis and the calcium myth\nOsteoporosis is a growing problem in the UK; one in two women and one in five men will suffer a fracture after the age of 50! The science shows that shows that dairy is part of the problem rather than the solution, White Lies reveals why it is not the best source of calcium and describes how best to promote bone health in the young and old.\nPinta pus\nMilk containing up to 400 million pus cells per litre may be legally sold for human consumption!

On the same day, the VVF held a public talk \u2013 Why You Don\u2019t Need Dairy \u2013 with speakers:\nProfessor T. Colin Campbell: For more than 40 years Colin has been at the forefront of nutrition research. His legacy, the China Study, is the most comprehensive study of health and nutrition ever conducted. He is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University and Project Director of the China-Oxford-Cornell Diet and Health Project.\nJuliet Gellatley: founder and director of the largest vegetarian and vegan organisation in Europe, Viva!, and of the health charity, the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation.\nDr Justine Butler: health campaigner of the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation and author of the White Lies report.\nProfessor Jane Plant CBE: top scientist and author of best sellers \u2018Your Life in Your Hands \u2013 Understanding, Preventing and Overcoming Breast Cancer\u2019 and \u2018Prostate Cancer\u2019.\nThe VVF have produced an extensive report called White Lies investigating the links between the consumption of cow\u2019s milk and dairy products and health. White Lies includes forewords by Professor T. Colin Campbell PhD , Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and Professor Jane Plant CBE , (DSc, CEng), Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and Professor of Applied Geochemistry at Imperial College in London. The VVF\u2019s 40,000-word report includes over 200 references from the peer-reviewed scientific literature. The report describes the evidence linking a diverse range of health problems and diseases to dairy including some of the UK\u2019s biggest killers such as heart disease , diabetes , breast cancer and prostate cancer as well as osteoporosis , eczema , asthma , Crohn\u2019s disease , colic , constipation and even teenage acne .\nThe White Lies campaign is supported by\u2026.\nProfessor Jane Plant CBE (DSc, CEng), Life Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine Professor and Professor of Applied Geochemistry at Imperial College in London\u2026\u201c This report exposes the nature of the modern industrialised dairy industry and the serious implications that this has for our health. I do hope that White Lies receives the recognition it deserves and that this will embolden politicians to take a stand against the dairy industry \u201d.\nHeather Mills is a patron of the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation and supported us in the launch of White Lies on May 24, 2006. Quotes from Heather include :\nWhite Lies is the first review of its kind. The evidence is overwhelming \u2013 cow\u2019s milk and dairy products are neither natural nor healthy, in fact they are harmful to health and have been linked to a wide range of illnesses and diseases. Many of the key findings were discussed at the public talk on May 24 2006. Hot topics that the campaign and report cover include:\nHeart disease \u2013 What it is in milk and dairy products that can cause heart disease and how following a plant-based diet can reduce cholesterol and even reverse heart disease.\nDiabetes \u2013 Research shows that drinking cow\u2019s milk at an early age is strongly linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible people. Several different theories have been suggested that attempt to unravel the actual mechanism by which cow\u2019s milk causes diabetes; they all share a common theme.\nCancer \u2013 Nutrition plays a major role in cancer; a poor diet is the second largest preventable risk factor for cancer (coming close behind smoking) and an increasing body of evidence now links the consumption of cow\u2019s milk to certain cancers. What it is about modern dairy farming practices that concerns scientists studying certain cancers including cancers of the breast, ovaries, colon and prostate? And which types of food can protect against these, and other, diseases?\nObesity\nIn 2004 the UK Foods Standards Agency reported that 25 per cent of men and 20 per cent of women were classified as obese. The British Medical Association warns that childhood obesity levels have soared in the UK. Part of the problem is the increasing lack of physical activity but diet plays a major role in the obesity epidemic. The World Health Organisation blames the rise in obesity on a shift away from diets high in complex carbohydrates towards diets high in saturated fats and sugars. How do dairy foods contribute to the rising levels of obesity and what is the difference between \u2018good\u2019 fats and \u2018bad\u2019 fats?\nOsteoporosis and the calcium myth\nOsteoporosis is a growing problem in the UK; one in two women and one in five men will suffer a fracture after the age of 50! The science shows that shows that dairy is part of the problem rather than the solution, White Lies reveals why it is not the best source of calcium and describes how best to promote bone health in the young and old.\nPinta pus\nMilk containing up to 400 million pus cells per litre may be legally sold for human consumption!

The fact that total mortality was about 20 per cent lower in the non-meat eating group than the meat eaters is perhaps of greatest clinical importance.\"\nBritish Medical Journal\nTranslated, this research found that vegetarians get a 40 per cent less risk of dying from cancer and they live longer than meat eaters. Cancer experts worldwide now believe that over a third of cancer deaths - and possibly many more - could be linked to diet.\nLeading cancer expert, Professor Sir Richard Doll, estimates that 20-60 per cent of cancers might be avoided through diet.\nOver a quarter of a million people are diagnosed with cancer every year in the UK and a staggering one-in-four of the population in the UK will die from it. Cancer is second only to heart disease as the major killer in the Western world, despite the knowledge that vegetables, fruit and plant foods considerably reduce the risk.\nIt's also known that the process of cooking meat, particularly at high temperatures for long periods, produces cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens) called heterocyclic amines. It happens with all meats but the level in chicken is 15 times higher than in beef - which rather destroys the image of chicken as a healthy option. Heating plant proteins such as soya doesn't produce these killer chemicals.\nFats - and particularly animal fats - produce bile acids in the digestive system that appear to promote cancer of the colon. Diets rich in fibre can reduce bile acids and low-fat diets seem to produce more 'natural killer' cells than high-fat diets. They seek and destroy abnormal cells that may turn cancerous.\nBreast Cancer\nSome 44,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year.\nOne in eight women in the UK will develop breast cancer at some point in their life. Asian countries traditionally have much lower rates of breast cancer but when Japanese girls are raised on Western diets their rate of breast cancer increases dramatically.\nThe Women's Health study looked at 41,836 women over a long period of time and found that the risk of breast cancer rose when well-done to very-well-done meat was eaten.\nCow's milk also carries a possible risk of breast cancer and one particular ingredient is suspected. It's a hormone called Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1). The same hormone occurs naturally in humans and stimulates growth in children but declines as a child ages. It's known that the IGF-1 in cow's milk encourages breast cancer cells to multiply.\nIt's also known that when premenopausal women have even small increases of IGF- 1 in their blood, their risk of breast cancer increases seven times.\nOne theory is that drinking cow's milk after weaning may cause breast cells to keep on multiplying.\nSee VVF's guide, A Fighting Chance, for helping prevent and beat breast cancer\nBowel Cancer\nOver 27,000 people each year in the UK develop cancer of the colon and rectum.\nWomen who eat the most animal fat are at greater risk - and it's much the same for men.\nLarge numbers of people have given up red meat in favour of 'healthier' white meat - fish and poultry - and yet both red and white meat increase the risk of colon cancer.\nPeople who eat only white meat less than once a week have a 55 per cent higher risk than those who don't eat any meat at all.\nWhen they eat it at least once a week, the risk increases threefold.\nOn the other hand, eating beans, peas or lentils at least twice a week drops the risk of colon cancer by 50 per cent.\nThe risk of colon cancer seems to depend on the overall healthiness of your diet. Fruits, vegetables and fibre reduce your risk while following the official health advice, and swapping high-fat dairy products for low-fat ones, butter for margarine, red meat for poultry and refined grains for wholegrains, also reduces your risk - but only slightly.\nThe evidence is beginning to stack up that there is a link between eating meat and processed meat products and colon cancer.\nThis risk is described as 'moderate' but significant and it's been shown that frequent consumption of beef, veal, pork and lamb can increase your chances of colon cancer by 20- 40 per cent.\nProstate cancer\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second most common cause of male cancer deaths after lung cancer.\nAlthough it rarely occurs in younger men, one in nine men in the UK will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives (Cancer Research UK, 2011).\nProfessor Jonathan Waxman, who founded the Prostate Cancer Charity, believes that diet plays a big part - particularly red meat and dairy products.\nThe reason why dairy products are in the frame is again believed to be the hormone IGF-1 - the same as in breast cancer.\nIt's known that vegan men have less IGF-1 than meat eaters, which might reduce their risk of prostate cancer.\nOther research has shown that the hormone oestrogen in cows' milk may also trigger prostate cancer.\nLevels of oestrogen are markedly higher in milk than they were 20 years ago due to 75 per cent of milk now coming from pregnant cows. Vegetarians are half as likely to get prostate cancer as meat-eaters (NHS Direct, 2006).\nThis protection may be partly due to the protective role conferred by the nutrients selenium and lycopenes found in vegetables, particularly tomatoes.\nThe very best anti-cancer diet\nWell it certainly isn't meat and dairy.\nAs people move towards a plant-based diet so the risks of developing cancer reduces.\nIn the words of Professor Jane Plant:\n\"Undoubtedly, the best anti-cancer diet would be completely vegan.\"\nCancer specialist Doctor Rosy Daniel thinks similarly:\n\"The best move... is to become completely vegan and eliminate animal products from the diet altogether.\"\nHow does a plant diet protect against cancer? Fibre helps to sweep toxins out of the body and the rich supply of protective antioxidants protect body cells against damage.\nSome foods, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower, almost certainly help to prevent cancer. That's why we're recommended to eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables every day and to eat more starchy carbohydrates.\nPlant foods also contain protective 'plant hormones' (phytoestrogens) and soya products contain the most. There is a bit of confusion because whilst most research point to soya having cancer-preventing properties, a very few show the opposite. However, the evidence today is that soya foods are beneficial. (For further information, see VVF's guide The Soya Story.) Meat and dairy products contain no antioxidant vitamins, no fibre and no protective phytoestrogens. Is it really surprising, then, that all-veggie diets are the best anti-cancer diets around?\n\"Vegetarians have lower rates of obesity, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, large bowel disorders and cancers and gall stones. Cholesterol levels tend to be lower and vegetarian diets have been noted to lower blood cholesterol. The vegetarian diet is adequate for the nutritional needs of infants.\"\nBritish Medical Association\nCoronary Heart Disease (CHD)\nCHD is the UK's number one health problem with one-in-five men and one-in-six women dying from it. World-renowned heart transplant surgeon, Christiaan Barnard, believes that most heart attacks are unnecessary - we have the power to prevent them.\nNot surprisingly he advocates a diet where fruits and vegetables, not meat, are the mainstay.\nVegetarians are less at risk of heart disease and have 25 per cent less chance of dying from it. If everyone in the UK went vegetarian, about 40,000 lives a year would be saved - a veggie diet should be available on prescription! Recent research came to just this conclusion:\n\"... dietary intervention with a vegetarian diet seems to be a cheap, physiological and safe approach for the prevention, and possibly management of modern lifestyle diseases.\"\nFlinders University, Australia\nApart from having lower body weights, lower cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure levels, new research adds another clue as to why vegetarians get less heart disease.\nSalicylic acid in the blood of vegetarians is up to one-and-a-half times higher than in meat eaters - some had levels 12 times higher! Salicylic acid is the main ingredient in aspirin, prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks by fighting the inflammation that causes it. Salicylic acid is also present in fruit and vegetables! The same research came up with evidence that salicylic acid may protect against bowel, breast and lung cancer as well as Alzheimer's disease.\nCholesterol and Saturated Fat\nCholesterol is not the only risk factor in heart disease but it is a major player.\nIt's found only in foods of animal origin - there's none in plant foods. As our liver makes all the cholesterol we need, we can cut it out of our diet entirely.\nPeople talk of 'good' cholesterol and 'bad' cholesterol and your body contains both main types. Bad cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins or LDL) is dumped on the artery walls, reduces blood flow and causes heart attacks and strokes. Good cholesterol (highdensity lipoproteins or HDL) is carried to the liver so the body can get rid of it. Most of your cholesterol is made up of the baddies. Saturated fat encourages your body to produce too much and a high level carries the risk of heart attack.\nPeople who turn to lean red meat and white meat to reduce their cholesterol levels are going to be disappointed because it's largely ineffective - about a five per cent reduction at best. Low-fat, vegetarian diets, devoid of all meat, can bring cholesterol down by up to 32 per cent. When lean meat was substituted for soya bean curd (tofu) again levels fell considerably.\nThere is increasing evidence that vegans have an even greater advantage. Lifelong vegetarians have been shown to have cholesterol levels 24 per cent lower than average and lifelong vegans 57 per cent lower. Just as importantly, vegetarian and vegan diets can reverse the damage done by CHD, even in severe cases.\n\"The Reversal Diet is a very low-fat vegetarian diet... This is what the patients in our study consumed, whose coronary heart disease began to reverse. I am convinced that this is the world's healthiest diet for most adults, whether or not they have heart disease.\"\nDr Dean Ornish, School of Medicine, University of California\nDiverticular Disease\nDiverticular disease is one of the most common disorders of the colon among elderly people in Western societies but again vegetarians suffer less. Small pouches form in the wall of the intestine and become inflamed.\nA study of 48,000 US men found that a diet high in fat and red meat and low in fibre increased the risk.\nGallstones\nGallstones are made up mostly of cholesterol crystals and are formed when bile (digestive fluid) becomes saturated with cholesterol.\nHigh-fibre diets stop gallstones forming, which is why the World Health Organisation recommends a starchy diet as protection.\nMeat-eaters stand twice the risk than do vegetarians. The causes are the same old suspects - too little fibre, saturated fat, cholesterol and obesity.\nHypertension\nHigh blood pressure is caused by stress, alcohol, obesity and poor diet and plays a part in heart disease and strokes (see Strokes, page 37).\nMany people don't even realise they have it.\nIn England, one in 10 people between 45 to 54 have high blood pressure. Not only do vegetarians suffer much less but a meat-free diet can help lower blood pressure.\nWhen 29 patients, who had suffered from high blood pressure for eight years, were put on a vegan diet for a year, so successful was it that almost all medication was withdrawn or drastically reduced. See VVF's Have a Heart guide.\nKidney Disease\n\"A well-planned vegetarian diet may be useful in the prevention and treatment of renal [kidney] disease...\"\nAmerican Dietetic Association\nFor those with kidney disease, plant proteins may increase survival rates and reduce kidney damage.\nAccording to Dr Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), animal protein is the worst enemy of people with a tendency toward kidney stones, or any kidney disease for that matter.\nAnimal protein tends to overwork the kidneys, making them less efficient at filtering waste from the body in the urine.\nAnimal protein is high in sulphur which can leach calcium from the bones and form painful kidney stones.\nMeat and eggs contain up to five times more of these sulphur compounds than grains and beans.\nSo, vegetarian diets tend to produce less wear and tear on the kidneys.\nA Harvard University study found that animal protein was directly linked to the risk of kidney stones and just small increases in meat consumption pushed that risk up.\nPeople with kidney problems are usually put on a low-protein diet yet it's been shown that a vegan diet is extremely effective and has the added advantage of being a healthier alternative.\nLactose Intolerance\nWith lactose intolerance, the body can't digest the sugar in cow's milk called lactose. It's found only in milk and has to be broken down in the small intestine by an enzyme called lactase. No surprises, then, that it is only babies who normally have this enzyme.\nNature didn't provide adults with it as they wouldn't need to drink milk after weaning. Undigested lactose reaches the large intestine where bacteria act on it, creating gas and drawing water into the digestive tract.\n`The result - bloating, stomach cramps and a lot of gas!\nUp to five million people in the UK are lactose intolerant; in the US it affects about 50 million people and a staggering 75 per cent of the world's population is lactose intolerant! This shows just how unnatural cow's milk really is for adults and why it plays a part in a host of diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome.\nObesity\nCurrently, over half of women and about two thirds of men are overweight or obese - a condition linked to heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, gallstones and some cancers. Fat around the stomach area is thought to be particularly damaging.\nKnowing the problem is one thing, doing something about it is quite another. Which is why all leading health advisory bodies stress the importance of encouraging children to eat a healthy diet.\nQuite simply, non-meat eaters are slimmer than meat-eaters! See the V-Plan Diet guide .\nOsteoporosis\nOsteoporosis - porous or brittle bones - is the major cause of bone fractures in the elderly and is a result of thinning bones due to loss of calcium. The number of hip fractures is reaching epidemic levels in many affluent countries, affecting a staggering one-in-three women and one-in-12 men in the UK over the age of 50.\nDespite our obsession with drinking cow's milk for calcium, supposedly to prevent osteoporosis, it isn't working.\nCountries with the highest calcium intake have the highest risk of osteoporosis.\nResearch with 77,000 women found that those who got most of their calcium from cow's milk had significantly more fractures than those who drank little or no cow 's milk.\nBone density increases until the midthirties and is dependent on genetics, hormones and nutrition.\nKeeping active with weight-bearing activities such as walking and skipping is important. But the main cause of osteoporosis in Western countries is not lack of calcium - it is loss of calcium. Vegetarians have less than half the calcium losses than meat-eaters.\nAnimal protein produces acid in the body whilst most fruit, vegetables and pulses form alkalines. Acids are neutralised by using calcium from the bones, which is then excreted in urine.\nElderly people who eat a lot of animal protein but little vegetable protein have a greater risk of hip fractures. Cutting down on meat and dairy - or cutting it out entirely - reduces the amount of calcium you need and there are plenty of plant foods that can provide it. ( See calcium section ).\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nRheumatism is any painful condition affecting bones, ligaments, joints, tendons or muscles.\nArthritis is a form of rheumatism where the joints become inflamed. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease where the immune system attacks its own tissues - in this case cartilage and joint linings.\nMeat, dairy produce and eggs can all be triggers for arthritis and can also encourage hormone imbalances that can contribute to joint pain.\nWhen RA sufferers were put on a vegetarian diet, they showed a significant reduction in pain, stiffness and swollen joints after just four weeks.\nResearchers have come to the conclusion that vegetarian diets might be useful in the treatment of RA and that meat and offal may be a major factor contributing to the inflammation in RA.\nStrokes\nA stroke is sudden damage to the brain caused by lack of blood supply or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain.\nThe damaged cells die and the parts of the body they control cease to function.\nA major cause is furring up of the arteries - made worse by high blood pressure and diabetes.\nStrokes are responsible for about 12 per cent of all deaths in England. About 30 per cent of people who have a stroke die within a few weeks and about one half of those who survive will have a lasting disability.\nSince vegetarians suffer less from high blood pressure and coronary artery disease than meat-eaters, a veggie diet is a sensible preventative.\nDiabetes\nDiabetes type II is much more common than type I. It affects about 150 million people worldwide - 22.5 million in Europe and two million in the UK. About 90 per cent of those affected are overweight or obese. The WHO estimates that by 2025 the problem will have doubled to at least 300 million worldwide.\nThe science again shows that vegetarians and vegans are considerably less at risk. Research with 25,000 adult Americans put it at about 45 per cent less. For those who already have diabetes, there's strong evidence that high-fibre, low-fat diets improve the situation and even without exercise, vegan diets can bring down blood sugar levels.\nA low-fat, high-fibre diet helps insulin to work better because it allows sugar to pass into the bloodstream a little at a time rather than all at once. Dietitians now recommend that wholegrain pasta, rice, bread and other complex carbohydrates - along with peas, beans, lentils and vegetables - form the main part of any diabetic diet. See the VVF's Defeating Diabetes report and guide.\nContents:\n"}, {"score": 1780.4899, "uuid": "c93ee3ff-a870-5edb-a69e-c36bdcf2b93a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0701wb-71-03105", "target_hostname": "www.veggies.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.veggies.org.uk/directory/detail-340-250.htm", "page_rank": 1.1724126e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Vegan</em> Lincs :: :: <em>Vegetarian</em> Campaigns", "snippet": "# <em>What</em> <em>Is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Baking Soda &amp; Baking Powder?", "explanation": null, "document": "We are a friendly group based in Lincoln - Linking Vegans in Lincolnshire\n* We are a friendly group based in Lincoln - Linking Vegans in Lincolnshire.\n* Vegans, Vegetarians and Non-Veggies are all welcome.\n* We have regular meetings, social events, food tastings, outings and fundraising events for local and national animal charities.\nADDRESS -\n"}, {"score": 1730.105, "uuid": "5852ff46-7b7b-5b87-906f-8bca98d57d74", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0701wb-71-03099", "target_hostname": "www.veggies.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.veggies.org.uk/directory/detail-161-250.htm", "page_rank": 1.1724126e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Manchester <em>Vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em> Group (MVVG) :: Manchester :: <em>Vegetarian</em>", "snippet": "# <em>What</em> <em>Is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Baking Soda &amp; Baking Powder? # Round Up of Nottingham\u2019s 2010 Free Food Give-Aways Manchester <em>Vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em> Group (MVVG) <em>is</em> Greater Manchester&#x27;s biggest <em>and</em> busiest <em>vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>vegan</em> support group.", "explanation": null, "document": "Manchester Vegetarian and Vegan Group (MVVG)\nManchester Vegetarian and Vegan Group is Greater Manchester's largest vegetarian and vegan group\nManchester Vegetarian and Vegan Group (MVVG) is Greater Manchester's biggest and busiest vegetarian and vegan support group.

Lower in gluten than All-purpose it is perfect for those delicate pastries.\nPasta flour is a grind of pure durum wheat.\u00a0 It is designed to produce the stability needed in\u00a0 pastas so they don't turn to mush when cooking.\nGluten flour is a flour designed to be high in gluten by removing most of the starch from hard wheat .\u00a0 This flour can be used along with either your all-purpose flour or bread flour to produce a\u00a0 loaf of bread better in both texture and size.\nRoux and Beurre Manie\nA roux is a thickener that is made from equal parts of flour and fat and whisked together in a saucepan over heat to blend flavors and remove the lumps.\u00a0 It is then added to sauces and gravies to thicken while cooking together.\u00a0 To make a Roux, heat fat in pan and gradually whisk in flour.\u00a0 cook mixture, stirring constantly for at least several minutes and gradually whisk in hot liquid you are trying to thicken.\u00a0 It should be cooked for 30 min in order to eliminate the flour's starchy flavor, to thicken liquid and to get rid of the flour's white color.\nWhite sauce is a roux.\u00a0 Its thickness depends on the liquid content vs. flour/fat.\u00a0\u00a0 Thin sauces is 1 T. each flour and fat with one cup of liquid; medium has 2 T each of flour and fat (b\u00e9chamel); thick has 3 T of each (veloute).\nBeurre Manie is a flour-butter mixture to correct overly thin sauces at the last minute.\u00a0 Blend equal parts of butter and flour and knead them together.\u00a0 After you whisk it into sauce, let it cook for no more than 1-2 minutes, since sauces thickened with flour pick up starchy taste after cooked for a few minutes.\nBaking Soda and Baking Powder\nBaking soda is sodium bicarbonate.\u00a0 When it is mixed with an acid liquid it releases carbon dioxide. That is what creates its leavening ability.\nAll recipes calling for baking soda include an acid.\u00a0 It could be vinegar, lemon juice, buttermilk, or sour milk to activate the baking soda.\u00a0\u00a0 Hidden acids are used instead like molasses or honey or cream of tartar (a dry acid).\nBaking soda releases the gas all at once.\u00a0 If the batter sits too long before baked, or is beaten too much, the leavening action will be lost.\u00a0\u00a0 Too much baking soda will give a bitter/soapy taste to your food.\nBaking Powder is a combination of baking soda and a dry acid and other ingredients.\u00a0 When added to a batter with the wet ingredients they react and release the carbon dioxide to leaven the batter.\nThere are two types of baking powder: single-acting and double-acting.\nSingle acting powders are differentiated by the acid used: Tartrate baking powder (cream of tartar and tartaric acid) and Phosphate baking powder (calcium phosphate or disodium pyrophosphate) and SAS baking powder (sodium aluminum sulfate {Alum}).\u00a0 Each reacts differently in the speed when gas is released.\u00a0 Single action is not commonly used in the US.\nDouble acting baking powders are more commonly used.\u00a0 This baking soda contains a dry acid which does not react with the baking soda\u00a0 until water is added. The first action refers to the release of gas when baking soda reacts with the acidic liquid.\nThe second action refers to the release of gas when the batter is heated in the oven or on the griddle.\u00a0 This relies on the presence of a slower acting acid, SAS, which only combines with the soda when the temperature increases.\nSometimes baking powder will list cornstarch as one of the ingredients....this is to keep the product dry and free flowing; help keep the soda and acid dry and separate and bulks the powder for easier measuring and standardization.\nSpices and Herbs\nMost all spices are grown in tropical regions of the Orient, East Africa, and the East Indian Islands. They are usually the seed, bark, root or fruit of a plant.\nMost herbs are grown in the US and Europe and can be distinguished from spices . Herbs are usually the leafy , flowers, or seeds of green plants. Many herbs, such as basil or oregano , may be used fresh, and are commonly chopped into smaller pieces or dried. Spices, however, are dried, extremely aromatic, and although sometimes used whole, are usually ground into a powder .\nCassava Flour and Tapioca Flour\nGround from the cassava root, cassava flour is creamy-white with a slightly fermented flavor and sour taste. Gluten free, it is used to replace wheat flour, and is so-used by some people with allergies to other grain crops.\nTapioca Flour is milled from the dried starch of the cassava root. Actually known as Tapioca Starch, it thickens when heated with water and is often used to give body to puddings, fruit pie fillings, and soups. It can also be used in baking as a flour .\nFor shipping to AK, HI, APO, FPO, see \"Ordering Information\"\n"}, {"score": 1751.5223, "uuid": "fd06a3f1-448c-5c16-b33c-0cc6c9d7e21d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1813wb-05-23379", "target_hostname": "www.vaskahome.com", "target_uri": "http://www.vaskahome.com/faq/is-vaska-vegan.email.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1882602e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "vaska, <em>vegan</em>, <em>vegetarian</em>, natural, organic, detergent ::<em>Is</em> Vaska <em>Vegan</em>?", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> Vaska <em>Vegan</em>?

With type 2 diabetes growing ever faster into epidemic proportions and general dietary advice and medication not achieving a substantial change, both, healthcare professionals and the public, should turn their attention to the diet that has been shown to be able to prevent and even reverse the disease or at least significantly reduce the need for medication.\nType 2 diabetes is usually, albeit not always, linked to increased body weight and especially to abdominal obesity. When the body's metabolism can't keep up with the amount and type of food eaten, droplets of fat are stored also in muscle cells as intramyocellular lipids (Petersen et al., 2004). When the amount of this fat reaches a certain level, it starts interfering with the cells' ability to react to insulin correctly. Studies show that these lipids start accumulating many years before type 2 diabetes manifests (Phillips et al.; 1996; Krssak et al., 1999; Petersen et al., 2004) and it has been confirmed that insulin resistance in muscles and liver is strongly linked to fat storage in these tissues (Delarue and Magnan, 2007; Morino et al., 2006).\nUnder normal conditions, fat is metabolised by the cells\u2019 own powerhouses \u2013 mitochondria - but it appears that people with type 2 diabetes have fewer mitochondria in their cells than they need to successfully burn all the supplied fat. As a consequence, the fat accumulates inside the cells faster (Barnard, 2007).\nHowever, as shown by another study (Sparks et al., 2005) where young healthy men were put on a special, high-fat diet that drew 50 per cent of its calories from fat \u2013 a diet not too different from that of many people in Western countries \u2013 accumulation of fat inside cells can be extremely fast even in perfectly healthy people.\nIt\u2019s well known that a lifestyle intervention approach can yield remarkable results but there\u2019s one diet in particular \u2013 the D-Diet \u2013 that can actually reverse the condition.\nIn one of the groundbreaking studies, researchers employed a combination of diet change and exercise (Barnard et al., 1994). The subjects were 197 men with type 2 diabetes and after just three weeks, 140 of them were able to discontinue their medication. Several studies followed (Barnard et al., 2006; Barnard et al., 2009a; Barnard et al., 2009b), each of them testing the effects of a plant-based, low-fat diet that emphasises foods with low glycemic index and all of them came to the same conclusion \u2013 that this type of diet is more effective than any other diet and even some medication.\nThe D-Diet- a low-fat wholesome vegan diet \u2013 does not only help the body reduce the fat stores in the cells, which are causing insulin resistancy but it brings about improved blood sugar control, reduces blood cholesterol, helps to induce weight loss without portion restriction, prevents further kidney and nerve damage and helps to lower blood pressure.\nThe usefulness of vegan diet was eventually endorsed even by the American Diabetes Association when in 2010, their Clinical Practice Guidelines stated that plant-based diets had been shown to improve metabolic control in persons with diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2010).\nBasic principles of the D-Diet:\n1st principle: no animal products\nBy eliminating all animal products diabetics avoid eating substantial amounts of fat and their cholesterol intake will be zero. Even lean, white meat and fish contain surprisingly high amounts of fat. For example, 38 per cent of calories from roast chicken and 40 per cent of calories from salmon come from fat (Food Standards Agency, 2002). Most of the fat found in animal products is saturated and there absolutely no requirement for saturated fats in our diet.\nReducing fat intake is vital for many reasons \u2013 in order to reduce the amount of intramyocellular lipid, which interferes with muscle cells\u2019 insulin sensitivity, for cardiovascular health and for general weight loss.\nThis diet excludes all animal products also because animal protein from meat, fish, dairy or eggs places an additional strain on the kidneys and can increase the damage already caused by diabetes (Knight et al., 2003; Barclay et al., 2010). Protecting the kidneys is another key issue for diabetics.\nAll foods should be of plant origin and unrefined wherever possible, which means they will be naturally high in fibre and complex carbohydrates, and low in fat (except oils, nuts and seeds). Animal products contain no fibre or healthy carbohydrates while plant foods (supplemented with vitamin B12) contain all the essential nutrients we need.\n2nd principle: low-fat\nEven though vegetable oils are better for the body than animal fats because they contain essential fatty acids, less saturated fat and no cholesterol, it is important to keep them to a minimum. In order to reverse or improve the diabetic condition, it is essential to reduce intracellular fats (Barnard, 2007) but this can only happen if excessive fat consumption is avoided.\nOne of the pilot studies on the effects of a vegan diet showed that there are important differences between types of fat in a low-fat regime (Nicholson et al., 1999). Researchers compared the potential of a low-fat vegan diet with a conventional low-fat diet. Participants were all type 2 diabetics and they followed the assigned diet for 12 weeks. At the end of the study period, the vegan group had an impressive 28 per cent reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels. The reduction in the conventional group was only 12 per cent. The average weight loss was 7.2 kg in the vegan group compared to 3.8 in the conventional group. Medication was reduced in all vegan participants, in one of them completely, whilst there were no reductions in medication in the conventional group.\nThe amount of fat per serving should not exceed three grams (or ten per cent of calories from fat). Preferred types of oils should be those with high omega-3 content \u2013 flaxseed, hempseed and walnut for cold preparation and rapeseed for cooking. Apart from added oils, diabetics should also limit their consumption of nuts and seeds.\n3rd principle: low glycemic index (GI)\nGlycemic index, or GI, is a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and rapidly release glucose into the blood have a high GI. Carbohydrates that break down more slowly, releasing glucose gradually into the bloodstream, have a low GI.\nTo help the body deal effectively with the carbohydrate content of different foods, those that release their energy slowly should be preferred. Low GI means that after ingestion, blood glucose will not reach high levels, which is exactly what people with diabetes need. It allows them to better control their blood sugar and reduce the likelihood of complications caused by hyperglycemia, such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy (kidney disease) as well as hypoglycemia.\nGlycemic index of selected foods (from Glycemic Index Database and The GI Diet Guide)\nClassification\n"}, {"score": 1710.0092, "uuid": "4af83602-82f0-5951-8072-7706bddf7923", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-56-12595", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/whitelies/wlreport03.shtml", "page_rank": 1.176156e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "<em>The</em> extensive EPIC Oxford study comprising 33,883 meat-eaters, 10,110 fish-eaters, 18,840 <em>vegetarians</em> <em>and</em> 2,596 <em>vegans</em> showed that while <em>the</em> total fat intake was highest in <em>the</em> meat-eaters <em>and</em> lowest in <em>vegans</em>, <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>the</em> groups was relatively small.", "explanation": null, "document": "WHITE LIES\nIntroduction\nThe foods we consume are of immense importance to our health and well-being. The recent increase in television and media coverage of food and health issues has improved our understanding of the links that exist between diet and health. The types of food that we eat are strongly linked to our culture and food issues can cause emotional responses. In the UK and other northern European countries as well as North America, we have developed a strong emotional attachment to the idea that milk is a natural and healthy drink for us, even as adults.\nMilk is the first food that we consume, our mother\u2019s breast milk if we are fortunate, if not then specially formulated substitutes based on cow\u2019s or soya milk are generally used in the UK. We associate milk with comfort and nurturing and consider milk to be a wholesome nutrient-rich component of the diet that is essential for normal growth and development, which for a baby it is. However, all other mammals on the planet are weaned off milk at an early age, whereas some humans continue drinking milk into adulthood. Not only that, we drink the milk of another species, something no other mammal does. To be fair, contrary to popular belief, most people in the world do not drink milk; it would make many of us ill. But in the UK, we are a nation of milk drinkers, along with most other northern European countries and North America. Infants, the young, adolescents, adults and the aged all consume large quantities of milk, cheese, butter and yogurt every year. But why are we so convinced that milk is some kind of wonder food?\nMilk, it seems, can help you lose weight; it can also make you gain weight. Milk promotes healthy skin; it may also cause acne. You need milk for good bone health, but the incidence of osteoporosis is highest in countries that consume the most milk. These conflicting reports leave us confused and unsure who to believe. The dairy industry invests millions in milk advertising and promotion. It could be argued that they present a biased view motivated by financial interest. An increasing amount of scientific evidence now shows that cow\u2019s milk is not the wonder food the dairy industry would have us believe. This research goes further in linking the consumption of cow\u2019s milk to a wide range of health problems. Many people, even health professionals, may find it hard to be objective about the detrimental impact of dairy products on health described in this report because of the emotional attachment many of us have to the idea that milk is natural and healthy.\nThe aim of this report is to redress the balance by presenting and reviewing the research on the health effects of cow\u2019s milk and dairy products.\nWhat is a healthy diet?\nA healthy diet contains a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, pulses, nuts and seeds. It is rich in important disease-busting antioxidants that protect against a number of illnesses and diseases including certain cancers and cardiovascular disease (Genkinger et al., 2004; Joshipura et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2000). It has been suggested that the high concentration of antioxidants in blood may be one of the reasons for the lower incidence of chronic diseases in people consuming a plant-based diet rich in fruit and vegetables (Waldman et al., 2005). A healthy diet provides plenty of fibre protecting against a range of diseases including colorectal cancer. It is rich in vitamins and minerals, again protecting health. A healthy diet should contain a good source of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids including the omega-3 fatty acids known to protect heart health.\nOn the other hand, a healthy diet should be low in saturated fat, animal protein and cholesterol for which we have no dietary requirement. Indeed the Government now advises that it is more important to replace saturated fat with unsaturated than to cut down on total fat (FSA, 2005). This means eating more avocados, nuts and seeds and plant-based oils and spreads such as flax seed oil and soya spread.\nCow\u2019s milk, cheese, butter, cream, ice-cream and milk chocolate all contain the unhealthy saturated kind of fat associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Some of these foods contain considerable amounts of saturated fat. For example, Cheddar cheese contains around 35 per cent fat, of which over 60 per cent is saturated. Similarly, butter contains over 80 per cent fat, of which over 60 per cent is saturated (FSA, 2002). This means that a 10 gram serving of butter contains over five grams of saturated fat! The Food Standards Agency describes five grams of saturated fat per 100 grams as \u2018a lot\u2019 (FSA, 2005), so the five grams of saturated fat contained in just 10 grams of butter makes this food remarkably unhealthy. Plant-based polyunsaturated fat spreads contain less total fat (around 60 per cent) of which less than 20 per cent is saturated. They tend to contain more of the valuable polyunsaturated fatty acids and so provide a much healthier option.\nSaturated fats from animal foods such as whole milk, cream and butter increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Research shows that a plant-based diet contains significantly less saturated fat. The extensive EPIC Oxford study comprising 33,883 meat-eaters, 10,110 fish-eaters, 18,840 vegetarians and 2,596 vegans showed that while the total fat intake was highest in the meat-eaters and lowest in vegans, the difference between the groups was relatively small. However, the percentage of energy from saturated fat was strikingly different across the four diet groups: saturated fat intake was highest in meat-eaters, almost identical in fish-eaters and vegetarians and significantly lowest among the vegans (Davey et al., 2003). So significant is the lower saturated fat content of a plant-based diet that it can be used to control weight without worrying about calorie counting. In one clinical trial, adoption of a low-fat vegan diet was shown to help weight loss despite the absence of prescribed limits on portion size or energy intake (Barnard et al., 2005). Other research confirming that vegetarians and vegans have a lower risk of being overweight or obese than meat-eaters shows that consuming more plant foods and less animal products may help individuals control their weight (Newby, et al., 2005). Being overweight or obese increases the risk of many health problems including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, asthma, infertility, high blood pressure and many cancers.\nMilk and other dairy products contain many biologically active molecules including hormones and growth factors. Cow\u2019s milk has been shown to contain over 35 different hormones and 11 growth factors (Grosvenor et al., 1992). Some researchers are particularly concerned about the oestrogen content of cow\u2019s milk (Ganmaa and Sato, 2005), suggesting that cow\u2019s milk is one of the important routes of human exposure to oestrogens. The milk consumed now is very different to the milk consumed a century ago. Unlike their pasture-fed counterparts of old, modern dairy cows are usually pregnant and continue to lactate during the latter half of pregnancy, when the concentration of oestrogens in blood, and hence in the milk, increases. Although there is a paucity of research in this field, early evidence suggests the increase in exposure to cow\u2019s oestrogen may be linked to an increased incidence of certain cancers. In one study, cancer incidence was correlated with food intake in 40 countries (Ganmaa and Sato, 2005). Results showed that both cow\u2019s milk and cheese increased the risk of hormone-dependent cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer. Among the dietary risk factors identified, these researchers were most concerned with milk and dairy products because, as already stated, the milk drunk today tends to come from pregnant cows among whom oestrogen and progesterone levels are markedly elevated.\nAnother bioactive component of cow\u2019s milk receiving an increasing amount of attention is the growth factor called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The amount of IGF-1 present is higher in milk produced by pregnant cows. The concern is that because IGF-1 in cows is identical to human IGF-1, this growth factor could cross the gut wall and trigger an abnormal response, for example increasing the risk of certain cancers. Indeed, over the last decade IGF-1 has been linked to an increased risk of childhood cancers, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and cancers of the pancreas and prostate (LeRoith et al., 1995; Chan et al., 1998) and gastrointestinal cancers (Epstein, 1996).\nInterestingly, one study observed a 10 per cent increase in blood serum levels of IGF-1 in subjects who increased their intake of non-fat milk (Heaney, 1999) while another study noted that vegan men had a nine per cent lower serum IGF-1 level than meat-eaters and vegetarians (Allen et al., 2000). Whether the consumption of cow\u2019s milk and dairy products raises IGF-1 levels directly (by crossing the gut wall), or indirectly (by triggering an increased production of human IGF-1 in the body), evidence suggests that some component of milk causes an increase in blood serum levels of IGF-1. It has even been suggested that IGF-1 may be used as a predictor of certain cancers, in much the same way that cholesterol is a predictor of heart disease (Campbell and Campbell, 2005).\nIn summary, a diet containing saturated fat, cholesterol, animal protein, hormones and growth factors is not a healthy diet. Cow\u2019s milk, butter, cheese, cream, ice-cream and other dairy products contain all these unhealthy components whereas substantial evidence shows that a plant-based diet rich in fruit and vegetables, whole grains and unsaturated fats (including omega-3 fatty acids) offers significant health benefits. By adopting a healthy diet, together with regular physical exercise and avoiding smoking, many of the so-called modern Western diseases can be prevented. As part of its global strategy on diet, physical activity and health, the World Health Organisation (WHO) claims that up to 80 per cent of cases of coronary heart disease, 90 per cent of type 2 diabetes cases and one-third of cancers can be avoided by changing to a healthier diet, increasing physical activity and stopping smoking (WHO, 2006c).\n"}, {"score": 1688.1555, "uuid": "82f69e7c-8071-5c34-aec1-bf48497d7ba7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0607wb-38-16450", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/diabetes/report/References.html", "page_rank": 1.2263903e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "<em>A</em> low-fat <em>vegan</em> diet elicits greater macronutrient changes, but <em>is</em> comparable in adherence <em>and</em> acceptability, compared with <em>a</em> more conventional diabetes diet among individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Vegetarians often have lower morbidity and mortality rates from several chronic degenerative diseases than do non-vegetarians... Vegetarian diets offer disease protection benefits because of their lower saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein content and often higher concentration of folate, antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, carotinoids and phytochemicals... vegetarian diets have also been successful in arresting coronary artery disease.\u0094 American Dietetic Association Position Paper on Vegetarian Diets, 1997.\nAnimal Products Promote Disease\nMeat and dairy products are promoting disease. They are high fat foods, a primary source of unhealthy (and inessential) saturated fats and cholesterol, contain no fibre, no complex (starchy) carbohydrate, none of the primary antioxidant (disease-busting) vitamins \u2013 vitamin C, E, and beta-carotene (the antioxidant form of vitamin A) \u2013 and no vitamin K.\nVegetarian Diets Promote Health\nBalanced vegetarian diets protect health. Fresh fruits, vegetables, cereals, vegetable protein sources like soya, beans, lentils \u2013 all provide fibre, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and protein the body needs without the harmful saturated fat and cholesterol animal proteins provide. Every leading health advisory body is saying the same thing \u2013 Western societies need to get away from eating animal products and turn to plant foods to ensure good health. No one element or 'magic bullet' will ensure good health \u2013 it is the totality of vegetarian diets that is the secret of vibrant health.\nWhat Are Children Eating?\nRubbish apparently. A Government survey published in June 2000 on the diet and nutrition of 4 to 18 year olds found that roughly 80% of children are guzzling away on white bread, savoury snacks, biscuits, chips and chocolate confectionery. Roughly 60-75% had not eaten any citrus fruits or leafy green vegetables in the week of the survey. Children are eating a diet low in many of the vital health-promoting vitamins and minerals needed to help combat disease and a diet high in disease-promoting foods such as high fat, high salt and high sugar convenience-type foods. Meat and dairy products are still firmly placed at the centre of most meals.\nThe Right Start In Life For Children\nDiets based on animal products are quite simply leaving children unprotected in the health stakes. Encouraging children to adopt healthy eating practices from a very early age will mean that they will grow up choosing foods that will promote their good health not promote their ill health. Study after study proves that not only are vegetarian diets perfectly safe but have significant advantages over meat-based diets. Recent research comparing omnivore and vegetarian children found that vegetarian children had lower intakes of total and saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium and higher intakes of beneficial nutrients like potassium and vitamins beta-carotene, C and E.\n\u0093A vegetarian diet, if properly selected, can meet all of the requirements of the growing child.\u0094 Professor Tom Sanders, Professor of Nutrition & Dietetics, King's College, London.\nVegetarians Live Longer!\nA landmark study in 1994 looking at the diets and health of 11,000 people \u2013 The Oxford Study \u2013 concluded that vegetarians have a 20% lower premature death rate than meat-eaters. This fact is now so well recognised that vegetarians can even get lower life assurance premiums than can meat-eaters!\nDemolishing Myths\nVegetarian diets easily provide all the nutrients \u2013 eg the protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals \u2013 that the body needs.\nIron \u2013 Vegetarians are no more at risk of iron-deficient anaemia than meat-eaters \u2013 so says the British Medical Association and the American Dietetic Association. Many everyday foods contain iron eg beans, wholemeal bread and even cocoa beans!\nCalcium \u2013 Dairy products are not necessarily the best source of calcium. 100g tofu (soya bean curd) contains 510mg calcium; 1 slice white bread 45mg; 100ml serving fortified soya milk 120-140mg. This compares to a calcium content of 75mg for 100g of eggs and 115-120mg of calcium for all types of cow's milk.\nHow Animal Products Affect Children\nAllergies\nAn allergy to cow's milk protein (casein) is the most common food allergy in childhood, affecting between four and 75 babies in every 1000. The advice to parents now is that whole cow's milk should not be given during the first year of a baby's life.\nDiabetes\nDiabetes is a group of disorders all leading to rises in blood glucose (sugar) levels due to the inaction of insulin \u2013 a hormone that takes glucose out of the bloodstream and into body cells. There is increasing evidence from a number of studies to show that early exposure to cow's milk may be a trigger for Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) \u2013 the early on-set form of diabetes. In fact 74-94% of the variation in diabetes incidence across countries may be related to differences in cow's milk consumption.\" Why? It seems that cow's milk may destroy the cells in the pancreas that secrete insulin.\nFood Poisoning\nAnimal products are responsible for 95% of all cases of food poisoning. A staggering 9.5 million people get food poisoning annually, costing the NHS \u00a3750 million each year. Children are particularly vulnerable. A complication of infection with E.coli 0157 is now thought to be the biggest cause of acute (short term) kidney failure in children. Farmed animals, in particular cattle, are thought to be the reservoir of infection. \u0093A diet free of meat, fish, milk and eggs is by far the safest and one that I highly recommend.\u0094 Emanuel Goldman, Professor of Microbiology & Genetics.\nHeart Disease\nAutopsy studies in young children reveal fatty streaks in the arteries. This indicates that atherosclerosis (clogged up arteries) is occurring \u2013 a first step in the lead up to heart disease. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reaffirms the importance of introducing a healthy, high-fibre, low-fat diet early in a child's life, one of the major reasons being that it is known that the atherosclerotic process leading to heart disease starts in childhood. \u0093The avoidance of meat is likely to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease, [heart disease] because meat is the major source of saturated fat... High consumption of red meat has adverse health consequences: thus vegetarian diets tend to impart health advantages.\u0094 Dr WC Willett, Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School.\nToxins\nHighly poisonous chemicals have polluted all the world's oceans and they have contaminated every single creature. Oily fish like mackerel and salmon are most at risk as their fatty tissue soaks up these poisons. Substances like dioxins can damage the immune system so the problem is extremely serious. Meat and dairy products can also be affected \u2013 once again because the high fat content of these foods means they take up chemicals in the environment easily. The European Commission guidelines on safety limits for dioxins in foods means that half of all British children under five years old could be exceeding safety limits.\nWeight Problems\nAt least 10% of children in the UK are now classed as being overweight. The 1991 Bogalusa Heart Study showed that even mild obesity in childhood is related to higher levels of blood pressure, insulin and cholesterol and that to some extent these track into adulthood. Numerous studies show that vegetarians are leaner than meat-eaters.\nHow Animal Products Affect Adults\nLittle people inevitably become big people. It is just as important therefore to look at how animal products can affect adult health.\nCancer\nOver a third of cancer deaths \u2013 and possibly many more \u2013 may be linked to diet. Vegetarians have a 40% reduction in cancer mortality than meat eaters \u2013 independent of differences in smoking, obesity and socioeconomic status. Why? Vegetarian diets may be the best anti-cancer diets. Cooking animal proteins (but not plant proteins) produces cancer-causing chemicals called heterocyclic amines, low-fat vegetarian diets have more 'natural killer' cells than high-fat diets which destroy abnormal cells that may turn cancerous, fibre helps sweep away toxins and antioxidant vitamins (C, E and beta-carotene) \u2013 abundant in balanced vegetarian diets \u2013 help protect body cells against damage.\nBreast Cancer \u2013 There are links with this type of cancer to red meat and speculation that the growth hormone \u2013 Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) \u2013 in cow's milk may encourage breast cells to multiply.\nProstate Cancer \u2013 This type of cancer is also linked to increased meat and dairy consumption and IGF-1.\nColon Cancer \u2013 Preliminary results from the EPIC study \u2013 a major on-going study looking at the link between diet and cancer \u2013 are showing that a high intake of red meat (particularly processed meat) is associated with a significant increased risk of colonic cancer. Frequent consumption of beef, veal, pork and lamb is associated with a 20-40% increase in colorectal cancer risk.\nCancer specialist Doctor Rosy Daniel states: \u0093The best move... is to become completely vegan and eliminate animal products from the diet altogether.\u0094\nDiabetes\n150 million people worldwide have middle-age onset diabetes \u2013 80% of sufferers are overweight. Vegetarians and vegans are less at risk from diabetes than meat-eaters as a 21-year study in America found. Over 25,000 adult Americans were studied and the results showed that people on meat-free diets had a 45% reduced risk of contracting diabetes compared to the population as a whole. There is very clear evidence that high-fibre, low-fat diets improve diabetic control. Even without exercise, vegan diets can bring down blood sugar levels.\nGallstones\nA British Medical Journal study found that non-vegetarians have about a two fold increase in risk of developing gallstones than vegetarians, even after controlling for potentially confounding factors. The main risk factors appear to be low fibre intake, saturated fat and cholesterol intake and obesity.\nHeart Disease\nThis is the number one killer in the UK. A number of key studies have shown that vegetarians are at reduced risk of heart disease \u2013 in fact a lower mortality from heart disease by some 25%! Widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet could prevent approximately 40,000 deaths from this disease in the UK each year. Why? Vegetarians are, as a group, leaner and have lower blood pressure levels \u2013 both risk factors for heart disease. Plus new research has shown that vegetarians have up to one and a half times the levels of salicylic acid in their blood than meat eaters. Salicylic acid \u2013 rich in fruits and vegetables \u2013 helps fight the inflammation that causes most cardiovascular illness. Vegetarians also have lower cholesterol levels since cholesterol is only found in foods that come from animals. High cholesterol levels are also a known risk factor for heart disease. Roughly 15% of dietary energy (calories) in the UK diet comes from saturated fat. Experts recommend that this be reduced to just 11%. Saturated fat is also a risk factor for heart disease. Vegetarian diets can also reverse heart disease. Dr. Dean Ornish \u2013 assistant clinical professor of Medicine at the School of Medicine, University of California \u2013 has demonstrated that a near-vegan diet causes significant overall regression of coronary atherosclerosis (clogged up arteries).\nHypertension\nHypertension (high blood pressure) has a number of possible causes including stress, alcohol, obesity and poor diet. In 1997 one in 10 men and women aged 45 to 54 in England had high blood pressure. It increases the tendency for blockages to form in the arteries and is therefore a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Many people with high blood pressure do not even realise they are hypertensive \u2013 it is often a silent killer. Many studies have shown that not only do vegetarians suffer much less from high blood pressure but that a meat-free diet can also help lower blood pressure in people already hypertensive. According to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine this effect has nothing to do with changes in body weight, salt or fat intake but entirely down to the vegetarian diet.\nKidney Disease\nAnimal protein tends to overwork the kidneys which in turn can cause a gradual decline in their ability to carry out their function in filtering waste from the body in the form of urine. Animal protein is high in sulphur-containing amino acids and these tend to leach calcium from the bones where it is excreted in the urine and may form painful kidney stones. Meat and eggs contain two to five times more of these sulphur containing amino acids than are found in grains and beans. Vegetarian diets would therefore be expected to show less wear and tear on the kidneys than meat-based ones. A Harvard study found that intake of animal protein was directly associated with the risk of kidney stone formation. Researchers here found that an increase in animal protein from less than 50g per day to 77g per day was associated with a 33% increased risk of kidney stones in men. Vegan diets can also be regarded as a valid alternative to the standard conventional low-protein diet (CLPD) that is the nutritional treatment for patients with chronic kidney failure. According to the American Dietetic Association: \u0093A well-planned vegetarian diet may be useful in the prevention and treatment of renal [kidney] disease. Studies... suggest that some plant proteins may increase survival rates and decrease proteinuria [proteins in the urine]... and histological renal damage [kidney tissue damage] compared with a non-vegetarian diet.\u0094\nLactose Intolerance\nLactose intolerance means the body can't break down or digest lactose \u2013 the sugar found in cow's milk. Lactose is found in no food other than in the milk secreted by female mammals (including humans) when suckling their young. Lactose has to be broken down in the small intestine by an enzyme called lactase. No surprises then that it is only a suckling infant that normally has this enzyme \u2013 adults wouldn't need it! Once weaned, mammals no longer have the need to drink their mother's milk and the need and ability to break down lactose disappears. If humans carry on drinking milk past weaning \u2013 and from another species to boot \u2013 we should not be surprised if our bodies haven't the enzyme to digest it. This is exactly what happens in the case of lactose intolerance. The absence of lactase to digest the lactose from cow's milk means the undigested lactose reaches the large intestine where bacteria act on it. These bacteria create gas and the lactose itself causes water to be drawn into the digestive tract. The result? Feelings of bloating, stomach cramps and a lot of gas! The gradual loss of lactase activity after weaning is actually the normal process in all mammals \u2013 humans are no exception. Not surprising then that current estimates put a figure of some four to five million people in the UK being lactose intolerant. In the US it affects as many as 25% of the adult population (50 million) and a staggering 75% of the population worldwide are thought to be lactose intolerant!\nOsteoporosis\nAfter the age of 50 osteoporosis will affect a staggering one in three women and one in 12 men in the UK. Although bones are made predominantly of calcium, drinking calcium-rich cow's milk is no guarantee of good bone health \u2013 there are a myriad of factors involved \u2013 genetic, hormonal, activity levels as well as nutritional factors. The real cause of osteoporosis in Western countries is not insufficient calcium intake, it's excessive excretion of calcium from the body. In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, subjects on a vegetarian diet had less then half the calcium loss than those on a typical meat-based diet. The Harvard Nurses' Health Study followed over 77,000 women for 12 years. Those deriving more calcium from cow's milk had slightly, but significantly, more fractures than those who drank little or no cow's milk. And elderly women with a high dietary ratio of animal to vegetable protein intake have been found to have a greater risk of hip fracture than those with a low ratio. Why? Acidic animal proteins appear to cause calcium stored in the bone to be lost in the urine \u2013 and bones become fragile.\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease whereby the immune system of the body attacks its own tissues \u2013 here its own cartilage and joint linings. Meat, dairy produce and eggs can all be triggers for arthritis and can also encourage hormone imbalances that may contribute to joint pain. The authors of a recent paper in the British Journal of Nutrition concluded that \u0093it is hypothesised that meat and offal may be a major factor contributing to the inflammation in RA.\u0094 Vegetarian diets can also play a therapeutic role in the management of RA. A recent systematic review of controlled studies on vegetarian diets and RA supports the view that a short period of fasting followed by a vegetarian diet can cause clinically relevant long-term improvement in patients with RA. Authors of the review concluded that vegetarian diets might be useful in the treatment of RA.\nWeight Problems\nCurrently, over half of women and about two thirds of men are overweight or obese. The\nWorld Health Organisation states that obesity is linked to heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthritis, gallstones and some cancers. They recognise that since it is very difficult to encourage people to slim, prevention is the key. Vegetarians are, as a group, slimmer than meat-eaters.\nConclusions\nThe China Health Study is the largest and most comprehensive survey of diet and mortality in the world. On-going analysis of the diets and health status of 65 rural counties in China is revealing a very clear picture of the sorts of foods humans should be eating. The study is being organised and overseen by Professor Colin Campbell \u2013 Jacob Gould Schurman Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry, Cornell University and long time senior science advisor to the World Cancer Research Fund. Results are clearly showing that we are a vegetarian species whose risk of disease is increased by eating meat and animal products. And it's not simply good enough to put some elements of a vegetarian diet into practice. As Professor Campbell states: \u0093The closer one approaches a total plant food diet, the greater the health benefit... Animal foods, in general, are not really helpful and we need to get away from eating them.\u0094\nVibrant life-long health for children demands a way of eating that provides all the necessary protective foods and rejects all the dangerous harmful ones. Scientific evidence clearly shows us this means plant-based not animal-based foods.\n\u0093The burden of modern lifestyle diseases is enormous when the costs of investigation, diagnosis, treatment and primary and secondary prevention are included. Thus, dietary intervention with a vegetarian diet seems to be a cheap, physiological and safe approach for the prevention, and possibly management of modern lifestyle diseases.\u0094 Dr M Segasothy, NT Clinical School of Medicine of Flinders University, Australia.\nSafeguarding Children's Health\nA summary of a major new report, Safeguarding Children's Health: Defeating Disease Through Vegetarian/Vegan Diets, by the Vegetarian and Vegan Foundation, unravelling the scientific evidence that shows vegetarian diets are the only ones to ensure children's health \u2013 now and in the future.\nLaura Scott (MSc Nutrition)\n"}, {"score": 1700.5885, "uuid": "ec96d321-ad38-5e3e-9319-817dd5e8fb01", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1103wb-96-04473", "target_hostname": "www.fiikus.net", "target_uri": "http://www.fiikus.net/?recipes", "page_rank": 1.4965242e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Maija&#x27;s <em>vegetarian</em>&#x2F;<em>vegan</em> recipes", "snippet": "I am <em>a</em> 27-year old journalist&#x2F;author&#x2F;foodie from Finland, though I recently moved to Amsterdam.

I've been a vegetarian since 1999 and I mostly cook and bake vegan. I set up the Finnish version of this page back in 2002 or 2003. The reason why there aren't more recipes is that I mostly cook \"whatever there happens be in the fridge\" (or on sale, since my budget is very limited). Vegetables tend to be quite expensive here. I also often use recipes from cookbooks or Indian recipes from the web, and I try to keep this page as more than just a copy-paste archive. Most of the recipes I've created myself, some originate from cookbooks, websites or magazines but have been adapted. All of them are vegan if you use a plant-based milk. Some of the baking recipes and most of the other recipes are gluten-free or can be made gluten-free.\nMy food blog Vegventures has started its journey around the world, trying out vegan(ized) foods from all different cuisines of the world.\nI'm working on a vegan food book (partially but not only a cookbook), coming from a Finnish publisher in 2012, sadly only in Finnish (of course, translation rights can always be bought!). The book is being written with special attention to several other special diets, like sugar-free, gluten-free and even low-carb (with some fat-free and raw recipes), but that's all I can reveal at the moment. I've had several other book projects keeping me busy, which is why I haven't had the time to update this page as often as I'd like to. My vegan food blog Vegventures is still updating three times a month, though.\nNewest additions\n8th February 2012 caramel frosting\n11th October 2011 raw mango balls\n20th January 2011 lemon Dijon thyme roasted cauliflower\nPastas\na sprinkle of chili, cayenne or paprika\nsome spices (see the note below)\na little oil\na little sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup or agave syrup\nsalt, soy sauce or a vegetable bouillon cube\nYou can use almost any spices here. Herbs like thyme, tarragon, basil, mint, chervil, lovage and chives work well, or you could use some Indian-inspired spices like coriander, cilantro, garam masala, ginger, nutmeg and cumin - or a mixture of these two. I bet lemongrass would also work marvellously.\nCut the carrot into pieces and chop the onion and garlic. Cook them in a small amount of liquid until a bit mushy (if using a bouillon cube, add it into the liquid, and dried spices can be added as well). Puree with a blender or food processor. Add the oil, lemon juice, spices and salt to taste, as well as liquid if needed. Some soy/rice/almond milk, soy cream or coconut milk/cream/powder can also be added, but is by no means necessary. You can even puree in (silken) tofu or cashew nuts for a more creamy and nutritious dish. Serve over pasta.\nSweet potatoes also work well in this dish.\nCauliflower pasta\na small to medium-sized cauliflower\nan onion\na few tablespoons vegetable oil\nwhite pepper\nsalt\nparsley\nThis recipe originates from a Finnish lifestyle magazine. It is very simple but tasty, one of my and my boyfriend's favorite dishes.\nCut the cauliflower into small florets and boil in a small amount of water until done, but still crisp (a microwave oven works wonders for this). Chop the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 in oil for a few minutes. Add the cauliflower and saut\u00e9 for a few more minutes. Serve over pasta.\nMacaroni casserole\n3 dl/1.25 cups uncooked pasta\n(a vegetarian bouillon cube)\n1 dl/0.4 cups small-grained textured soy protein\n1 dl/0.4 cups water\n(alternatively you can use something else you would use in place of minced meat)\n2 large carrots\n0.5 dl/0.2 cups soy flour\n4.5 dl/1.9 cups milk of your choice\n1 tbsp corn starch or another starch\n(nutritional yeast)\nsalt (or salt and soy sauce)\n(sesame seeds, almond \"parmesan\" or soy cheese for the top)\nMacaroni casserole is a traditional Finnish dish, one people commonly list as their favorite food - of course the particular variety cooked by their mom. Ready-made options are also popular. The traditional macaroni casserole is far from vegetarian, as it contains eggs and milk (to create a sticky omelette-like \"matrix\" which holds the dish together) and almost always minced meat.\nSoak the soy protein in the water seasoned with ingredients listed in the same section, or prepare the \"mince\" you're using. Grate the carrot and chop the onion and sundried tomatoes. Boil the macaroni in water seasoned with salt or a bouillon cube for about five minutes (it is not supposed to be fully done!) and drain it. Mix all the ingredients (except for the topping, if using) in an oven-proof casserole dish and add the topping, if using.\nBake in 200C/390F oven for about 40 minutes. Makes about four portions.\nJerusalem artichoke pasta\n500 g/1.1 lbs Jerusalem artichokes\n1 onion or 2 shallots\n2-4 minced or crushed garlic cloves\n2 dl/0.8 cups milk of your choice\n2 dl/0.8 cups water\n1 dl/0.8 cups raw cashew nuts\n2 tbsp corn starch\n4 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n1 tsp grated lemon zest\n1 tsp dried basil (or some fresh basil)\n0.5 tsp dried tarragon (or some fresh)\n0.5 tsp dried thyme (-\"-)\na sprinkle ginger powder, nutmeg, cayenne and paprika powder\na larger sprinkle ground coriander\nsome black pepper\na little soy sauce\nsome mirin\nJerusalem artichokes are my favorite vegetable. If you have never eaten them, fix that as soon as possible! This is a fancy, sophisticated pasta that can (and should be!) served to dinner guests. Technically the only necessary ingredients are Jerusalem artichokes, cashew nuts and lemon, everything else can be left out or substituted with other things (though obviously the result won't be the same if you leave out everything).\nFry the onions in a little vegetable oil for a few minutes. Add the garlic and fry for a few more minutes. Peel the Jerusalem artichokes, cut them into about 0.5\" cubes and place them in a saucepan. Cover with water (this water is not included in the ingredients list!) and boil without the lid for about five minutes. Meanwhile blend the cashew nuts, the water listed in the ingredients and the corn starch with a blender or a food processor into a smooth paste. Add this paste and all the other ingredients except for Dijon mustard, lemon juice and lemon zest (and fresh herbs, if using them) and cook until the Jerusalem artichokes are done (soft in the middle, still slightly \"al dente\" on the edges). Add the rest of the ingredients and check the taste, e.g. whether it needs more salt. If the sauce feels too tart, you can add a sprinkle of sugar or other sweetener. Serve over pasta. Makes about 4-5 portions.\nLegume dishes\n3 dl/1.25 cups red lentils\n5 dl/2 cups water\n1 dl/0.4 cups bread crumbs\n(2 tbsp ketchup or tomato puree)\n2 garlic cloves\n1 tsp black pepper or garam masala\n1 tsp dried basil\n(parsley)\nlemon juice\nBoil the lentils and the onion (and the carrot, if using) in the water seasoned with soy sauce and the bouillon cube until done and puree using a blender or a food processor. Add the other ingredients and spread into a loaf pan (a rectangular, fairly narrow pan). Bake in a 175C/350F oven for about 50 minutes. Makes 4-5 portions.\nBeetroot hummus\n3 dl/1.25 cups dried chickpeas\na few beetroots\na few gloves of garlic\nsalt\nlemon juice\nparsley\nThis colorful take on hummus (chickpea dip) originates from a Finnish leftist magazine which features one recipe in each issue. There is no tahini, but nothing is stopping you from adding some. This recipe makes quite a lot, so you could halve it if cooking for one or two persons.\nSoak the chickpeas overnight and boil until soft. Peel and dice the beetroots and onion and boil until the beetroots are done. Add the chickpeas, puree in a blender or food processor and season. Good served as a dip, on sandwiches and tortillas and even as a pasta sauce.\nBeanstr\u00f6m's burgers\nBeanstr\u00f6m's burgers with gravy (scroll down for gravy recipe)\nbeetroot\nroughly the same amount of cooked beans, e.g. navy beans\nonion\nonion\n(other spices)\nLindstr\u00f6m's steak burgers are a traditional Finnish dish, minced meat burgers which contain beetroot (pickles and/or capers are also sometimes added, so add some capers if you are so inclined). This is my own version which combines beetroot with beans.\nSlice the beetroot and cook. Blend with the beans and onion (using a blender or a food processor), season and form into burger or meatball shaped patties. Bake in the oven at 200C/390F for about 40 minutes. I'd assume you can also fry them, but I haven't tried it, so I don't know how long it takes. Serve with potatoes, rice or salad and a sauce of choice, or in hamburgers.\nFalafels\n3 dl/1.25 cups dried chickpeas\n1 onion\n(0.5 dl/0.2 cups flour or bread crumbs)\n(1 tsp baking powder)\n(tahini)\n(oil for frying)\nSoak the chickpeas overnight or for at least six hours. Cook until soft, about 45 minutes. Saut\u00e9 the onion and combine all ingredients. Add more spices if needed. Puree with a blender or food processor until fairly smooth. It's alright if a few whole chickpeas or chickpea chunks remain. Some people add baking powders, others don't. I haven't noticed much difference either way.\nShape into balls and fry in oil, deep fry or bake in the oven (200C/390F, 30-40 minutes) for a healthy alternative. If using the baking method as I usually do, it's a good idea to add some oil in the mixture to avoid drying them out. Serve with a tomato sauce (and a yoghurt/tofu sauce if so inclined) and rice, bulgur, potato wedges or pita bread.\nChili sin carne\nChili sin carne with basmati rice and bell pepper slices\n5 dl/2 cups cooked beans (preferably a mixture of several types)\n3 dl/1.25 cups seitan or TVP strips (prepared)\n1.5 dl/0.6 cups sweetcorn kernels (frozen are fine)\n1 large onion or 2 smaller ones\n3-4 garlic cloves\n1 green or red bell pepper (or one of each if you want)\n1-2 chili peppers (not super hot ones)\n1 can (400 g/14 oz) crushed tomatoes (or canned tomatoes of choice)\n200 g/7 oz tomato paste\n1-2 dl/0.4-0.8 cups water\n1 tsp paprika powder (any kind which is not hot)\n1-2 tsp marjoram\nsalt\npepper\nMy own simple chili recipe which is easy to vary. You can leave out the marjoram and Dijon mustard if you want or don't have them, bu don't leave out the cocoa powder, because it adds body and richness to the taste. The maple syrup can be replaced with some other sweetener, brown sugar would probably work the best.\nChop the onion, garlic, bell pepper and chili pepper. Saut\u00e9 the onion for a few minutes. Add the garlic and chili peppers and saut\u00e9 for a few more minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and the bouillon cube and cook for about 10-15 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients except for cilantro (if using), bell pepper (and corn, if using frozen - if using fresh, add it now). Cook for about 20 minutes, while occasionally stirring. Add the bell pepper and corn (if using frozen) and cook 10 minutes more. If you want to add chopped cilantro, add it when the dish is otherwise done.\nServe with rice, bulgur, quinoa or bread - or as it is. Makes about 6-8 portions.\nSoups\n200 g/7 oz cabbage or red cabbage\n1-2 carrots\nsmall-grained textured soy protein (or other mince-like \"meat substitute\" - use something smoke-flavoured if available)\na vegetarian bouillon cube or two\nsalt to taste (may not be needed, depending on the amount and saltiness of the bouillon cubes)\npeper to taste\na couple of bay leaves\nBorts soup is a traditional Russian soup based on beetroot. It also includes meat, which has been left out in this edition. Traditionally it has been served with a dollop of sour cream. You can use a soy-based sour cream, or just leave it out. If you keep the soup in the fridge for 4-5 days, it starts to slightly ferment (think sauerkraut, not booze) which creates a slightly sour taste that I find pleasant - and which mimics the acidity given off by the sour cream.\nGrate the beetroot and cabbage with a large blade. You can grate the other veggies too or chop them. Place everything in a large pot with a sufficient amount of water and cook until soft to your liking (30-60 minutes).\nRoasted pumpkin and coconut soup\n200-250 grams/7-9 oz of fresh pumpkin\n1-2 garlic cloves\n1-2 tbsp coconut milk powder (or a few tablespoons of coconut milk/cream)\nsalt and pepper to taste\nIf you are an American, you might have a hard time believing that in Finland hardly anyone cooks with pumpkin. In fact I am the only person I know who does, except for my grandma, who used to make pumpkin relish. We do have pumpkins in all the big grocery stores in the fall, but canned pumpkin is not available here. Unlike with most recipes, the amounts are per person, so if you are cooking for, say, four, multiply by four - it doesn't really make sense to prepare just a single portion.\nCut the pumpkin flesh into about 5x5 cm (2x2 inch) cubes and deseed them. The size doesn't really matter, as long as the pieces are fairly equal in size. Roast the pieces in the oven in 175C/350F for 40-45 minutes. Also roast the garlic cloves simultaneously, but they only need 20-30 minutes (after which they will burn), so be careful. The pumpkin is done when you can easily pierce it with a fork. The edges may get a bit burnt, but it's alright. You can cut them off if you want to.\nPuree the pumpkin pieces and the roasted garlic with a blender or a food processor. You can start with only a part of the garlic, but remember that it's much milder after roasting. Add the spices and the coconut milk (powder). You can substitute it with oat or soy cream if you want. If the soup tastes very bland, add more of the spices (especially garam masala) until the taste is rich, though be careful with the nutmeg. Serve as a hot soup, or you can also use it as a pasta sauce similar to the carrot pasta.\nWild vegetable gumbo\na few liters (about half a gallon) of wild vegetables, such as\nstinging nettle leaves/tops\nabout 1 liter of water or broth\n2 tsp dried thyme\n(1-2 tsp hot sauce)\n(a little liquid smoke or smoke salt)\nThis recipe originates from Fat-free vegan, but this is a simplified version which only uses wild vegetables (you can use spinach and other non-wild greens, but then you might as well use the original recipe . If you don't know these plants, a Google Images search will probably reveal whether they grow in your area. Just be careful not to pick anything you don't fully recognize (I've been told goutweed looks like poison ivy, which doesn't grow here in Finland) and use gloves when picking stinging nettle. I'd almost recommend freezing these wild greens for this soup, as it tastes more like winter food, but you can't get the greens in the winter.\nChop the garlic and the onion. Brown the flour by stirring it on a dry pan on moderate heat for about 10 minutes, until it is slightly brown in color. Don't let it burn or you'll have to start from scratch. You can skip this step if you'd rather not use flour. Move the flour to another container and saut\u00e9 the onion for a few minutes on the pan. Add the garlic and the bay leaf and saut\u00e9 for a few more minutes. Stir in the browned flour. Add the water a little at a time while stirring as not to clump the flour. Add all the other ingredients and bring to boil. Simmer for about 10 minutes. Puree with a blender or food processor and cook for an hour more.\nIndian main dishes\nabout 600-700 g/1.3-1.5 pounds veggies, e.g.\ncarrots\n1 tbsp tamarindi paste (can be substituted with lemon juice though it's entirely different)\n2 dl/0.8 cups water\na hint black pepper\na hint turmeric\nIf you're looking for an Indian curry which is based on neither tomato sauce or cream, this one is a good choice. Note that it is a dry curry. (I sometimes want to eat a non-tomato based curry simply because I get tired of tomato sauces if I eat them all the time). As a funny anecdote, Masala is (besides the Indian name for a mixture of spices) a place near Helsinki.\nChop the chili, vegetables, onions and garlic. Mix the coriander, chili powder, salt, black pepper, turmeric, ginger, tamarindi and water together in a small bowl. Saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic in oil for a few minutes. Add the spice mixture and saut\u00e9 for a few more minutes. Add the vegetables, chili peppers and brown sugar. Cover the pan and simmer until the vegetables are done. You can add a little water if it seems too dry. Serve with rice or naan (note that ordinary naan can contain several animal-based ingredients).\nAloo saag\n1 tsp amchoor (mango powder)\n(0.5 tsp curry leaves)\nOne of my favorite Indian foods, not very fiery or otherwise spicy.\nChop the onions, garlic and spinach and dice the potatoes into small cubes. Saut\u00e9 the onion and fenugreek in oil for a few minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, coriander and salt. Saut\u00e9 for a few more minutes and add the potatoes. Keep cooking for about five minutes more. Pour in the water and the rest of the spices. Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, until potatoes are done. Add the spinach after that and cook only until it's heated through. If the result seems too soup-like, you can uncover the pan and let the excess liquid evaporate. Serve with rice or naan (note that ordinary naan can contain several animal-based ingredients).\nSaag tofu\n200 g/7 oz frozen spinach\n150 g/5 oz firm tofu\n1 onion, chopped\n2 tsp minced fresh ginger\n1 tsp ground coriander\n0.25 tsp asafoetida (hing)\nsalt\nSaag paneer or palak paneer is one of the most popular Indian vegetarian dishes. In this vegan version tofu takes the place of paneer, a type of fresh cheese. If you want you can find several pages online with ideas on making the tofu more paneer-like. The most important thing, however, is the use of spices. I feel like most recipes are too low on them. My own version has been inspired by a recipe in the blog Garam Masala (in Finnish), although I use a different method of preparation. I think this version has a tastier sauce than in my favorite Indian restaurant, which already beats many other Indian restaurants.\nCut the tofu into slices. Press moisture out of them between tissues or tea towels, preferably for a while. Cube the tofu. Fry the onion in the oil for about five minutes. Add the garlic, chili and ginger and fry for a few more minutes. Add the remaining spices and fry for a little bit. Add the tofu and fry for a few more minutes. Add the spinach and let simmer for a while. If you want you can also add soy/oat/coconut/cashew/almond cream. Serve with rice.\nRoasted cauliflower Indian style\ncoriander\nturmeric\nOk, I confess. This is based on a recipe from Veganomicon, but it only had cumin and coriander, I added the other spices. This is a tasty, healthy and simple dish that goes great as a side for any Indian food (or otherwise). When you first taste it, it may not seem like anything special - but after a few bites you just keep eating it, because it's so good.\nCut the cauliflower into florets. Put all ingredients in an oven-proof casserole dish and stir to mix. Roast in 220C/430F for 20 minutes turning once or twice, or until done to your liking.\nOther main dishes\ncarrot sliced thinly into \"coins\"\nonion, chopped\n(tofu, pressed, cut into small cubes)\nparsley\nsalt or a vegetarian bouillon cube\nspices, e.g.\ncoriander\ncumin\nThis is kind of a \"comfort food\" pilaf I used to eat a lot back when I couldn't really afford any other veggies in the winter but carrots, onion and cabbage (the parsley came from the freezer).\nCook the rice together with the spices. Saut\u00e9 the onion and carrot (and tofu if using) in oil for a while. Combine all ingredients.\nCabbage stew\nbarley pearls (or rice or bulgur - quinoa and other grains would probably work, too)\nsmall-grained textured soy protein or another substitute for minced meat\n1-2 onions\na vegetable bouillon cube or salt\nmarjoram\n(some molasses or brown sugar)\na little oil\nCabbage casserole is a traditional Finnish dish, which people either love or hate (I'm one of the lovers, in case you didn't guess). Traditionally it contains minced meat (yes, just about all Finnish food does) and is baked in the oven. This version is done on the stove, as the results are very similar and it saves you some dish-washing and other hassle. It is nutritious, low-fat and very inexpensive to make. Barley has a very low glycemic index and is thought to be the grain that keeps you full for the longest time.\nSlice or grate the cabbage and onion. Put all the ingredients in a large pot and cover with water. Cook for about 45 minutes. If you're using rice or bulgur instead of barley pearls, add them about 15-20 minutes before the dish is done (depending on the cooking time of the grain) so that you won't end up with porridge.\nNutty tofu mushroom \"meatloaf\"\n1 dl/0.4 cups chopped nuts, e.g. walnuts\n1 bag onion soup mix (check that it does not contain beef stock or anything!)\n1 large can or 2 small cans mushrooms\n2 dl/0.8 cups bread crumbs\n(cooked vegetables)\nherbs (especially thyme and parsley work well)\ngarlic\nmushroom sauce (an Asian condiment)\nmargarine and bread crumbs for the pan\nPlease don't take the name to expect this to be a \"fake\" meatloaf, it's not. But I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to people who don't like mushrooms, I just wouldn't tell them it contains them.\nThis recipe originates from VegWeb many years ago, though I've adapted it in some ways - can no longer remember how and the original recipe seems to have disappeared. This recipe is easy to vary - you can use fresh/frozen/dried and reconstituted mushrooms, or you can replace some or all of the nuts with seeds, e.g. sunflower seeds or hempseed. You can add cooked vegetables, seaweed and stuff, too. You could probably use some cooked gluten-free grain to replace the bread crumbs, though the result might turn out more mushy.\nBlend everything together with a blender or food processor. Add the spices - you can use quite a lot of herbs, but be careful with salt, soy sauce and mushroom sauce, as most onion soup mixes contain quite a bit of salt. Oil a loaf pan (unless using non-stick one). Spread the loaf mixture into the pan and flatten the top. Bake in a 175C oven for 45-50 minutes. The loaf should be rather soft when you remove it from the oven and for some time afterwards, but if you let it properly cool down without cover it should turn very solid. Serve with potatoes and gravy (cranberry sauce and mushroom gravy work well) or on sandwiches.\nSundried tomato potato salad\n800 g/1.75 pounds potatoes (preferably new ones, not too starchy)\n2 large sundried tomatoes (or more of smaller ones), finely chopped\n4 tbsp oil from the sundried tomatoes\n10-12 cherry tomatoes, halved\nsalt\npepper\nThis recipe originates from a good friend, who first served me this dish. He had got it from a family member, but the recipe did not mention any amounts, so I had to make them up. It is my favorite potato salad and good for serving at parties, because it keeps better in room temperature than most salads. It makes about four portions, though not very big ones. It does not feel greasy despite the amount of oil, because the potatoes absorb most of it. The sundried tomatoes and their oil are the whole \"trick\" to this salad, so don't substitute them with anything or be too stingy with the oil.\nBoil the potatoes until done. If not using new potatoes, peel them before cooking. Cut them up into small cubes while still warm (this is why you have to peel them in advance if necessary, as it is possible to cut warm potatoes, but peeling them is much more difficult). Add all the other ingredients but cherry tomatoes and 1 tbsp of the oil and mix. If making a very large batch, add some of the ingredients as you go, then cut up more potatoes (because they soak up the oil and spices better when hot, and if you have to prepare a large amount the first ones may cool down too early). Add the rest when the potatoes have cooled down to at least room temperature. Put in the fridge and preferably let marinate for a few hours before serving.\nTzatziki potato salad\nTzatziki potato salad decorated with cucumber stars\n800 g/1.75 pounds potatoes (preferably new ones, not too starchy)\n1/2 red onion or the green parts of a few scallions, finely chopped\n2 dl/0.8 cup unsweetened soy yoghurt\n1 tbsp oil;\n2-3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely minced\n10 cm/4 inches cucumber\n2 tbsp chopped fresh mint (or 2 tsp dried)\n1 tbsp fresh lemon juice\nsalt\nblack pepper\nTzatziki is a Greek yoghurt based dip with garlic and cucumber, which I love to use as a dip. This potato salad proved a huge hit in my book release party. Unlike most potato salads it is fairly low on fat and refreshing. This recipe makes about four portions.\nBoil the potatoes until done. Peel (if not using new potatoes) and cube them. Grate the cucumber. Mix the sauce ingredients (everything but potatoes and red onion) together. Mix everything together and let marinate in the fridge for at least several hours. If you try the tzatziki sauce as it is, note that a) it takes several hours for the final garlic flavour to develop; initially it will taste much milder, but on the other hand b) the sauce will be noticeably \"diluted\" when it is added to the potatoes.\nSides\nLemon Dijon thyme roasted cauliflower\n1 large-ish (but not humongous) cauliflower\n2 tbsp oil\n1 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n2 tsp dried thyme\n0.5 tsp grated lemon zest\nsalt\nSomeone on Twitter gave me an idea for this dish, albeit no recipe, so I had to try it out. My first try was way too bland, but even this version isn't as spicy as the ingredients might suggest.\nCut the cauliflower into florets. Mix the oil and mustard together. It can be stirred into a smooth emulsion, but it will curdle nastily as soon as you add the lemon. Mix all the seasonings (except for salt) into the oil mixture and brush it on the cauliflower (or roll the florets in the mixture). Spread on a baking sheet and sprinkle salt on the top. Roast in 220C/430F for 20 minutes turning once or twice, or until done to your liking.\nBrussels bombs\nBrussels bombs\n400 g/0.9 lbs Brussels sprouts\n400 g/0.9 lbs white/button/cremini mushrooms (or some other mild mushrooms, like chanterelles, bolete, shiitake or oyster mushrooms)\n2 tbsp oil\n2-3 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes\nsalt to taste\nThe seasonings of this recipe may be somewhat exotic, including a Middle Eastern spice mix called za'atar (use the kind that also includes sumac, easily recognized by its red color), but the result is well worth it. For years I was a Brussels sprout hater and even after that I assumed the only way to prepare them with delicious results was oven-roasting, but I was wrong.\nCut the mushrooms into fairly thin slices. If they are big, you can halve the slices, but don't chop them finely. Cut off the stems from the Brussels sprouts and slice them fairly thinly length-wise (different direction than when destemming them). Lots of leafy parts will come apart, but worry not. If the Brussels sprouts are huge, you can also halve these slices.\nFry the mushrooms on a pan without oil - you may need to sprinkle a little water on them initially to avoid burning - until they have shrunken down and most of the water has evaporated. Remove the mushrooms from the pan to a plate or bowl.\nHeat both of the oils on the pan and fry the Brussels sprouts on medium heat for 6-10 minutes, until tender. Add the sugar, mix well and set the heat higher. Fry the Brussels sprouts on the higher heat for a few more minutes until slightly browned and caramelized (don't stir them too vigorously or they will fail to brown). Add the za'tar, salt and mushrooms and fry for a bit more. Add the nutritional yeast, dtir well and serve.\nNoysters\n250 g/0.5 lbs oyster mushrooms\n1 tsp miso\n0.5 tsp roasted sesame oil\n0.5 tsp grated lemon zest\na sheet of sushi nori\nThis recipe was inspired by several oyster mushroom recipes which either used nori or other seaweed to enhance the supposedly seafoody taste of oyster mushrooms, or lemon. I also wanted it to have other Japanese influences besides just the nori. I have never tasted oysters, but this dish probably has nothing to do with shellfish. Hence, noysters. Interestingly immediately after frying the mushrooms may taste too strongly flavoured or unbalanced, but after wrapping them in the nori, suddenly it all balances out. Must be magic or something.\nFry the whole oyster mushrooms on a pan without oil, you can again sprinkle on some water if it looks too dry otherwise. When the mushrooms start releasing their juices add the miso, soy sauce and lemon juice and stir well. Fry the mushrooms until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add the oils and lemon zest and continue frying for a few more minutes. There should be no more liquid on the pan. Cut wide strips of the nori sheet and wrap the mushrooms in it.\nRoasted root vegetables with balsamic vinegar and maple syrup\n800 g/1.75 pounds root vegetables\n2 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n2 tbsp oil\nsalt\nMy favorite combination in this dish is half carrot, half parsnip, but you can also use beetroot, sweet potatoes, celeriac, Jerusalem artichoke etc. Pumpkin, cauliflower, eggplant and bell pepper might also be tasty, even though they aren't root vegetables. Keep in mind that if you're not using root vegetables it can result in very different cooking times. In that case you may have to chop some ingredients much smaller than others.\nCut up the veggies into evenly sized cubes. Mix the other ingredients together and pour that and the veggies into a casserole dish. You can also add herbs and pepper. Mix well so that the liquid covers all of the veggies. Roast in the oven at 200C/390F for about 45 minutes, depending on the size of the cubes. Stir the veggies a few times during the roasting. The best way to check the doneness is - surprise, surprise - to remove one cube and taste it (don't burn your mouth!).\nGingered carrots\ncarrot sliced thinly into \"coins\"\nvegetable oil\nginger powder or finely sliced fresh ginger\ngarlic\n(turmeric)\nsalt\nPour carrots into a saucepan and add only a little water, so that you can boil all the liquid out. Boil them for a few minutes, careful not to burn them (add more water if needed of they are not done yet). When they're dry and slightly soft but still crisp, immediately add the oil and spices and stir for a minute or two. Serve with Indian food or as a side to just about any meal. This is a real power food especially if you use turmeric, due to the anti-inflammatory and other health-promoting effects of ginger, garlic and turmeric.\nPotato wedges in the microwave\nmedium to large potatoes\nthyme\ncoriander\nMany people think you cannot make potato wedges in the microwave. I disagree. At least I have been successful.\nWash the potatoes thoroughly (don't peel them) and cut them into 6-8 wedges, preferably evenly sized. Mix the spices and oil. Roll the potatoes in the spice-oil mixture or use a\n. Place the potatoes on a microwave-safe plate upwards (the peel side down). Use other wedges to support potatoes that do not otherwise stay in this position. Heat in the microwave oven for 8-15 minutes on full power, until the potatoes are done but not dry. The time depends on the microwave oven and the amount of potatoes used (using my ancient microwave oven it took almost 15 minutes, but could be a lot quicker with a new, more powerful oven).\nSweetcorn couscous\n2 dl/0.8 cups couscous (uncooked)\n2 dl/0.8 cups water\n200 g/7 oz frozen sweetcorn kernels\nabout 2/3 of a bouillon cube (or all of it, if low in salt)\na little oil\ncashew nuts cut in half\ngarlic\nlemon juice\nparsley\nBring the water to boil and add the bouillon cube, turmeric, mint, lemon and parsley. Stir until the bouillon cube has dissolved. Add the couscous and stir well, cover and remove from the stove. Let it sit for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid clumping, until the couscous has absorbed all of the water.\nChop the garlic finely. Roast the cashew nuts slightly by stirring them on a dry frying pan (you can skip this step if you use preroasted cashews, but if they are salted, as they most likely are, you'll have to rinse the salt out). Pour them into the couscous. Saut\u00e9 the garlic and corn together in a small amount of oil for a few minutes. Pour the mixture and the apricots into the couscous and stir.\nSauces and spreads\n500 g/1.1 pounds (tart) apples\n1 dl/0.4 cups water\n1 tsp mint (preferably fresh)\n0.5 tsp garam masala\nThis is the kind of recipe I recommend if you end up with loads of apples in the fall. I do prefer mango chutney to apple chutney, but at least here in Finland I'm yet to encounter a mango surplus... I guess you could substitute mango or plums and see what happens. This recipe stems from the cookbook Vegetarian Indian, though I've adapted it slightly. According to the recipe this only keeps in the fridge for 2-3 days, but I doubt that. Considering the amount of sugar and vinegar it should keep for much longer, and I think you can freeze or can it.\nPeel the apples and cut them up into small pieces. and place everything in a saucepan (except for fresh mint, if using). Boil on medium heat until mushy and most of the liquid has evaporated. Mash the apples with a fork during cooking, so that the end result is jam-like, but still chunky. Serve with e.g. lentil dishes.\nIndian date tamarind chutney\n1 dl/0.4 cups seedless dates\n4 dl/1.7 cups water\n3 tbsp white or apple cider vinegar\n0.5 tsp cumin\n0.5-1 tsp salt\nchili powder or sauce to taste\nThis sweet, slightly tart and usually just a little (if at all) hot chutney is my favorite chutney and goes very well with e.g. lentil dishes. This recipe makes quite a lot and because it's not very acidic it will keep a few weeks at most, so you can halve the recipe. Many recipes have no vinegar, but I like adding some. Many recipes also feature jaggery or brown sugar, but I find the sweetness of the dates makes it unnecessary, unless you want to use more tamarind. Tamarind is a very tart fruit which is also a part of HP and Worcestershire sauces. You can find it in Asian groceries and these days probably also in supermarkets. Some people also add fennel, anise or ginger to this chutney.\nPlace all ingredients in a saucepan and cook for some 20 minutes. Add more water, if it looks too thick. Check the taste and add salt, sugar or spices if you want to. Puree with a blender or a food processor. Serve chilled or in room temperature.\nTofu spread\nmushrooms (canned, fresh, frozen or dried - if dried, reconstitute them first)\n(mushroom sauce (an Asian condiment somewhat similar to soy sauce, but much thicker, like syrup))\nthyme\nbasil\noil (if not using sundried tomatoes in oil)\nBlend tofu and ingredients from either variation into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor. You can of course add other herbs, like parsley. This spread keeps in the fridge for about four days - after that it begins to get sour in taste.\nHot Chi Minh sauce\nTofu, cabbage and sesame seeds in Hot Chi Minh sauce\nabout 2/3 or 3/4 hoi sin sauce\nthe rest gochujang sauce\nExcuse the punny name, this sauce blends the salty hoi sin of Chinese cuisine with the fermented Korean chili paste gochujang (which has a rather paprika-ish taste, not awfully hot). This sauce works great for Asian stir-fries and such.\nMiso gravy\n3 dl/1.25 cups vegetable broth\n1-2 tbsp corn starch\nparsley\nchives\nThis gravy is omnivore-friendly and goes well with e.g. seitan, potatoes and Beanstr\u00f6m's burgers. You can substitute most ingredients or leave them out if you don't have them.\nPut everything but the starch together in a saucepan and bring to boil while stirring. Separately mix with a splash of water in a small glass or bowl and stir until combined. Pour into the sauce while stirring and let thicken for a moment before removing it from the stove. Makes about 1.5 cups or 3-4 portions.\nBaked goods\n5 dl/2 cups non-dairy milk\n2.5 dl/1 cups wheat flour\n2 tbsp oil\n1 tl vanilla extract/sugar\n0.5 tsp salt\nI don't know if these should be called pancakes or crepes. In Finland they are usually baked in a special pancake pan, which has four (or sometimes 7-9) round indentations for pouring the batter, but sometimes they are made on a normal pan or a huge cast iron pan placed on top of open fire, called muurikka. To confuse things further, the dish called \"pancake\" (pannukakku) in Finnish is made with the same batter (just a little thicker), but baked in the oven. However, just about everyone prefers the fried variety. Both kinds are traditionally eaten with strawberry (sometimes raspberry) jam and sometimes vanilla sauce or whipped cream. In Finland pancakes are not traditionally eaten at breakfast, but as a dessert or as a not-so-healthy meal, often at the summer cabin.\nI think the same batter is essentially used for most European crepes (e.g. French and Dutch), thinner than American pancake batter and without leavening agents, but Finns may be the only ones who use a pancake pan (?). As I said, you can use a normal frying pan, non-stick or cast iron, but you may have to adjust the amount of flour slightly. If the pan isn't non-stick, you will probably have to add a little oil for each pancake, or after every two pancakes. Many people add oil anyway even with a teflon pan.\nMix all the ingredients together. The batter should be almost completely free of lumps. It should be refrigerated for about 30 minutes before frying the pancakes, which will also help dissolve some of the lumps. Heat the pan to medium or medium-hot temperature and fry a test pancake. Usually the first ones will be a little weird, because the pan won't be hot enough yet, even when you think it is. The pancakes should be about 2 mm thick. Be careful not to make the pancakes too big. Some people are skilled enough to flip a pancake filling the whole pan (sometimes by throwing them upwards!), but most can't do it. It is ready to flip when it is mostly firm. The pancakes should be somewhat brown on the first fried side and mostly golden on the other side. This makes enough for 2-3 people, or more if eaten as a dessert.\nSpinach pancakes\nSpinach pancakes with lingonberry jam\n7.5 dl/3 cups non-dairy milk\n3 tbsp soy or chickpea flour (may be optional)\n4 dl/1.7 cups wheat flour (not sure if gluten-free flours work)\n250 g/0.5 lbs frozen spinach\n1 dl/0.4 cups TVP granules, reconstitute in a little water seasoned with soy sauce (measure before adding water)\n3 tbsp oil\n1-1.5 tsp salt\nSpinach pancakes are a traditional Finnish main dish, served widely in schools and other lunch cafeterias and are a very popular store-bought food. Sadly the store-bought varieties are usually very bland and contain very little spinach. My grandma used to add minced meat to her spinach pancakes (I don't know how traditional this is) and when I went vegetarian she bought small TVP granules and used them instead - I didn't give her this idea or anything, she is just awesome like that.\nFry the pancakes as per the instructions of the previous recipe (they will be a little thicker and less crisp, though). This makes enough pancakes as a main dish for about 3-5 people.\nIf you're more used to American pancakes, you could alternatively just add spinach to your ordinary pancake recipe, add a little salt and leave out the sugar. Spinach pancakes are always eaten with lingonberry jam over here. If you can't find it, cranberry jam or cranberry sauce would probably work, as cranberries are quite similar to lingonberries. You could try other condiments too, but on their own the pancakes are quite bland.\nOat crisps\n1.5 dl/0.6 cups uncooked oatmeal\n0.75 dl/0.3 cups wheat flour (or use gluten-free flour of choice)\n0.5 tsp baking powder\n0.75 dl/0.3 cups sugar (include some brown sugar for a better taste)\n0.5 dl/0.2 cups oil\na pinch of ginger\na pinch of vanilla extract/sugar\nClassical Finnish cookies, extremely easy to make. Can be served as a dessert topped with e.g. berries and ice cream.\nMix all the ingredients. Form into small blobs on baking parchment. Bake in 200C/390F for about 7 minutes.\nVegan cookies\n8 dl/3.4 cups wheat flour\n1 tsp vanilla sugar/vanilla extract\n2 tsp baking powder\n0.5 dl/0.2 cups apple juice (or water)\n1/2 ripe banana\nThese are quite plain cookies, but very delicious. The use of these \"egg substitutes\" (banana and soy flour) creates cookies that are slightly crisp on the outside but moist on the inside - much better than the original recipe of traditional Finnish cookies, which uses two eggs. I don't know if you can substitute flax seed, soy yoghurt or something else for the soy flour liquid mixture. The cookies keep for up to two weeks - if you really have any left after that time.\nBeat soft margarine and sugar into a somewhat fluffy mixture. Mash the banana into a smooth puree and mix with soy flour and apple juice. Mix dry ingredients together. Combine the banana paste, the fat sugar mixture and the dry ingredients and mix into a batter. Don't overmix. Form into small cookies and bake in 175C/350F for about 10 minutes. I cannot remember how many cookies this makes, but I think it is about 20-24.\nBuckwheat muffins (gluten-free)\n1 dl/0.4 cups fruit or vegetable puree\n1 dl/0.4 cups oil or melted margarine\n1 dl/0.4 cups sugar\n1 dl/0.4 cups buckwheat flour\n1 dl/0.4 cups potato or tapioca starch (most likely corn starch works too)\n1 tsp baking powder\nThese muffins are gluten-free, but don't take that to mean that they aren't as good as normal muffins. They are moist, soft and delicious, best straight out of the oven, but they are edible for several days. You can also add nuts, dried fruit or chocolate chips. For the puree you can use e.g. carrot, mango or apricot. The original recipe used sweet potato, but we've mostly used baby food fruit purees. This recipe is extremely easy to make and easy to remember, as well. However, we haven't got it to work with metallic muffin cups (they don't raise properly or sink afterwards, for some reason), only by using paper liners without cups (I also have a silicone muffin pan but I haven't tried it yet). This recipe makes 8-12 small muffins.\nMix all the ingredients using a blender or a food processor. The batter should be thick, sticky and gooey. If it feels less than thick (which may happen if you use a baby food puree as they often have added liquid), add a little bit of flour. Spoon into small muffin liners. Bake in 200C/390F for about 15 minutes.\nBerry \"quark\" pie\nany pie crust\n150-200 g/5.3-7 oz tofu\n1-2 dl/0.4-0.8 cups soy milk, soy cream, oat cream, rice milk or something similar (less if you use silken tofu)\n0.5 dl-1 dl/0.2-0.4 cups sugar\n1-2 tsp vanilla sugar/extract\n1 tsp lemon juice\n3-4 dl/1.25-1.75 cups fresh or frozen berries, preferably raspberries, blueberries, blackberries or a combination of these\nQuark pie is a traditional Finnish dessert topped with a mixture of quark (a low-fat curd cheese which is somewhat like yoghurt but thicker and creamier), eggs and cream, with several variations. It is a bit like those cheesecakes that are baked. Some people only use quark at the top and only add raisins. A quark pie made using canned apricot or peach halves is often eaten on Easter. In the summertime people use raspberries, blueberries or a combination of them. This vegan version uses tofu and a non-dairy milk/cream to emulate the quark topping.\nYou can use any non-savoury pie crust. If you don't have a recipe, you can just mix water, flour and oil until it resembles a pie crust. You can add a sprinkle of salt and some sugar, but it's not necessary. Grease a pie pan (if needed) and spread the crust at the bottom and to the sides. Blend the tofu and the liquid with a blender or food processor until smooth. The consistency should be like thick yoghurt or a little thicker. If you are not using soy milk or cream, you may want to add 1 tsp of corn starch, because the lecithin in soy adds as a thickener. Add the sugar, vanilla and the lemon juice. The result should be sweet but with a hint of tartness. Remember that the berries have not been sweetened, so if you use tart berries (like currants) you may want to add more sugar.\nIf you are using frozen berries which have been sitting in the freezer for a while, rinse them quickly with cold water in a sieve, to rinse off some of the \"freezer taste\". You can fold the berries into the tofu mixture, or first spread the tofu mixture on top of the pie crust and then add the berries (you will probably have to press them in). If the berries are very moist, the latter method prevents the tofu mixture from turning red/blue, which might make the result more aesthetical.\nBake in a 200C/390F for 20-30 minutes, depending on how wet the topping is. It should not brown at all, so remove it from the oven after 30 minutes, unless the topping is still very liquid (which should not happen). Let it cool and serve chilled or at room temperature. Keeps for 3-5 days in the fridge. I don't know if it can be frozen.\nChristmas chocolate muffins\nThese muffins make nice gifts too - if you manage not to eat them all\n4 dl/1.7 cups wheat flour\n1 dl/0.4 cups cocoa powder\n2 tsp baking powder\na small pinch nutmeg (very little)\n1 dl/0.4 cups oil\n1.5 dl/0.6 cups brown sugar (preferably muscovado or similar)\n2 dl/0.8 cups soy or other milk\n2 dl/0.8 cups prune puree (can use baby food or make your own)\n1-2 tsp vanilla sugar/extract\n100 g/3.5 oz dark or semisweet chocolate, melted\nPerhaps more cupcakes than muffins, this recipe originates from the wonderful Tofu for Two blog, but luckily Heikki and Anni allowed me to post my own adaptation. These muffins use more holiday related ingredients and spices - besides spices also prune puree and almond extract. They are fairly healthy as far as chocolate muffins go, less fat than most (mostly oil) and contain many antioxidant/nutrient packed ingredients like cocoa, soy, cinnamon, prunes and brown sugar.\nI've also tried adding balsamic vinegar, which goes great with the taste, but the muffins don't rise so well as I feared. I guess the pH of the batter drops too low and some of the baking powder should be replaced with soda. You can try this addition if you want to take the risk (they are not in any way ruined even if they don't rise properly, but they just don't look as good). You can make the muffins more Christmassy by adding things like raisins/sultanas, rum extract, grated lemon zest, preserved cherries, crushed almonds, nuts and/or dried cranberries.\nMix the dry ingredients (everything up until nutmeg) together and the wet ingredients together in separate bowls. If the melted chocolate becomes very clumpy when you mix it with the other liquids, put the entire bowl containing the wet ingredients in the microwave and nuke on low power (even the thawing mode may work) until the chocolate melts in nicely. Mix wet and dry ingredients together. Pour into 12 muffin cups and bake in 175C/350F for about 15 minutes. You can decorate the muffins with e.g. almond flakes.\nGingerbread balls\nGingerbread balls just out of the oven\n250 g/9 oz margarine\n2 dl/0.8 cups brown sugar\n1 tbsp molasses\n6-6.5 dl/2.5-2.75 cups wheat flour\n1.5 tbsp soy flour\n2.5 tbsp water or apple juice\n2 tsp cinnamon\n2 tsp baking soda\nabout 45 hazelnuts, halved\nThis is my grandma's Christmas cookie recipe, which may have a bit of a misleading name, as it is not all that close to gingerbread (despite the spices) nor are the finished cookies shaped like balls, but this is the most accurate translation nonetheless. I tweaked the recipe to make it vegan by replacing the egg with soy flour and liquid.\nBeat the margarine, sugar and molasses together until somewhat light and fluffy. Mix together the soy flour and the water or apple juice and pour into the margarine sugar mixture, while still beating it. Mix the dry ingredients together and add to the rest. Do not add all flour at once - you should only add so much that you can form the dough into small balls, it shouldn't be too stiff. Form the dough into small balls. This recipe should make 80-90 tiny cookies, so the balls should be fairly small. After you've made the first batch, press a hazelnut half on top of each ball (or have someone else top the cookies while you're forming them - even a small kid can do this quite well). Bake in 175C/350F for about 8 minutes. The cookies will be a bit soft at first, but they're almost better if you let them dry out until crunchy, and that way they will keep for several weeks.\nTreats and desserts\n2 tbsp brown sugar (preferably something very dark, like muscovado)\n2 tbsp brown rice syrup\n2 tbsp coconut milk (or cashew milk/almond milk/soy cream)\n2 + 1 tbsp soy milk\n1 + 2 tbsp vegan margarine\n1/4 tsp vanilla extract\n3.6 dl/1.5 cup confectioner's sugar (or more)\nI wanted to develop a vegan frosting with a distinct caramel/butterscotch/fudge/taffy flavour, but that wasn't actual caramel (not that there is anything wrong with caramel, but I needed a frosting). In one vegan cookbook I have such a recipe which starts by making caramel and then adding piles of confectioner's sugar, but I didn't find the flavour fudgy enough. So I developed a recipe which has just the taffy flavour I was looking for. If you aren't using coconut milk but some other fatty non-dairy milk/cream, you can replace the soy milk with it, for a total of 5 tbsp. I didn't dare to use this much coconut milk, as I did not want a coconut frosting.\nThis frosting can most likely be piped, if you cool it down just the right time and use the right amount of confectioner's sugar. The amount is for 12 cupcakes (a nice amount smeared on top), but if you want to pipe it on them or frost a cake, I recommend doubling the recipe. You could probably use it inside of a layer cake too, perhaps with something tart, but then you probably need an even larger portion - remember that the confectioner's sugar shrinks down to nothing.) If spread with a knife it isn't particularly fancy, so I recommend additional garnishes such as sweets, sprinkles, chocolate or fruit.\nMix the first three ingredients, 2 tbsp soy milk and 1 tbsp margarine in a small saucepan. Bring to boil, lower the heat and cook, stirring, for 3-5 minutes until it resembles fairly thickc caramel. Add to it 1 tbsp soy milk, the vanilla and the sugar. Stir and let cool for a bit. Add the remaining 2 tbsp of margarine (you don't want the hot caramel to melt it, since you are making a kind of buttercream). Mix into a smooth paste. If you feel it is stiff enough, spread or pipe it on top of the cake/cupcakes. Otherwise let it cool for a bit more or add a bit more confectioner's sugar before using. Refrigerate the frosted baked goods.\nRaw mango balls\n2.4 dl/1 cup dried mango\n1 tsp lemon zest\n1 tsp lemon juice\n2.4 dl/1 cup mild nuts (macadamia, cashew, almond or a combination of these, you can also include some hemp and sunflower seed)\n2 tbsp agave syrup (or maple syrup, which isn't raw though)\n0.6 dl/1/4 cup toasted flaked coconut (toasted obviously isn't raw, but so good)\n2 tbsp chia seeds (can probably substitute flax but won't be as tasty)\n2 tbsp coconut oil\n0.5 tsp vanilla extract\nThis is an adaptation of these mango coconut balls , but not being such a big fan of coconut I replaced most of it with nuts and made some other changes as well. For some reason I didn't think of adding lucuma, but it works great with mango so should make a lovely addition here, too, maybe 1-3 tbsp.\nSoak the dried mango in a little water for 30 minutes. Drain and discard the water (or use in cooking/baking/smoothies). Grind the nuts and chia seeds in a blender or food processor into a coarse meal. add all the other ingredients and blend until you have a sticky \"dough\" (you will likely need to scrape it down to get all of it blended). Roll into balls larger than a cherry but smaller than a meatball. You can roll them in flaked coconut if you want to. Store in the fridge, keeps 1-2 weeks.\nNettle candies\nfresh stinging nettle leaves (use gloves when picking them!)\nvegetable oil\nsugar\nI learnt this recipe back when I was a little kid. This is a very easy candy to make - perhaps not the healthiest treat due to the liberal use of oil and sugar, but on the other hand nettles are very nutritious (much more so than spinach!) containing massive amounts of calcium, iron, vitamin C and other good stuff. Pick the nettle leaves from plants that are not in flower yet. You may be able to use blackcurrant leaves or other non-bitter edible leaves, but I haven't tried it.\nFry the nettle leaves in the oil. The aim is to get them crisp and crumbly without much browning - it doesn't take long. Even if some of the leaves aren't crisp, it is completely safe to eat them (they no longer sting). Roll the leaves in sugar and serve. I have no idea how long these would keep - usually they disappear like magic...\nLime mead\n500 g/1.1 pound brown sugar (or 250 g brown sugar and 250 g normal sugar)*\n1/2 lemon\na pea-sized piece of fresh yeast (1/4 tsp or even less)\na few raisins\n* especially if using a very dark sugar like muscovado, it might be a good idea to use normal sugar as well\nFinnish mead is traditionally made for Mayday celebrations. It is quite different from the most common meaning of the word (honey wine). It does not contain honey and is very low on alcohol. Even little kids are allowed to have some. The taste is difficult to describe, a bit like lemonade but with brown sugar, and almost everyone likes it. It is slightly sparkling when made properly. This version is otherwise completely traditional, except that I substitute lime for half of the lemon.\nHeat water or most of it in a large pot or saucepan. Mix in the sugars, juices from the citrus fruits and citrus peel. Pour into a large bowl or bucket. Add the rest of the water and let cool down to body temperature. Add the yeast. Cover the bowl with a towel or parchment and let brew in room temperature overnight. Bottle in well-washed glass or plastic bottles (you can use e.g. soda bottles). Don't fill the bottles completely full, because the brewing process produces some carbon dioxide and the bottles might burst if filled to the top. Add a few raisins and a tablespoon of sugar into each bottle (most of the sugar falls into the bottom of the bottle, undissolved, feeding the yeast which also falls to the bottom).\nLet the bottles sit in room temperature for one more day and then move to the fridge. When the raisins rise to the surface, the mead should be done. It usually takes 5-8 days. The mead can be stored for about one week after it is done, though it is generally best to consume it within a few days, as the fermentation continues, turning sugar into alcohol and resulting in a more alcoholic (and less sweet) beverage.\nCocoa chai\n1 dl/0.4 cups rice or soy milk\n1 dl/0.4 cups water\n1/2 tsp fresh ginger, grated (or a sprinkle of ginger powder)\n1/2 tsp cardamom\n1/4 tsp cinnamon\n1 bag of tea or 1 tsp black tea (preferably strong, such as Assam, Kenya or \"English breakfast\")\n1 tsp sugarfree cocoa powder\n2 tsp sugar\nHeat the milk and water until boiling and add the other ingredients. Let it steep until the tea is ready, though a bit longer than you'd usual steep your tea (3-10 minutes, depending on the kind of tea).\nVegan kulfi\nKulfi decorated with slivered almonds and cardamom\n3 dl/1.25 cups coconut milk (don't use light)\n3 dl/1.25 cups soy or some other mild non-dairy milk (like rice or almond - wouldn't use oat)\n1 dl/0.4 cups raw cashew nuts\n0.5 dl/0.2 cups blanched almonds\n0.75 dl/0.3 cups pistachios, shells removed (measure after removal)\n1 tsp ground cardamom\n0.5 tsp almond extract\n0.75-1 dl/0.3-0.4 cups sugar\nKulfi is an Indian frozen dessert, often called an ice cream, but because it's not whipped, it's more like French parfait. Normally kulfi mostly consists of evaporated and condensed milk and heavy cream (with pistachio nuts usually added, at least to the kulfi which is served in Indian restaurants in Finland; I believe this is properly called \"pista kulfi\"). In India it's usually sold in the shape of ice cream sticks, but in the restaurants here it's usually served in a shape like this (the kulfi in the picture was frozen in a silicone muffin tin). Because the kulfi mixture is not whipped, the dessert will be rock solid when taken out of the freezer. You should take it out 15 minutes in advance to let it soften enough to allow for eating.

While doing this you can also push off some of the inner skins of the nuts. Use a blender or a food processor to grind the cashews, almonds and about 1/3 or 1/2 of the soy milk into a fine paste. After that add the pistachio nuts and blend until they're ground but not a complete paste (you can add them with the other nuts and grind into a paste if you want to, but many people prefer their kulfi to have some nutty texture left). Add the cardamom, the vanilla and the almond extract. The almond extract isn't mandatory, but it's often used to enhance the flavor of pistachios. Heat the coconut milk and the sugar in a saucepan and stir until the sugar is dissolved. This step is not to caramelize the sugar or anything, just to fully dissolve it.\nPour the coconut milk mixture into the rest of the mixture and mix well. Pour the mixture into 6-8 silicone muffin cups, small ramekins or even disposable cups, anything small that you can fit into the freezer (silicon muffin cups work the best if you want to serve them like in this picture). Let freeze completely, at least for several hours. Take out of the freezer about 15 minutes before serving and decorate with slivered almonds, coconut flakes and/or cardamom.\nVegan pasha\n125 g/4.5 oz vanilla soy yoghurt (can use lemon, orange or unflavored, but may have to adjust the flavorings)\n150 g/5.25 oz tofu (preferably silken)\n1 dl/0.4 cups raw cashew nuts\n40 g/1.4 oz margarine\n"}, {"score": 1698.7782, "uuid": "150c7fe3-4e66-5954-8244-4875c1e53167", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0916wb-10-09568", "target_hostname": "atheistuniverse.net", "target_uri": "http://atheistuniverse.net/group/vegetarianandveganatheists", "page_rank": 1.211877e-09, "spam_rank": 96, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em> Atheists - Atheist Universe", "snippet": "<em>the</em>\u2026Continue You need to be <em>a</em> member of <em>Vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em> Atheists to add comments!", "explanation": null, "document": "You can also sign up with:\nWe are a worldwide social network of freethinkers, atheists, agnostics and secular humanists.\nLatest Activity\n"}, {"score": 1690.157, "uuid": "4c816128-ed47-58f4-9f5b-76c7be86c37e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1712wb-95-12882", "target_hostname": "www.tigersandstrawberries.com", "target_uri": "http://www.tigersandstrawberries.com/category/recipes-almost-vegetarian-vegetarian-and-vegan/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.1723927e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Tigers &amp; Strawberries \u00bb Recipes: Almost <em>Vegetarian</em>, <em>Vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em>", "snippet": "\u201cCarola\u201d <em>is</em> one of my favorite all-time potato varieties.

By Laura Cooke\nThere are lots of \u201cweird\u201d foods out there that if we were honest about it, we have no clue where they come from.\nSomething that has been a relatively recent addition to my shelves is quinoa (pronounced keen-wah or kee-noh-uh.) with it\u2019s slightly nutty taste, it makes an excellent change to rice, pasta and couscous. The fact that it\u2019s packed with nutrients, high in protein and gluten-free makes it even better.\nQuinoa grains\nSo what is it?\nQuinoa refers to the edible seeds of a grain-like crop that has been cultivated and used by humans for thousands of years \u2013 starting in the Andean region of South America.\nWay back in the day, the Incas thought of quinoa as sacred, calling it the \u201cmother of all grains.\u201d When the Spanish came along during the 15-17th century, they weren\u2019t too keen on quinoa. Looking down on this \u201cfood for Indians\u201d they tried to get the locals to stop growing the crop because of the status it held in non-Christian ceremonies. At one point they just outright banned it. Usage declined and was replaced by other grains like wheat.\nQuinoa before flowering\nMiracle food?\nEvery now and again, a new \u201cmiracle food\u201d makes waves around the globe. And quinoa has certainly been one of the chosen few of the ancient staples that have been \u201crediscovered\u201d. It \u201chas remarkable nutritional properties, not only from its protein content (15%), but also from its great amino acid balance\u201d.(Abugoch, 2009). It has high levels of the amino-acid lysine \u2013 which you don\u2019t find in many plant foods \u2013 and is packed with minerals and minerals.\nIn a feature on health24.com , author Dr IV van Heerden says:\nIt is evident that one cup of cooked quinoa is a rich source of energy supplying about 12% of the daily energy requirement for an adult woman who is not trying to lose weight and nearly 15% of the daily energy intake if a woman is on an energy-reduced diet.\nSo while quinoa is an excellent source of readily available fuel and will make an important contribution to the energy needs of anyone who has a high energy demand such as sportsmen and women, and very active children and teenagers, slimmers should only eat moderate portions to prevent weight gain. Have half a cup of cooked quinoa for breakfast to sustain you for the whole morning.\nIt has very high protein content and has 9 essential amino acids, including lysine, making it a complete protein and great addition to the vegetarian or vegan diet. It\u2019s also low in fat, a rich source of B vitamins, namely thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and folate and on top of all this gluten-free!\nSo while you probably shouldn\u2019t eat buckets of the stuff (and you shouldn\u2019t really eat buckets of anything, particularly chicken), it\u2019s pretty amazing stuff.\nHow to cook it\nThe seeds are covered in a bitter-tasting coat containing saponins, which are removed after harvesting.\nTo cook the stuff, you follow a similar process to cooking rice. Rince the seeds, then add one cup quinoa to two cups water and bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 15 minutes until they become translucent.\nTake a look at the fabulous post and video on My New Roots for more on how to cook this miracle food.\nWhere to buy\n"}, {"score": 1668.1874, "uuid": "77741874-5f35-5d6a-be3c-39ab4ec498fd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0710wb-88-02873", "target_hostname": "www.vrg.org", "target_uri": "http://www.vrg.org/press/poll.htm", "page_rank": 1.1765793e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>THE</em> <em>VEGETARIAN</em> RESOURCE GROUP -- <em>VEGAN</em> MICROWAVE COOKBOOK", "snippet": "According to <em>The</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> Resource Group, <em>the</em> market for <em>a</em> company producing <em>a</em> meatless product <em>is</em> much broader than <em>the</em> number of <em>vegetarians</em> or <em>vegans</em> in <em>the</em> country.", "explanation": null, "document": "For Immediate Release January 2, 2006\nContacts: Jeannie McStay (410) 366-8343\nJohn Cunningham (410) 366-VEGE\nHOW MANY YOUTH ARE VEGETARIAN?\nVegetarian foods seem to be everywhere. Supermarkets are now carrying soy milk, most restaurants have vegetarian options, and even fast food chains are offering or testing veggie burgers.\nAccording to The Vegetarian Resource Group, the market for a company producing a meatless product is much broader than the number of vegetarians or vegans in the country. For example, some colleges have said more than 20 percent of their students are eating vegetarian foods, though some customers may have both a vegetarian selection and a meat item on their plates.\nIn a 2004 nationwide survey by Aramark, nearly a quarter of college students said finding vegan meals on campus was important to them. The popularity of meatless foods has certainly created many opportunities for businesses, and made life easier for vegetarians.\nHowever, The Vegetarian Resource Group wanted to know how many young people are actually vegetarian. In a national poll, VRG asked: Please tell us which of the following foods, if any, you never eat: Meat. Poultry. Fish/Seafood. Dairy Products. Eggs. Honey.\nBecause foods are named and the word \u0093never\u0094 is used, the number will be different than other polls that ask if you are a vegetarian and are more dependent on personal definitions.\nIn this 2005 poll, 3% of 8 -18 year olds were vegetarian (that is, never eat meat, poultry, and fish/seafood.) A whopping 11% of 13-15 year old females said they never eat meat. According to VRG, this can be an important reason why so many companies are delving into the meatless meals category. Even if these teens don\u0092t stay completely vegetarian throughout life, they and their families are likely to form a sizable audience for appealing vegetarian foods.\nView past vegetarian polls .\nThe 2005 survey results have a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, so the figure should /not/ be taken as exact and can\u0092t be truly compared with other surveys because of wording differences. However, this number generally agrees with other VRG teen and adult polls.\nMethodology: Harris Interactive\u00ae conducted the online survey on behalf of The Vegetarian Resource Group between April 14 and 18, 2005, among a\nnationwide sample of 1,264 youth aged 8- to 18-years old of whom 650 were male and 614 were female. Though this online sample is not a probability sample, in theory, with probability samples of this size, Harris Interactive estimates with 95 percent certainty that the results of the overall sample have a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points of what they would be if the entire population of U.S. youth aged 8-18 was polled with complete accuracy. Sampling error for the various sub-sample results is higher and varies. Harris Interactive is the 15th largest market research firm in the world.\nThe Vegetarian Resource Group is a non-profit organization which educates the public about vegetarianism. Vegetarians do not eat meat, fish, or fowl. Vegans are vegetarians who also do not use other animal products such as eggs or dairy.\nDIETARY HABITS OF 8- TO 18- YEAR-OLDS IN THE U.S. IN 2005\n100% Total 8- to 18-year-olds\n6% Never eat meat\n24% Never eat fish/seafood\n3% Never eat meat, poultry, fish/seafood (vegetarian)\nEight percent of females say they never eat meat.

Eventually the bony articular surfaces come into contact and the bones begin to degenerate. This condition tends to occur in older people; around 12 per cent of people over 65 in the UK are affected (NHS Direct, 2005). Osteoarthritis can develop after an injury to a joint; this can happen months or even years after the injury. The most frequently affected joints are in the hands, knees, feet, hips and spine.\nThe next most common type of arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints. This type of arthritis affects up to three per cent of the UK population, and tends to occur in people between the ages of 30 and 50. Women are three times as likely to develop this condition as men (NHS Direct, 2005). Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic condition characterised by hot painful swelling in the joints. In many diseases inflammation can help towards healing but in rheumatoid arthritis it tends to cause damage. For some people the pain and discomfort caused by this condition has a serious impact on their lives. Rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disease, caused by a fault in the immune system that causes the body to attack its own tissues. This condition usually starts in the wrists, hands and feet but can spread to other joints in the body.\nOther forms of arthritis include ankylosing spondylitis, cervical spondylitis, fibromyalgia, lupus, gout, psoriatic arthritis and Reiter\u2019s syndrome (NHS Direct, 2005). Arthritis can also affect children but the causes of juvenile arthritis are poorly understood. It has been suggested that genetic factors or viral infections may be responsible (NHS Direct, 2005).\nUntil recently there has been little scientific research into the links between diet and arthritis but recent research suggests that diet may be involved in its development. It is important for people with arthritis to maintain a healthy well-balanced diet. Arthritis Care (the UK\u2019s largest voluntary organisation working with and for people with arthritis) suggest a diet high in fruit, vegetables, pasta, fish and white meat and low in fatty foods such as red meat, cream and cheese can help (Arthritis Care, 2004). Indeed most people could benefit from eating less sugar and saturated fat and eating more complex carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and minerals.\nIf you suffer from arthritis it is important to keep as healthy as possible by ensuring that the diet provides all the important nutrients including minerals such as calcium and iron. Some people are concerned that their calcium intake may drop if they cut out dairy foods. Arthritis Care suggests that if you don\u2019t like or are unable to eat dairy products, you should obtain enough calcium from non-dairy sources (Arthritis Care, 2004a). They list several non-dairy sources of calcium including bread, green leafy vegetables and baked beans (also see here ). They also warn people with arthritis to be careful not to have too much animal protein, salt or caffeine as excessive quantities of these can reduce the body\u2019s ability to absorb or retain calcium (Arthritis Care, 2004a). Others are worried about iron, particularly people who have recently stopped eating red meat. This should not be a concern as vegetarians and vegans are no more likely to become iron deficient than meat-eaters. Indeed one of the largest studies of vegetarians and vegans in the world (the EPIC Oxford cohort study) looked at over 33,883 meat-eaters, 18,840 vegetarians and 2,596 vegans and found that the vegans had the highest intake of iron, followed by the vegetarians then the meat eaters (Davey et al., 2003). It should be stressed that milk and milk products are an extremely poor source of iron, whereas pulses, dried fruits and dark leafy vegetables are good sources.\nThe Arthritis Research Campaign (ARC) founded in 1936, raises funds to promote medical research into the cause, treatment and cure of arthritic conditions. ARC has produced dietary guidelines for people with arthritis and they suggest that one of the most important links between diet and arthritis is being overweight. The extra burden on the joints can make symptoms considerably worse. Losing weight can have a dramatic effect in improving the condition. In order to lose weight, you need to use more energy than you consume in the diet. Research shows that vegetarians and vegans weigh less than meat-eaters and ARC suggests that a lacto-vegetarian diet might help some people with rheumatoid arthritis. They also go further to state that a vegan diet may also help (ARC, 2002). Cutting down on sugar and taking regular (even gentle) exercise will help control weight as well.\nSaturated fats are the most important kind of fat to cut down on. The body does not require saturated fats and they may aggravate arthritis whereas essential fatty acids (EFAs) have been shown to help some people with arthritis as the body uses EFAs to make substances that help control inflammation (ARC, 2002). When trying to lose weight, it is important to maintain a good intake of vitamins and minerals. This means consuming plenty of fruit and vegetables. A healthy balanced diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables, pulses and whole grain carbohydrate foods (such as wholemeal bread, brown rice and whole wheat pasta) provides a good supply of vitamins and minerals (and fibre). A diet lacking in fruit and vegetables, and containing processed carbohydrates (such as white bread, white rice and white pasta) does not provide such a good source of these essential nutrients. This can have a deleterious effect on health as the ARC states that a good diet can still help even if strong drugs are being taken to treat arthritis (ARC, 2002).\nThe subject of food allergy and arthritis is quite controversial. However, research has shown that, in some people, rheumatoid arthritis can be made worse by certain foods including milk products and food colouring (ARC, 2002). If you think you are allergic to a particular food ARC recommend cutting it out of your diet for one month then reintroducing it to see if it makes a difference. In 2001, Swedish researchers reported that nine out of 22 patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed significant improvements in their condition compared to one patient out of 25 after following a gluten-free, vegan diet (Hafstrom et al., 2001). Of course it is difficult to say whether eliminating milk was the reason these patients improved as they eliminated all animal foods and gluten from the diet. However, this work does provide evidence that dietary modification can benefit arthritis patients.\nBovine somatotrophin (BST)\nIn cows, milk production is influenced by the complex interaction of a range of hormones. Bovine somatotrophin (BST) is a natural growth hormone that occurs in cattle and controls the amount of milk that they produce. In 1994 Monsanto began marketing a synthetic version of BST, known as recombinant BST (rBST), which was sold as Posilac. Injecting dairy cows with rBST alters the metabolism to increase milk production by up to 15 per cent. Since its introduction in 1994, Posilac has become the largest selling dairy animal pharmaceutical product in the US. Sold in all 50 states, rBST is used in around one-third of the nine million dairy cows in the US (Monsanto, 2005).\nWhile the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permit the use of rBST, its use is associated with severe welfare problems, for example increasing the incidence of lameness and mastitis. For reasons of animal health and welfare, the use of rBST in the EU was prohibited in 2000. Indeed Canada, Japan and many other countries have banned the use of rBST because of its effects on animal health and welfare. However, there are no restrictions on the import of rBST dairy products, or any requirement to label them.\nThe Government\u2019s Veterinary Medicines Directorate does not carry out any testing of imported milk (Defra, 2006). Furthermore, Defra confirmed in correspondence with the VVF, that since the EU is a single market once a product has entered, if it is transported on to another country within the EU, then the origin of the product will be the EU country rather than the originating country (Defra, 2006). In 2005, the UK imported over 1,000 tons of dairy products (mainly ice-cream) from the US (Defra, 2006a); these figures have declined from over 5,000 tons in both 2001 and 2002 but still remain a concern, especially as the consumer has a limited chance of discriminating against imports from the US. The sensible option is to avoid all dairy products.\nConcern has been expressed over several health issues associated with the use of rBST. The increased incidence of lameness and mastitis in rBST-treated cows inevitably leads to an increased use of antibiotics to treat these and other infections. Over half of the antibiotics that are produced in the US are used for agricultural purposes (Mellon et al., 2001). Antibiotic use is known to promote the development of antibiotic resistance. Thus the widespread use of these drugs has contributed to the high frequency of resistant bacteria in the intestinal flora of farmed animals (Lipsitch et al., 2002). This raises concerns about the development of antibiotic resistant infections in humans. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2000 reported that the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Salmonella is associated with the use of antibiotics in cattle. This study described how a new antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmonella was isolated from a 12-year-old boy admitted to hospital with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. The boy lived on a ranch in Nebraska and subsequent investigation revealed the presence of the identical strain of bacteria, resistant to the antibiotic ceftriaxone, among cattle on his family\u2019s ranch and nearby ranches that had suffered outbreaks of salmonellosis. The cattle had been treated with ceftriaxone. This evidence suggests that the boy\u2019s gastrointestinal infection was acquired from cattle (Fey et al., 2000). The obvious concern here is that the widespread use of antibiotics in cattle can lead to an increase in antibiotic-resistant strains that may subsequently transmit to humans. This is a public health concern and the question must be asked: how much evidence of harm do we need before we much further restrict the use of antibiotics in farm animals?\nMilk production increases in cows treated with rBST because it promotes the production of the naturally occurring growth hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) which then stimulates the glands in the cow\u2019s udders to produce more milk. Research shows that rBST use on dairy cows can substantially increase the levels of IGF-1 in their milk (Prosser et al., 1989). This raises concerns about the potential biological action of IGF-1 from cow\u2019s milk in humans especially because IGF-1 from cows is identical to human IGF-1. Professor Samuel Epstein, an international leading authority on the causes and prevention of cancer, warns that converging lines of evidence incriminate IGF-1 in rBST milk as a potential risk factor for both breast and gastrointestinal cancers (Epstein, 1996).\nSo why should this concern us if we do not allow the use of rBST in the UK? Well in terms of human health, the concern is that milk and milk products imported from countries that permit the use of rBST may lead to the consumption of foods that promote increased levels of IGF-1 in humans. In 1999, the minister of state, Baroness Hayman, referred to a report from the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) which stated that while the use of rBST does not increase the level of BST found naturally in cow\u2019s milk, there is a two-to-five fold increase the level of IGF-1 in the milk, which she acknowledged may be implicated in the occurrence of colonic cancer. However, Hayman reiterated the VPC\u2019s view that the risk to human health was likely to be extremely small. Hayman also suggested that just 0.3 per cent of total milk and milk products imported into the UK come from the US where rBST is authorised for use (UK Parliament, 1999).

It could be that you want to prevent this disease or just want to find our more about the most common cancer affecting women in the UK....\nWhatever your reasons, this guide, based on the latest science, explains how meat and dairy foods are linked to breast cancer. It will help you discover different ways of eating healthier, tastier foods that don\u2019t contain the harmful substances found in meat and dairy but do contain vital fibre and disease-busting compounds.\nIt also contains a useful seven-day meal plan with easy-to-follow, inspiring recipes, as well as a list of delicious superfood ingredients with an explanation as to why they can help combat illness.\nThis guide cannot guarantee to cure cancer but it does provide the scientific and nutritional information you need to make an informed choice about which foods to eat that, coupled to conventional therapy, can help overcome breast cancer. It also shows you how to eat healthily to help prevent breast cancer.\nIf you would like to read a more thorough review of the scientific research on breast cancer and diet see the VVF\u2019s fully-referenced scientific report One in Nine available free online at www.vegetarian.org.uk or for \u00a32.50 from the VVF. The title refers to the number of women in the UK who will get breast cancer in their lifetime. This report explains why breast cancer cases are continuing to rise and looks at how diet affects your risk of developing one of the West\u2019s major killers.\nBREAST AWARENESS\nBreast development\nDuring puberty, blood levels of the sex hormone oestrogen rise, causing the development of sexual organs and secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and body hair, so that reproduction becomes possible. During this time girls develop milk-producing glands called lobules at the back of the breasts. These lobules are connected to tiny tubes called ducts that can carry milk to the nipple. The lobules, ducts and blood vessels are surrounded by fatty tissue and connective tissue called stroma, attached to the chest wall.\u00a0 Men have much less fatty tissue in their breasts than women but can still be affected by breast cancer.\nThe female breast\nPicture credit Philip Downs\nBreast changes\nTry to get to know how your breasts normally look and feel. This will help you notice any changes early on, which is very important as effective treatment is then more likely.\nLook out for the following changes:\nIf one breast becomes larger than the other\nIf a nipple becomes inverted\nRashes on or around the nipple\nDischarge from one or both nipples\nSkin texture changes (puckering or dimpling)\nSwelling under the armpit or around the collarbone (where the lymph nodes are)\nA lump that you feel is different to the rest of your breast tissue\nContinuous pain in one part of the breast or armpit (not a common symptom)\nIf you notice any of these changes, make an appointment to see your GP as soon as you can but try not to worry as most changes do not turn out to be breast cancer.\nDifferent types of breast cancer\nWhen cancer occurs, cells grow in an uncontrolled way. If untreated, the cells may spread to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells develop in the ducts of the breast, the cancer is called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If they occur in the lobules, it is referred to as lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). If the cancer cells have spread into the surrounding breast tissue, lymph glands or further within the body, it is called invasive breast cancer.\nOestrogen sensitive cancers\nOestrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) cancer is when there are certain proteins on the surface of the cancer cell that respond to oestrogen by causing the cancer cell to grow. Most breast cancers (around 75 per cent in postmenopausal women and 50-60 per cent in premenopausal women) are ER-positive. Determining whether breast cancer is ER-positive or not can help to guide treatment as women with ER-positive cancer are usually offered hormone therapy (to block the effects of oestrogen), whereas women with ER-negative breast cancer are usually offered chemotherapy.\nNUMBER CRUNCHING\nThe rising tide...\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in the UK and one in nine women will get this disease. Each year more than 44,000 women are diagnosed with it: that\u2019s more than 100 women a day. Breast cancer accounts for nearly a third of all cancer cases in women in the UK.\nTen most common cancers in UK women\nThere has been much publicity about how improved diagnostic techniques and treatment methods have improved the chances of surviving breast cancer. Indeed, survival rates have been improving for more than 20 years and more women are surviving than ever before. However, not so well publicised is the fact that the chances of getting breast cancer are rising year on year. The number of cases in UK women is increasing by more than one per cent each year. Between 1971 and 2003, the incidence rates have increased by an astounding 80 per cent!\nIncidence and mortality (death) rates of breast cancer in England and Wales\nbetween 1971 and 2003\nMale breast cancer\nBreast cancer can occur in men too although the numbers affected are a great deal lower; one in 300 men in the UK at some point in their lives compared to one in nine women. However, the incidence of breast cancer among men is also increasing. Between 1973 and 1998, it increased by 26 per cent. What is particularly worrying is that men tend to have larger tumours which have spread further by the time they seek help. It should be remembered, though, that breast cancer is rare amongst men. The five most common cancers in UK men are prostate (24 per cent), lung (16 per cent), bowel (14 per cent), bladder (five per cent) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (four per cent).\nBreast cancer around the world\nStudies show that the number of people who get breast cancer in different countries varies widely. Some countries have a much higher incidence than others. For example, in Northern Europe and North America the risk of breast cancer is many times higher than that in parts of Asia and Africa.\nBreast cancer rates in selected countries in 2002\nWhy do the rates of breast cancer among different populations vary so much? Some people suggest it is due to genetic differences between populations. Maybe white Northern European women are genetically programmed to be more susceptible to breast cancer than Chinese women? However, this is simply not the case.\nScientific studies show that when people move from a country that experiences very low levels of breast cancer to one with a much higher incidence (for example Japanese women moving to the US), their risk of breast cancer soon changes to match that of where they move to. This shows us that genes alone are not the cause and that some environmental factor such as chemical pollutants or diet must be involved.\nBreast cancer rates in the UK\nUK breast cancer rates vary from region to region. For example lower rates are seen in some areas of Yorkshire, Trent and Wales and significantly higher rates are found in East Anglia, Oxford and in the Southwest. This must reflect differences in diet and lifestyle. Furthermore, South Asian women living in the UK are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than other women but the risk varies according to ethnic subgroups. For example, Muslim women from India and Pakistan are almost twice as likely to develop breast cancer as Gujarati Hindu women. This may be because Gujarati women are more likely to be vegetarian and will therefore have a higher intake of fruit and vegetables in their diet which has been shown to lower the risk of breast cancer.\nThese observations have led scientists to investigate the causes of breast cancer, including the role of diet.\n\u00a9 Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation (VVF) 2007.

Thrush is less common in men but it can occur, causing irritation and redness particularly on the head of the penis.\n(The uncontrolled overgrowth of Candida can occur in the gut and mouth causing a whole gamut of problems in men, women and children, although this isn\u2019t labelled \u2018thrush\u2019. But here we\u2019re talking about vaginal thrush only.)\nTHE THRUSH TAKE-OVER BID\nWhen you research Candida you\u2019ll find many differences of opinion on the causes and cures \u2013 but one resounding agreement \u2013 antibiotics cause thrush! Antibiotics are taken to kill damaging bacteria; the trouble is they can\u2019t distinguish between the good and bad guys and kill both. If you take repeated courses you are at great risk of creating an imbalance between our friends and foe. We have 300-500 species of bacteria in our guts and our health depends on a delicate balance between these wee residents!\nThe good guys play a vital role from helping keep the acidic pH in the large intestine which deters Candida and many other germs; to depriving Candida and other parasites of food, water and oxygen to increasing our absorption of nutrients; lowering blood cholesterol and making certain vitamins. So antibiotics kill good bacteria such as lactobacillus in the gut which may be the start of Candida and other germs taking over. Antibiotics also kill the good bacteria in the vagina, allowing thrush to take hold. Yet antibiotic prescriptions are handed out in their millions each year and often inappropriately. Meat-laden, junk diets result in compromised immune systems that can\u2019t fight infections and are one of the direct causes of the worrying overuse of antibiotics \u2013 as is the factory farming of animals.\nDiet also has a direct impact on our vulnerability to thrush. Another major agreement amongst researchers is that sugar plays a sickly sweet part! A diet with too many refined main meals and biscuits, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks, dairy products and wine contribute to thrush by increasing sugar in our urine. This feeds the yeast in the genital area. Similarly, women with diabetes are more likely to get thrush because this disease increases blood sugar levels, which may, in turn, increase the sugar in vaginal secretions. Diabetic women also tend to have high sugar levels in their urine, so again giving Candida a feast.\nNot so obvious is that pregnancy and oral contraceptives also play havoc with our sugar metabolism. Hormone levels change dramatically during pregnancy and this increases sugars in vaginal secretions. The Pill can affect a woman\u2019s ability to process sugar. With extra sugar in the body, yeast will use it to grow.\nYOU'RE TOO ACIDIC BABE!\nOur body is naturally slightly alkaline and if our pH veers towards acidity, it allows parasites, including Candida, to thrive in our intestines. Certain foods are acid forming once digested, and others alkaline forming. A food's acid or alkaline-forming tendency in the body has nothing to do with the actual pH of the food itself. For example, lemons are very acidic, however the end-products they produce after digestion are very alkaline so lemons are alkaline-forming in the body. Likewise, meat will test alkaline before digestion but it leaves very acidic residues in the body so, like almost all animal products, meat is very acid-forming. When Candida flourishes in these acidic conditions, it may result in recurrent thrush.\nHowever just to confuse you, the vagina (unlike our body) is naturally acidic \u2013 but too acidic for thrush. So if something upsets the pH of the vagina \u2013 and that could be menstruation or washing with soap (as most soaps are alkaline and remove the acidity) - that too can help Candida to thrive. That\u2019s why it really is important to stop using soap if you get thrush.\nAnother aspect of diet which is important in thrush, is nutritional deficiencies. The government\u2019s food and nutrition survey found that 80 per cent of British kids are guzzling away on white bread, savoury snacks, biscuits, chips and chocolate confectionery. Roughly 60-75 per cent had not eaten any citrus fruits or leafy green vegetables during the week of the survey. The point here is that nutritional deficiencies in adults and now kids, is incredibly common in the UK. Deficiencies stop our systems from thriving and that includes our digestive system, again giving a helping hand to parasites to take control.\nHave you noticed that your thrush reoccurs if you are under sustained stress? The hormone cortisol increases in times of stress and it dampens the effectiveness of our immune system. It also tells cells to go into survival mode. This causes the body\u2019s digestion to become subdued and the undigested food nourishes Candida and other parasites, and the good bacteria diminish.\nSo there are many causes for Candida but you can see that our diet is an important component of the illness and the cure. There are many books that offer help with diet. It is up to you to try which you think will work for you.

Are humans evolutionarily adapted to eat animals, plants or both?\nOne of the most pervasive myths surrounding vegetarianism is the belief that humans are naturally meant to eat meat \u2013 that we are evolutionarily adapted to eat and thrive on dead flesh. A new Guide by Viva!, Wheat-eaters or Meat-eaters?, knocks this fable firmly on its head. Humans belong to the primate family. Our closest living relatives such as chimpanzees and gorillas live on a diet of foods overwhelmingly derived from plants. We ignore our evolutionary past at our peril, with the growing epidemics of killer diseases such as cancer, heart disease, obesity and diabetes now occurring in almost every corner of the planet.\nCUES FROM THE BODY: WE'RE WHEAT-EATERS, NOT MEAT-EATERS\nBasic anatomical comparisons show that people have much more in common with herbivores than carnivores \u2013 or even omnivores! Just a look at an adult's mouth \u2013 let alone a child's \u2013\u00a0 shows that the opening is too small for anything but relatively small pieces of food. We can't even swallow those whole, but must chew them finely and mix them with saliva before the ball of food will slide down the oesophagus. In contrast, carnivorous animals such as cats tear off chunks and swallow them almost immediately.\nOur teeth are much better suited for eating starches, fruits and vegetables \u2013 not tearing and chewing flesh. What many refer to as our 'canine teeth' are nothing at all like the sharp blades of true carnivores designed for processing meat.\nOur jaws can open and close as well as move forwards, backwards and side-to-side. This is ideal for biting off pieces of plant matter and then grinding them down with our flat molars. In contrast, carnivores' lower jaws have very limited side-to-side motion. They are fixed only to open and close, which adds strength and stability to their powerful bite.\nA TRIP THROUGH THE BODY\nFrom top to bottom, human digestive systems have evolved to efficiently process plant foods. Digestion begins in the mouth with a salivary enzyme called amylase. Its sole purpose is to help break down complex carbohydrates from plant foods into simple sugars. As there are no carbohydrates in meat, true carnivores don't need this enzyme. Their salivary glands don't make it.\nThe stomach juices of meat-eating animals are highly acidic. They have to be, so that they can break down the large quantities of muscle and bone materials they eat. Much lower concentrations of stomach acid are needed to digest starches, vegetables and fruits. Weight for weight, plant protein requires half the amount of hydrochloric acid to digest it, compared to animal protein. It is also digested in half the time. Vegans and vegetarians have fewer peptic ulcers than meat-eaters, mainly because their plant-based diets are easier to digest.\nThe human intestine is long and coiled, much like that of apes, cows and horses. This makes digestion slow, allowing time to break down and absorb the nutrients from plant foods. In contrast, the intestine of a carnivore, such as a cat, is short, straight and tubular. This means that flesh can be digested very rapidly, and the remnants excreted quickly, before they putrefy (rot).\nThe difference in transit time (time taken for food to make its way from the mouth to the anus) between humans and carnivores is what really brings the anatomical differences home. Humans \u2013 even those on a high fibre diet \u2013 have an average transit time of almost 41 hours. In stark contrast, the average transit time in a pure carnivore such as the mink, is just 2.4 hours! This means that when people eat meat, it has plenty of time to putrefy (rot) and cause the production of cancer-causing agents.\nWe cannot make vitamin C \u2013 we need it in our diet. Carnivores and omnivores manufacture it internally.\nHANDY MAN\nFinally, take a look at the external differences. Our hands are made for gathering plants, not for ripping flesh. We cool ourselves by sweating, like most other plant-eating animals, rather than panting like carnivores. We drink by sipping, not by lapping like a dog or cat.\nBACK TO OUR ROOTS\nFruits, green leafy parts of plants, shoots, seeds, nuts, roots and tubers are the fundamental components of the primate eating pattern \u2013 and common sense tells us that these foods should be the foods that humans eat, too.\nOur Stone Age predecessors ate three or more times the amount of plant foods that we do \u2013 about nine servings daily of fruits and vegetables, compared to the UK average of three. And we consume just a fraction of the antioxidants, calcium, iron and other nutrients that our ancestors ate every day.\nCHOLESTEROL CALAMITY\nIt is well known that too much cholesterol is harmful to the human body. What is less widely known is that cholesterol is only found in animal foods, and not plant foods.\nMeat-eating animals have an unlimited capacity to process and excrete cholesterol from their bodies. For example, you could feed a cat egg yolks all day long, and he or she would excrete all of it, never suffering from a build up of cholesterol. On the other hand, people's (like other plant-eating animals) livers have a very limited capacity for cholesterol removal. Most people have great difficulty eliminating the amounts of cholesterol that they take in from eating animal products. We were made to consume plant foods (containing no cholesterol); therefore we have never needed a highly efficient cholesterol-eliminating system.\nMEAT-EATING CHIMPS?\nIt has passed into popular folklore that chimps have been observed eating meat, which has been taken as an indication that humans too have evolved to eat meat. This is in large part due to a David Attenborough film many years ago in which chimps were seen hunting. Attenborough's observations were first recorded by chimpanzee expert Jane Goodall. Over 10 years, the 50 or so chimpanzees killed and ate 95 mammals. They were all tiny \u2013 the young of bushpigs, bushbuck and baboons \u2013 and most weighed 10lbs or less. It works out at 2.4 grams per individual per day \u2013 about the size of a pea! So, meat-eating in chimps is actually rare \u2013 it forms just 1-1.5 per cent of the overall diet. And, of course, not all chimp groups hunt at all.\nWhilst our primate ancestors did eat insects this was not in sufficient quantity to provoke a change in their dentition. Primate canine teeth are small and their molars have a large grinding surface with a thick enamel covering, making their jaws a powerful crushing, grinding and chewing machine designed to cope with vegetation.\nOf all the living primates, humans are the only one to eat large animals, the rest being almost entirely herbivorous.\nBACK IN TIME\nSixty million years ago the lower primates first developed \u2013 the mammals from which we all sprang. So much of what makes us skilled as mammals was developed at this time. They were all plant-eating species.\nTwenty million years after the lemurs came the anthropoids, the higher primates that include monkeys, apes and humans \u2013 another group of vegetarians. Around 18 million years ago came the hominoids, apes which lack tails and have larger brains and bodies than the monkeys. They evolved in Africa and included one called Proconsul, sometimes referred to as the 'Daddy of us all'. It is thought that we share this ancestor with the gorilla and it is another famous vegetarian. DNA studies show that we have a close relationship with the gorilla and the chimpanzee and that we split from one common ancestor around five to six million years ago.\nBecause we have the fossilised jaws to study, we know that these primates were herbivores and ate fruits, nuts, berries and the cambium which grows in the spring beneath the bark as the tree begins to swell. Some of us still eat it today and we call it slippery elm, a popular health food supplement for digestive disorders.\nMEAT-EATING BEGINNINGS\nMeat-eating began in the last one-and-a-half million years with the advent of Homo erectus, who lived until 300,000 years ago. However, this species was still largely a plant-eating animal. Contrasted with the life of an 80-year-old human being it means that only in the last 15 years would meat have been eaten. For 65 years we were vegetarian.\nOf course no-one can deny that human beings became omnivorous. But very little meat was eaten compared to today's consumption. Hunting was given a great boost when climactic changes destroyed the food sources in the northern climes in the great Ice Ages. However in evolutionary terms this is a very short period.\nHumans are naturally vegan and we ignore, at our peril, our primate ancestry. The sooner we ditch the 'meat maketh man' myth the better for our health. We were never meant to eat meat or dairy (which humans only began consuming 6,000 years ago), our bodies are not designed to eat flesh and our health is suffering because of it. Once we exclude animal products from our diets our own health, our planet's health and the lives of billions of animals will be better for it. Only then can we really claim to be a truly great ape.\nExtracted from the Viva! Guide, Wheat-eaters or Meat-eaters? . Buy it for just \u00a31 inc p&p.

Do you think there is a difference between these three desserts or do they all sort of blend in as some variation of butter, sugar and flour atop fresh fruit? Well, with fresh apples, pears, and pumpkins from autumn harvest on their way, I think it\u2019s important that we can all properly label the desserts we will make out of this fine fruit. So here\u2019s my guide on how to tell a crisp from a crumble and a cobbler from a crisp, with plenty of tasty recipes along the way (of course!)\nCobblers\nAmerican cobblers are considered \u201cfruit stews with dough dropped on top before baking\u201d (ochef.com) They involve a bottom layer of fruit that is then topped with ingredients for a biscuit dough. The result is a dense, rich dessert. Not to be confused with British cobblers (made with meat), popular cobbler ingredients include: apples, peaches and cherries.\nRecipes:\nCranberry Cobbler\nCrisps\nCrisps also have a bottom layer of fruit, but their topping is much more crunchy than cobblers. Instead of a dough-like pastry that rises, the crisp is topped with a different proportion of butter, sugar and flour that is sort of crumbly, and only briefly browned in the oven. Crisps might include oats or granola in their topping as well.\nRecipes:\nCranberry Apple Crisp\nCrumbles\nThe crumble also begins with fruit at the bottom, but is topped with a different butter-flour-sugar mixture called a \u2018streusel\u2019. The three ingredients are mixed just until crumbly and then poured on top of the fruit. This dish is very similar to a crisp but the crumble originated in Britain whereas the crisp is seen as more American. Crisps are also more rich than crumbles with higher amounts of sugar, butter and flour.\nRecipes:\nTags: apple crisp , cobblers , crisps , crumbles , dessert recipes , recipes\nPosted by Hillary , 5:55 PM\nThis entry was posted on Monday, September 15th, 2008 at 5:55 pm and is filed under dessert , fruit .

If you\u2019ve read my previous blogs, you know that I am a big proponent of doing the absolute best you can, and being really proud of that.\u00a0 Even if you only feel that you\u2019re able to eat a vegan diet 50% of the time right now, you\u2019ll still be reducing the suffering and needless death of animals by 50%, you\u2019ll be reducing your carbon footprint by 50%, and you\u2019ll make some great strides toward bettering your health.\nHowever, there is a difference between a bonafide vegan and someone who eats a vegan diet:\u00a0 The word \u201cvegan\u201d connotes a basic philosophy that other living beings are not ours to exploit.\u00a0 Therefore, vegans do not eat other animals or their products, we do not wear other animals (like leather, suede, fur or wool) and we do not use products that contain animal ingredients (such as many shampoos and other household products.) It may be next to impossible to do all this perfectly, but as long as a person is doing his or her best to abide by these principles, they are officially vegan.\nThere are many people who are not particularly concerned about the animals or environment, yet choose to eat a vegan diet for health reasons.\u00a0 These people are eating a vegan diet, but are not vegans, because true veganism is an entire philosophy \u2013 not just a diet. In fact, many people are now using the term \u201cplant-based diet\u201d instead of \u201cvegan diet\u201d to differentiate between those who adopt this diet for health reasons versus philosophical reasons.\nHowever, while you can be a bonafide vegan or a person who eats a vegan diet, you cannot be \u201cvegan-ish.\u201d For example, just like you cannot be Christian-ish (you either believe that Jesus is the son of God or you do not) you cannot be vegan-ish either (you either believe it is acceptable to kill or exploit other beings for human purposes or you do not.)\nI\u2019m not here to tell you what you should believe.\u00a0 If you eat a vegan diet full time or part time, I\u2019m simply requesting that you either call yourself a vegan, or say that you eat a vegan diet, based on whether you espouse a vegan philosophy.\u00a0 Just please don\u2019t call yourself \u201cvegan-ish!\u201d\n"}], [{"score": 1651.3052, "uuid": "f6be8d70-b61d-534d-8f6c-b235ca08de9d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0605wb-31-06528", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/guides/Fish/Report/", "page_rank": 1.2406332e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "<em>The</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation (VVF) <em>is</em> <em>a</em> science-based health <em>and</em> nutrition charity which monitors <em>and</em> interprets <em>the</em> growing body of research linking diet <em>and</em> health.", "explanation": null, "document": "Walnuts\n8 halves (28 grams)\nIf more people knew that they could produce sufficient amounts of EPA and DHA from ALA they might be less inclined to turn to potentially decaying and contaminated fish oils. The research indicates that the only thing vegetarians and vegans miss out on by avoiding fish is the toxic pollutants that contaminate them.\nOmega-3s from algae - cut out the middleman\nWhilst omega-3 is present in fish oil, fish do not produce omega-3 in their bodies. Fish obtain their omega-3 from their diet of algae. People who are concerned about intake of DHA can use algal supplements as a source of this long chain omega-3 too. There are even brands available online that can provide both DHA and EPA.\nAlgae used for omega-3 supplements is usually grown in controlled conditions away from the sea, so it doesn't interfere with the marine ecosystem and doesn't impact on fish stocks nor their natural food source. So, in addition to the numerous health benefits of this vegan-friendly source of long chain omega-3s, it is a more environmentally friendly choice.\nBy switching from fish to a plant-based source of omega-3 you'll be doing yourself a favour and the environment too, whilst getting the safest, toxin-free omega-3 fats.\nOily fish, EFAs and health\nHeart health\nWhy are oily fish promoted as essential for good health? The answer lies, partly, in the role EFAs may have in lowering the risk of heart disease and stroke.\nOily fish first got the nutritional thumbs up when it was observed that populations such as the Japanese and Inuit (Eskimo) people, with their fish-rich diets, have much lower rates of CVD. Further investigation suggested that the EPA and DHA fatty acids found in fish can help reduce blood-clotting, lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride (fat) levels in the body. All these effects can help lower the risk of CVD. However, the promotion of oily fish ignores the fact that EPA and DHA can also be formed within the body from plant sources of ALA. Not to mention the toxic pollutants found in fish and the environmental catastrophe of industrial fishing.\nNumerous studies have looked at the benefits of eating polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly the omega-3s: ALA, EPA and/or DHA) to reduce the risk of heart disease. Three major studies are frequently referred to: the DART, GISSI and LYON studies. The DART and GISSI trials demonstrated how fish oils could reduce mortality in people with CVD. However, there is now a large body of evidence showing how plant-based ALA can do the same without exposure to harmful toxins found in oily fish. The third well-known study, the LYON study, clearly demonstrated this.\nDART - using dietary fish to prevent secondary heart disease\nOne of the best-known early studies was the Diet and Reinfarcation Trial (DART) (Burr et al., 1989). This study looked at the effects of dietary intervention in the secondary prevention of heart attacks in patients who had previously recovered from one. In this study 2,033 men who had recovered from a heart attack were allocated to receive or not receive advice to eat around 300 grams of oily fish per week, or take fish oil supplements giving an equivalent amount of omega-3 fats.\nResults showed that the fish group had a 29 per cent reduction in death during the two year recovery period following a heart attack. So it was concluded that fish oil may reduce CVD mortality; the effect being greatest during the period of recovery following a heart attack.\nBurr suggested that omega-3 fats may help normalise heartbeat rhythms by exerting what is called a beneficial anti-arrhythmic effect. In other words, omega-3s may help your heart beat more regularly and calm irregular activity (arrhythmia). Others agree that the most likely mechanism by which EPA and DHA reduce the recurrence of heart disease is by stabilising arrhythmias (Marchiolo et al., 2002). Research suggests that the anti-arrhythmic effect of omega-3 fats is partly due to their ability to reduce the electrical excitability of cells.\nAs stated, fish oils (or components of them) may also offer benefit by reducing blood-clotting. Platelet cells found in the blood ensure that blood becomes sticky (platelet aggregation or blood-clotting). This is important for stopping bleeding, for instance, if you are wounded. However, too much clotting can cause the cells to clump together and stick to the walls of blood vessels. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. EPA appears to reduce the tendency of blood platelets to clump together. Consequently, it may prevent the formation of blood clots and the narrowing of coronary arteries, which can lead to a heart attack. However, extensive reduction in platelet aggregation can lead to prolonged bleeding times following injury. It is important that blood is neither too thick nor too thin.\nThose taking blood-thinning medication (such as daily aspirin or warfarin), should speak to their GP before eating lots of food that has added omega-3 or before taking fish oil supplements, as this can also reduce blood-clotting.\nInterestingly, although there were less fatal heart attacks among the DART fish group, the total number of attacks was not reduced. So although eating oily fish reduced the risk of dying after a heart attack, it did not prevent a secondary heart attack. Whereas a large body of evidence shows that plant-based diets can be used to both prevent and even reverse heart disease (see the VVF guide Have a Heart for further information).\nGISSI - using fish oil supplements to prevent secondary heart disease\nThe GISSI-Prevenzione trial similarly looked at the effect of EPA and DHA on 11,324 patients (primarily men) who had recently survived a heart attack. Half the participants received a daily supplement (1 gram per day) of omega-3 fish oil capsules, while the other half did not (GISSI, 1999).\nAfter three-and-a-half years, results showed a 20 per cent reduction in the overall death rate among the fish oil group. However, like the DART trial, the rate of non-fatal heart attacks was unchanged. It should also be noted that the large amount of omega-3 fats given (1 gram) is the equivalent of consuming a very large amount (around 100 grams) of oily fish per day. This exceeds the 'safe' amount the UK government recommends (FSA, 2009).\nMore recently, a Finnish study looking at the relationship between omega-3 levels and the five-year risk of heart attack and death in patients with heart disease found that relatively high blood levels of omega-3 fats were associated with a lower risk of death (Erkkil\u00e4 et al., 2003). However, like the previous trials, omega-3s did not prevent the recurrence of a heart attack. This finding fits well with those from earlier studies showing that fish consumption and omega-3s may be associated with decreased death rates but do not necessarily prevent a secondary heart attack in high-risk subjects. Conversely, there is a huge body of evidence (see below) showing how vegetarian or vegan diets can actually reverse heart disease in patients and so reduce both death rates and secondary heart attacks.\nNo benefit from fish for low-risk heart disease populations\nWhile the DART and GISSI trials suggested that fish oils may reduce death rates in people who have already had a heart attack, the same cannot be said for the wider population. A major review of studies examining the relationship between fish intake and heart disease found that fish consumption is not associated with a reduced risk in low-risk populations (people with no history of heart problems) (Marckmann and Gronbaek, 1999). This review concluded that healthy people (at low-risk of heart disease) do not gain any additional protection for the heart from eating fish. The authors question whether the apparent protection in high-risk individuals is attributable to eating fish or whether the link might be explained by other dietary or non-dietary confounding factors.\nIn a later editorial, one of the review authors reaffirmed that while an average daily intake of 50 grams of fish may lower heart disease death rate, the apparent protection is limited to high-risk populations (Marckmann, 2003). Marckmann observes that both the DART and GISSI trials were well-designed and performed and the results were convincing. However, he says that their conclusion, that heart disease patients should be prescribed oily fish or fish oil supplements, has been seriously challenged by more recent research.\nNo long-term protection against heart disease\nA long-term follow-up to the DART study (Ness et al., 2002), showed that the death rate in the two groups (fish and no fish) after an average follow-up of 15 years was almost identical. So the dietary advice given to former DART participants, over a decade previously, offered no long-term protective effect. So while fish oil may offer short-term protection to people who have suffered a heart attack, this protection does not appear to stand the test of time.\nA further study looked at whether dietary advice (to eat oily fish or fish oil supplements) could reduce the death rate among men with angina (Burr et al, 2003). Another surprising result was found: advice to consume fish and the intake of fish oil capsules was associated with an increase in mortality of 20 per cent and 45 per cent respectively! Furthermore, this increase was even more prominent for sudden death. Such results should make health organisations and the Government sit up and rethink their position on fish and fish oil in the primary and secondary prevention of heart disease.\nMore recently, in 2006, a major review published in the British Medical Journal drew the evidence together by reviewing all the relevant studies published over the previous four years (Hooper et al., 2006). It looked at 89 studies on omega-3 fats and health and concluded that long chain and shorter chain omega-3 fats do not have a clear effect on total mortality, combined cardiovascular events or cancer.\nThe review noted that the 2003 study by Burr contradicts the other large studies by not suggesting a benefit of omega-3s in patients with angina. One possible explanation the researchers suggest for this is that as this trial had the longest follow-up period of all the studies reviewed it could be that the negative effects of oily fish and fish oil supplements were due to the cumulative harmful effects of mercury. In other words, the pollutants in fish and fish oil supplements taken over time may cancel out the beneficial effects of the omega-3 fats they contain.\nAnother study found fish oil supplements increased life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms in patients with implanted defibrillators (Raitt et al., 2005). This study actually found that fish oil supplementation did not reduce the risk of abnormal or irregular heart rhythm and may even be pro-arrhythmic in some patients.\nLYON - using plant-derived ALA to prevent secondary heart disease\nThe Lyon Diet Heart Study investigated whether a Mediterranean-type diet could reduce secondary heart disease (a second heart attack) compared to a prudent Western-type diet (de Lorgeril et al., 1999).\nIn this study, 423 patients with a history of heart attack were randomly assigned either a Mediterranean diet or a prudent Western diet (as recommended by the American Heart Association). The Mediterranean diet was largely plant-based containing more bread, pulses (peas, beans and lentils), vegetables (both root and green vegetables) and fruit. Butter and cream were replaced with healthier fats including olive oil and rapeseed oil margarine. The diet did contain fish, but less red meat, and overall it was lower in animal fat.\nThe Mediterranean diet was significantly lower in cholesterol and higher in a number of beneficial substances such as ALA. Earlier work with this group revealed a 70 per cent increase in circulating levels of ALA and a 40 per cent rise in EPA (de Lorgeril et al., 1994). Although fish intake was encouraged, the experimental group ate only seven grams a day more fish than the control group, leading the researchers to conclude that the favourable EPA level seen in the test group was due to plant-ALA intake rather than the fish in the diet.\nResults showed a striking drop in death rates (due to a reduction in heart disease) of close to 70 per cent. Compared with the DART trial, the protective effect was associated with ALA instead of EPA. Another important difference was that the protection ALA offered extended to non-fatal heart attacks. The authors of this study suggested that moderate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (such as in the Mediterranean diet), may work in multiple ways to reduce the risk of heart attacks and sudden death.\nJust to be clear, the only fatty acid associated with the reduction in heart attacks was ALA. The authors did not find any correlation between the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) and a reduction in cardiac events. The Lyon Diet Heart Study demonstrated that plant-derived ALA is extremely effective in reducing the risks of secondary heart disease. It demonstrated that plant ALA was superior to fish-derived EPA and DHA in reducing the risk of a second heart attack. This study also confirmed that ALA can confer long-term protection to heart health.\nThree years later, in an article published in the journal Circulation, Dr J. David Spence of the Stroke Prevention and Atherosclerosis Research Centre at Robarts Research Institute in London, Canada, asked why the Lyon study was so neglected (Spence, 2002). Spence believes this study should have set the benchmark for dietary recommendations. He stressed how Mediterranean diets have been shown to improve endothelial function (how the internal lining of the blood vessels work). Spence also attributed the protective role of this type of diet to the higher levels of antioxidants they contain. A large body of evidence indicates that antioxidants may be able to reduce atherosclerosis (the progressive thickening and hardening of arterial walls that results from the build up of fatty deposits) (Azen et al., 1996).\nSpence also suggested that dietary cholesterol is more harmful to health than previously thought. Cholesterol is a fatty substance mainly produced by the liver (in response to saturated fat intake) but it is also supplied in diets containing animal-based foods (meat and dairy). Plant foods don't contain any cholesterol. It is carried in the bloodstream by molecules called lipoproteins (a mixture of fat and protein). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) takes cholesterol from the liver to the cells and is often referred to as 'bad' cholesterol because when levels are high, it can accumulate on the walls of the arteries. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries excess cholesterol back to the liver for excretion and is therefore called 'good' cholesterol.\nEvidence suggests that LDL can also harm the walls of the arteries when it is damaged or oxidised (Galassetti and Pontello, 2006). So what has this to with the diet and what can be done about it? Well, quite a lot. For example, one study showed how eating two eggs a day for three weeks not only raised LDL levels by about 10 per cent but increased oxidised LDL by 34 per cent (Levy et al., 1996). The authors concluded that egg consumption, in addition to raising cholesterol, increased how readily LDL could be oxidised. This, in turn, enhanced the progression of atherosclerosis (the build up of fatty deposits in the arteries). It was concluded that this may contribute to the high levels of heart disease seen in populations with high cholesterol intakes.\nThe precise mechanism underlying how eggs increase LDL oxidation is unclear, although their relatively high omega-6 intake has been blamed (Shapira and Pinchasov, 2008). Conversely, a healthier diet, such as the Mediterranean diet (rich in antioxidants and flavanoids), appears to reduce how readily LDL is oxidised (Lapointe et al., 2006). Interestingly though, antioxidant supplements and fish oil supplements have not been clearly demonstrated to prevent LDL oxidation.\nResearch shows that LDL in vegetarians is less susceptible to oxidative damage (Lu et al., 2000). This may be due to the low-fat, high-antioxidant (beta-carotene and vitamins C and E) and/or soya food content of a well-balanced plant-based diet. This could be one of the reasons why the Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower incidence of heart disease (Lapointe et al., 2006). These and other studies provide strong evidence that plant-based omega-3s can protect heart health and that contrary to popular belief, oily fish are not the only (nor indeed the best) source of these valuable nutrients.\nSpence states that it is no longer reasonable for patients with heart disease to be prescribed diets containing a daily intake of animal flesh (Spence, 2002). Dietary recommendations, he suggests, should be based on diets similar to that used in the Lyon study.\nPlant omega-3s and heart disease\nMany other studies indicate that plant omega-3s have a protective effect against heart disease. The Health Professionals' Study looked at 43,757 men over six years (Ascherio et al., 1996). During this time 229 men suffered a fatal heart attack and 505 a non-fatal heart attack. This study found that a one per cent increase in ALA intake lowered the risk of heart attack by 59 per cent. It was concluded that diets high in ALA from plants are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.\nSimilar findings were reported in the Nurses' Health Study which looked at over 76,000 women over 10 years (Hu et al., 1999). During this time 232 women suffered a fatal heart attack and 597 a non-fatal attack. Those who consumed the most ALA had a 45 per cent lower risk of fatal heart disease. The risk was further lowered among women who also took vitamin E supplements or who had a lower intake of trans fatty acids. The authors concluded that higher consumption of foods such as oil-based salad dressings that provide polyunsaturated fats, including ALA, may reduce the risk of fatal heart disease.\nIn the 2001 National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Family Heart Study, the diets of 4,584 participants were assessed (Djousse et al., 2001). Results showed that men who consumed the most ALA had a 40 per cent lower risk of heart disease and women who consumed the most had a whopping 50-70 per cent reduction.\nIn 2003, a joint report by WHO/FAO concurred that ALA has a protective effect against heart disease (WHO/FAO, 2003). The report states that several prospective studies have found an inverse association between the intake of ALA (from flaxseed, rapeseed and soya bean oils) and risk of fatal heart disease. In other words, ALA protects against death from heart disease.\nIt has been suggested that the protective effects of ALA are particularly evident among subjects with low intakes. This may be in parts of Europewhere sunflower oil is used almost exclusively, or in developing countries where palm oil is used (both oils lack ALA).\nIn 2008, a study published in Circulation, the Journal of the American Heart Association, investigated the role of ALA in heart disease in Costa Rica where ALA intake was low but is increasing due to the switch from palm oil to soya bean oil (Campos et al., 2008). This study found that a 1.79 gram per day intake of (supplying 0.65 per cent of total energy) decreased the risk of a second heart attack in heart disease patients by 57 per cent, compared to a 1.11 gram per day intake (supplying 0.42 per cent of total energy). The authors suggest that the amount of ALA needed to reduce the risk of a second heart attack can be obtained from just 2 teaspoons of soya bean or rapeseed oil, 1-2 millilitres of flaxseed oil or just 6-10 halves of walnuts per day.\nThe Cochrane Collaboration is an international not-for-profit, independent organisation, dedicated to making up-to-date, accurate information about the effects of healthcare readily available worldwide. The Collaboration's systematic reviews of healthcare studies are published quarterly as part of The Cochrane Library. Cochrane reviews have become known internationally as sources of high quality, reliable health information.\nIn 2004, the Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the current evidence to see whether dietary or supplemental omega-3 fatty acids alter total mortality (death rate) or cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke) (Hooper et al., 2004). They concluded that there was no overall benefit either on heart attacks, deaths from heart disease or overall mortality. The authors concluded that there was not enough evidence to say that people should stop taking rich sources of omega-3 fats, but said that further high quality trials are needed to confirm the previously suggested protective effect of omega-3 fats for those at increased cardiovascular risk.\nWith declining fish stocks, polluted seas and oceans, the role of plant-based omega-3s in heart disease must be further examined. The possibility of a simple and sustainable plant-based solution can no longer be ignored.\nVeggie diets and heart disease\nPlant-based diets have been shown to prevent and even reverse heart disease. Dr Dean Ornish, Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California in San Francisco, is well-known for his Lifestyle Heart Trial in which he treated severe heart disease patients with lifestyle changes alone (Ornish et al., 1990; Ornish et al., 1998). The experimental group ate a low-fat wholegrain plant-based diet containing lots of fruits, vegetables and pulses. They also followed an exercise programme, practised various forms of stress management but did not receive medication. They were monitored against a control group of similar patients who received conventional treatments.\nAfter just one year, 82 per cent of patients on this lifestyle change regime had regression of their heart disease with a 91 per cent reduction in chest pain and reduced cholesterol levels. Whereas the control group experienced a 165 per cent increase in the frequency of chest pain, cholesterol was worse and blockages of their arteries became worse. This trial has continued with similar results and continues to achieve better results than conventional surgical or medical intervention.\nMore recent work shows that vegetarians generally have a much lower risk of heart disease than meat-eaters. A major review of the scientific evidence shows that vegetarians have a massive 25 per cent lower risk of dying from heart disease! The authors of this study conclude that the widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet could prevent approximately 40,000 deaths from heart disease in Britain each year (Key et al., 1999).\nAs stated, meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products all contain cholesterol, while a plant-based diet contains little or no cholesterol. It should be no surprise then that a large-scale study investigating cholesterol levels among vegans, vegetarians, fish- and meat-eaters found that the vegans had the lowest levels, vegetarians and fish-eaters had similar values and the meat-eaters had the highest (Appleby et al., 1999).\nFor vegans it's a win-win situation. Not only do they avoid harmful substances (saturated animal fat, animal protein and cholesterol), they also benefit from a wide range of healthy nutrients including fibre, vitamins and minerals.\nInflammatory diseases\nIt is reported that omega-3 fats can help fight heart disease, asthma, type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The beneficial effects have also been seen in some cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, mental health, dry eye disease, age-related macular degeneration and psoriasis (Simopoulos, 2008). Many of theses conditions involve inflammation.\nOur bodies use inflammation to protect tissues from infection, injury or disease. The inflammatory process usually promotes healing but, when uncontrolled, it can also harm. We now know that the balance of omega-6s to omega-3s is important for regulating inflammation. As a general rule, omega-6 fats are thought to be pro-inflammatory, whereas omega-3 fats are considered anti-inflammatory (GLA is the exception as it is an omega-6 fat with anti-inflammatory properties). The dramatic increase in dietary saturated and omega-6 fats, coupled to the decrease in omega-3 fats is linked to the increasing incidence of numerous inflammatory diseases including asthma, allergy and atherosclerosis (Chilton et al., 2008).\nThere is evidence that changing the diet can help some people with inflammatory conditions; some of these are discussed below.\nArthritis\nArthritis is a painful condition of the joints and bones. There are many different forms of this condition. The two main types are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis include ankylosing spondylitis, cervical spondylitis, fibromyalgia, lupus, gout, psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's syndrome (NHS Direct, 2008).\nOsteoarthritis\nOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, with an estimated 8.5 million people affected by the condition (NHS Direct, 2008a). This degenerative disease is sometimes referred to as 'wear and tear' arthritis. Cartilage is the strong, smooth surface that lines the bones and allows joints to move against each other easily without friction. In osteoarthritis, cartilage gradually breaks down faster than it can be repaired. Eventually the surface of the bones begin to rub together causing them to degenerate.\nIn osteoarthritis, damage to cartilage can result in bony growths developing around the edge of the joints causing mild inflammation of the tissues (synovitis). Osteoarthritis mostly occurs in the knees, hips and small joints of the hands. However, almost any joint can be affected.\nOsteoarthritis generally occurs in the over 50s and is more common in women than men. However, it is not an inevitable part of getting older. It can develop after an injury to a joint; this can happen months or even years after the injury.\nStudies have been carried out to try to find whether omega-3 fats and/or fish oils can be helpful for osteoarthritis, but the results so far are inconclusive.\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid (inflammatory) arthritis is a more aggressive, but less common condition than osteoarthritis. It is thought to be an autoimmune disease whereby the body's own immune system attacks the joints, causing pain, swelling and the destruction of bone and cartilage.\nThis chronic condition is characterised by hot painful swelling in the joints. It usually starts in the wrists, hands and feet but can spread to other joints in the body. In some diseases inflammation can help towards healing, but in rheumatoid arthritis it tends to cause damage. For some people the discomfort, pain and loss of mobility caused by this condition can have a serious impact on their lives.\nRheumatoid arthritis affects approximately 350,000 people in the UK and like osteoarthritis, is also more common in women than men. It is most common after the age of 40, but can affect people of any age (NHS Direct, 2008b).\nDiet and arthritis\nIn the past, arthritis patients were told that dietary changes would not help them. Despite this many arthritis patients have found that certain foods can worsen their condition, or improve it.\nArthritis Care is the UK's largest voluntary organisation working with and for people with arthritis. It suggests that a diet high in fruit, vegetables, pasta, fish and white meat, and low in fatty foods such as red meat, cream and cheese can help (Arthritis Care, 2008). Most people would benefit from eating less saturated fat and sugar and eating more complex carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Evidence shows that at least for some people with arthritis, a healthier diet can help considerably.\nIn 2001, the first controlled study examining the long-term effect of a vegan, gluten-free diet on rheumatoid arthritis found that this diet could improve the signs and symptoms of this condition (Hafstr\u00f6m et al., 2001). The authors of this study suggested that a gluten-free vegan diet may, in some people, reduce the immune response that triggers rheumatoid arthritis. Another study tested a low-fat, vegan diet in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (McDougall et al., 2002). Results also showed those who switched to this type of diet experienced a significant reduction in symptoms.\nA further study showed that an uncooked vegan diet, rich in antioxidants and fibre, decreased joint stiffness and pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (H\u00e4nninen et al., 2000). Some studies have looked at fasting followed by a vegetarian or vegan diet. A review of these studies concluded that this dietary treatment might also be beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis (M\u00fcller et al., 2001). Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence that dietary modification can benefit arthritis patients.\nWeight control\nIt is widely accepted that it is important for people with arthritis to maintain a healthy weight. The extra burden on the joints, in overweight or obese arthritis patients, can make symptoms considerably worse and losing weight can have a dramatic beneficial effect.\nThe Arthritis Research Campaign (ARC) promotes medical research into the cause, treatment and cure of arthritic conditions. ARC's dietary guidelines for people with arthritis suggest that one of the most important links between diet and arthritis is being overweight (ARC, 2006).\nAdopting a plant-based based diet can help people lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight. Numerous studies show that vegetarians and vegans weigh less than meat-eaters. A study of over 55,000 Swedish women revealed that the vegetarian and vegan women were less likely to be overweight or obese than the meat-eaters (Newby et al., 2005). In another study, the effects of a low-fat, plant-based diet on 64 overweight postmenopausal women was compared to a diet based on National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (Barnard et al., 2005). Results showed that the low-fat, vegan diet was associated with significant weight loss. A subsequent review of 40 studies revealed that, on average, vegetarians and vegans weigh between six pounds and two stones less than meat-eaters (Berkow and Bernard, 2006).\nWhen trying to lose weight, it is important to maintain a good intake of nutrients. A healthy balanced diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables, pulses and wholegrain foods (wholemeal bread, brown rice and wholemeal pasta) provides a good supply of vitamins, minerals and fibre. A diet lacking in these foods and rich in meat, dairy and processed foods (such as white bread, white rice and white pasta) does not provide such a good source of nutrients. Find out how to achieve and maintain a healthy weight while protecting your health too in the VVF's V-Plan Diet guide.\nGetting the fats right\nARC states that vegetarian diets have been shown to be helpful in the long-term to some people with rheumatoid arthritis. It also says that a vegan diet (no meat, fish or other animal products such as eggs, milk, cheese or other dairy products) may also be helpful (ARC, 2006). Conversely, studies have shown that people who eat large amounts of red meat seem to have a higher risk of developing inflammatory arthritis.\nThe key point here is that not only is a plant-based diet helpful because it contains beneficial substances (antioxidants and omega-3 fats), but a typical Western diet, rich in meat, dairy and processed foods, is detrimental as it contains high levels of harmful substances such as saturated fat. This unhealthy type of fat tends to come from animal-based food (particularly meat, poultry and dairy products) and processed foods (cakes, pastry and biscuits). This unhealthy fat is the most important kind to avoid as it can increase pain and inflammation in arthritis (ARC, 2006).\nPlant-based diets tend to contain considerably less saturated fat and more healthy polyunsaturated fats. The research suggests that polyunsaturated omega-3 fats may help some people with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. The fact that people also tend to lose weight on a vegan diet contributes further to its beneficial effects.\nOmega-6 fats do not appear to benefit people with arthritis. In fact they may increase inflammation by competing with omega-3s (ARC, 2006). Most people have diets which already contain more omega-6 fats than they need. If you have inflammatory arthritis, it may be helpful to replace some of the omega-6 fats (found in sunflower oil, corn oil and products made from them such as sunflower margarines) with omega-3 fats from flaxseed, hempseed and rapeseed oils and walnuts. Obtaining plant-based omega-3s from these sources will ensure you get this healthy fat without exposing your body to the harmful toxins found in oily fish.\nGout\nARC warns that people with gout should not consume oily fish. Gout is a type of arthritis caused by a high level of urate in the body which can crystallise in the joints and cause severe pain and inflammation. Urate is produced from purines, which are chemicals that result from the natural death of cells. Cutting down on foods which are high in purines may be helpful if you have gout. This is best done by replacing animal-based foods (especially meat and fish) with other sources of protein, such as pulses (peas, beans, and lentils). Other dietary measures for gout include losing weight (if you are overweight) and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption, which has been associated with gout for centuries (ARC, 2006).\nCalcium\nA well-balanced healthy diet can help you if you are taking strong drugs for arthritis. In fact, ARC states that if you are taking strong drugs for arthritis there is even more reason to eat a good diet as it can help to protect the body against some of the side-effects of the drugs. For example steroids, such as prednisolone, can cause osteoporosis, particularly if you stay on them for a long time. Plenty of calcium in your diet will help to reduce the risk (ARC, 2006).\nArthritis Care points out that people with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis and agrees that ensuring an adequate calcium intake is very important (Arthritis Care, 2007). While cow's milk and dairy products are indeed a source of calcium, they are not the best source. This is because they contain animal protein. Excessive amounts of animal protein can upset the acid balance within the body, which then takes calcium from the bones to neutralise the acid. Even the usually pro-dairy National Osteoporosis Society says: \"It is a good idea to avoid too much protein, particularly animal protein such as meat and cheese,\" (NOS, 2008). It is also a good idea to avoid too much salt, fizzy drinks and caffeine for the same reason.\nHealthier sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables (broccoli, kale, spring greens, cabbage, parsley and watercress - but not spinach), dried fruits (figs and dates) nuts (almonds and Brazil nuts), seeds (sesame seeds and tahini - sesame seed paste), pulses (peas, beans, lentils and soya products such as calcium-set tofu and calcium-enriched soya milk). For more information on calcium see the VVF's fact sheet Boning up on Calcium .\nIron\nSome arthritis sufferers may be concerned about their iron intake, particularly - they may be told - if they avoid eating red meat. This should not be a concern as the British Medical Association and the American Dietetic Association agree that vegetarians are no more likely to suffer from iron deficiency than meat-eaters (BMA, 1996; American Dietetic Association, 2003). Indeed one of the largest studies of vegetarians and vegans in the world (the EPIC Oxford cohort study) looked at over 33,883 meat-eaters, 18,840 vegetarians and 2,596 vegans and found that the vegans had the highest intake of iron, followed by the fish-eaters, vegetarians then the meat-eaters (Davey et al., 2003). Cow's milk and dairy products are an extremely poor source of iron, containing hardly any, whereas pulses, dried fruits and dark leafy vegetables are all excellent sources. For more information on iron see the VVF's fact sheet Ironing out the Facts .\nAntioxidant action\nThe antioxidant vitamins A, C and E are thought to protect against disease (and aging) by defending the body against attack from harmful molecules called free radicals. These damaging molecules are produced naturally as your body breaks down food, or as a result of exposure to harmful chemicals (including cigarette smoke) or radiation.\nThe damage caused by free radicals plays a role in many diseases including cancer and arthritis. A particular class of free radicals (called reactive oxygen species) can promote the inflammatory response that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (Filippin, 2008). A molecular mechanism linking free radicals to inflammation has been proposed. It suggests that free radicals activate molecules called transcription factors (nuclear factor-kappa B or NF-?B). These then activate genes involved in inflammatory and/or autoimmune responses. In other words, free radicals can cause a sequence of events rather like a line of dominos falling down, which may lead to inflammatory arthritis.\nThere is some evidence that anti-rheumatic drugs may exert their therapeutic effects by acting as antioxidants. For example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to act as free radical scavengers (Merry et al., 1991). This means they may protect against the harmful effects of free radicals by 'mopping them up'. However, antioxidants may be more useful in preventing damage before it occurs, rather than treating an already inflamed joint.\nToo much iron in the blood can encourage the production of free radicals (McCord, 2004). Unlike the non-haem iron we find in plant foods, haem iron in meat is absorbed into the body whether it is needed or not. Thus meat can supply an overload of iron (but no vitamin C and very little vitamin E). Conversely, vegetables and wholegrains foods can supply as much or as little iron as is required, as well as an abundance of protective antioxidant vitamins, fibre and other nutrients.\nOmega-3s and arthritis\nFor some arthritis patients, omega-3 supplements may be helpful, for example a tablespoon of flaxseed oil twice a day (this exceeds the 1 teaspoon-a-day recommendation for normal consumption). If this is helpful, it may be a good idea to try to reduce your intake to the lowest effective dose.\nAdditional treatments\nSome arthritis patients have benefited from taking a herbal remedy isolated from Rosa canina, a type of rose hip (Winther et al., 2005). In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, published in the Journal of Rheumatology, 82 per cent of patients reported a reduction in pain after just three weeks of active treatment with this herbal remedy. The authors of the study concluded that it could alleviate symptoms of osteoarthritis. In fact pain was reduced to such an extent that there was a significant decrease in the consumption of painkillers such as paracetemol, ibuprofen and NSAIDs. This compares favourably to glucosamine, currently the most popular supplement for joint health (Reginster et al., 2001; Matheson and Perry 2003).\nSummary\nLosing weight, eating a healthy plant-based diet that includes a good supply of omega-3 fatty acids (either though foods or supplements) can help reduce the symptoms of arthritis and may help some people reduce their medication (ARC, 2006).\nMultiple sclerosis\nIn multiple sclerosis (MS), the protective sheath (called myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibres of the central nervous system becomes damaged. This process is called demyelination. Sclerosis means scarring and multiple refers to the many different sites at which the scarring may occur in the brain and spinal cord. Demyelination interferes with the messages that are sent between the brain and other parts of the body. Symptoms can include blurred vision, paralysis, slurred speech, lack of coordination and incontinence. The severity of symptoms depends on how much damage has occurred.\nMS is the most common disease of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) affecting young adults in the UK. It currently affects around 85,000 people in the UK and can occur at any age, but in most cases symptoms first appear between the ages of 20 and 40. Women are almost twice as likely to develop MS as men. The majority of patients with MS have the relapsing-remitting form of the disease, characterised by attacks or relapses interspersed with periods of recovery or remission (Harbige and Sharief, 2007). It is a life-long condition, but it is not terminal and people with MS can expect to live as long as anyone else (NHS Direct, 2008c).\nThe cause of MS is not yet fully understood but is thought to be an autoimmune disease (like rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes) whereby the body's immune system attacks its own tissues having 'mistaken' them for an invading (foreign) protein. This process is referred to as 'molecular mimicry' as part of the foreign protein closely resembles part of certain cells in our own body. If this all sounds a bit complicated, just think of it as 'friendly fire' - when a soldier mistakenly attacks one of his own. In autoimmune diseases, the body attacks itself.\nAs with other autoimmune diseases, it is thought that a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors causes the disease. There is undoubtedly an element of genetic predisposition in MS but the evidence suggests that this disease is more strongly related to environmental factors than genes. In other words, a person may have a genetic predisposition to the disease but not develop it unless exposed to a specific environmental 'trigger'. Such triggers may include bacteria, viruses or components of the diet.\nGeographical pattern\nOne of the most intriguing features of MS is that it occurs more in countries that are far from the equator. For example, MS is relatively common in the UK, North America and Scandinavia, but hardly ever occurs in countries such as Malaysia and Ecuador (NHS Direct, 2008c). The reason for this is not fully understood, but it could be that MS is triggered by a particular bacteria or virus which thrives in cooler climates. Alternative theories suggest that components of particular foods consumed in these countries may be responsible.\nDiet and MS\nResearch suggests that some components in food can act as causative agents of autoimmune disease. For example, there is strong evidence that proteins found in cow's milk can trigger an autoimmune response leading to type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible children. The theory with MS is that proteins from certain foods (such as cow's milk) may also prompt the immune system to respond inappropriately and attack the myelin sheath in the brain and central nervous system. A large body of evidence shows that populations that consume high quantities of animal-based foods seem to be most affected by MS (Agnello et al., 2004). This inevitably has drawn attention to the role of meat and dairy foods in the development of MS.\nNumerous studies have revealed a striking association between the geographical pattern of MS and that of meat and dairy consumption (Arganoff and Goldberg, 1974; Butcher, 1976; Lauer, 1994). There is also strong evidence linking a high intake of saturated fat to the incidence of MS. Taken together, the evidence shows that foods rich in saturated fats are associated with higher levels of MS while foods rich in polyunsaturated fats are linked to lower levels (Harbige and Sharief, 2007).\nThe research investigating the links between diet and MS dates back 60 years to Dr Roy Swank's work first at the Montreal Neurological Institute in Norway, then at the Division of Neurology at the University of Oregon Medical School in the US. Swank was intrigued by the geographical distribution of MS and hypothesised that dietary fat intake may contribute to progression of MS.\nSwank suspected animal foods high in saturated fats may be responsible as MS seemed to occur most among inland dairy-consuming populations and less among coastal fish-eating populations. His best known trial, published in the Lancet in 1990, followed 144 MS patients for a total of 34 years (Swank and Dugan, 1990). Swank prescribed a low-saturated fat diet to patients with relapsing-remitting MS and observed how their conditions progressed. Results showed that those who adhered most closely to the diet derived the greatest benefits from the intervention. The beneficial effects were strongest in those who began to follow the diet early in their disease.\nIn 2000, 15 patients who had been on the diet for 50 years were re-assessed. Of these, 13 were able to walk without difficulty, the other two required assistance with walking (Swank and Goodwin, 2003). Swank concluded that if people with MS adhere to the diet, with no more than 10-15 grams of saturated fat per day, they can expect to survive and be ambulant and otherwise normal to an advanced age.\nAlthough Swank's diet restricted meat and dairy foods, it did include fish and fish oils. More recently, another study recommended a co-called 'quasi' vegan diet with fish oil (McCarty, 2001). This study concluded that a whole-food vegan diet, coupled with fish oil and vitamin D supplementation, may represent a practical strategy for the prevention of autoimmune diseases, while concurrently lowering the risk of many other life-threatening Western diseases. Both regimes overlook the fact that you can have an omega-3 rich vegan diet (containing ALA and an algal supplement containing DHA and EPA if desired) without exposing yourself to the toxins found in oily fish and fish oils.\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids and MS\nSome research indicates that polyunsaturated fatty acids (particularly omega-6 fats) have a role in the chain of events leading to, and the treatment of, MS. Studies show that omega-6 levels are lower in MS patients. It has been suggested that the way omega-6 fatty acids are normally processed in the body is disrupted in people with MS.\nIn a randomised, double-blind trial of a high dose and low dose omega-6 GLA-rich (borage) oil and a placebo control, the high dose had a marked clinical effect in relapsing-remitting MS. Results showed that the GLA-rich oil significantly decreased the relapse rate and the progression of disease (Harbige and Sharief, 2007). The authors of this study suggested that disturbed omega-6 fatty acid metabolism in MS gives rise to a loss of both long chain omega-6 fatty acids in the membranes and anti-inflammatory cytokines, particularly during the relapse phase.\nThe loss of these important neural fatty acids in central nervous system structure and function may have long-term consequences in MS. However, this feature of MS can be treated by supplementation (Harbige and Sharief, 2007). In general, it appears that over time, diets low in saturated fat, but containing both some omega-6 and omega-3 fats, can improve the course of MS (Harbige and Sharief, 2007).\nIn 2007, a Cochrane review concluded that polyunsaturated fatty acids seemed to have no major effect on the main clinical outcome in MS (disease progression) (Farinotti et al., 2007). However, only a limited number of studies was reviewed and they did state that the data available were insufficient to assess any potential benefit or harm from supplementation. Clearly more research is required to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions in MS. In the meantime, over 50 per cent of people with MS make dietary changes and take supplements (Farinotti et al., 2007).\nPolyunsaturated fats and autoimmunity\nIt is generally accepted that omega-6 fatty acids are pro-inflammatory (Harbige, 2003). However, while they have been shown to increase the severity of some autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, omega-6 fats may actually protect against other (immune-mediated and non-immune-mediated) inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the view that all omega-6 fats are pro-inflammatory is incorrect (Harbige, 2003).\nThere is some evidence that omega-3 fats can 'dampen down' inflammatory responses. This anti-inflammatory role may offer short-term benefits in some autoimmune diseases. However, this could be an undesirable long-term effect of high-dose fish oils, as it could compromise immunity (Harbige, 2003). As stated earlier, the inflammatory response is a natural part of our immune system and can help fight infection. In other words, a high intake of fish oils may not be beneficial in the long term; it may weaken the immune system while only addressing the secondary consequences of an autoimmune response.\nDiets low in saturated fat and relatively high in omega-3 fats (higher than the low amount present in most UK diets) can reduce the severity of some autoimmune diseases. Conversely, diets high in the omega-6 fat LA may increase the severity of these conditions (Harbige, 2003). However, as stated previously, there is convincing evidence for a protective role of both omega-6 and omega-3 fats in MS (Harbige, 2003).\nIn conclusion, moderate intakes of omega-6 fats and the appropriate ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fats are important for the correct functioning of the immune system (Harbige, 2003). Adjusting the ratio could be helpful in autoimmune or inflammatory disease. The optimum ratio varies depending on age and the basis of the autoimmune disease.\nThis all sounds rather complicated but the overall message is that a plant-based diet, low in fat, salt, sugar and processed foods and high in fresh fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, pulses, nuts and seeds can provide all the nutrients required for good health and reduce some of the risk factors for autoimmune diseases or prevent making an already existing condition worse.\nAs the incidence of most autoimmune diseases correlates directly to the consumption of animal foods, a move towards a more a plant-based diet could help combat the rise in these conditions among populations that currently consume high levels of dairy and meat products.\nAllergies\nSome research suggests that the dramatic increase in the consumption of omega-6 fats, coupled to the decrease in omega-3 fats consumed, is a major driver of the increase of a range of inflammatory allergic reactions (Chilton et al., 2008).\nAsthma\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterised by recurrent breathing problems. The UK has one of the highest prevalence rates for asthma in the world, along with New Zealand, Australia and Ireland. Around one in eight children and one in 20 adults are currently being treated for asthma in the UK.\nDuring an asthma attack, the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and the airways constrict. This can lead to the characteristic symptoms of asthma such as coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and tightness across the chest.\nThe causes of asthma are thought to include a genetic predisposition (asthma in the family) and environmental triggers such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, dust mites and diet.\u00a0As food allergies are responsible for approximately five per cent of all asthma cases (James et al., 1994) and as cow's milk is a primary cause of food allergies, it seems reasonable to consider avoiding all cow's milk and dairy products in the treatment of asthma.\nAsthma may also respond to other dietary modifications, thereby reducing the need for medication. Studies show that supplementing the diet with plant-based fatty acids can inhibit inflammatory responses leading to asthma. One study found that supplementing the diet with omega-6 and omega-3 fats in a ratio of 2:1 helped alleviate symptoms, whereas a ratio of 10:1 made symptoms worse (Broughton et al., 1997).\nAnother study found that supplementing the diet with borage oil (containing GLA) led to the accumulation of natural inhibitors of leukotrines (hormones that cause the symptoms of asthma) within inflammatory cells (Chilton et al., 2008). This concurs with the research described above that shows that GLA provides an exception to the usual pro-inflammatory role attributed to omega-6 fats.\nThe overall optimum ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats may vary according the disease and the patient (age, sex and physical condition) but the message that we all need to increase our intake of omega-3 fats while not increasing that of omega-6 fats is consistent throughout the research.\nEczema\nThe increasing rate of eczema in the West has been linked to a steep rise in the consumption of omega-6 fats and the reduced intake of omega-3s (Koch et al., 2008). Omega-6 fats favour the formation of specific eicosanoids (hormone-like molecules) that are involved in allergic inflammation. The parent omega-6 fatty acid LA is converted into arachidonic acid, a precursor in the production of eicosanoids (Koch at al., 2008). Consequently an increased intake of omega-6 fats can promote allergic reactions, while increasing omega-3 intake competes with omega-6 metabolism and protects against inflammatory conditions.\nThe results of a recent exploratory trial were published in the British Journal of Dermatology (Koch at al., 2008). This study reported how 53 patients suffering from eczema were randomly allocated supplements of both DHA and EPA, or a control (caprylic acid, otherwise known as octanoic acid, an eight-carbon saturated fatty acid) daily for eight weeks. Results showed a considerable improvement in the group taking DHA/EPA supplements. The authors suggested that these fatty acids may have an anti-inflammatory role as they inhibit arachidonic acid production. While some arachidonic acid is essential for your health, too much may make inflammation worse.\nIt was noted that plasma DHA and EPA levels rose two- to threefold following supplementation. The authors suggested that the higher level of EPA might have resulted from the small but significant amount of EPA in the supplement or from the retroconversion of DHA to EPA. This is important as it indicates that an algal supplement supplying DHA could be used to increase both DHA and EPA levels. Again this means you could take an algal supplement and avoid the risk of exposing yourself to toxins that may be found in fish oil supplements.\nSummary\nOur genes take a very long time to change and are still very similar to the genes of our ancestors during the Palaeolithic era 40,000 years ago, when the human genetic profile was established (Simopoulos, 2008). The same cannot be said for our diet. Anyone can see our diets have changes hugely - our ancestors would have been hard pushed to find burger, chips and a milkshake! But does this matter? Well, studies on the evolutionary aspects of diet indicate that the major changes that have occurred have altered the type and amount of essential fatty acids in our diets (Simopoulos, 2008). So while in many ways our bodies are potentially the same as those of our ancestors, the way we fuel it has changed drastically. This is like expecting a car to run on a lower grade fuel than it was designed for. There will inevitably be problems with the engine.\nThe increase in heart disease, arthritis, allergies and other health problems has encouraged some scientists to investigate the role of diet in these and other diseases. Omega-3 fats have been identified as potentially helpful. Many people cannot tolerate the taste or smell of fish oils, even when provided in capsules. Because of this, and dwindling fish stocks, interest in plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids has increased tremendously (Chilton et al., 2008).\nMost fat eaten in excess of requirements is stored in adipose tissue in the form of triglycerides (three fatty acids combined with glycerol). Many diseases feature elevated levels of triglycerides: cardiovascular diseases, asthma, diabetes, obesity and arthritis. There is tremendous interest in plant-based oils and supplements (as an alternative to fish oil) as a source of omega-3 fatty acids for protection against these chronic diseases. Researchers from the Center for Botanical Lipids at Wake Forest University in North Carolina state that botanical (plant-based) oils hold particular promise for modulating inflammatory responses (Chilton et al., 2008).\nA large number of vegetarian and vegan studies show that plant-based diets offer numerous health benefits, including the prevention and therapy of many chronic diseases including arthritis (Leitzmann, 2005). Since vegetarian and vegan diets are more sustainable, environmentally and economically, they certainly deserve more consideration in both the prevention and treatment of disease. This message needs to filter down from the peer-reviewed studies into our hospitals, schools, workplaces and homes.\nBrain food\nThe human brain grows and develops very rapidly during the first year of life, tripling in size by the age of one. The brain is largely made up of fat (over 60 per cent) and early brain development and function in humans requires a sufficient supply of polyunsaturated EFAs. For humans, the omega-6 fat arachidonic acid and the omega-3 fat DHA are essential for brain development and functioning.\nAlthough human breast milk and cow's milk contain a similar amount of total fat, the proportion of saturated and unsaturated fats in each is very different. This difference contributes to the unsuitability of cow's milk for human infants. The high level of unsaturated fats in human breast milk reflects the crucial role these fats play in human brain development. A rapid increase in body size is more important for cows, so they produce milk high in body-building saturated fats to help their calves grow quickly.\nA review of 20 studies of cognitive (brain) function of breast-fed infants compared to that of formula-fed infants concluded that the nutrients in breast milk may have a significant effect on neurological development in infants (Anderson et al., 1999). Indeed, a longer duration of breastfeeding is associated with significantly higher scores in verbal, performance and IQ tests (Mortensen et al., 2002). So breast really is best!\nAttempts to alter the fatty acid composition of cow's milk, in order to meet human requirements, have involved experiments feeding cows fish meal and soya beans (Abu-Ghazaleh et al., 2004) and flaxseed (Petit, 2002). Feeding flaxseed resulted in a lower omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio, which might improve the nutritional value of milk for humans. Of course you could just eat flaxseed oil yourself to improve the balance of omega-3 and omega-6 oils in your diet while avoiding the many undesirable components of cow's milk and oily fish.\nSmart enough to be veggie?\nFish oils have been sold as a magic bullet for boosting brain power. As the term 'essential' implies, we certainly do need some EFAs in the diet. However, contrary to the intensive and misleading marketing, fish and fish oils are not essential for good health. In fact, the fatty acids found in fish oil (EPA and DHA) are not defined as 'essential'; only the plant-based fats ALA and LA are. These plant-derived EFAs provide a healthier and safer source. Consider this: if fish oils were a superior source of fatty acids for brain health then vegetarians would come bottom of the intelligence stakes. The reverse appears to be the case.\nLinks between intelligence and the vegetarian diet were demonstrated in 2006 when a team of vegetarians won the BBC's Test the Nation IQ battle (the butchers came joint fourth; sadly there was not a team of fish-mongers!)\nMore weighty evidence was provided in a study published in the British Medical Journal which showed that intelligent children are more likely to become vegetarians later in life (Gale et al., 2007). Researchers from Southampton University found that people who are vegetarians by the age of 30 had an IQ five points higher than the average IQ when they were 10. This might explain why people with a higher IQ are healthier: vegetarians generally suffer less heart disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, various cancers, diverticular disease, bowel disorders, gallstones, kidney stones, and osteoporosis.\nThe obvious point here is that if omitting fish and fish oils from the diet led to a lower cognitive ability, non-fish eating children and adults would come bottom in the intelligence stakes. There has never been any study to suggest this is the case and thousands of healthy intelligent vegetarian and non-fish eating families provide proof that brains function perfectly well without fish oils!\nFish oils for brainy kids?\nSo what is the scientific evidence that fish oils can improve cognitive ability and where does the Government stand on this issue? The evidence comes mainly from trials done using children with behavioural problems and is largely anecdotal.\nThe Durham-Oxford Study is the most cited work (Richardson and Montgomery, 2005). In this study, 117 children with developmental coordination disorders (DCD) such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia and dyspraxia were given a daily supplement of fatty acids. The treatment was a supplement containing 80 per cent fish oil and 20 per cent evening primrose oil in gelatine capsules. The daily dose of six capsules provided omega-3 fatty acids (558 mg of EPA and 174 mg of DHA) and the omega-6 fatty acid LA (60 mg), or olive oil (omega-9) as a placebo.\nAfter three months of treatment, results showed significant improvements in reading, spelling and behaviour among those receiving the fish oil supplements. The researchers concluded that fatty acid supplements may be a safe, tolerable, effective treatment for improving academic progress and behaviour among children with DCD. In other words, children who are not fulfilling their potential may benefit from increasing their intake of essential fatty acids. The VVF asked the researchers in Durham if they would consider using flaxseed oil in future trials to see if similar results could be achieved without exposing children to potential toxins but our requests were ignored.\nA follow-up trial was conducted in Durham more recently whereby three million fish oil capsules were given to 2,000 children over eight months to see if their GCSE results improved. Unfortunately the GCSE results were rather disappointing, which was not press-released by the County Council. In some very fast back-pedalling they said \"...it was never intended, and the County Council never suggested, that it would use this initiative to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of using fish oil to boost exam results.\" So it seems fish oil was not the magic bullet Durham Council was looking for.\nIt is interesting to note that the fish oil capsules used in the Durham trial cost 80p per child, per day, rather more than the 65p Durham Council was spending per child per day on school meals at the time. In 2008 the cost of ingredients had risen, but to just 80p for a secondary school child per day (Durham Council, 2008). Rather than looking for a magic bullet, improving the quality of school meals and education about diet and health would perhaps have been a better approach.\nMost children in the UK eat such appalling diets that nutritional deficiencies are inevitable. Correcting such deficiencies will in many cases improve the symptoms associated with that particular deficiency. This is not the same as saying fish oil will turn all kids into geniuses, which is exactly how the media interpreted the findings. 'Council to include more fruit, vegetable and wholefoods in school meals' just doesn't make such an impressive headline as 'magic pill makes kids clever'.\nThe Joint Health Claims Initiative (JHCI) operated between 2000 and 2007 to ensure a level playing field for the food industry and to increase consumer protection by investigating the science behind health claims (JHCI, 2007). It is no longer in operation as the new EU 'claims' regulation for foods now verifies health claims. However, during the seven years of investigating health claims, the JHCI approved claims for soya protein, oats and reduced saturated fat all for their cholesterol-lowering effects and for wholegrain foods' benefits to heart health. They also approved health claims for long chain omega-3 fats for maintaining a healthy heart. They did not approve any claims linking omega-3 fats (or fish oils) to cognitive ability.\nUnfortunately misleading publicity from this and other research has encouraged companies to produce so-called functional foods such as St Ivel Advance Omega-3 milk. The advertisements implied that this milk may make children more intelligent because it contained omega-3 fatty acids (from fish). The advertisements for this so-called 'clever milk' featured the scientist Professor Robert Winston, lending kudos to the outlandish claims. But following complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the advertisements were misleading and the claims used for the benefits of the milk unproven. The ASA ruled that as the children in the trial had learning difficulties, there was no basis to claim there would be an improvement in the concentration of all children. Dairy Crest, the firm behind the product, withdrew the adverts following the ruling.\nAlthough the Government has refused to shift its position on recommending fish oils for heart health, it is clearly not convinced about cognitive benefits. The FSA states that: \"Evidence on the cognitive benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, which are found in fish oils, is currently uncertain,\" (FSA, 2008).\nCommon sense suggests that if the diet provides enough EFAs, fish oils may have no additional effect on cognitive ability at all. Encouraging children to eat oily fish in the pursuit of cleverness may lead to serious health problems due to their exposure to pollutants.\nContaminated fish are a danger to health\nAll of the world's oceans and rivers are polluted with toxic chemicals; mainly pollutants resulting from decades of increasing industrial activity. The health risks associated with the consumption of fish and fish oil supplements are due to the presence of these toxic pollutants, not to mention the saturated fat, animal protein and cholesterol they contain. Oily fish such as salmon, trout and mackerel may be contaminated with chemicals, while shark, marlin and swordfish contain high levels of mercury (Consumers' Association, 2002). Long-term exposure to these harmful substances poses a significant threat to health.\nPOP goes the seawall\nA particularly nasty class of contaminants found in oily fish is known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These organic pollutants are made up of complex molecules which do not break down easily in the environment; hence the name 'persistent'. They build up in the food chain through bioaccumulation. This means that the level of chemicals found in an animal tissue rises the higher up the food chain the animal is. For example, larvae might eat some contaminated algae, a fish then eats the larvae, and a bigger fish eats smaller fish and so on. Fish at the top of the food chain such as tuna, shark, swordfish, tilefish and king mackerel, have the highest concentrations of POPs. Algae (which are right at the bottom of the food chain) are likely to contain much lower levels.\nFarmed salmon are even more of a concern than wild salmon due to the concentration of POPs in the feed they eat and their fatty nature as POPs can accumulate in fatty tissue.\nIn 2001, officials from 90 countries signed a landmark UN treaty in Stockholm, designed to curb the use of some of the world's most dangerous and toxic chemicals (Stockholm Convention, 2008). They identified twelve particular substances for banning which later became known as the 'dirty dozen'. The list included eight organo-chlorine pesticides: aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex and toxaphene; two industrial chemicals: hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and two groups of industrial by-products: dioxins and furans.\nThe Stockholm Convention on POPs came into force on May 17, 2004, with agreement from an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agreed to ban nine of the 'dirty dozen,' limit the use of DDT to malaria control and curtail production of dioxins and furans. Several other substances are now being considered for inclusion in the Convention. These are: hexabromobiphenyl, octaBDE, pentaBDE, pentachlorobenzene, short-chained chlorinated paraffins, lindane, a- and \u00df-hexachlorocyclohexane, dicofol, endosulfan, chlordecone and PFOS. Not what you'd expect to see in a list of ingredients!\nHowever, even though this is a step in the right direction, it will take many years for POPs (used in everyday items such as plastics, paints and pesticides) to break down. Furthermore, the environmental group, the World Wildlife Fund has expressed concerns that global warming could increase levels of POPs as higher temperatures may release chemicals which have been frozen in glaciers.\nPCBs\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins are the main contaminants in oily fish (Consumers' Association, 2002). Although they are now banned, PCBs have not disappeared from the environment and won't for a very long time.\nThe Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) is an advisory committee of independent experts that provides advice to the FSA, Department of Health and other government agencies and departments. SACN states that: \"PCBs are very persistent chemicals which are ubiquitous in the environment and are generally present in low concentrations in foods, especially fat-containing foods including milk, meat and fish,\" (SACN, 2004).\nAs persistent lipophilic (fat-loving) compounds that accumulate in lipids, PCBs are particularly likely to be present in oily fish. They are implicated in heart disease, cancer, infertility and can harm developing foetuses by disrupting the development of male babies' reproductive organs.\nDioxins\nDioxins were the primary ingredient in Agent Orange, the defoliant sprayed over Vietnam which has produced an appalling legacy of cancers and other diseases, miscarriages and birth defects. As stated, these insidious toxins build up in the body over time. The FSA points out that: \"If a woman changes her diet when she becomes pregnant, or when she starts trying for a baby, this won't change the levels of dioxins and PCBs that are already in her body. So it's a good idea to limit the amount of oily fish eaten from a young age.\"\nFurthermore, contrary to previous advice that these toxic pollutants are only found in oily fish, the FSA states that: \"Recent surveys have shown that some other fish and crab may also have similar levels of dioxins and PCBs as oily fish. These fish are: sea bream, turbot, halibut, dog fish or huss, and sea bass.\" Now they tell us!\nMercury rising\nMethylmercury is the organic form of mercury found in the environment, usually as the result of industrial pollution. This toxin is commonly found in the marine environment and accumulates up the food chain particularly in older, larger fish. Mercury affects the kidneys, heart and central nervous system (CNS). Exposure is particularly hazardous for unborn children where the main organs and the CNS are still developing. Women and girls who may have children one day are advised to eat less oily fish than men and older women because mercury can harm the development of unborn children. The FSA states that adults should have no more than one portion of swordfish, shark or marlin a week because these fish contain high levels of mercury (FSA, 2009).\nWhile some studies indicate that high intakes of oily fish, or fish oil supplements, are associated with a reduced risk of CVD, others have suggested that fish oils can increase the risk. In these studies, mercury is suspected as being responsible for the harmful effects seen as it can accelerate atherosclerosis and increase the risk of heart attack. Possible mechanisms by which mercury exerts these damaging effects include promoting the peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (Salonen et al., 1995). This is the process whereby damaging molecules called free radicals 'steal' electrons from the fats in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage.\nMercury also forms an insoluble complex with the antioxidant mineral selenium. It binds it in an inactive form preventing selenium from acting as a cofactor for the protective enzyme glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme's main biological role is to protect the body from oxidative damage. Binding selenium in this way can lead to an increase in free radical activity. Mercury also has a very high affinity to sulfhydryl groups which play an important role in antioxidant reactions. Sulfhydryl groups are compounds that contain a functional group composed of a sulphur atom and a hydrogen atom (-SH). They feature as a functional group of the amino acid cysteine and so play an important role in many biological systems. By binding to sulfhydryl groups, mercury inactivates antioxidative compounds, again, increasing free radical activity. Taken together, these reactions indicate how mercury could inhibit important antioxidative mechanisms in humans. In other words, the high mercury content in fish can not only counteract the protective effects of the fatty acids found in oily fish, but may go on and do serious harm to health.\nFor non-oily fish, there seems even less reason to take the risk of exposing yourself to mercury. Numerous studies have reported an association between fish intake and coronary mortality. In 1995, one study investigated why men in Eastern Finland have an exceptionally high level of mortality from CVD (Salonen et al., 1995). This study measured hair mercury content in healthy individuals and then recorded CVD events (such as heart attacks) over the following years.\nThe mercury content in Finnish lakes is known to be relatively high; especially so in ground waters (water that supplies wells and springs) in Eastern Finland. This study found that an average daily fish intake of just 30 grams or more was associated with a two-fold increase in heart attack risk. For each additional 10 grams of fish per day there was an increment of five per cent in the five-year risk of heart attack. This indicates that mercury, even in subtoxic amounts, is a risk factor for coronary and fatal CVD. The authors concluded that because in many countries fish and seafood are contaminated with mercury and because fish is eaten all over the world, their findings could be of enormous public health importance.\nA later study (from the same group) investigating the association between blood levels of the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, and the risk of acute coronary events in middle-aged men from Eastern Finland, again looked at mercury levels in hair (Rissanen et al., 2000). This prospective population-based study of 1,871 men confirmed that high levels of DHA in the blood were associated with a decreased risk of acute coronary events. However, the men who fared best in this comparison were those with high DHA levels and low mercury content in the hair. It was concluded again that mercury could cancel out any protective effect offered by the fats in oily fish.\nA case-controlled study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002 conducted in eight European countries and Israel provided further evidence linking mercury in fish to CVD. This study investigated the relationship between mercury levels in toenail clippings and DHA levels in adipose tissue with the risk of a first heart attack among men (Guallar et al., 2002). This study included 684 men in the coronary care units of participating hospitals who had experienced their first heart attack. Also, 724 men representative of the same population (but who had not had a heart attack) were selected to act as controls. Results showed that while higher DHA levels were associated with a lower heart attack risk, the toenail mercury level was directly associated with an increased risk of heart attack. The authors concluded that mercury may diminish the cardioprotective effect of fish intake.\nThey also warned that exposure to mercury is already a concern in specific high risk groups and suggested extending the US Food and Drug Administration's recommendation that pregnant women and women who may become pregnant do not eat swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish or tuna to include the entire population.\nA statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) acknowledges the discrepancy in the findings of research on fish oils and CVD (Kris-Etherton et al., 2002). They acknowledge that the contradictory findings of these studies could be explained by the adverse effects of mercury, which they say may diminish the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids from fish. They conclude that while collectively, the research is supportive of the recommendation to include at least two weekly servings of fish (particularly fatty fish), this recommendation must be balanced with concerns about environmental pollutants, in particular PCB and methylmercury. This ambiguity can only add to the confusion!\nThey do however point out that the research supports the inclusion of vegetable oils (soya bean, rapeseed, walnut and flaxseed oils) and food sources (walnuts and flaxseeds) high in ALA in a healthy diet for the general population. This, at least, is a move in the right direction.\nFood Poisoning\nFood poisoning generally happens when someone eats food that is contaminated with bacteria or its toxins. According to the FSA, it is estimated that up to 5.5 million people in the UK are affected by food poisoning each year (NHS Direct, 2008d). However, it is difficult to know exactly how many people are affected as not all of those affected seek medical advice.\nMost cases of food poisoning result from eating contaminated animal products (meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, fish and shellfish) as plants tend not to harbour the types of bacteria capable of causing food poisoning in humans. If plant foods do cause food poisoning it is generally because they have been contaminated with animal excreta, human sewerage or prepared with dirty hands.\nWhile most food poisoning incidents are associated with meat and poultry, the links between fish, shellfish and food poisoning should not be discounted. Researchers from the Health Protection Agency Centre for infections in London looked at a number of cases of food poisoning in the UK between 1992 and 2003 (O'Brien et al., 2006). Of the 1,763 cases reported to national surveillance, only 55 were published in the peer-reviewed literature. As this type of publication tends to favour the unusual or novel event, coverage can lead to an over-emphasis of one food group over another. This has lead to a failure to pay enough attention to the role of contaminated fish and shellfish in food poisoning. The authors of this study suggest that relying solely on the literature has lead to an over-emphasis on controlling the milk supply and a failure to pay enough attention to the role of contaminated fish and shellfish in food poisoning.\nWhen they are raw or haven't been cooked properly, fish and shellfish can contain a range of harmful viruses and bacteria. Shellfish (such as clams, mussels and oysters) are also filter feeders, constantly filtering water, which can lead to the accumulation of pollutants. The FSA recommends that elderly people and people who are unwell might want to avoid eating raw shellfish to reduce their risk of food poisoning (FSA, 2008d). Most shellfish is eaten cooked, but oysters are often served raw and can contain a virus called the Norovirus. Raw or partially cooked shellfish can also contain hepatitis A, which is a highly contagious virus of the liver.\nFor these reasons, the VVF argues that sea vegetables (seaweed) are the true 'fruits de mer' or fruits of the sea, not shellfish. Not only do they add flavour to food, each variety is a low-fat nutritional powerhouse, packed full of vitamins and minerals. Plus, you won't find elevated levels of dioxins, PCBs or mercury in sea vegetables, in contrast with fish and shellfish in whose body fats these pollutants accumulate over time.\nThe FSA's website provides an extensive list of precautionary measures people should take when buying, storing and preparing fish. It lists 18 different ways you can minimise the risk of being poisoned (FSA, 2009). Of course just avoiding fish and shellfish would be much easier. Indeed excluding all animal foods from the diet will dramatically decrease the risk of food poisoning.\nFish and PhIPs\nMost people think the fool-proof way to avoid food poisoning from meat and fish is to cook it very well - some people practically cremate it to make sure. However, thoroughly cooking meat and fish can lead to even more serious problems.\nCancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are formed when meats (such as beef, chicken and pork) and fish are cooked at high temperatures (Wilson et al., 2007). HCAs form when a chemical found in muscles called creatine reacts with amino acids (the building blocks of protein) and sugar at high temperatures. While meat and fish contain significant amounts of creatine, vegetables contain none.\nIn 2005, the US federal government officially added HCAs to its list of known carcinogens (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2008). The most abundant HCA found in the human diet is called 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP). PhIP is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the colon, breast and prostate (Wilson et al., 2007).\nExactly how PhIP increases cancer risk is uncertain. It has been suggested that PhIP produces harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species which cause DNA strands to break thus increasing cancer risk (Wilson et al., 2007). Alternatively, researchers at Imperial College in London have reported that PhIP is a potent mimic of the hormone oestrogen (Lauber et al., 2007). This is very worrying, as many studies link higher oestrogen levels to breast cancer. This theory provides a plausible explanation for why diets rich in red meats are linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\nIn 2005, the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine's Cancer Project revealed that grilled salmon was among the five worst foods to grill (PCRM, 2005). The Cancer Project nutritionists found that many commonly grilled foods contain alarmingly high levels of HCAs. The five foods containing the highest levels included: chicken breasts, steak, pork, salmon and hamburgers.\nThe amount of PhIP in some foods may typically lie in the region of 35 nanograms per gram. However, there are some reports of much higher levels of PhIP (Skog, 2002). Concentrations of PhIP in fish vary widely according to the type of fish and method of cooking. One study reported levels ranging from 1.7 to 73 nanograms per gram in salmon cooked at 200\u00b0C by various methods (Gross and Gr\u00fcter, 1992).\nThe damaging action of HCAs may be reduced by foods containing antioxidants, such as vegetables and soya foods (Weisburger, 2002). However, the safest option is to avoid meat and fish altogether. Healthier options for grilling and frying include soya burgers, veggie sausages and Portabella mushrooms.\nFarmed and dangerous\nUnless you seek out wild fish, the chances are that most of the fish you see in shops and restaurants were raised on a fish farm in an environment very different to what their wild counterparts would have experienced. One of the main differences on many fish farms is the stocking density - imagine having to fight your way through the January sales every day just to get something to eat. This is the type of scenario many farmed fish endure.\nFish species raised by fish farms include salmon, catfish, tilapia, cod, carp, trout and others. Just as we see with other farmed animals such as the dairy cow, intensive farming methods results in a cheaper end product (in terms of quality and price). This is why farmed salmon has been called 'the battery chicken of the seas'. This may not concern you if the supposed health benefits are the same. However, they are not.\nFrom a nutritional and health perspective, there are several important differences between farmed and wild fish. In the wild, salmon can eat 10 times their own body weight per day. Providing a similar diet to farmed fish would mean grinding up to 10 pounds of sardines, anchovies, mackerel, herring and other fish for every pound of pale and sickly farmed salmon produced. This is clearly uneconomical for fish farmers and heralds an ecological disaster as one-third of the global fish catch ends up as fishmeal or fish oil and fish farms use about half of the fishmeal and more than 80 per cent of the fish oil (Soil Association, 2008).\nIt is much cheaper to manufacture feed pellets from soya, rapeseed or corn with animal by-products and vitamin and mineral supplements. In Canada and Chile, it is common to use other protein sources such as feather or blood meal by-products of chicken and pig production (Soil Association, 2008a). Consequently, farmed fish tend to contain more total fat, but less omega-3s than their wild counterparts (Weaver et al., 2008). In other words, the levels of good and bad fats (the fatty acid profile) of farmed fish vary widely from that of wild fish.\nUsing cheaper vegetable-based feeds drives up the level of omega-6 fats found in the fish. Farmed tilapia (the most rapidly expanding fish in terms of world and US consumption), contain some of the highest levels of the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid found in our food chain (Weaver et al., 2008). These and other farmed fish have a fatty acid profile that would generally be considered as unhealthy. Indeed, marked changes in the fishing industry during the past decade have produced widely eaten fish that have fatty acid characteristics that are generally accepted to be inflammatory by the health care community (Weaver et al., 2008).\nThe fish used in organic fish feeds come from the discarded filleting wastes (blood, guts, tails and heads) of fish caught for human consumption and should not contain fish caught specifically for fish feed. However, this does mean the supply is sustainable; human demand for fish also exceeds supply. Compared to conventional fish feed, organic fish feed may use more fish-based ingredients than non-organic fish feed but still might only have 40 per cent fishmeal and about 22-25 per cent fish oil (Soil Association, 2008a). This means that 35 per cent of the feed could be vegetable-based.\nFarmed fish can also contain chemical pesticide residues as well as dangerous levels of toxic man-made chemicals including PCBs. A 2002 study investigating the levels of toxins in commercial salmon feeds, farmed salmon and wild salmon found that the farmed salmon had consistently higher levels of a range of contaminants including PCBs (Easton et al., 2002). The authors suggested that the higher levels seen in the farmed salmon probably resulted from the elevated level of contamination found in the commercial salmon feed. They concluded that this analysis indicates a safety concern for individuals who, on a regular weekly basis, consume farmed salmon produced from contaminated feed. Since then, other studies have indicated that commercial feed is likely to be a major source of PCBs in farmed salmon (Carlson et al., 2005).\nSo, farmed fish are very far from the safe choice we are led to believe and from a health perspective, when fish are farmed, they lose some of their protective fats. This is a ridiculous situation where the one possible argument in favour of fish consumption (their omega-3 content) is being eroded by intensive farming methods. There remains little, if any, argument for consuming fish.\nFish oil supplements\nSome people prefer to take fish oil supplements rather than eat oily fish. However, fish oil supplements have also been linked to negative health effects in numerous studies. This is particularly worrying as they are increasingly popular as clever marketing persuades people to buy them.\nMost fish oil supplement manufacturers publicise their meticulous manufacturing techniques reassuring us that all toxins are removed from their products. However, in March 2006, the FSA announced that the fish oil supplement manufacturer Seven Seas Ltd withdrew a number of batches of its own fish oil supplements because the levels of pollutants present (FSA, 2006). Less than a month later Boots withdrew fish oil capsules for the same reason (FSA, 2006a). In both cases they said although there was no health risk associated with consumption of this product, the level of dioxins found in fish oil used to produce these capsules exceeded statutory limits. This is a bizarre statement which seems to be saying that a little bit of poison should be all right!\nThe official position - not budging\nThe seriousness of the potential health risks of consuming toxins in fish prompted a joint subgroup of two advisory committees, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), to consider the benefits and risks of fish consumption (SACN, 2004).\nTheir report formed the basis of the FSA advice that pregnant and breastfeeding women should limit their consumption of oily fish to one to two 140 gram portions per week. This group (and children under 16) they say, should avoid shark, marlin and swordfish and not eat large amounts of tuna because of the potential methylmercury exposure. Men, boys and women past childbearing age or who are not intending to have children can eat up to four portions of oily fish a week before the possible risks might start to outweigh the benefits.\nThe report highlights the presence of dioxins in herring, salmon, mackerel and to a lesser degree in trout, and voices concerns about the presence of other pollutants such as brominated flame retardants. The FSA states that occasionally eating more than the recommended amounts of oily fish will not be harmful. It says that the risks from chemicals such as dioxins are not immediate; they develop as the chemicals accumulate in the body over a long period of time. Surely it is better to avoid these hazardous chemicals altogether?\nConfused? You will be!\nThe FSA advises that fish oils protect against CVD and that long chain omega-3s are vital for the development of the central nervous system of the foetus and the breast-feeding infant (SACN, 2004). However, the FSA warns pregnant and breast-feeding women to restrict their intake of oily fish to limit their exposure to harmful toxins. So just when your intake of omega-3 really matters, during pregnancy and when you are breastfeeding, the Government warns you to limit your intake! Consumers are unsurprisingly confused; the information given is neither comprehensive nor consistent.\nIn 2002, Which? magazine reported the findings of a Consumers' Association survey which asked 972 adults about their awareness of, eating habits and attitudes to oily fish (Consumers' Association, 2002). The survey found that only a sixth of fish-eaters knew that the FSA's advice is to eat oily fish once a week; over half thought the advice was to eat two or more portions. A shocking 61 per cent of people had no idea that oily fish may contain contaminants. One per cent knew that pregnant women should avoid certain fish but nobody could name them. Most people in the survey were confused by what was meant by oily fish (14 per cent thought that cod was an oily fish). It is not just the public who are confused; the Consumers' Association states that the FSA couldn't provide any clear answers about the health implications of eating more than one portion of oily fish per week.\nIt's no clearer in the US. In 2002 the American Heart Association (AHA) issued a statement supporting the recommendation for at least two servings of fish (particularly oily fish) per week (Kris-Etherton et al., 2002). However, the AHA warned that the recommendations on fish consumption need to be balanced with concerns over contamination of fish with environmental pollutants (particularly mercury and PCBs). This is an incredibly important proviso which seriously challenges the idea that fish is 'healthy'. It should be noted that the AHA also recommended plant foods that are high in the plant omega-3 ALA such as soya beans, rapeseed, walnuts and flaxseed and oils made from them.\nIn the joint WHO/FAO 2003 report Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases, regular fish consumption of one to two servings per week is recommended to protect against CVD (WHO/FAO, 2003). However, whilst it also states that vegetarians can ensure adequate intakes of the omega-3 fatty acid ALA from plant sources, the report fails to give any warnings about the dangers of environmental contamination.\nThis conflicting advice has led to much confusion. Who should the public listen to? Who can they believe?\nFish is not a popular food\nDespite the constant barrage of fish-promoting marketing and hype, the UK public just don't buy it! The FSA says that on average, people in the UK eat only a third of a portion of oily fish a week (FSA, 2004). Indeed, fish is so unpopular that the FSA admits that seven out of 10 people in the UK don't eat any oily fish at all. Clearly then, oily fish is not a significant contributor of omega-3 fatty acids in the diets of many people.\nFrom a public health perspective, encouraging people to eat more fish in order to gain healthy amounts of omega-3 fats is simply not working. Even if people did start to consume more, the oceans simply cannot cope with any more demand, and as we have seen, farmed fish is definitely not the solution.\nThe upshot of all this confusion and dislike for fish is that many people fail to understand the importance of omega-3s and do not realise how easy it is to obtain them from every-day plant foods. Promoting oily fish as the only 'heart friendly' solution could actually deter individuals from making the fundamental dietary changes necessary for real long-term heart and body health. A healthier and simpler solution would be to promote a plant-based diet containing EFA-rich seeds, nuts and oils. Plants, not fish, are the way forward for good health.\nPlant EFAs leading the way to good health\nThe good news is you don't have to eat neurotoxins and carcinogens to get your omega-3 fatty acids; there are perfectly safe plant sources that can benefit your health.\nAntioxidants in plants protect EFAs\nThe antioxidant vitamins C, E and beta-carotene (the precursor of vitamin A) are found in abundance in plant foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. They are thought to be one of the body's main defences against damaging molecules called free radicals. They are also vital for another important function that demonstrates why plant sources of fatty acids are superior to fish-derived versions.\nMost people (especially those who cook a lot) know that certain fats are more likely to 'go off' when they are exposed to air. The difference arises from the number of double bonds in the fat as they make fats vulnerable to attack from oxygen molecules. This is why we cover food with plastic wrap or submerge it in water to protect it. This is why fish oils are prone to oxidation and give off a characteristic 'fishy' smell.\nAntioxidants help slow this decaying process by acting as a fall guy for the fatty acid; they take the oxygen hit and save the fat from oxidative damage. Plant sources of EFAs, such as nuts and seeds, possess their own supply of antioxidants which protect their fats (in particular vitamin E). So yet again, we see why a plant-based diet provides not only important nutrients, but valuable substances that can protect us from oxidative damage too.\nFree radicals are a problem for us too! They are unstable molecules generated by normal bodily functions, cigarette smoke, pollution, ultraviolet light and stress. Free radicals are linked to cancer or other diseases as well as the aging process. Animals and plants protect themselves against free radicals with antioxidants. They are a natural self-defence mechanism which is thought to defend against many diseases in humans, including the UK's biggest killers heart disease and cancer.\nAs stated, the three amigos of the antioxidant world are beta-carotene (vitamin A), vitamin C and vitamin E. The mineral selenium is another valuable antioxidant. Antioxidants are not found abundantly in meat or fish. Plant foods (including fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds) are the best sources. In the largest, most comprehensive analysis to date of the antioxidant content of commonly consumed foods cranberries, blueberries and blackberries ranked highest among the fruits studied. Beans, artichokes and Russet potatoes topped the list of vegetables. Pecans, walnuts and hazelnuts were the top nuts and ground cloves, cinnamon and oregano ranked highest among the herbs and spices (Wu et al., 2004). As a general rule, brightly coloured vegetables (such as sweet potatoes, red cabbage and tomatoes) tend to be relatively high in antioxidants.\nAgain, vegans are in a win-win situation. Not only do they avoid harmful substances found in meat and fish, they also benefit from a wide range of healthy nutrients including fibre, vitamins, minerals and of course, antioxidants.\nSustainability\nThe widely publicised supposed health benefits of omega-3 fats from fish, together with dwindling supplies of fish caught from the wild, have spawned a dramatic expansion in aquaculture (farmed fish). Aquaculture has increased at an annual rate of 9.2 per cent compared with 1.4 per cent for caught fish (Weaver et al., 2008).\nNearly half the fish consumed as food worldwide (43 per cent) is raised on fish farms rather than caught in the wild; that's up from just nine per cent in 1980 (FAO, 2006). The level of fish caught in the wild (around 90-93 million tonnes annually) by contrast, has not changed much despite growing world population and demand. It can't. The FAO acknowledges that there is little chance of any significant increase in catches beyond these levels anyway.\nThe levelling off of wild catches coupled with the growing world population and increasing demand for fish spells trouble says the FAO. It estimates that an additional 40 million tonnes of aquatic food will be required by 2030 just to maintain current levels of consumption. This is clearly unsustainable, we have to look to alternatives, and fish farming is not the answer. The environmental problems such as the spread of disease, sea lice and pollution associated with farmed fish are abundant. The sensible, and in fact the only answer is to obtain our omega-3 fats from sustainable plant sources.\nFor more information on the environmental impact of fishing see Viva!'s guide The End of the Line .\nRecommendations\nA well-balanced plant-based diet containing green leafy vegetables, wholegrain foods, pulses, nuts and seeds will ensure an adequate intake of the plant omega-3 ALA. One of the best sources is flaxseed oil, containing 57 per cent ALA and 16 per cent LA with a omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 0.28:1 (Davis and Kris-Etherton, 2003). A 14 gram tablespoonful of flaxseed oil provides eight grams of ALA. Flaxseed oil must be kept in the fridge and added to sauces and dips or cooked food. Cooking with it will destroy its beneficial properties. In addition to this, try to buy and store nuts, seeds and their oils in small quantities to ensure that they are as fresh as possible and limit the amount of time the oils have to degrade.\nIt is difficult to say exactly how much of a certain food should be consumed to optimise EFA intake as the fatty acid content of foods varies. However, a sensible approach is to reduce consumption of omega-6 rich vegetable oils (substitute sunflower or corn oil for olive oil in cooking), while increasing omega-3 intake (found in flaxseed oil, walnuts and green leafy vegetables). Limiting or avoiding commercial oil-based processed foods will also help improve the omega-6:omega-3 ratio. Consumption of saturated fatty acids (and trans fatty acids in processed foods) should also be limited as they are unnecessary in the diet, are a risk factor for atherosclerosis and can interfere with the conversion of ALA into the longer chain omega-3s.\nTo improve the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA follow these simple guidelines:\nConsume a wide range of wholefoods everyday - remember variety is the spice of life!\nObtain most fat from whole foods (nuts, seeds, wholegrains, olives, avocados and soya)\nSelect monounsaturated fat (olive oil) for cooking\nUse omega-6 fats (sunflower oil, safflower oil) with moderation\nUse omega-3 fat (flaxseed oil) for salad dressing and in dips but do not cook with it (store it in the fridge)\nCut down on cholesterol (avoid eggs, meat and dairy products)\nAvoid or cut down on processed foods, trans fats from margarines and hydrogenated vegetable oils\nAvoid or reduce fried foods, alcohol, caffeine, sugar, smoking and stress\nConclusion\nNo short cuts, no magic bullet...\nFish is not a health food. Neither is it a magical wonder food that can guarantee good heart health and turn all kids into geniuses. The real problem here is not just the lack of good fats in the diet; it's the generally appalling state of most people's diets. Fish is not a popular food; on average people in the UK eat only a third of a portion of oily fish per week with seven out of ten people consuming none whatsoever. We should stop looking for a 'quick miracle fix' and focus on the bigger picture. improving our diets by cutting out the saturated fatty foods laden with animal fats, sugar, salt and cholesterol and eating more fruit, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, nuts and seeds.\nThis report explains what the current research shows: fish may be a source of protective fats but they are not the only, nor the healthiest, source. Fish are also a source of unhealthy and unnecessary saturated fat in the diet. Plant-derived EFAs are a far superior source of good fats in the diet.\nEnvironmental contamination of the oceans now means that when you take a mouthful of fish you are also taking a mouthful of neurotoxins and carcinogens (mercury, PCBs and dioxins). Some people might consider this game of Russian roulette worth the risk if the health benefits afforded from fish could not be gained elsewhere. However, the research clearly shows that ALA from plants can protect heart health and doesn't come laced with poison. Plant-derived EFAs have numerous advantages over fish-derived fats yet are virtually ignored by health professionals. This may be due to the paucity of relevant research. The VVF is trying to address this by pushing for more research including plant-derived ALA alongside the fish oils EPA and/or DHA.\nIncluding fish in the typical Western diet, high in saturated and processed fat, will not provide the health benefits that many people seek. A far more effective way to achieve good health is to adopt a more plant-based diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol but containing a healthy amount of polyunsaturated EFAs. Well-balanced vegetarian and vegan diets, containing EFA-rich foods, not only help combat heart disease but also protect against many other degenerative diseases.\nAlthough the main focus of this report is human health, the environmental argument for switching to plant-based omega-3s cannot be ignored. We know how commercial fishing is devastating the world's oceans and fish stocks are plummeting. Flaxseed and other plant-based sources of omega-3s are sustainable sources of this important fatty acid as well as being the healthier option. The many arguments supporting the move towards plant-based omega-3s away from fish oils are indisputable.\nOur hearts don't need fish, our brains don't need fish and our health is far better served by plant EFAs as part of a well-balanced plant-based diet. Next time you are told of the magical properties of fish oil, you'll know what to say... fish is not a health food.\nReferences\nAbu-Ghazaleh, A.A., Schingoethe, D.J., Hippen, A.R. and Kalscheur, K.F., 2004.

The VVF helps the public, health professionals and the food industry make informed choices about diet by providing accurate information and advice about healthy eating. The VVF also runs health and education campaigns, presents school talks, cookery demonstrations, produces a magazine, VeggieHealth, and a wide variety of materials, runs the Vegetarian Recipe Club and answers nutritional queries from the public. The majority of diseases that kill most of us prematurely can be prevented by consuming a plant-based diet - the VVF explains why and provides information and advice about healthy eating.\nISBN: 978-0-9557653-4-6\n"}, {"score": 1649.3822, "uuid": "c3151ecd-b97f-555c-bc79-2d93711bd9f0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-13-12641", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/guides/Fish/", "page_rank": 1.2409448e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "Many studies show that <em>vegetarians</em> <em>and</em> <em>vegans</em> weigh less than meat-eaters; on average <em>between</em> six pounds <em>and</em> two stones less.

While some algae produce only DHA, recently discovered species contain both EPA and DHA. So, if you\u2019re concerned about conversion, fear not, you can obtain both of these omega-3 fatty\nacids from algae! Brands are available online.\nAlgae for omega-3 supplements is usually grown in controlled conditions away from\nthe sea so it doesn\u2019t impact on marine ecosystems or deprive fish of their natural\nfood. When fish stocks are declining so rapidly it is highly irresponsible to continue\npushing them as the best source of omega-3s. Alternatives must be found and algae\nand other plant sources are the obvious choice. The bonus is that toxin levels are\nvirtually non-existent.\nOily fish, omega-3s and health\nThe heart of the matter\nOne of the main reasons oily fish is promoted is because EFAs can lower the risk of heart disease. They got the nutritional thumbs up when it was seen that Japanese and Inuit (Eskimo) people who eat lots of fish had much lower rates of heart disease. Research showed that EPA and DHA from fish helped reduce blood-clotting and lowered blood pressure, cholesterol and fat levels \u2013 all factors in reducing heart disease. What the research ignored was that EPA and DHA can be formed from plant omega-3 (ALA).\nSince then, numerous studies have looked at the role of ALA, EPA and DHA in reducing heart disease with three studies in particular most usually being quoted \u2013\nDART, GISSI and LYON.\nThe DART and GISSI trials showed how fish oils could reduce death rates in people\nwho already have heart disease. Plenty of other studies showed that plant-based oils did the same thing \u2013 but without harmful toxins \u2013 particularly the LYON study.\nDART \u2013 fish to fight heart disease\nThe DART trial set out to find if oily fish or fish oil supplements could help prevent a second heart attack in people who had already had one attack. It showed that those on fish oils were a third less likely to die from heart failure in the two years after their first heart attack compared to those not taking fish oils. The improvement was thought to come from a normalising of heartbeat rhythms where heartbeats were irregular (arrhythmia).While the DART trial showed a reduced number of deaths it didn\u2019t show a reduction in heart attacks \u2013 fewer deaths but the same number of painful attacks.\nA large body of evidence shows that plantbased diets can be used to both prevent and even reverse heart disease (see the VVF guide Have a Heart for further information).Those taking blood-thinning medication such as daily aspirin or warfarin should speak to their GP before eating lots of food with added omega-3 or fish oil supplements, as these can also reduce blood-clotting.\nGISSI \u2013 fish oil and heart disease\nThe GISSI trial also looked at the effect of EPA and DHA omega-3s on people who had recently survived a heart attack. Some were given a daily supplement of fish oil capsules while others weren\u2019t.\nAfter three-and-a-half years, it showed a 20 per cent reduction in death rates for those on fish oil but, like the DART trial, the number of non-fatal heart attacks was unchanged. The daily one gram of fish oil taken was the equivalent to eating 100 grams of oily fish a day \u2013 exceeding the Food Standards Agency\u2019s \u2018safe\u2019 levels (see page 8).\nNo benefit\nThese two studies showed that fish oils may reduce the risk of death in people who have already had a heart attack but a review of many more studies showed that fish and fish oils do not reduce the risk for people with no history of heart problems. So, those with healthy lifestyles don\u2019t protect their heart by eating fish. There is now even doubt that fish oils offer protection to people with existing heart disease.\nNo long-term protection\nOver a decade after the DART trial started, researchers went back to the fish and nonfish groups and found, to their surprise, that the death rate was almost identical in\nboth groups. So, there was no evidence of long-term protection even for those with a heart condition.\nAnother study looked at whether advising men with angina to eat oily fish or fish oil\nsupplements would help their condition. It found an increased death rate of 20 per\ncent and 45 per cent respectively! Health organisations and the government should\nperhaps rethink their promotion of fish and fish oils.\nThe British Medical Journal drew all the evidence together in a major review which looked at 89 studies on omega-3 fats and found no clear evidence that people\u2019s health benefited from them. Surprising, considering the benefits previously shown for omega-3s. What could it be about fish omega-3s that was negating these positive effects?\nA possible explanation was provided by one large study in their review that showed\na significant increase in deaths from heart attack in men taking fish oil capsules. This\ntrial had the longest follow-up period of all the studies. It was thought that the\nmercury in fish oil could build up over time and that early protective effects might later\nbecome harmful. In other words, pollutants cancel out the beneficial effects of fish omega-3s in the long term!\nLYON \u2013 plants on trial\nThe LYON study investigated whether a healthier, Mediterranean-type diet could\nreduce the risk of a second heart attack.\nPatients were given either a Mediterranean diet or a low-fat \u2018prudent\u2019 Western diet.\nThe Mediterranean diet was largely plant-based with butter and cream being replaced with olive oil and rapeseed oil margarine. The diet did contain some fish but less red meat and was lower in animal fat. It had much less cholesterol but was higher in the plant omega-3 ALA.\nThis diet increased levels of ALA in the blood by 70 per cent and EPA by 40 per\ncent. Their fish intake was only seven grams a day more than the group on the \u2018prudent\u2019 Western diet so the higherEPA levels were due to plant ALA rather\nthan fish.\nAfter almost four years, patients following the Mediterranean-style diet had a 50-70 per cent lower risk of recurrent heart disease compared to those on the \u2018prudent\u2019 Western diet.\nAn important difference between this and previous studies with fish oils was that\nthe number of non-fatal heart attacks was reduced. Secondly, the diet\u2019s protective effect was associated with the parent omega-3 ALA rather than the converted EPA as in previous studies. In fact there was no link between the converted EPA and DHA omega-3s and a reduction in heart attacks.\nThe LYON study showed that plant ALA is extremely effective in reducing the risks of\nsecondary heart disease, that it was superior to fish-derived EPA and DHA in reducing the risk of a second heart attack and that it protects the heart in the long-term.\nThe bonus is that the Mediterranean diet is rich in disease-busting antioxidants that can help reduce the build up of fatty deposits in the arteries that lead to heart disease and reduce the risk of cholesterol becoming \u2018oxidised\u2019 \u2013 the body\u2019s equivalent of rust. When oxidised, \u2018bad\u2019 cholesterol can harm the walls of arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease.\nThe problem is \u2013 this research does not appear to have reached health professionals! Around 300,000 people in Britain have a heart attack every year and many of those who survive receive little or no dietary advice. Many scientists agree that survivors should be advised to follow a diet similar to that used in the LYON study.\nPlant omega-3s and heart disease\nThere is a wealth of science showing that plant-based omega-3s protect against heart disease. The Health Professionals\u2019 Study found that a one per cent increase in ALA intake lowered the risk of heart attack by 59 per cent.\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study found that those who ate the most ALA had a 45 per cent lower risk of fatal heart disease.In 2003, a WHO/UN FAO report supported the fact that ALA protected against heart\ndisease and listed flaxseed, rapeseed and soya bean oils as being beneficial.\nIn 2008, a study in the journal Circulation (the journal of the American Heart Association) reported that when ALA intake was just 0.65 per cent of daily energy intake (compared to 0.24 per cent), non-fatal heart attacks reduced by a staggering 57 per cent. In weight, this amounts to just 1.79 grams per day \u2013 two teaspoons of soya bean or rapeseed oil, 1-2ml (1tsp = 5ml) of flaxseed oil, or 6-10 walnuts a\nday would do the trick.\nInterestingly, neither fish nor EPA and DHA intake altered the heart attack-lowering effect of ALA, indicating that it is the parent ALA rather than the converted EPA or DHA that lowers the risk.\nveggie diets...THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION\nChanging your diet can change \u2013 and save \u2013 your life! Meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products all contain cholesterol while a plant-based diet contains little or no cholesterol so, not surprisingly, vegans have lower cholesterol levels than vegetarians \u2013 fish and meat-eaters tend to have the highest. As a result, vegetarians and\nvegans have a much lower risk of heart disease than meat-eaters \u2013 and a 25 per cent lower risk of dying from heart disease! If people throughout Britain went vegetarian, there would be some 40,000 fewer deaths from heart disease every year.\nAnd it\u2019s never too late to change. Plantbased diets can not only prevent heart disease, they can reverse the damage. Dr Dean Ornish, Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California in San Francisco, is known for his Lifestyle\nHeart Trial in which he treated severe heart disease patients by changing their\nlifestyle and nothing else. They ate a low-fat, wholegrain, plant-based diet containing lots of fruit, vegetables and pulses, took exercise and managed their stress. A \u2018control\u2019 group of similar patients received conventional treatment.\nAfter one year, the control group experienced a 165 per cent increase in the frequency of chest pain, cholesterol was higher and artery blockages had worsened. Conversely, 82 per cent of the patients following Ornish\u2019s lifestyle changes had improved with a 91 per cent reduction in chest pain and reduced cholesterol levels.\nFor more information on heart disease see the VVF fact sheet Plant-based Diets\nand Cardiovascular Disease.\nThe conclusion of the study was that vegetable oils rich in ALA could provide important protection against heart disease. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Family Heart Study showed that men eating the most ALA had a 40 per cent lower risk and women, a whopping 50-70 per cent reduction.\nInflammatory diseases\nIt\u2019s been known for years that omega-3 fats can help fight coronary heart disease, asthma, type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The beneficial effects have also been seen in some cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, mental health, dry eye disease, age-related macular degeneration and psoriasis. Many of these conditions involve inflammation.\nOur bodies use inflammation to protect tissues from infection, injury or disease. It\nusually promotes healing but, if uncontrolled, can harm. We now know that the balance of omega-6s to omega-3s is important for regulating inflammation. As a general rule, omega-6 fats are considered proinflammatory, whereas omega-3 fats are\nconsidered anti-inflammatory (GLA is the exception as it is an omega-6 fat with antiinflammatory properties).\nThere is evidence that changing the diet can help some people with inflammatory\nconditions; some of these are discussed below.\nArthritis\nArthritis is a painful condition of the joints and bones. There are many different forms of arthritis; the two main types are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Other forms include ankylosing spondylitis, cervical spondylitis, fibromyalgia, lupus, gout, psoriatic arthritis and Reiter\u2019s syndrome.\nOsteoarthritis\nOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting 8.5 million\npeople. Sometimes called \u2018wear and tear\u2019 arthritis, it occurs when cartilage (the strong, smooth lining covering our bones) breaks down faster than it can be repaired.\nEventually the surface of the bones rub together, causing damage. This can lead\nto bony growths developing around the edge of the joints and inflammation of\nthe tissues. Osteoarthritis mostly occurs in the knees, hips and hands but can affect\nany joint.\nIt generally occurs in the over 50s, and is more common in women than men. However, it is not an inevitable part of aging. It can develop after an injury to a joint; this can happen months or even years after the injury.\nThere is much less research on omega-3s and osteoarthritis compared to rheumatoid\narthritis (see below). However, some work indicates that omega-3s are involved. One\nstudy found that cartilage from osteoarthritis patients had higher levels of omega-6s and lower levels of omega-3s than muscle tissue from the same people. Another study showed that long chain omega-3s can reduce the level of cartilage-degrading enzymes. This raises the possibility that omega-3s can help prevent the loss of cartilage and ultimately prevent osteoarthritis.\nMore research on omega-3 fats and osteoarthritis is needed. Eating a healthy\nplant-based diet, containing a good supply of omega-3 fats (including an algal supplement if necessary), would however be a good insurance policy, rather than just\nwaiting for the research.\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRheumatoid (inflammatory) arthritis is a more aggressive, but less common\ncondition than osteoarthritis. It is known as an \u2018autoimmune\u2019 disease, whereby the body\u2019s own immune system attacks the joints, causing pain and swelling and the destruction of cartilage and bone.\nRheumatoid arthritis affects around 350,000 people in the UK and like osteoarthritis, is also more common in women than men. It is most common after the age of 40, but can affect people of any age.\nIt is characterised by hot painful swelling in the joints. It usually starts in the wrists,\nhands and feet but can spread to other joints. In many diseases inflammation can help healing, but in rheumatoid arthritis, it damages. For some people the discomfort, pain and loss of mobility can have a serious impact on their lives.\nDiet and arthritis\nIn the past, people with arthritis were told that changing their diet would not help them. Despite this, over the years, many arthritis patients have found that certain foods can help, while others can harm.\nArthritis Care, the UK\u2019s largest voluntary organisation working with and for people with arthritis, suggest a diet high in fruit, vegetables, pasta, fish and white meat and low in fatty foods such as red meat, cream and cheese can help. Most people would benefit from eating less saturated fat and sugar and eating more complex carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and minerals. It is clear that for many people with arthritis, a healthier diet can help considerably.\nThe research shows that people who eat the most red meat, white meat and meat products have the highest risk for inflammatory arthritis, while vegetarian and vegan diets can prevent and treat this and many other diseases.\nStudies show that low-fat, gluten-free, vegan diets can help reduce symptoms\nof arthritis. Other work, looking at an uncooked vegan diet, rich in antioxidants\nand fibre, reduced joint stiffness and pain. Further studies show that fasting, followed by a vegetarian or vegan diet can help people with arthritis. These\nstudies provide strong evidence that dietary modification can benefit arthritis patients and that some foods do help while others harm.\nWeight control\nIt is very important for people with arthritis to maintain a healthy weight. The extra\nburden on the joints, in overweight or obese arthritis patients, can make symptoms much worse. Losing weight can have a dramatic effect in improving the condition.\nVegetarian and vegan diets can help people lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight. Many studies show that vegetarians and vegans weigh less than meat-eaters; on average between six pounds and two stones less.\nWhen losing weight, it is important to ensure a good intake of nutrients. A healthy\nbalanced diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables, pulses and wholegrain foods (wholemeal bread, brown rice and wholemeal pasta) provides a good supply of vitamins, minerals and fibre. A diet lacking in these foods and rich in meat,\ndairy and processed foods (such as white bread, white rice and white pasta), does\nnot provide a good source of nutrients. Find out how to achieve and maintain a healthy weight while protecting your health too in the VVF\u2019s V-Plan Diet guide.\nGetting the fats right\nWhile vegetarian and vegan diets have been shown to help some people with arthritis, people who eat large amounts of red meat, dairy and processed foods may suffer more. The key point here is that plant-based diets (rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fats) are helpful, whereas Western diets (rich in meat, dairy and processed foods) contain harmful saturated fat which can increase the pain and inflammation of arthritis. The fact that people also lose weight on a plant-based diet is an added bonus.\nOmega-6 fats don\u2019t appear to help people with arthritis. In fact, they may increase\ninflammation by competing with omega-3 fats. Most people have diets which already\ncontain more omega-6 than they need. If you have arthritis, it may be helpful to replace some of the omega-6 fats (found in sunflower oil, corn oil and products made from them such as margarine) with omega-3 fats from flaxseed, hempseed and rapeseed oils and walnuts. Omega-3s from these sources will ensure you get this healthy fat without exposing your body to the harmful toxins found in oily fish. For an extra boost, you can take omega-3 algal supplements.\nGout\nPeople with gout are advised not to eat oily fish. Gout is a type of arthritis caused\nby a high level of uric acid in the body which can crystallise in the joints and\ncause severe pain and inflammation. Uric acid is produced from the breakdown of\nfoods high in substances called purines. Such foods include certain meats (kidney,\nliver, veal, turkey and venison) and fish (anchovies, herring, mackerel, sardines, fish roes, mussels and scallops).\nTo avoid foods high in purines, replace animal-based foods with other sources\nof protein such as pulses, nuts and seeds. Other dietary measures for gout include losing weight (if you are overweight) and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption.\nCalcium\nA well-balanced healthy diet can help if you are taking strong drugs for arthritis. In fact, it could help protect against some of the side-effects. For example steroids (such as prednisolone), can cause osteoporosis, particularly if you stay on them for a long time. Plenty of calcium in your diet will help reduce the risk.\nArthritis Care warns that some people with arthritis have an increased risk of osteoporosis and say that ensuring a good calcium intake is very important. While cow\u2019s milk and dairy products are indeed a source of calcium, they are not\nthe best. This is because they contain animal protein. Excessive amounts of animal protein can upset the acid balance within the body, which then takes calcium from the bones to neutralise the acid. Even the usually pro-dairy National Osteoporosis Society says that it is a good idea to avoid too much protein, particularly animal protein such as meat and cheese. It is also a good idea to avoid too much salt, fizzy drinks and caffeine for the same reason.\nHealthy sources of calcium include green leafy vegetables (broccoli, kale, spring greens, cabbage, parsley and watercress \u2013 but not spinach), dried fruits (figs and\ndates), nuts (almonds and Brazil nuts), seeds (sesame seeds and tahini \u2013 sesame\nseed paste) and pulses (peas, beans, lentils and soya products such as calcium-set tofu and calcium-enriched soya milk). For more information on calcium see the VVF\u2019s fact sheet Boning up on Calcium.\nIron\nSome people with arthritis may be concerned about their iron intake, particularly (they may be told) if they have decided not to eat red meat. This should not be a concern as the British Medical Association and the American Dietetic Association agree that vegetarians are no more likely to suffer from iron deficiency than meat-eaters. Indeed one of the largest studies of vegetarians and vegans in the world found that the vegans had the highest intake of iron, followed by the vegetarians and then the meat-eaters.\nGood sources of iron include pulses, dried fruits and green leafy vegetables.\nUnlike iron from plant foods, the iron in meat is absorbed into the body whether\nit is needed or not. Thus meat can supply an overload of iron (but no vitamin C\nand very little vitamin E). Excessive iron in the diet can increase production of harmful molecules called free radicals (see Antioxidant action, page 20) linked to heart disease, cancer and other diseases. Conversely, vegetables and wholegrain foods can supply as much, or as little iron as is required, as well as an abundance of antioxidant vitamins and other nutrients.\nFor more information on iron see the VVF\u2019s fact sheet Ironing out the Facts.\nAntioxidant action\nThe antioxidant vitamins A, C and E protect against disease (and aging) by \u2018mopping up\u2019 harmful free radicals, produced as your body breaks down food or when it is exposed to harmful chemicals (including cigarette smoke). Free radicals play a role in the development of many diseases. They do this by causing a sequence of events\n(rather like a line of dominos falling down) which can ultimately result in cancer, heart\ndisease or arthritis.\nAnti-rheumatic drugs may work by acting as antioxidants. For example, non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs act as free radical \u2018scavengers\u2019 mopping up free radicals.\nHowever, antioxidants may be more useful in preventing damage before it occurs, rather than treating an already inflamed joint. A plant-based diet, rich in a wide\nrange of brightly coloured fruit and vegetables (such as sweet potato, red cabbage, carrots, blueberries and so on) will provide an abundance of disease-busting antioxidants that will fight off many diseases, not just arthritis.\nOmega-3s\nFor some people with arthritis, omega-3 supplements may be helpful, for example\na tablespoon of flaxseed oil twice a day (this exceeds the 1-2 teaspoon-a-day\nrecommendation for normal consumption). If it is helpful, it is a good idea to try to\nreduce your intake to the lowest effective dose.\nAdditional treatments\nSome arthritis patients have benefited from taking a herbal remedy isolated from rose-hips. In one study, the rosehip remedy reduced pain so much after just three weeks that patients were able to reduce their intake of painkillers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This result compares favourably with glucosamine, currently the most popular supplement for joint health.\nSummary\nLosing weight and eating a healthy plantbased diet that includes a good supply of\nomega-3 fatty acids (either through foods or algal supplements) and antioxidants can\nhelp reduce the symptoms of arthritis and may help some people reduce the amount\nof medication they are taking.\nMultiple sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease affecting the central nervous system (the brain\nand spinal cord). In MS, the protective sheath called myelin, that surrounds the nerve fibres of the central nervous system becomes damaged. This disrupts the messages that pass between the brain and other parts of the body. Symptoms include blurred vision, paralysis, slurred speech, lack of coordination and incontinence. The severity of symptoms depends on how much damage has occurred.\nAround 85,000 people in the UK have MS and twice as many women as men are affected. It can occur at any age, but in most cases symptoms appear between the ages of 20 and 40. Most people with MS suffer attacks followed by periods of recovery. This is why MS is called a relapsing-remitting condition. It is a lifelong condition, but it is not terminal and people with MS can expect to live as long as anyone else.\nMS is an autoimmune disease whereby the body\u2019s immune system attacks its own tissues. As with other autoimmune diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes), it is thought that a combination of genetic factors and environmental triggers cause the disease.\nAlthough genes are involved, evidence suggests that MS is more strongly related\nto environmental factors which may include bacteria, viruses or components of the diet.\nGeographical pattern\nOne of the most interesting features of MS is that it occurs mostly in countries far from the equator. It is relatively common in the UK, North America and Scandinavia, but rare in Malaysia and Ecuador. The reason for this is not really understood; it could be that MS is triggered by a bacteria or virus which thrives in cooler climates. Alternatively, it could be that certain foods eaten in these countries are responsible.\nPopulations that eat lots of animal-based foods are most affected by MS. In fact, many studies reveal a striking link between the geographical pattern of MS and that of meat and dairy food consumption. In general, the evidence shows that foods rich in saturated fats are associated with higher levels of MS, while foods rich in polyunsaturated fats are linked to lower levels.\nOmega-6 fatty acids and MS\nOmega-6 fats may be involved in both the development and treatment of MS. This\nmay be because people with MS do not process them as well, leading to lower\nlevels than in people without MS.\nStudies show that taking borage oil (containing the omega-6 fatty acid GLA) can lower the number of relapses and slow the disease. Some experts argue that it would be good for people with MS to add more omega-6 fats to their diets. Others disagree saying that the evidence is not there and it should be avoided because of the potential negative health consequences.\nAn ideal way of getting enough (but not too much) omega-6 is through increasing\nflaxseed oil in the diet, as it contains both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. Some experts recommend consuming four teaspoons of flaxseed oil daily (higher than the 1-2 teaspoons-a-day recommended normally). In general, a low saturated fat, plant-based diet, containing both omega-6 and omega-3 fats in a healthy balance may help\ncontrol MS.\nAutoimmune diseases\nIn general, diets low in saturated fat and high in omega-3 fats can reduce the severity\nof some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, while diets high in omega-6 fats may increase the severity. The possible exception is MS; there is convincing evidence for a protective role of both omega-6 and omega-3 fats in MS.\nThe immune system works best when there is a good balance of omega-6 and\nomega-3 fats in the diet. The optimum ratio varies depending on age and the\ncondition being treated. Some scientists recommend ratios between 5:1 and 10:1\nomega-6 to omega-3. Others suggest a ratio of between 1:1 and 4:1 as being best.\nWhat are we getting? The current ratio in our diet is estimated to be higher than 15:1 and may be as much as 30:1 in some people. We clearly need to increase our\nintake of omega-3s.\nYou can improve your ratio by making a few simple changes: use olive oil in place\nof sunflower or safflower oil, and flaxseed oil in dressings and dips. If you want to\nimprove the ratio further, take flaxseed oil or an algal supplement.\nThe overall message is clear: a plant-based diet low in saturated fat, salt and sugar (and processed foods) and high in fresh fruits, vegetables, wholegrain foods, pulses, nuts and seeds can provide all the nutrients required for good health while protecting against a wide range of diseases.\nAs the incidence of most autoimmune diseases is directly linked to the consumption\nof animal foods, this approach could help prevent many autoimmune conditions that\noccur increasingly in populations that eat large amounts of dairy and meat products.\nAllergies\nThe steep rise in the amount of omega-6 fats in the diet and the huge drop in omega-3\nfats is a major driver of the increase of inflammatory allergic reactions. The omega-6 fat LA is made into arachidonic acid in the body, which gives rise to hormones\nthat promote inflammation. So high levels of omega-6s can encourage allergic\ninflammation. On the other hand, omega-3s reduce inflammation as they compete for\nthe enzymes that convert omega-6s into arachidonic acid, thus blocking production of\ninflammatory hormones.\nAsthma\nAsthma is a chronic, inflammatory lung disease characterised by recurrent breathing problems. The UK has one of the highest rates for asthma in the world, along with New Zealand, Australia and Ireland, with one in eight children and one\nin 20 adults affected.\nDuring an asthma attack, the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and constricted,\nleading to coughing, wheezing, difficulty in breathing and tightness across the chest.\nThe causes of asthma include a genetic susceptibility (asthma in the family) and\nenvironmental triggers such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, dust mites or diet. As food allergies are responsible for around five per cent of all asthma cases, and\nas cow\u2019s milk is a primary cause of food allergies, it may be useful to consider avoiding cow\u2019s milk and dairy products in the treatment of asthma.\nChanging the diet in other ways has been shown to help, reducing the need for drugs.\nSupplementing the diet with plant-based fatty acids may relieve the symptoms of asthma in some people. In one study, borage oil (containing GLA) reduced the symptoms. Lowering the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats from 10:1 to 2:1 helped\nother people with asthma, while a ratio of 10:1 made symptoms worse.\nEczema\nThe increasing rates of eczema in the UK have also been linked to the rising levels\nof omega-6 fats and the falling levels of omega-3 fats in the typical Western diet.\nSupplementing eczema patients with omega-3 fats has been shown to relieve\nsymptoms. Again, the anti-inflammatory effect of these omega-3s is attributed to\ntheir role in stopping arachidonic acid being used to make inflammatory hormones.\nSupplementing the diet with DHA and EPA from fish has been shown to increase blood levels of both long chain omega-3s. But the higher levels of EPA could result either directly from the EPA in the supplement, or from \u2018retroconversion\u2019 of DHA into EPA. This is very important as it shows that an algal supplement supplying DHA could increase both DHA and EPA levels in the body.\nThe study referred to above used preparations from tuna fish, however, in an email to the VVF, the author said:\n\u201cI personally think, and we also have already experimental data, that algal sources would work as well.\u201d\nIn short, there is no need to expose yourself to harmful toxins found in fish oils when you can obtain effective treatment from omega-3 fats from plant foods and algal supplements.\nSummary\nBecause many people dislike the taste or smell of fish oils, even when provided in\ncapsules, and because of dwindling fish stocks, interest in plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids has increased tremendously. A well-balanced plantbased\ndiet, low in saturated fats but providing a good balance of omega-6s and omega-3s, and algal supplements when deemed necessary, can protect against a range of inflammatory (and other) diseases without exposure to the insidious toxic pollutants found in fish oils.\nA large number of vegetarian and vegan studies convincingly show that plant-based diets have numerous health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of many common chronic diseases. Furthermore, since vegetarian and vegan diets are more sustainable, environmentally and economically, they certainly deserve more consideration in the prevention and treatment of disease.\nBrain food\nThe human brain develops rapidly during the first year of life, tripling in size by the age of one. Over 60 per cent composed of fat, the brain\u2019s early development requires a good supply of polyunsaturated EFAs, which is why there are high levels in human\nbreast milk compared to cow\u2019s milk. Cow\u2019s milk tends to be low in these types of fat but high in saturated fats, needed for rapid body growth \u2013 essential for survival in the wild.\nNutrients in breast milk have a significant effect on brain development in infants. Long-term breastfeeding is linked with higher scores in verbal, performance and IQ tests. Omega-6 arachidonic acid and omega-3 DHA are both important fats.\nAttempts to alter the fat composition of cow\u2019s milk to meet human requirements involved feeding cows fish meal, soya beans and flaxseed. Flaxseed produced a lower\nomega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio but you could, of course, eat the flaxseed yourself and get better results!\nSmart enough to be veggie?\nAccording to Benjamin Franklin, the 18th century statesman and scientist, a vegetarian diet results in: \u201cgreater clearness of head and quicker comprehension.\u201d Consider this \u2013 if fish oils really were the best source of EFAs then vegetarians would come bottom of the intelligence stakes. In fact the opposite seems to be true. In 2006, a team of veggies won the BBC\u2019s Test the Nation IQ battle. The butchers came joint fourth \u2013 there was not a team of fishmongers!\nThe British Medical Journal provided more weighty evidence showing that intelligent children are more likely to become vegetarians. People who were vegetarians by the age of 30 had an IQ five points higher than average when they were 10. Perhaps not surprisingly, people with a higher IQ tend to be healthier \u2013 and vegetarians generally suffer less heart disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, various cancers, diverticular disease, bowel disorders, gallstones, kidney stones and osteoporosis.\nIf not eating fish was a serious threat to brain development, vegetarians would\ngenerally fail at school, university and work. They don\u2019t!\nFish oils for brainy kids?\nThe evidence that fish oil can improve brain power comes mainly from trials on children with behavioural problems and is largely anecdotal, not scientific.\nThe Durham- Oxford Study is the work usually quoted. Over 100 children with developmental coordination disorders (DCDs) such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia and dyspraxia, were given a daily supplement of fish oils while others were given olive oil as a control.\nAfter three months, there were significant improvements in reading, spelling and behaviour in those taking fish oil supplements. Perhaps not surprisingly,\nthe conclusion was that EFA supplements are an effective way of improving the performance of children with these problems. At this time, the VVF asked the researchers in Durham if they would consider using flaxseed oil in future trials to see if similar results could be achieved without exposing children to potential toxins but our suggestions were completely ignored.\nA follow-up trial in Durham was conducted more recently whereby three million fish oil capsules were given to 2,000 children over eight months to see if their GCSE results improved. Unfortunately the results were rather disappointing but this was not press-released by the County Council. In some very fast back-pedalling they said: \u201c...it was never intended, and the County Council never suggested, that it would use this initiative to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or otherwise of using fish oil to boost exam results.\u201d So it seems fish oil was not the magic bullet Durham Council was looking for.\nMost children in the UK eat such appalling diets that nutritional deficiencies are inevitable. Correcting the deficiencies will, in many cases, improve performance of those kids. This is not the same as saying that fish oil will turn kids into geniuses, which is how the media interpreted the findings.\nPublicity from this kind of research has encouraged companies to produce socalled functional foods, such as the St Ivel Advance Omega-3 milk. Adverts for this\n\u2018clever milk\u2019 implied that because of its fish omega-3 content, it may make children more intelligent. The Foods Standards Agency issued a short briefing which was prepared specifically in response to the St Ivel \u2018clever milk\u2019 campaign stating that: \u201cthe evidence on the cognitive benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, which are found in fish oils, is currently uncertain.\u201d Quite rightly, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the adverts were misleading and the claims unproven, not least because results from trials involving children with learning difficulties could not be applied to all children. The adverts were withdrawn.\nThe Joint Health Claims Initiative operated between 2000 and 2007, checking the science behind health claims. During this period it approved claims for soya protein, oats and reduced saturated fat for their cholesterol-lowering effects and wholegrain foods for their benefits to heart health. It also approved health claims for omega-3 fats for healthy hearts. It did not approve any claims linking omega-3 fats to improved brain function.\nIn fact, fish oils may have no effect on cognitive ability at all and encouraging children to take them in the pursuit of cleverness may lead to far more serious health problems from toxic chemicals.\nFish \u2013 a danger to health\nAlmost all of the world\u2019s oceans and rivers are polluted with toxic chemicals, mainly from decades of industrial activity. The health risks from fish and fish oil supplements result directly from this. Oily fish such as salmon, trout, herring, sardines and mackerel are invariably contaminated whilst shark, marlin and swordfish can also contain high levels of mercury. Long-term exposure to these damaging substances is\na threat to health.\nPOP goes the seawall\nPersistent organic pollutants (POPs) are particularly nasty and are found in oily fish. POPs come from plastics, paints and pesticides and don\u2019t break down easily in the environment, building up in the food chain. A small fish eats some larvae, then a bigger fish eats the small fish, then an even bigger fish eats that fish, and so on. Fish at the top of the food chain \u2013 such as tuna, shark, swordfish, tilefish and king mackerel \u2013 have the highest concentrations of POPs. Farmed salmon \u2013 which is most of the salmon eaten \u2013 are of particular concern because of the concentration of POPs in the feed they eat, mostly wild-caught fish and fish oils.\nAlthough some POPs are now banned, it will be years before they disappear from the environment. Other POPs are still being released. The World Wildlife Fund have expressed concerns that global warming could increase levels of POPs as higher temperatures release chemicals frozen in glaciers.\nHigh levels of POPs in human blood have been linked to insulin resistance and diabetes. Some scientists say resignedly that it is hard to avoid POPs while others believe that they need to be seriously considered when planning treatment. Avoiding fish is one easy way to cut exposure.\nPCBs and dioxins\nPOPs known as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins are the main toxins in oily fish. PCBs are widespread, very persistent chemicals and are generally present at low concentrations in fat-containing foods such as milk, meat and fish. Fat-loving,\nPCBs accumulate in fatty tissue and are particularly likely to be present in oily fish.\nRecent surveys have shown that some other fish and crab may also have similar\nlevels of PCBs and dioxins as oily fish. These include: sea bream, turbot, halibut,\ndogfish or huss and sea bass.\nImplicated in heart disease, cancer and infertility, PCBs and dioxins can also\nharm developing foetuses by disrupting the growth of male babies\u2019 reproductive organs.\nDioxins were the primary ingredient in Agent Orange, the defoliant sprayed over Vietnam and which has produced an appalling legacy of cancers and other diseases, miscarriages and birth defects.\nMercury rising\nMercury is everywhere in the world\u2019s seas and accumulates in the food chain in the same way as POPs. It can affect the kidneys, heart and central nervous system. Exposure for unborn children, where the main organs and nervous system are still developing, is particularly hazardous.\nIn those studies that have shown fish or fish oils can increase the risk of heart disease, mercury is usually seen as the guilty party as it can accelerate atherosclerosis \u2013 the build up of fatty deposits in the arteries.\nMen in Eastern Finland eat a lot of fish yet have an exceptionally high death rate from heart disease. In one study, just 30 grams of fish a day was linked to a two-fold increase in heart attacks. Each additional 10 grams a day increased the risk by five per cent. High levels of mercury in their hair indicated that mercury-tainted fish was to blame. Levels of mercury in Finnish lakes are known to be relatively high and it was thought eating non-oily freshwater fish was the cause. It is thought that the mercury simply cancels out any benefit from the omega-3s in fish.\nStudies in eight European countries and Israel confirmed that DHA lowers the risk of a heart attack but where high levels of mercury are present, the risk increases. Mercury is already a concern for high-risk groups such as pregnant and breastfeeding women but researchers say that the caution to limit the intake of some fish should be extended to everyone.\nThe American Heart Association acknowledges the contradictions in research on fish oils and heart health and also points the finger at mercury. It still supports the idea of two weekly servings of fish but says this should be balanced against concerns over pollutants \u2013 whatever that might mean! It does support the inclusion of vegetable oils high in ALA as part of a healthy diet. A small move in the right direction.\nFood poisoning\nThe Food Standards Agency estimates that over five million people get food poisoning in the UK every year. It is impossible to know exactly how many people are affected as so many cases go unreported.\nMost food poisoning is caused by meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, fish and shellfish contaminated with bacteria. Plant foods are much safer as they rarely harbour the types of bacteria that cause food poisoning. When plant foods are responsible, it is usually because they are contaminated with animal excreta, human sewage or prepared with dirty hands.\nThe role of fish and shellfish in food poisoning is often underestimated. Raw and undercooked fish and shellfish can contain harmful viruses and bacteria.\nThe Food Standards Agency recommends that elderly people and people who are unwell avoid eating raw shellfish. It also provides an 18-point list of precautionary measures people can take when buying, storing and preparing fish. Of course just avoiding fish and shellfish altogether would be much easier. Indeed excluding all animal foods from the diet will dramatically decrease your risk of food poisoning.\nFish and PhIPs\nSome people regularly overcook meat and fish to avoid food poisoning. However, this could lead to even more serious problems.\nGrilling, frying or barbecuing meat and fish can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs). These dangerous compounds are made when creatine (a chemical found in muscle) reacts with amino acids (the building blocks of protein) and sugar at high temperatures. Meat and fish both contain creatine, vegetables contain none.\nThe most abundant HCA in food is called PhIP and is linked to cancers of the colon, breast and prostate. Some research suggests that PhIP encourages breaks in our DNA that then lead to cancer. Other work shows that PhIP acts in the same way as the female hormone oestrogen, high levels of which are linked to breast cancer.\nThis could explain the link between red meat and breast cancer. The amount of PhIP in fish varies widely according to the type of fish and method of cooking; one study reported high levels in grilled salmon. In fact, a recent report from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine showed that the five foods containing the highest levels included: chicken breasts, steak, pork, salmon and hamburgers.\nThe damaging effect of HCAs can be reduced by foods containing antioxidants, such as vegetables and soya foods. However, the safest option is to avoid meat and fish altogether. Healthier options for grilling and frying include soya burgers, veggie sausages and Portabella mushrooms.\nFarmed and dangerous\nUnless you specifically buy wild fish, the chances are the fish you eat are raised on a fish farm and there are important nutritional differences between farmed and wild fish.\nFarmed fish are likely to contain more fat than their wild cousins, but less omega-3s. Wild salmon can eat 10 times their body weight of smaller fish. To feed that amount of fish to farmed salmon is uneconomical, so much cheaper, manufactured pellets of soya, rapeseed or corn are used, combined with animal by-products, vitamins and minerals as well as wildcaught fish. Commercial fish feed may consist of just 35 per cent fish or less.\nOrganic fish feeds are made from the discarded filleting waste (blood, guts, tails and heads) of fish and shellfish caught for human consumption. As fish stocks are so low, the Soil Association are considering permitting up to 25 per cent oil seed in fish meal.\nThe outcome of using plant foods in fish meal is that the level of omega-6 fats in farmed fish has increased. Tilapia, the fish most in demand worldwide, has some of the highest levels of omega-6 in our food supply. This is not healthy!\nFarmed fish can also contain pesticide residues and dangerous levels of POPs such as PCBs. A study of toxins in salmon feed, farmed salmon and wild salmon found that farmed salmon had consistently higher levels of contaminants, including PCBs. Other studies have confirmed this, meaning considerable health risks for those who regularly eat farmed salmon.\nThis is a crazy situation and there is no longer any convincing argument in favour of eating fish.\nFish oil supplements\nSome people choose fish oil supplements in preference to eating oily fish. The news here is not good either \u2013 particularly worrying as intense marketing by producers boasts of meticulous manufacturing techniques and reassurances that all toxins have been removed.\nIn March 2006, the Food Standards Agency announced that supplement manufacturer Seven Seas Limited was withdrawing some batches of fish oil supplements because of high levels of pollutants. Less than a month later, Boots also withdrew fish oil capsules for the same reason. In both cases they claimed there were no health risks yet the levels of dioxins exceeded statutory limits. A bizarre statement which seems to say that a little bit of poison is okay!\nThe official position \u2013 not budging\nThe risk of toxins in fish prompted the government to commission a report on the benefits and risks of fish consumption. The report from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment was published in 2004.\nIt led to the advice that pregnant and breastfeeding women should limit their consumption of oily fish to one or two 140 gram portions a week. They, along with children under 16, should also avoid shark, marlin and swordfish entirely and limit the amount of tuna they eat. Men, boys and women past childbearing age or who are not intending to have children, can eat up to four portions of oily fish a week before possible risks outweigh the benefits, they claimed.\nThe report highlighted dioxins in herring, salmon, mackerel and, to a lesser degree, trout and voiced concerns about other pollutants such as brominated flame retardants. The Food Standards Agency insists that occasionally eating more oily fish than they recommend will not be harmful.\nThe risks from chemicals such as dioxins are not immediate but develop over time as they accumulate in the body and no-one knows what the long-term effects will be. Surely it must be better to avoid these hazardous chemicals entirely? This guide\u2019s recipe section will enable you to do just that!\nConfused? You will be!\nOfficial advice to eat oily fish to help the development of unborn and breastfeeding infants is contradicted by advice to limit fish eating for fear of damaging both these vulnerable groups. So just when your intake of omega-3 really matters \u2013 during pregnancy and breastfeeding \u2013 the government warns you to limit your intake! No wonder people are confused!\nIn 2002, Which? magazine reported on a Consumers\u2019 Association survey which found that only a sixth of fish eaters knew that the official advice is to eat oily fish once a week; over half thought the advice was to eat two or more portions but a staggering 61 per cent had no idea that oily fish is likely to contain toxins. One per cent knew that pregnant women should avoid certain fish but nobody could name them.\nMost people were even confused by what was meant by oily fish \u2013 14 per cent thought that cod was an oily fish \u2013 it isn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s no clearer in the US. In 2002, the American Heart Association recommended at least two servings of fish, particularly oily fish, per week. It also warned that this needed to be balanced with concerns over mercury and PCBs. How on earth are people supposed to do that? It is either safe or it isn\u2019t, and such cautions seriously challenge the idea that fish is \u2018healthy\u2019. Who should the public listen to?\nFish failing\nDespite the constant promotion of fish, the British public just doesn\u2019t buy it! On average, people eat only a third of a portion of oily fish a week and seven out of ten people eat none at all. Clearly, oily fish is not a significant contributor of omega-3 fatty acids in the diets of most people.\nEncouraging people to eat oily fish is not working as a public health measure and if it did work it would be an environmental disaster as the oceans simply cannot cope with the current, let alone increased, demand. And farmed fish are not the solution.\nThe upshot of all this is that many people fail to understand the importance of omega-3s and don\u2019t realise how easy it is to obtain them from everyday plant foods. The government is doing us a great disservice by not promoting alternative, plant-based sources. We can only guess that they see the protection of the fishing industry as more important than public health.\nPromoting oily fish as the only route to heart health could actively deter people from making the fundamental dietary changes necessary to improve their health. A better and simpler solution would be to recommend a plant-based diet containing EFA-rich seeds, nuts and oils. Plants, not fish, are the way forward for good health.\nThe way to good health\nThe good news is you don\u2019t have to eat neurotoxins and carcinogens (cancer causing agents) to get your omega-3 fatty acids \u2013 there are perfectly safe plant sources (see page 9). But there\u2019s much more to plant foods than that.\nFree radicals are unstable molecules generated by normal bodily functions and such things as cigarette smoke, pollution, ultraviolet light and stress. They are linked to cancer and other diseases as well as the aging process.\nAntioxidants such as vitamins A, C and E are the body\u2019s main defence against free radicals and are found in abundance in plant foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Antioxidants in plants also protect EFAs against deterioration, which is another reason why plant sources are superior to fish EFAs.\nMost people know that certain fats are more likely to \u2018go off\u2019 when exposed to air and fish oils are one of these, giving off a characteristic \u2018fishy\u2019 smell as they oxidise. Antioxidants help slow this decaying process by acting as a fall guy, taking the damaging oxygen hit rather than the fat. Plant sources of EFAs such as nuts and seeds possess their own antioxidants (in particular vitamin E) which give this protection. Yet another reason in favour of plant oils.\nThe three amigos of the antioxidant world are beta-carotene (vitamin A), vitamin C and vitamin E \u2013 plus the mineral selenium. Neither meat nor fish are good sources, the best being plant foods \u2013 fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds.\nIn the largest and most comprehensive analysis to date on the antioxidant content of foods, cranberries, blueberries and blackberries ranked highest amongst fruits. Beans, artichokes and russet potatoes topped the list of vegetables. Pecans, walnuts and hazelnuts were the top nuts and ground cloves, cinnamon and oregano ranked highest among the herbs and spices. As a general rule, brightly-coloured vegetables such as sweet potatoes, red cabbage and tomatoes are high in antioxidants.\nFeeling better \u2013 naturally\nBy Juliet Gellatley, nutritional therapist, founder and director of VVF and Viva! Over the years I have supported many clients with many conditions and the power of a healthy diet never ceases to amaze me! Here are just three examples of many success stories where people have been helped without fish oils for conditions where they are traditionally used.\nSean. Age: 5. Condition: eczema\nSean\u2019s condition had suddenly worsened, with the whole of his side covered in sore, red skin. Topical steroids are popular in cases such as this but I advised natural products and a change in diet. The first thing to go was dairy, which is a well-known eczema trigger. I then helped his mum to improve his diet by introducing rich sources of omega-3s \u2013 flaxseed and hempseed oil \u2013 by mixing them into his main meal after cooking and from ground flaxseeds sprinkled onto breakfast cereal. This was also changed, from high-sugar to wholegrain varieties and porridge made with soya milk, to which were added mixed fresh or frozen berries every day.\nTo boost his antioxidant intake, I persuaded his mum to buy a juicer so he could have a mix of fresh fruits every morning, something which became part of his (and her!) routine. Foods rich in nutrients to help the skin heal and ensure bowel health were given.\nThe eczema dampened down quickly but returned if the changes were not stuck to. It took about four months but Sean\u2019s skin has now returned to being normal and healthy.\nJohn. Age: 62. Condition: osteoarthritis\nInflammation is central to this condition and so I advised John to remove the inflammatory foods from his diet \u2013 particularly sugar (including alcohol!) and dairy. I advised an anti-inflammatory vegan diet rich in the antioxidants vitamins C and E (which protect and enhance cartilage formation), complex carbohydrates, fibre, vegetable proteins and omega-3 oils.\nA helping hand came from a plant supplement which specifically helps reduce inflammation in joints and promotes healing. Levels of omega-3 DHA and EPA were topped up with an algal supplement.\nIn John\u2019s words the results were \u2018amazing\u2019. His long-established and worsening condition improved 100 per cent in his knees and elbows and by about 60 per cent in his shoulders. No fish oils or shark cartilage were used!\nAndrew. Age: 66. Condition: coronary heart disease\nAndrew had a heart attack a year before seeing me. Despite wanting to help himself become healthy rather than rely solely on drugs, he had received little information on diet. Blood pressure and cholesterol levels were high and so I advised an anti-inflammatory diet as inflammation plays a big role in clogging arteries.\nDiet can reduce inflammation, which is why people are advised, wrongly in my opinion, to opt for fish oils. I advised Andrew to cut his saturated fat intake and he immediately stopped eating meat and then gradually removed all dairy from his diet. He boosted omega-3s by taking flaxseed oil and ground seeds daily, as well as green leafy veg, and ate walnuts regularly. All these foods help reduce inflammation and clogging of arteries as well as helping to \u2018thin\u2019 the blood.\nTo help lower his blood pressure, Andrew included much more fibre from brown rice, wholemeal bread and wholemeal pasta in his diet, and by sprinkling rice bran on soups and sauces he also helped to lower his cholesterol. His fresh fruit and veg intake increased to about eight portions a day and again I advised him to invest in a juicer.\nTogether, we devised an exercise programme that suited him and during the course of a year, his cholesterol came down by a third and his blood pressure returned to a normal 120/80.\nWith nutritional therapy, long interviews are conducted with patients and treatment plans are tailored specifically for them. In these brief reports, only some major elements of the treatment are included.\nSustainability\nThe promotion of the supposed health benefits of fish, combined with dwindling wild supplies, have spawned a dramatic expansion in aquaculture (farmed fish), increasing at an annual rate of 9.2 per cent.\nNearly half the fish consumed worldwide as food (43 per cent) are now raised on fish farms. In 1980 it was just nine per cent. Wildcaught fish have reached a peak at around 90-93 million tonnes annually, despite increasing demand due to a growing world population and there are no prospects of an increase in catches, according to the UN FAO. If fact, it\u2019s all downhill from here on!\nIf people maintain their eating habits, an additional 40 million tonnes of food from the sea would be required by 2030 just to support current levels of consumption. This is clearly unsustainable and we have to look for alternatives \u2013 but fish farming is not the answer. Its demands on wild-caught fish as food and the spread of disease, sea lice and pollution are unacceptable and environmentally irresponsible.\nJust as in other forms of factory farming, chemicals and antibiotics are widely used in fish farming and are just as harmful to human health. A chemical used to kill sea lice has been linked to testicular cancer, for example, and antibiotic resistant superbugs owe their appearance largely to factory farming.\nIn the wild, fish have become infected with deadly sea lice and other diseases caught from fish that have escaped from fish farms. There is even evidence of genetic pollution in wild salmon \u2013 factory-farmed fish breeding with wild fish and reducing their ability to survive. Couple this to the terrifying, automated scoop-it-all-up nets that catch everything in their path \u2013 and then throw back up to a quarter of the catch dead \u2013 and the pressure on the oceans is extreme and is unsustainable. The better and more sensible \u2013 in fact the only answer \u2013 is to obtain our omega-3 fats from sustainable plant sources.\n(For more information on the environmental impact of fishing see Viva!\u2019s guide End of the Line).\nRecommendations\nA well-balanced, plant-based diet containing green leafy vegetables, wholegrain foods, pulses, nuts and seeds will provide all the plant omega-3 ALA you need. One of the best sources is flaxseed oil, containing 57 per cent ALA and 16 per cent LA, with an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 0.28:1. A 14 gram tablespoonful of flaxseed oil provides eight grams of ALA.\nFlaxseed oil must be kept in the fridge and can be added to dressings, sauces, dips or cooked food but cooking with it will destroy its properties. It\u2019s always best to buy and store nuts, seeds and their oils in small quantities to ensure that they\u2019re as fresh as possible and have little time to degrade.\nIt is difficult to say exactly how much of a certain food should be eaten to obtain your EFAs but a sensible approach is to limit how much omega-6 rich vegetable oil you use, switch to olive oil for cooking and increase your omega-3 intake from the sources we\u2019ve listed. Spurn saturated and trans fats as much as possible, which means cutting down on animal and processed foods, because you are much better off without them.\nTo improve the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA follow these simple guidelines:\no\nEat a range of wholefoods everyday \u2013 variety is the spice of life!\no\nObtain most fat from wholefoods - nuts, seeds, wholegrains, olives, avocados and soya\no\nChoose olive oil for cooking n Use sunflower, corn and safflower oil sparingly\no\nUse flaxseed oil for salad dressings and dips, keep it in the fridge and don\u2019t cook with it\no\nCut down on cholesterol by avoiding eggs, meat, fish and dairy products\no\nAvoid processed foods, trans fats from margarines and hydrogenated vegetable oils\no\nConclusion\nNo shortcuts, no magic bullet...\nFish is not a health food. It\u2019s not a magical wonder food that can guarantee good heart health and turn all kids into geniuses. The real problem is a lack of good fats because of the appalling state of most people\u2019s diets. Fish is not a popular food and most people never eat it. We have to stop looking for a \u2018quick fix\u2019 miracle and focus on the bigger picture\u2026 improving our diets by cutting out the foods laden with animal fats, sugar, salt and cholesterol and eating more fruit, vegetables, pulses, wholegrains, nuts and seeds. It really is that simple.\nFish are a source of protective EFAs but they are not the only one nor are they the healthiest. They contain saturated fat, are loaded with toxic pollutants known to damage health and no-one knows what the long-term result will be of constant exposure to low levels of these highly-toxic chemicals. It could well be described as a game of Russian roulette. When you take a mouthful of fish you are also eating neurotoxins and carcinogens, including mercury, PCBs and dioxins and contributing to the destruction of the world\u2019s oceans.\nThere is an alternative. ALA from plants protects your heart and doesn\u2019t come laced with poison. If you want belt and braces, take an algal supplement.\nWell-balanced vegetarian and vegan diets, containing EFA-rich foods, not only help combat heart disease but also protect against many other degenerative diseases. The big question is \u2013 why have the tremendous advantages of a plant-based diet in providing ALA and reducing the risk from almost all degenerative diseases been virtually ignored by health professionals?\nOur hearts don\u2019t need fish, our brains don\u2019t need fish and our health is far better served by plant EFAs. In short \u2013 fish is not a health food.\nFish-free recipes\nIntroduction So what do you eat instead for a bit of ocean-style nutrition and flavour? Well, the VVF has created some fish-friendly alternatives to favourites old and new. While nothing tastes identical to fish, sea vegetables have a definite sea-tang and are very tasty! Such foods may be unfamiliar to you but were eaten regularly by UK coastal-dwellers until quite recently and are still consumed in huge quantities throughout the rest of the world \u2013 Japan and China in particular.\nSea vegetables are the true \u2018fruits de mer\u2019 or fruits of the sea, not shellfish. Not only do they add flavour to food, each variety is a nutritional powerhouse, crammed with vitamins and minerals in an easily digestible format. Indeed, they are one of the main components of the Okinawan diet, responsible for more healthy nonagenarians and centenarians than anywhere else in the world. Go sea veggies!\nFor those of you who want a quick and convenient alternative to fish there are products on the market that are similar but vegan \u2013 they contain no fish or any other animal product (eg Redwoods Vegetarian Fish Style Fingers and Fillets). You can keep these in the fridge for those evenings when you\u2019re late home and just want a really quick supper.

This myth reached epic proportions in the 1960s. A UN report recognised there was worldwide protein deficiency and called for a \u201cglobal strategy to avert the impending protein crisis\u201d. International aid focused on the so-called \u2018protein gap\u2019 and the USA subsidised dried milk powder to provide protein for the world\u2019s poor.\nNext came a report on diet and heart disease in 1976 by the Royal College of Physicians which encouraged people to eat white meat rather than red meat on the grounds that it contained less saturated fat and was therefore less damaging to health.\nSpeed up history to the present day and the shift in nutritional knowledge is astounding. We now know that the average Brit gets far too much protein \u2013 it makes up 15 per cent of the daily calorie intake when the maximum needed, according to leading health bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), is only eight per cent.\nMost foods can provide us with this eight per cent, the exceptions being fruits (only about five per cent of their energy comes from protein) and most sweets and junk foods. The WHO\u2019s estimate includes a large safety margin so most people\u2019s real needs are even lower than eight per cent.\nIn truth, the protein gap had disappeared \u2018at the stroke of a pen\u2019 in 1969 when researchers concluded that almost all staple foods contain enough protein for our needs.\nGood nutritionists know that by not eating meat \u2013 or dairy, for that matter \u2013 you can obtain plenty of protein, including all the amino acids you need. Get enough calories and you get enough protein!\n[top]\nProtein Quality\nProtein plays an important role in the body, forming the basis of muscles, hair, nails and collagen \u2013 the connective tissue that holds the body together. It also plays a part in regulating the body, causing heart muscle to contract and the body to digest food and is what makes DNA.\nTo make protein, plants combine sugars, which they make from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water, with nitrogen from the air or soil. The end products are protein building blocks called amino acids (\u2018amino\u2019 simply means nitrogencontaining). There are 20 or so different amino acids in the body, of which it can make about 11 solely from carbohydrate, fat and nitrogen.\nAbout nine of these amino acids are called \u2018essential amino acids\u2019 and these must come from the diet as the body can\u2019t make them. Animal and soya products are sometimes called \u2018complete\u2019 proteins as they contain plenty of all of the essential amino acids. Many other plant proteins have relatively low quantities of one or more of the essential amino acids \u2013 the socalled \u2018limiting\u2019 amino acid. Pulses such as peas, beans and lentils are a major exception to this general rule and contain good amounts of high-quality protein. Nuts and seeds are rich protein sources, too.\nalmost all staple foods contain enough protein for our needs\nThere is a persistent myth that vegetarians need to be well educated in order to know which protein foods to choose to make up for the amino acid deficiencies that one food or the other may contain. Research doesn\u2019t support this view and is clear that both vegetarians and omnivores get enough protein, including plenty of the amino acids they need, as long as they are getting enough calories. In fact, almost all foods contain protein.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to eat enough protein if you\u2019re a vegetarian and especially so if you choose foods from two or more of these three groups in a given day: wholegrains; pulses; nuts and seeds.\nSays Dr Linda Bacon, nutrition lecturer at City College of San Francisco: \u201cPlant products will typically do a better job of meeting your protein needs than animal products, both because they are less concentrated sources of protein, making protein over-consumption less likely, and because they are more likely to be bundled with other great nutrients such as fibre, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and healthy fats.\u201d\n[top]\nProtein Over-consumption\u2013 the Hazards\nIronically, excess protein is one of today\u2019s big concerns, being linked to kidney disease, osteoporosis, cancers, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Excesses are usually a result of eating too many animal products. Even lean-looking white meats are associated with large amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol \u2013 artery-clogging substances that are a main cause of heart disease, kidney failure and stroke as well as many cancers.\nPutting these hidden nasties aside, there is strong evidence to suggest that it is excess protein per se which plays a part in all these diseases. There is a compelling case that animal protein alone \u2013 ignoring all the other damaging substances that come with it \u2013 increases the risk for cancer, clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), crumbly bones (osteoporosis) and type 2 diabetes. Powerful evidence came from the China Study, one of the largest and most comprehensive studies ever undertaken to examine the links between diet and disease in people. Big differences in disease rates were seen when the amount of animal-based foods people ate were compared with plant foods.\nThe average Westerner gets well in excess of their protein needs. British men eat on average 88.2 grams a day, and women 63.7 grams \u2013 both getting around double (15 per cent) the WHO\u2019s recommendation of eight per cent of calorie intake from protein. The WHO suggests that protein deficiency is highly improbable in industrialised countries.\nWorryingly, an average portion of chicken or turkey meat weighing 100g (3.5oz) provides roughly half a woman\u2019s daily protein requirement and almost half a man\u2019s!\n[top]\nWhite Meat \u2013 the Low-Fat Choice?\nWhite meat is seen as, and often promoted by producers as being, a low-fat, healthy food. It isn\u2019t even close to being so. Chicken and all meats are muscles, which are made of protein and fat.\nAverage raw chicken meat is 17.5 per cent fat, rising to 38.1 per cent when roasted. Raw turkey is 13.7 per cent fat in terms of calories. Nearly half of the calories in roast duck come from fat \u2013 and that\u2019s only when the skin and excess fat are discarded. Without that, 80 per cent of calories come from fat! Roast goose is not far behind at 63 per cent of calories. This compares with one per cent fat in a baked potato and four per cent in baked beans.\nIn fact, meat and meat products, including chicken and turkey in all their guises, are the leading source of fat in our diet, including the equally unhealthy trans fats. Not only are we eating meat in unprecedented amounts (see Figure 1) but modern farming methods have ensured that its fat content has doubled.\nProfessor Michael Crawford of London Metropolitan University found that chicken contains as much fat, gram for gram, as a Big Mac. He analysed chicken thigh meat from several supermarkets \u2013 even organic suppliers \u2013 and found they contain more than twice as much fat as they did back in 1940, a third more calories and a third less protein. Someone eating a 100 gram portion of chicken would get 207 calories from fat and only 64 from protein \u2013 and this wasn\u2019t the breadcrumbed type which is even higher in fat.\nA medium-sized chicken contains almost a pint of fat\nEven organic chickens didn\u2019t do much better \u2013 154 kilocalories from fat and 74 from protein. This is probably because, despite having more space than factory-farmed chickens, organic birds are on the same regime of high-energy feed, little exercise and being bred for rapid weight gain.\nSays Professor Crawford: \u201cThis focus on rapid growth has changed the lipid [fat] composition of the chicken meat itself, and you cannot escape that \u2013 even by removing the skin and scraping away the subcutaneous fat stuck to the meat.\u201d\nThe team also found that a medium-sized chicken contains almost a pint of fat!\nResearchers at the American Cancer Society followed more than 75,000 people for a decade to find out what is was that caused their weight loss and weight gain. High meat consumption was the food most responsible for their putting on weight. Both men and women who had more than a single serving of meat a day showed a 50 per cent increase in \u2018abdominal obesity\u2019 \u2013 they put on the pounds around their middles.\nFrom the 1980s onwards, it became common for butchers and processors to trim from meat any visible fat as part of the demand for leaner meat. It didn\u2019t have much effect as people\u2019s fat intake from meat has dropped by a mere five per cent since 1983!\n[top]\nWhite Meat \u2013 a Superfood?\nAmazingly, turkey is listed as a superfood in Dr Steven Pratt\u2019s book, Superfoods: 14 Foods That Will Change Your Life. Turkey makes the top 14, along with tomatoes, broccoli, beans, blueberries, tea, oats, pumpkin, yoghurt, walnuts, spinach, salmon, soya and oranges.\nDr Pratt favours turkey because it is the \u2018leanest meat source of protein\u2019. However, this position has more qualifications than a university. Readers are advised to eat skinless breast meat only (no more than three to four servings a week), don\u2019t buy self-basting birds as they may contain damaging \u2018partially hydrogenated oils\u2019 and only eat ground turkey (minced) that\u2019s labelled 99 per cent fat free!\nEven those who have the discipline to stick to the 3-4 ounce portion limit \u2013 about the size of a pack of cards \u2013 will be ingesting 100 milligrams of cholesterol with each portion \u2013 the same as beef \u2013 along with a scattering of harmful trans fatty acids.\nCholesterol from white meat does just as good a job at clogging arteries and causing heart disease as any other cholesterol (see The Effect of White Meat on Cholesterol, page 11). The human body produces cholesterol on its own and never needs outside sources. All plant foods are cholesterol-free!\nWhile metaphorically patting turkey protein on the back with one hand, Dr Pratt assassinates it with the other, cautioning against too much animal protein. Excess can lead to a loss of calcium and an increased risk of osteoporosis, kidney damage, raised blood cholesterol levels, heart disease and increased production of the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) \u2013 which is thought to boost the growth of cancer cells (see Protein Over-consumption \u2013 the Hazards, page 6).\nWhat\u2019s enough? A meagre 45 to 55.5 grams a day and you don\u2019t need to eat any meat or dairy to achieve it, there\u2019s plenty in plant foods.\nDespite these hazards, Dr Pratt\u2019s support for white meat is based on it containing some vitamins and minerals such as niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, iron, selenium and zinc. But it certainly has no monopoly on them. Mixed nuts, cereal grains, yeast extracts, vegetables and fruits are all useful sources of these nutrients but without the potential for harmful side effects. It\u2019s even been shown that B12 in fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals, is more easily absorbed than B12 in meat, poultry and fish \u2013 particularly for the elderly. This is why the National Academy of Sciences in the USA advises adults aged 50 and over to obtain most of their B12 from fortified foods. It\u2019s pretty good advice for younger adults as well.\nAll plant foods are cholesterol-free\nThis begs the question: what is missing from white meat? It has no fibre, complex carbohydrates or vitamin C. Fibre cleanses the digestive tract, keeping bowels healthy and regular, slows the absorption of sugar and fat, carries away excess hormones from the blood and lowers cholesterol.\nComplex carbohydrates, found only in plants, are relatively low in calories and boost metabolism. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is involved in immunity, wound healing and the formation of collagen in skin, tendons and bones. When white meat takes the place of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and pulses you get less vitamins, less fibre, and unwanted dietary fat and cholesterol.\n[top]\nWhite Meat- Essential for Growing Children?\nThere is a persistent myth that meat is essential for growing children \u2013 perhaps more so than for adults. In reality, children of all ages can thrive on a lower concentration of protein in their diets than adults!\nOne of the main causes of death in children in developing countries is from something called protein-energy malnutrition. It usually develops in those who get too little protein and energy \u2013 and these deficiencies tend to go hand-in-hand. Diets that contain enough energy (calories) typically contain plenty of protein (see Origins of the Protein Gap, page 4).\nThe real problem is usually quantity rather than quality. Wartime studies in the UK found that orphanage children grew faster than the general population when they ate a bread-based diet with only a small fraction (14 per cent) of their protein coming from milk products. These children grew no faster when nearly half their protein was from milk! Bread provided the children with plenty of energy to support their growth, whilst meeting more than double their protein needs.\n[top]\nHigh-Protein Diets for Weight Loss\nProtein is the most filling nutrient of all which is why highprotein diets such as Atkins came into being. But there\u2019s no absolute proof that it\u2019s protein per se that\u2019s responsible for weight loss on these diets \u2013 monotony and boredom from the tight restrictions on what you can eat and \u2018ketosis\u2019 may play a part.\nKetosis happens when the body is short of glucose, the fuel needed to power the breakdown of body fat. Lacking glucose, the liver releases acidic substances (ketones) into the blood, much as happens in type 2 diabetes. But studies have shown that ketosis is unrelated to weight loss. In other words, low-carb diets do not trigger weight loss any more effectively than low-fat, vegetarian diets do.\nWhile a few studies show that high protein, lowcarbohydrate diets do produce some weight loss early on, the long-term health consequences can be very serious.\nMost of these diets contain less than 10 per cent carbohydrates, 25 to 35 per cent protein and 55 to 65 per cent fat. Protein comes mostly from meat, meat products and dairy, which are high in unhealthy saturated fat and cholesterol. As they contain so much more fat than protein, a better name would be \u2018high-fat\u2019 diets.\nOver 400 people who followed one of these diets listed their health problems using an online registry.They included constipation, loss of energy, bad breath, difficulty concentrating, kidney and heart problems, including heart attack, bypass surgery, irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) and raised cholesterol.\nOf course, plants also contain protein but plants rich in vegetable protein are low in the harmful saturated fat that increases the risk of heart problems. Good protein sources include pulses such as baked beans, peas, lentils and soya products, grains, nuts and seeds.They have the added bonus of being rich in fibre and eating two to three servings of these foods each day is recommended.\nA low-fat veggie diet is a successful aid to weight loss.

They arise during the cooking of many meats, including chicken, beef, pork and even fish. In January 2005, they were officially added to the USA federal government\u2019s list of known carcinogens.\nHCAs form when sugars, creatine \u2013 a chemical found mostly in muscle \u2013 and amino acids are heated during cooking. These are all naturally present in meats. Some of the highest concentrations are in grilled meat \u2013 especially chicken \u2013 which contains more than 10 times the amount in grilled beef. Frying can also produce large amounts of HCAs.\nAs creatine is found mostly in muscle tissue, grilled plant foods such as veggie burgers, veggie sausages or portabello mushrooms tend to contain either no HCAs or negligible levels.\nHCAs can bind directly to human DNA, causing mutation and initiating cancer. One common HCA, called PhIP, has been shown to damage DNA even at the low concentrations found in home cooking. Alarmingly, the pan scrapings often used for gravy contain up to 500 parts per billion of PhIP \u2013 hundreds of times higher than the concentration in meat!\nAccording to Dr Michael Greger, GP, author and a founding member of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine: \u201cThere does not seem to be a way to cook meat to an internal temperature necessary to kill off [food poisoning] bacteria without producing at least some carcinogenic compounds. And even low doses have been shown to cause human DNA mutations which could lead to cancer.\u201d\n[top]\nThe Effect of White Meat on Cholesterol\nCholesterol is a type of lipid (fat) called a sterol made by the liver and present in every cell in an animal\u2019s body, including human animals. It is found only in foods of animal origin \u2013 white meat, fish, eggs, and every other meat and dairy product. Foods from plants \u2013 all types of fruits and vegetables, pulses, wholegrains, nuts and seeds \u2013 are cholesterol-free.\nOur livers make all the cholesterol we need \u2013 approximately 1,000 milligrams per day \u2013 and it is used in the manufacture of hormones and cell membranes and in other parts of the body. It follows that we have no need for cholesterol in our diet at all.\nCholesterol can\u2019t be avoided by choosing lean cuts of meat as it\u2019s mainly found in the lean parts. Neither is white meat lower in cholesterol than red meat as chicken contains as much cholesterol as beef. One small, grilled, skinless chicken breast contains around 100 milligrams of cholesterol \u2013 an amount that can add roughly 0.13 mmol/L (or 5 mg/dL) to your cholesterol level!\nAnimal products also contain saturated fat which causes our livers to manufacture even more cholesterol. Unsaturated fats don\u2019t have this effect.\nDespite a welter of evidence that a vegetarian diet is the best way to avoid high cholesterol levels and the diseases which go with them, official advice, amazingly, is not to go vegetarian.\nBut to switch to a lower fat diet \u2013 avoiding fatty cuts of red meat, eating white meat and fish and ditching butter for margarine.\nDr Neal Barnard, president and founder of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, states that: \u201c\u2026chicken-and-fish diets are not low enough in fat or cholesterol to do what vegetarian diets can\u2026 The leanest beef is about 28 per cent fat as a percentage of calories. The leanest chicken is not much different, at about 23 per cent fat.\nFish vary but all have cholesterol and more fat than is found in typical beans, vegetables, grains, and fruits, virtually all of which are well under 10 per cent fat.\n\u201cSo, while white-meat diets lower cholesterol levels by only about five per cent, meatless diets have three to four times more cholesterol-lowering power, allowing the arteries to the heart to reopen.\u201d\n[top]\nThe Acidifying Effects of White Meat\nWhen certain foods are digested, acids are released into the blood. The body attempts to neutralise this acidity by drawing calcium from the bones. This calcium is then excreted in the urine (the calciuric response).\nThe sulphur in high-protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy products is metabolised into sulphuric acid which can cause this acidifying process. Meat and eggs contain more sulphurcontaining amino acids than plant foods \u2013 up to five times more. As the sulphur content of the diet increases, so does the level of calcium in the urine. Research suggests that animal protein increases the risk of uric acid stones.\nThe calciuric response may also be a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. The traditional Inuit (or Eskimo) diet is made up almost entirely of animal protein. Inuits have one of the highest calcium intakes in the world, hitting as much as 2,500 milligrams per day depending on whether they eat whole fish, including the bones, or not. They also have a high rate of osteoporosis; even higher than white Americans.\nHow much protein and its type can affect bone-mineral loss in post-menopausal women. The first real evidence came from Andrews University in the USA in a survey of 1,600 women, where meat eaters (omnivores) experienced almost double the bone loss of vegetarian women.\nIt\u2019s estimated that people\u2019s consumption of acid-producing protein has increased by 50 per cent over the past 40 years and this includes chicken and turkey which are both acidforming foods. Over time, high-protein diets \u2013 especially meat- and cheese-based diets \u2013 lead to a decrease in bone density.\nThe good news is that vegetarian diets based on protein from pulses, cereals and other plant foods produce much less acid than mixed meat and vegetable diets \u2013 even when the total protein content of the diets are the same. Plant-based diets often produce no unwanted acid or alkaline residues.\nIn her book, The Chemistry of Success, Dr Susan Lark links an acidic diet to a range of inflammatory conditions:\n\u201cAs we age, our ability to maintain a slightly alkaline balance in our cells and tissues diminishes\u2026 Maintaining the cells and tissues of the body in their healthy, slightly alkaline state helps to prevent inflammation\u2026 Overacidity promotes the onset of painful and disabling inflammatory conditions as diverse as\u2026 rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial cystitis.\u201d\nIngredients and Stockists\nPraise Seitan!\nFake meats made from wheat gluten have been used in the Orient for hundreds of years at least, partly because the Buddhist tradition used meat substitutes to cater for vegetarian monks.\nGluten is a fairly pure, minimally processed food. It\u2019s also a good source of protein, relatively low in fat and cholesterol-free. Seitan (pronounced \u2018say-tan\u2019) is another name for gluten and is available in jars from health stores, such as Yakso or Vegetalia brands, both organic. Vegetarian chicken and duck (gluten) are available in tins from Chinese or similar supermarkets at less than half the price, but aren\u2019t organic. Companion and Mong Lee Shang are the most common brands. They may have a Chinese name but will also be labelled as \u2018vegetarian mock chicken\u2019 or \u2018vegetarian duck\u2019 or \u2018gluten\u2019. As you\u2019ll see in the recipes which follow, gluten is an excellent white meat replacement in just about everything.\nChunky No-Chick\nTVP (textured vegetable protein) is available in chunky pieces. It\u2019s a good, very economical white meat substitute, particularly in curries and stews. TVP is also available in mince form. Both varieties can be found in large supermarkets and health stores. For best results, soak the chunks in very hot vegan stock until softened. Drain and use in the recipe as instructed. The stock can be re-used in soup or other dishes.\nOn the Curds\nTofu (or bean curd). The plain variety is a very pure food which is available from large supermarkets and health stores. Health stores increasingly sell other flavours, too. (Taifun brand is particularly good.) It\u2019s often organic and is very good in stir-fries, salads and other dishes. The ready-made deep-fried pieces (eg Cauldron brand) have a slightly more chewy texture and are usually popular with \u2018tofu virgins\u2019! Plain tofu is bland but absorbs other flavours very well.\nTasty!\nThai Taste green or red curry paste is our current favourite. Not only does it taste very good, but it is also easily available in large branches of Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury, as well as delis and health stores.

For these reasons, the D-Diet is based on whole grains, pulses, vegetables, fruit and nuts and seeds (see the D-Diet nutrition basics, page 22, for more information on plant-based nutrition). Whilst limiting the types of food eaten, this diet does not limit the amount of food consumed. Being high in fibre and digested gradually, the recommended foods make the consumer feel full sooner and for longer, while calorie intake is reduced by the minimal amount of fat it contains (per volume of food eaten).\nIn this section, the basic principles of a diet used for preventing, treating and reversing diabetes are described together with explanations of each of them. The next section (\u2018Why and how it works\u2019 on page 20) then provides a more detailed insight into how this diet influences the body\u2019s processes. Anyone switching to the D-Diet should remain in close touch with their doctor as glucose control and insulin sensitivity can improve relatively quickly and there might be need for medication adjustment \u2013 a decision that needs to be made by a doctor, never by the patient.\n1st principle: no to animal products\nBy eliminating all animal products (meat, fish, dairy, eggs) diabetics avoid eating substantial amounts of fat and their cholesterol intake will be zero. Even lean, white meat and fish contain surprisingly high amounts of fat. For example, 38 per cent of calories from roast chicken and 40 per cent of calories from salmon come from fat (Food Standards Agency, 2002).\nAlthough promoted as a source of omega-3 fats, fish oils also contain cholesterol and a significant proportion of their fat is saturated fat \u2013 between 15 and 30 per cent, depending upon the species (Barnard, 2007). Dairy products, even low-fat varieties, inevitably contain fat and most of it is saturated fat. There is no requirement for saturated fats in our diet.\nReducing fat intake is vital for many reasons \u2013 in order to reduce the amount of intramyocellular lipid (which interferes with muscle cells\u2019 insulin sensitivity), for cardiovascular health and for general weight loss.\nThis diet excludes all animal products also because animal protein from meat, fish, dairy or eggs places an additional strain on the kidneys and can damage them (Knight et al., 2003; Barclay et al., 2010). Plant proteins do not appear to cause the same problem (see pages 16 and 21). Protecting the kidneys is another key issue on the way to better health.\nAll foods should be of plant origin and unrefined wherever possible, which means they will be naturally high in fibre and complex carbohydrates, and low in fat (except oils, nuts and seeds). Animal products contain no fibre or healthy carbohydrates while plant foods contain all the essential nutrients we need.\nIt has been found that avoiding certain foods entirely is easier than attempting to moderate their intake (Trapp et al., 2010). Reducing the intake of problem foods may not have the desired effect and cravings for them may never be lost. Avoiding them entirely, on the other hand, enables the taste to adjust to the new way of eating and problem foods are likely to lose\ntheir appeal.\n2nd principle: low-fat\nEven though vegetable oils are better for the body than animal fats because they contain essential fatty acids, less saturated fat and no cholesterol, it is important to keep them to a minimum. In order to reverse or improve the diabetic condition, it is essential to eliminate intracellular fats (Barnard, 2007) but this can only happen if excessive fat consumption is avoided. By eating low-fat foods, the body is still likely to obtain the essential amount of fat\nit needs, but not more.\nOne of the pilot studies on the effects of a vegan diet showed that there are important differences between types of fat in a low-fat regime (Nicholson et al., 1999). Researchers compared the potential of a lowfat vegan diet with a conventional low-fat diet. Participants were all type 2 diabetics and they followed the assigned diet for 12 weeks. At the end of\nthe study period, the vegan group had 28 per cent reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels (tests carried out after approximately 12 hours without eating). The reduction in the conventional group was significantly lower \u2013 only 12 per cent. The average weight loss was 7.2kg in the vegan group compared to 3.8kg in the conventional group. Medication was\nreduced in all vegan participants, in one of them completely, whilst there were no reductions in medication in the conventional group.\nWhen individuals with impaired glucose tolerance were tested repeatedly for diabetes and their eating habits were examined (Marshall, et al., 1994), it was found that excessive fat consumption significantly increased the risk of developing diabetes. A recent review of studies on bariatric surgery (a surgical procedure reducing the size of the stomach and gut available for nutrient absorption, performed on severely obese people) (Andreelli et al., 2009) revealed a startling result. Type 2 diabetes can be reversed within days of the surgery, even before any\nsignificant weight loss is achieved. The main mechanism for this dramatic change is the sudden decrease of triglycerides and free fatty acids in the blood and rapid reduction of fats in liver and muscle cells. Such drastic changes are obviously not achievable immediately through diet but the effects of this surgery clearly illustrate the efficacy and importance of a low-fat diet.\nThe amount of fat per serving should not exceed three grams (or ten per cent of calories from fat). Apart from added oils, diabetics should also limit their consumption of nuts and seeds.\n3rd principle: low glycemic index (GI)\nGlycemic index, or GI, is a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels. Carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and rapidly release glucose into the blood have a high GI. Carbohydrates that break down more slowly, releasing glucose gradually into the bloodstream, have a low GI.\nTo help the body deal effectively with the carbohydrate content of different foods, those that release their energy slowly should be preferred. Low GI means that after ingestion, blood glucose will not reach high levels, which is exactly what people with diabetes need. It allows them to better control their blood sugar and reduces the likelihood of complications caused by hyperglycaemia, such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy (kidney disease).\nGlycemic index of selected foods (from Glycemic Index Database and The GI Diet Guide)\nClassification\n"}, {"score": 1640.1128, "uuid": "177b15f5-05c4-52a3-b63e-db0a626afae8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-83-18568", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/guides/White-Meat/index.htm", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "Diabetes <em>is</em> less common among <em>vegetarians</em> <em>and</em> <em>vegans</em>, as <em>a</em> 21-year study of 25,000 adults in <em>the</em> USA found.

This myth reached epic proportions in the 1960s. A UN report recognised there was worldwide protein deficiency and called for a \u201cglobal strategy to avert the impending protein crisis\u201d. International aid focused on the so-called \u2018protein gap\u2019 and the USA subsidised dried milk powder to provide protein for the world\u2019s poor.\nNext came a report on diet and heart disease in 1976 by the Royal College of Physicians which encouraged people to eat white meat rather than red meat on the grounds that it contained less saturated fat and was therefore less damaging to health.\nSpeed up history to the present day and the shift in nutritional knowledge is astounding. We now know that the average Brit gets far too much protein \u2013 it makes up 15 per cent of the daily calorie intake when the maximum needed, according to leading health bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), is only eight per cent.\nMost foods can provide us with this eight per cent, the exceptions being fruits (only about five per cent of their energy comes from protein) and most sweets and junk foods. The WHO\u2019s estimate includes a large safety margin so most people\u2019s real needs are even lower than eight per cent.\nIn truth, the protein gap had disappeared \u2018at the stroke of a pen\u2019 in 1969 when researchers concluded that almost all staple foods contain enough protein for our needs.\nGood nutritionists know that by not eating meat \u2013 or dairy, for that matter \u2013 you can obtain plenty of protein, including all the amino acids you need. Get enough calories and you get enough protein!\n[top]\nProtein Quality\nProtein plays an important role in the body, forming the basis of muscles, hair, nails and collagen \u2013 the connective tissue that holds the body together. It also plays a part in regulating the body, causing heart muscle to contract and the body to digest food and is what makes DNA.\nTo make protein, plants combine sugars, which they make from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water, with nitrogen from the air or soil. The end products are protein building blocks called amino acids (\u2018amino\u2019 simply means nitrogencontaining). There are 20 or so different amino acids in the body, of which it can make about 11 solely from carbohydrate, fat and nitrogen.\nAbout nine of these amino acids are called \u2018essential amino acids\u2019 and these must come from the diet as the body can\u2019t make them. Animal and soya products are sometimes called \u2018complete\u2019 proteins as they contain plenty of all of the essential amino acids. Many other plant proteins have relatively low quantities of one or more of the essential amino acids \u2013 the socalled \u2018limiting\u2019 amino acid. Pulses such as peas, beans and lentils are a major exception to this general rule and contain good amounts of high-quality protein. Nuts and seeds are rich protein sources, too.\nalmost all staple foods contain enough protein for our needs\nThere is a persistent myth that vegetarians need to be well educated in order to know which protein foods to choose to make up for the amino acid deficiencies that one food or the other may contain. Research doesn\u2019t support this view and is clear that both vegetarians and omnivores get enough protein, including plenty of the amino acids they need, as long as they are getting enough calories. In fact, almost all foods contain protein.\nIt\u2019s relatively easy to eat enough protein if you\u2019re a vegetarian and especially so if you choose foods from two or more of these three groups in a given day: wholegrains; pulses; nuts and seeds.\nSays Dr Linda Bacon, nutrition lecturer at City College of San Francisco: \u201cPlant products will typically do a better job of meeting your protein needs than animal products, both because they are less concentrated sources of protein, making protein over-consumption less likely, and because they are more likely to be bundled with other great nutrients such as fibre, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and healthy fats.\u201d\n[top]\nProtein Over-consumption\u2013 the Hazards\nIronically, excess protein is one of today\u2019s big concerns, being linked to kidney disease, osteoporosis, cancers, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Excesses are usually a result of eating too many animal products. Even lean-looking white meats are associated with large amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol \u2013 artery-clogging substances that are a main cause of heart disease, kidney failure and stroke as well as many cancers.\nPutting these hidden nasties aside, there is strong evidence to suggest that it is excess protein per se which plays a part in all these diseases. There is a compelling case that animal protein alone \u2013 ignoring all the other damaging substances that come with it \u2013 increases the risk for cancer, clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), crumbly bones (osteoporosis) and type 2 diabetes. Powerful evidence came from the China Study, one of the largest and most comprehensive studies ever undertaken to examine the links between diet and disease in people. Big differences in disease rates were seen when the amount of animal-based foods people ate were compared with plant foods.\nThe average Westerner gets well in excess of their protein needs. British men eat on average 88.2 grams a day, and women 63.7 grams \u2013 both getting around double (15 per cent) the WHO\u2019s recommendation of eight per cent of calorie intake from protein. The WHO suggests that protein deficiency is highly improbable in industrialised countries.\nWorryingly, an average portion of chicken or turkey meat weighing 100g (3.5oz) provides roughly half a woman\u2019s daily protein requirement and almost half a man\u2019s!\n[top]\nWhite Meat \u2013 the Low-Fat Choice?\nWhite meat is seen as, and often promoted by producers as being, a low-fat, healthy food. It isn\u2019t even close to being so. Chicken and all meats are muscles, which are made of protein and fat.\nAverage raw chicken meat is 17.5 per cent fat, rising to 38.1 per cent when roasted. Raw turkey is 13.7 per cent fat in terms of calories. Nearly half of the calories in roast duck come from fat \u2013 and that\u2019s only when the skin and excess fat are discarded. Without that, 80 per cent of calories come from fat! Roast goose is not far behind at 63 per cent of calories. This compares with one per cent fat in a baked potato and four per cent in baked beans.\nIn fact, meat and meat products, including chicken and turkey in all their guises, are the leading source of fat in our diet, including the equally unhealthy trans fats. Not only are we eating meat in unprecedented amounts (see Figure 1) but modern farming methods have ensured that its fat content has doubled.\nProfessor Michael Crawford of London Metropolitan University found that chicken contains as much fat, gram for gram, as a Big Mac. He analysed chicken thigh meat from several supermarkets \u2013 even organic suppliers \u2013 and found they contain more than twice as much fat as they did back in 1940, a third more calories and a third less protein. Someone eating a 100 gram portion of chicken would get 207 calories from fat and only 64 from protein \u2013 and this wasn\u2019t the breadcrumbed type which is even higher in fat.\nA medium-sized chicken contains almost a pint of fat\nEven organic chickens didn\u2019t do much better \u2013 154 kilocalories from fat and 74 from protein. This is probably because, despite having more space than factory-farmed chickens, organic birds are on the same regime of high-energy feed, little exercise and being bred for rapid weight gain.\nSays Professor Crawford: \u201cThis focus on rapid growth has changed the lipid [fat] composition of the chicken meat itself, and you cannot escape that \u2013 even by removing the skin and scraping away the subcutaneous fat stuck to the meat.\u201d\nThe team also found that a medium-sized chicken contains almost a pint of fat!\nResearchers at the American Cancer Society followed more than 75,000 people for a decade to find out what is was that caused their weight loss and weight gain. High meat consumption was the food most responsible for their putting on weight. Both men and women who had more than a single serving of meat a day showed a 50 per cent increase in \u2018abdominal obesity\u2019 \u2013 they put on the pounds around their middles.\nFrom the 1980s onwards, it became common for butchers and processors to trim from meat any visible fat as part of the demand for leaner meat. It didn\u2019t have much effect as people\u2019s fat intake from meat has dropped by a mere five per cent since 1983!\n[top]\nWhite Meat \u2013 a Superfood?\nAmazingly, turkey is listed as a superfood in Dr Steven Pratt\u2019s book, Superfoods: 14 Foods That Will Change Your Life. Turkey makes the top 14, along with tomatoes, broccoli, beans, blueberries, tea, oats, pumpkin, yoghurt, walnuts, spinach, salmon, soya and oranges.\nDr Pratt favours turkey because it is the \u2018leanest meat source of protein\u2019. However, this position has more qualifications than a university. Readers are advised to eat skinless breast meat only (no more than three to four servings a week), don\u2019t buy self-basting birds as they may contain damaging \u2018partially hydrogenated oils\u2019 and only eat ground turkey (minced) that\u2019s labelled 99 per cent fat free!\nEven those who have the discipline to stick to the 3-4 ounce portion limit \u2013 about the size of a pack of cards \u2013 will be ingesting 100 milligrams of cholesterol with each portion \u2013 the same as beef \u2013 along with a scattering of harmful trans fatty acids.\nCholesterol from white meat does just as good a job at clogging arteries and causing heart disease as any other cholesterol (see The Effect of White Meat on Cholesterol, page 11). The human body produces cholesterol on its own and never needs outside sources. All plant foods are cholesterol-free!\nWhile metaphorically patting turkey protein on the back with one hand, Dr Pratt assassinates it with the other, cautioning against too much animal protein. Excess can lead to a loss of calcium and an increased risk of osteoporosis, kidney damage, raised blood cholesterol levels, heart disease and increased production of the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) \u2013 which is thought to boost the growth of cancer cells (see Protein Over-consumption \u2013 the Hazards, page 6).\nWhat\u2019s enough? A meagre 45 to 55.5 grams a day and you don\u2019t need to eat any meat or dairy to achieve it, there\u2019s plenty in plant foods.\nDespite these hazards, Dr Pratt\u2019s support for white meat is based on it containing some vitamins and minerals such as niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, iron, selenium and zinc. But it certainly has no monopoly on them. Mixed nuts, cereal grains, yeast extracts, vegetables and fruits are all useful sources of these nutrients but without the potential for harmful side effects. It\u2019s even been shown that B12 in fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals, is more easily absorbed than B12 in meat, poultry and fish \u2013 particularly for the elderly. This is why the National Academy of Sciences in the USA advises adults aged 50 and over to obtain most of their B12 from fortified foods. It\u2019s pretty good advice for younger adults as well.\nAll plant foods are cholesterol-free\nThis begs the question: what is missing from white meat? It has no fibre, complex carbohydrates or vitamin C. Fibre cleanses the digestive tract, keeping bowels healthy and regular, slows the absorption of sugar and fat, carries away excess hormones from the blood and lowers cholesterol.\nComplex carbohydrates, found only in plants, are relatively low in calories and boost metabolism. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is involved in immunity, wound healing and the formation of collagen in skin, tendons and bones. When white meat takes the place of fruits, vegetables, wholegrains and pulses you get less vitamins, less fibre, and unwanted dietary fat and cholesterol.\n[top]\nWhite Meat- Essential for Growing Children?\nThere is a persistent myth that meat is essential for growing children \u2013 perhaps more so than for adults. In reality, children of all ages can thrive on a lower concentration of protein in their diets than adults!\nOne of the main causes of death in children in developing countries is from something called protein-energy malnutrition. It usually develops in those who get too little protein and energy \u2013 and these deficiencies tend to go hand-in-hand. Diets that contain enough energy (calories) typically contain plenty of protein (see Origins of the Protein Gap, page 4).\nThe real problem is usually quantity rather than quality. Wartime studies in the UK found that orphanage children grew faster than the general population when they ate a bread-based diet with only a small fraction (14 per cent) of their protein coming from milk products. These children grew no faster when nearly half their protein was from milk! Bread provided the children with plenty of energy to support their growth, whilst meeting more than double their protein needs.\n[top]\nHigh-Protein Diets for Weight Loss\nProtein is the most filling nutrient of all which is why highprotein diets such as Atkins came into being. But there\u2019s no absolute proof that it\u2019s protein per se that\u2019s responsible for weight loss on these diets \u2013 monotony and boredom from the tight restrictions on what you can eat and \u2018ketosis\u2019 may play a part.\nKetosis happens when the body is short of glucose, the fuel needed to power the breakdown of body fat. Lacking glucose, the liver releases acidic substances (ketones) into the blood, much as happens in type 2 diabetes. But studies have shown that ketosis is unrelated to weight loss. In other words, low-carb diets do not trigger weight loss any more effectively than low-fat, vegetarian diets do.\nWhile a few studies show that high protein, lowcarbohydrate diets do produce some weight loss early on, the long-term health consequences can be very serious.\nMost of these diets contain less than 10 per cent carbohydrates, 25 to 35 per cent protein and 55 to 65 per cent fat. Protein comes mostly from meat, meat products and dairy, which are high in unhealthy saturated fat and cholesterol. As they contain so much more fat than protein, a better name would be \u2018high-fat\u2019 diets.\nOver 400 people who followed one of these diets listed their health problems using an online registry.They included constipation, loss of energy, bad breath, difficulty concentrating, kidney and heart problems, including heart attack, bypass surgery, irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) and raised cholesterol.\nOf course, plants also contain protein but plants rich in vegetable protein are low in the harmful saturated fat that increases the risk of heart problems. Good protein sources include pulses such as baked beans, peas, lentils and soya products, grains, nuts and seeds.They have the added bonus of being rich in fibre and eating two to three servings of these foods each day is recommended.\nA low-fat veggie diet is a successful aid to weight loss.

They arise during the cooking of many meats, including chicken, beef, pork and even fish. In January 2005, they were officially added to the USA federal government\u2019s list of known carcinogens.\nHCAs form when sugars, creatine \u2013 a chemical found mostly in muscle \u2013 and amino acids are heated during cooking. These are all naturally present in meats. Some of the highest concentrations are in grilled meat \u2013 especially chicken \u2013 which contains more than 10 times the amount in grilled beef. Frying can also produce large amounts of HCAs.\nAs creatine is found mostly in muscle tissue, grilled plant foods such as veggie burgers, veggie sausages or portabello mushrooms tend to contain either no HCAs or negligible levels.\nHCAs can bind directly to human DNA, causing mutation and initiating cancer. One common HCA, called PhIP, has been shown to damage DNA even at the low concentrations found in home cooking. Alarmingly, the pan scrapings often used for gravy contain up to 500 parts per billion of PhIP \u2013 hundreds of times higher than the concentration in meat!\nAccording to Dr Michael Greger, GP, author and a founding member of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine: \u201cThere does not seem to be a way to cook meat to an internal temperature necessary to kill off [food poisoning] bacteria without producing at least some carcinogenic compounds. And even low doses have been shown to cause human DNA mutations which could lead to cancer.\u201d\n[top]\nThe Effect of White Meat on Cholesterol\nCholesterol is a type of lipid (fat) called a sterol made by the liver and present in every cell in an animal\u2019s body, including human animals. It is found only in foods of animal origin \u2013 white meat, fish, eggs, and every other meat and dairy product. Foods from plants \u2013 all types of fruits and vegetables, pulses, wholegrains, nuts and seeds \u2013 are cholesterol-free.\nOur livers make all the cholesterol we need \u2013 approximately 1,000 milligrams per day \u2013 and it is used in the manufacture of hormones and cell membranes and in other parts of the body. It follows that we have no need for cholesterol in our diet at all.\nCholesterol can\u2019t be avoided by choosing lean cuts of meat as it\u2019s mainly found in the lean parts. Neither is white meat lower in cholesterol than red meat as chicken contains as much cholesterol as beef. One small, grilled, skinless chicken breast contains around 100 milligrams of cholesterol \u2013 an amount that can add roughly 0.13 mmol/L (or 5 mg/dL) to your cholesterol level!\nAnimal products also contain saturated fat which causes our livers to manufacture even more cholesterol. Unsaturated fats don\u2019t have this effect.\nDespite a welter of evidence that a vegetarian diet is the best way to avoid high cholesterol levels and the diseases which go with them, official advice, amazingly, is not to go vegetarian.\nBut to switch to a lower fat diet \u2013 avoiding fatty cuts of red meat, eating white meat and fish and ditching butter for margarine.\nDr Neal Barnard, president and founder of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, states that: \u201c\u2026chicken-and-fish diets are not low enough in fat or cholesterol to do what vegetarian diets can\u2026 The leanest beef is about 28 per cent fat as a percentage of calories. The leanest chicken is not much different, at about 23 per cent fat.\nFish vary but all have cholesterol and more fat than is found in typical beans, vegetables, grains, and fruits, virtually all of which are well under 10 per cent fat.\n\u201cSo, while white-meat diets lower cholesterol levels by only about five per cent, meatless diets have three to four times more cholesterol-lowering power, allowing the arteries to the heart to reopen.\u201d\n[top]\nThe Acidifying Effects of White Meat\nWhen certain foods are digested, acids are released into the blood. The body attempts to neutralise this acidity by drawing calcium from the bones. This calcium is then excreted in the urine (the calciuric response).\nThe sulphur in high-protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy products is metabolised into sulphuric acid which can cause this acidifying process. Meat and eggs contain more sulphurcontaining amino acids than plant foods \u2013 up to five times more. As the sulphur content of the diet increases, so does the level of calcium in the urine. Research suggests that animal protein increases the risk of uric acid stones.\nThe calciuric response may also be a risk factor for the development of osteoporosis. The traditional Inuit (or Eskimo) diet is made up almost entirely of animal protein. Inuits have one of the highest calcium intakes in the world, hitting as much as 2,500 milligrams per day depending on whether they eat whole fish, including the bones, or not. They also have a high rate of osteoporosis; even higher than white Americans.\nHow much protein and its type can affect bone-mineral loss in post-menopausal women. The first real evidence came from Andrews University in the USA in a survey of 1,600 women, where meat eaters (omnivores) experienced almost double the bone loss of vegetarian women.\nIt\u2019s estimated that people\u2019s consumption of acid-producing protein has increased by 50 per cent over the past 40 years and this includes chicken and turkey which are both acidforming foods. Over time, high-protein diets \u2013 especially meat- and cheese-based diets \u2013 lead to a decrease in bone density.\nThe good news is that vegetarian diets based on protein from pulses, cereals and other plant foods produce much less acid than mixed meat and vegetable diets \u2013 even when the total protein content of the diets are the same. Plant-based diets often produce no unwanted acid or alkaline residues.\nIn her book, The Chemistry of Success, Dr Susan Lark links an acidic diet to a range of inflammatory conditions:\n\u201cAs we age, our ability to maintain a slightly alkaline balance in our cells and tissues diminishes\u2026 Maintaining the cells and tissues of the body in their healthy, slightly alkaline state helps to prevent inflammation\u2026 Overacidity promotes the onset of painful and disabling inflammatory conditions as diverse as\u2026 rheumatoid arthritis and interstitial cystitis.\u201d\nIngredients and Stockists\nPraise Seitan!\nFake meats made from wheat gluten have been used in the Orient for hundreds of years at least, partly because the Buddhist tradition used meat substitutes to cater for vegetarian monks.\nGluten is a fairly pure, minimally processed food. It\u2019s also a good source of protein, relatively low in fat and cholesterol-free. Seitan (pronounced \u2018say-tan\u2019) is another name for gluten and is available in jars from health stores, such as Yakso or Vegetalia brands, both organic. Vegetarian chicken and duck (gluten) are available in tins from Chinese or similar supermarkets at less than half the price, but aren\u2019t organic. Companion and Mong Lee Shang are the most common brands. They may have a Chinese name but will also be labelled as \u2018vegetarian mock chicken\u2019 or \u2018vegetarian duck\u2019 or \u2018gluten\u2019. As you\u2019ll see in the recipes which follow, gluten is an excellent white meat replacement in just about everything.\nChunky No-Chick\nTVP (textured vegetable protein) is available in chunky pieces. It\u2019s a good, very economical white meat substitute, particularly in curries and stews. TVP is also available in mince form. Both varieties can be found in large supermarkets and health stores. For best results, soak the chunks in very hot vegan stock until softened. Drain and use in the recipe as instructed. The stock can be re-used in soup or other dishes.\nOn the Curds\nTofu (or bean curd). The plain variety is a very pure food which is available from large supermarkets and health stores. Health stores increasingly sell other flavours, too. (Taifun brand is particularly good.) It\u2019s often organic and is very good in stir-fries, salads and other dishes. The ready-made deep-fried pieces (eg Cauldron brand) have a slightly more chewy texture and are usually popular with \u2018tofu virgins\u2019! Plain tofu is bland but absorbs other flavours very well.\nTasty!\nThai Taste green or red curry paste is our current favourite. Not only does it taste very good, but it is also easily available in large branches of Tesco, Waitrose and Sainsbury, as well as delis and health stores. And of course, it\u2019s suitable for vegans and vegetarians \u2013 unlike some Thai products, it doesn\u2019t include fish sauce.\nSaucy\nYou may well have your own fantastic curry sauce recipe \u2013 however, for those busy nights, we\u2019ve recommended Meridian sauces which are all vegan and readily available in free-from sections in large supermarkets or in health stores. We\u2019ve also listed a few other animalfree curry sauces at the end of the recipe, but do check with your local shop/supermarket, as they may have a list including other suitable products.\nRecipes\nLuvverly Lunches\nFood to go: these recipes are not only delicious and healthy, but much cheaper than buying ready-mades at the local sarnie shop!\nCreamy Mock Chicken, Avocado & Tomato Wraps\nServes 4\n"}, {"score": 1616.0898, "uuid": "6c576f54-0df4-58aa-ae58-60e1676e0b15", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-56-12597", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/whitelies/wlreport16.shtml", "page_rank": 1.2193718e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "Infant feeding <em>and</em> components of <em>the</em> metabolic syndrome: findings from <em>the</em> European Youth Heart Study.

Sapon, Ph.D.\nEmeritus Professor of Psycholinguistics, University of Rochester (NY)\nco-founder of the Rochester Area Vegetarian Society, hunger activist.\nPresented at a Plenary Session of the World Vegetarian Congress\nhosted by the North American Society, August, 1996\nThroughout almost 50 years of professional life -- as a scientist, a teacher and a clinician -- I have been deeply concerned with three domains of human experience and their inter-relationships: Language, behavior and ethics. What I have to say this evening conjoins all three fields to focus on something that has informed my life and enriched it with added purpose, understanding, energy and commitment: vegetarianism.\nMy title promises a linguistic and psychological appraisal of the future of the vegetarian movement and how that future relates to \"names\" -- their definition, their use and their effects. We will focus on two words: \"vegetarian\" and \"vegan\" and how they impact on the future of our movement.\nIt is becoming more and more apparent that there is a growing element of tension, with strong emotional overtones, between vegetarians who accept only plant-based foods, and those who reject animal flesh , but accept the use of products derived from living animals. The tension is manifested in a number of ways... some overt, others more subtle.\nKeith Akers and Kate Lawrence, in the newsletter of the Veg. Soc. of Colorado, write of their concern about friction between vegans and ovo-lacto vegetarians. They are troubled by a growing perception that \"people think of veganism and vegetarianism as two similar but opposed ideas - or even opposed movements,\" and are perturbed by expressions of annoyance, irritation and resentment between members of both groups. Their concern is neither exaggerated nor premature. Sharp feelings of difference, divergence, dissonance and discord between two subsets of a group are common antecedents of a split into two discrete groups, each one following what its members believe to be the best goals and the best strategies to achieve those goals. Without a doubt, the fragmentation of vegetarian organizations would seriously diminish the power to effect social change that a single, large, unified organization can exert.\nAlthough they deny that there is a problem, insisting that \"Veganism is not opposed to vegetarianism, it is a form of vegetarianism,\" they nevertheless felt the need to quiet the rustlings of discord with the following strong admonition: \"To these and all others who think of separating veganism from vegetarianism, we have formulated the following piece of advice: LIGHTEN UP, GUYS!\"\nWhile these condescending and patronizing words are more likely to fuel hard feelings than to extinguish them, they nevertheless confirm a perception of troubled waters within the movement.\nIf some ovo-lacto vegetarians feel disparaged or looked down upon by vegans for their continued acceptance of dairy and eggs, they can at least take comfort from the status the ovo-lacto diet enjoys as the recognized Standard Vegetarian diet. Unfortunately this same official recognition generates feelings of isolation and resentment in vegans, who do not appreciate being a minority within a minority.\nThe roots of our difficulties lie in our definitions.\nThere is a \"World Standard Definition of vegetarianism\" given by almost every local, national or international Vegetarian Society in the world: it defines a vegetarian as a person who lives on a diet free of meat , fish or fowl in any form, \"with or without the addition of dairy products and eggs.\"\nWhat, precisely, does that phrase ...with or without the addition of dairy products and eggs mean? From a straightforward linguistic analysis it says that the presence or absence of the named items has no bearing on the use of the appellation \"vegetarian.\" From a behavioral perspective, a definition of vegetarianism is a statement of contingencies. If being a vegetarian is seen as desirable, then the privilege of calling oneself a vegetarian is contingent upon meeting the terms of the definition. The qualifying phrase in question declares that use of dairy and eggs falls outside the contingencies. From the point of view of discourse, it means that the use of dairy and eggs merits mention, but that this use is neither relevant nor significant in the dietary practice referred to.\nWhat we have is an organizationally sanctioned definition of vegetarianism that makes abstention from flesh THE vital, central component, and leaves as an option the movement toward a completely plant-based diet.... an option, not a target.\nContrast this with a different, more inclusive, formulation. The Rochester Area Veg. Soc. defines vegetarianism as \"the practice of living without the use of flesh, fish or fowl, and the ideal of complete independence from animal products.\" The definition has its flaws, but it holds out a goal to reach for, in positive terms, that has been acceptable to all our vegetarian members. A half-dozen other vegetarian societies in the country have already adopted, or adapted, this definition.\nThe \" old standard\" definition of a vegetarian not only identifies the parameters of vegetarianism... it fixes them. It says more than \"this is how far you must go\" -- it defines the boundaries of propriety. If you go beyond what is required of you, are walking out near the periphery, you are out at the edges, the extremes. Setting the properties of the vegetarian diet in terms of \"NO to flesh, YES to eggs, YES to cows' milk\" has a further, long-lasting and pernicious effect on the achievement of dietary change; the definition as given actually predetermines the process of change -- establishing a \"standard strategy for becoming a vegetarian.\" It prescribes the process of becoming a vegetarian as a sequence of \"abstentions\". By putting meat as the first condition, it automatically relegates milk and eggs to later consideration. This fixed, \"orthodox\" sequence of dietary changes is responsible for several outcomes.\nIt establishes a hierarchy of difficulty of change. Naming flesh as the \"first abstention\" marks this as the most accessible behavior. By extension, then, subsequent abstentions are acknowledged - and presented- as more difficult to achieve.\nThe existence of a hierarchy of difficulty of change has its own behavioral and emotional by-products. It assumes that \"Giving up meat may be hard, but giving up milk and eggs is \"even harder.\" Ranking people along a continuum of the difficulty of tasks accomplished, establishes yet another hierarchy... a hierarchy of value.\nThe stage is set for ranked comparisons of individuals along this hierarchy of value. Phrases employing comparative terms cannot be avoided ...\"more advanced,\" \"more rigorous,\" \"stricter\" in one direction, and in the other, \"not so strict,\" \"more easy-going\" \"more lenient,\" and finally, with a tinge of irritation, \"not so compulsive about my diet.\"\nIn this verbal climate it is impossible to avoid the implication that vegan is higher on the scale ..better, and ovo-lacto is lower and not as good. At this point the notion of \"holier than Thou\" makes its appearance, and an inevitable foundation of discordant -- sometimes corrosive -- divisiveness is laid down.\nLooked at from this perspective, what seemed like a simple \"definition\" turns out to be a prime antecedent -- a cause -- of a number of problems that beset the movement.\nBy establishing -- and insisting on -- dairy and eggs as acceptable foods for vegetarians, the definition serves to increase the probability of their consumption. Foods that are eaten frequently, become foods that acquire a steady and secure place on one's table and in one's shopping basket. The behavioral Law of Strength confirms what we already know: the longer you hold on to something, the harder it is to let it go.\nBut why should one let it go? and when? If you have already made a challenging commitment to a change in lifestyle, and met the Basic Criteria, and what remains is not presented as urgent -- then the \"extras\" are things to be addressed later -- somewhere down the line. No hurry. But you will not be eager to spend time with someone who threatens your contentment with tales of \"What's wrong with milk\" or \"the horrors of egg production.\"\nIn a word, the hierarchy of difficulty sets the schedule, the perceptions and the expectations of beginning vegetarians...\" Easy stuff first, hard stuff later.\"\nIf it is common experience for vegetarians who begin as ovo-lacto vegetarians to face a struggle to change to a vegan diet, all that is empirically confirmed is that this is indeed what happens when the \"Standard Definitions\" define the \"Standard Strategy\" and the \"Standard Schedule for Change.\" Since this seems to have been inscribed in granite, we have no data on alternative strategies. There is a universe of strategies waiting to be explored.\nMy title promised a view of vegetarianism's past and its future. Let's look at both.\nIn 1847, in London, a movement was born out a conviction that the killing of living, feeling creatures was neither biologically necessary nor morally acceptable for human survival and well-being. Factory farming had not yet been invented, chickens pecked away in open barnyards, cows had not yet been genetically engineered to have grotesquely distorted udders, and the veal crate of today was unknown. There was no genetic engineering, no hormones, no massive doses of antibiotics, no battery cages of egg-laying hens, no \"processing plants\" for the assembly line slaughter of chickens, no epidemic salmonella & campylobacter in eggs and poultry, no Mad Cow disease, no Bovine Growth Hormone.\nAnd in 1847 the simple rejection of flesh is what defined a vegetarian.\nNow , almost 150 years later, we are still working with the same definition. An obsolete definition, by which a plant-based diet remains an option -- not even an ideal.\nThe passage of years has seen the word \"vegetarian\" acquire a gloss of attractiveness that has led to an overgrowth of \"hyphenated varieties\" of vegetarianism. The mores of the last decades have encouraged a stance of non-judgmental all-inclusiveness, that is willing to respectfully acknowledge definitions of vegetarianism that range from the logical to the loony.\nClassifying vegetarians by what they do not eat is neither enlightening nor productive. People who consider their vegetarianism to be more than a dietary fling or an exploratory excursion into novel ways of eating -- people who have a sense of purpose in their vegetarian commitments -- need to come together around a definition of vegetarianism that meets several, literally vital criteria:\nWe must have a working definition of vegetarianism that describes -- IN POSITIVE TERMS -- WHAT VEGETARIANS DO. It needs to be made clear that vegetarians are committed to doing something other than \"not eating meat.\"\nWe must present a CORE OF COMMON VALUES and AN IMAGE OF SOME IDEAL THAT MAKES CLEAR WHY VEGETARIANS DO WHAT THEY DO.\nIf we continue to insist that an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet is the capstone of vegetarian ideals, we enshrine an anachronism and carry it into the next century.\nGiven what we now know about the health hazards of dairy products,it would be deceitful, dishonest - or both - to do anything that encourages the consumption of dairy foods. Regardless of one's personal dietary custom, given what we know about the way milk is produced, it is a frank breach of ethics to suggest to the uninformed that while the flesh of a cow is unacceptable as human food, the milk of that cow is.\nIf we continue to mark the achievement of a plant-based lifestyle as either irrelevant , \"optional\" or extreme, we will ultimately succeed in isolating and alienating from the movement precisely those people who have taken the whole message to heart.\nThere needs to be ONE vegetarian movement with a coherent vision of a world of peace, plenty, health, dignity and compassion for our planet and ALL the sentient creatures it supports -- ALL CREATURES ... without exemptions, without exceptions based on race, gender, nationality OR species. We cannot afford to risk or provoke a split into two camps. Two camps - of people with similar practice, but whose values... and goals differ in such vital ways that they become competitors, rather than collaborators in the struggle to \"humanize\" the world.\nWe need to be sufficiently confident of our values to ask for what we know to be necessary, recognizing the principle of \"You will get no more than you ask for, and no less than you will settle for.\"\nIt makes a difference whether vegetarianism is a \"diet\" or a \"philosophy.\" A diet is a list of the foods you choose -- a philosophy is a set of coherent REASONS for making those choices. You cannot build a movement around a \"diet.\" To have a movement you have to have people believing, living and working in concert to realize an ideal.\nWe need to reset our compasses to set our sights in accord with the realities of today and tomorrow. It is our urgent task to enter the 21st century with a definition of our movement that not only legitimizes and validates the vegan perspective, but broadens our global objectives to uncompromisingly identify a plant-based diet as the hope of the future.\nWe need to have the wit and the courage to speak out honestly and unambiguously to unify our movement with a definition that is positive and simple, a definition that is both inclusive and inspiring... a definition that will help us cultivate and nourish a globally life-sparing vegetarianism. To that end, I earnestly offer for your consideration -- and hopefully, your acceptance -- this definition:\n\"Vegetarianism is a philosophy that manifests its reverence and respect for the well-being of all sentient life by advocating and striving for the ultimate adoption of a plant-based diet.\"\nThis view of vegetarianism permits us to characterize vegetarians behavior in positive terms. Instead of classifying vegetarians by what they reject, we describe them in terms of what they choose:\n\"Vegetarians are people who have made a conscientious and principled commitment to achieve a lifestyle in which they consistently choose their food solely from the Plant Kingdom.\"\nI make an urgent appeal to each and every one of you -- members, board members and officers of vegetarian societies -- local, national and international -- to take this proposed definition to heart and to mind -- to begin NOW the task of reconceptualizing the meaning and the mission of vegetarianism.\"\nglobesetter\nMay 19th, 2004, 08:32 PM\n\"Vegetarians are people who have made a conscientious and principled commitment to achieve a lifestyle in which they consistently choose their food solely from the Plant Kingdom.\"\nI like this for some reasons, but it is just a bit too vague, I think.\nWe understand what it means, but non-veg*ns, who are the real audience for such definitions, might not `get it` - I think most would respond to this with `huh`?\nregards,\nveganmike\nMay 19th, 2004, 09:09 PM\nHaha, you're probably right... That's what you get when a linguist wants to say \"vegetarians eat plants\". :) Nevertheless the article is a great piece of work. I do agree that the word \"vegetarian\" lost its meaning and became obsolete. Especially since 1944 when veganism entered the stage.\nglobesetter\nMay 20th, 2004, 09:07 AM\nNevertheless the article is a great piece of work.\nI like it, too, and i think the issue is important - language not only reflects our attitudes, feelings, beliefs and relationships, but it also can shape them.\nWhen i first saw the word vegan, last August, I thought it was a typo - it took me some surfing to find the Vegan Society home page, and even after reading it, I still wasn\u00b4t really sure I understood it. So, in my experience, the language we choose to describe what we do is very important.\nregards,\nSabster\nDec 4th, 2004, 12:00 PM\nI don't agree with the statement on \"resentmant\" between vegans and general vegetarians. The minority within a minority. I'm sure it's true for some but not for the majority - I personally don't care. We're all vegetarians only at different degrees. The statement in the article came off as an almost definite claim - could be the way I read it.\nPinkFluffyCloud\nDec 4th, 2004, 01:25 PM\nVegetarians I meet up with often talk about 'compromise', as though it is taking a liberty to enforce my Veganism on others - i.e by expecting my family and friends to respect or understand my views.\nI can't say too much, as I reverted to Vegetarianism for a long while after first being Vegan for nearly 4 years, but I am upset that I did this, and realise that it had a lot ot do with 'compromise' - of my own heartfelt views, and I am never again prepared to sell my soul again like that. I don't resent Vegetarians, personally, but sometimes feel a little annoyed when I hear one spouting on about cruelty (to farm animals) when they are adding to the cruelty (as I used to, yes), by eating dairy.\nCherry.Chops\nFeb 12th, 2009, 08:52 PM\nI dont know how to do a poll...but Sandra and I were talking and it seems we both have different ideas of what vegeterian is.\nWhat is your defenition of vegeterian??

To my mind, a vegetarian does not eat an animal's meat, but will eat things taken from their bodies including eggs, dairy, honey and will use things made from their bodies including leather, wool, silk. That was me when I was a vegetarian, before I did the research.\nA strict vegetarian is one who understands about gelatine, rennet and other hidden slaughterhouse by-products and will avoid them if it is easy to do so. That was me when I was a vegetarian and had only done the not-too-distressing research.\nRose Jail\nFeb 12th, 2009, 11:54 PM\nI also see vegetarianism as being food-focussed rather than life-style focussed.

(lacto ovo)\nMy definition of vegetarian is someone who doesn't eat meat/fish or animal by-products e.g. gelatine, rennet. They also don't wear leather.\nThey do however eat dairy and eggs.\nCherry Chops said she thought 'whey' wasn't vegetarian, I believe it is vegetarian as it comes from dairy. This is in respect to the vegetarian gravy we were discussing, but not ALL whey is vegetarian.\nEnchantress\nFeb 13th, 2009, 11:53 AM\nWhey can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian. It's a by-product of cheese, so it's vegetarian status depends on whether or not the cheese was made with animal rennet.\nSloth\nFeb 13th, 2009, 12:12 PM\nIn my experience of people who are solidly vegetarian (not progressing towards veganism), I've found that there tends to be a sense of vagueness, and a bizarre willful ignorance. I've possibly just been unlucky in my exposure to vegetarians, but I am yet to meet one who doesn't occasionally decide that it's ok to eat sweets (and it's usually haribo) containing gelatin, or cheese made with a bit of cow stomach.\nharpy\nFeb 13th, 2009, 12:20 PM\nI can't really see the point of vegetarian (rennet-free) cheese because if you eat milk products then there are going to be dead calves so you might as well eat rennet as well. But that argument doesn't go down well with some vegetarians :devil:\nPowered by vBulletin\u00ae Version 4.1.10 Copyright \u00a9 2012 vBulletin Solutions, Inc.

Freeze dried fruits , bulk grains, and vegetables like potato flakes would all fit into the diet.\nTVP is a source of protein that can be used to supply equivalent nutrition to animal protein.\u00a0 With this and items like peanut butter, peanut or canola oil, powdered potatoes, etc., a year or more of food can be stockpiled for use. Plant milk and meat substitutes complete the picture.\n\u2018Trail food\u2019 can be obtained easily enough.\u00a0 The Omnivore may go after jerky or some honey-based\nbar.\u00a0 The Vegan can go for a fruit and nut (no honey) trail mix or bars like the \u2018 Bora Bora \u2019 bars which have a great taste, provide calories, and are Vegan friendly.\u00a0 As a diabetic I carry them as an emergency food source.\nThe difficulty begins with the recognition that a Vegan diet may be deficient in necessary vitamins and minerals .\u00a0 While we all must be aware of our dietary needs, Vegans must be very careful to get enough iron, B12, fatty acids, omega-3 and so on.\u00a0 In a SHTF scenario with its associated stress this is even more critical.\u00a0 When the foods don\u2019t contain these elements, supplements must be provided or alternate foods sought.\u00a0 This need expands the requirements of the larder to provide for these items.\u00a0 The standard caution of eating the foods you plan to survive on applies so that your body is accustomed to the foods you will be eating.\nAreas of Concern\nA main concern for the Vegan is what happens when the larder begins to empty.\u00a0 Not every climate or location is conducive to growing the variety of foods a Vegan needs. Mushrooms are a good protein source but must be started before SHTF. \u00a0 Soy, rice, peanuts and such may need more acres of land than available for sufficient food. Potatoes are a good crop once you learn how to grow them.\u00a0 A system like \u2018 square foot gardening \u2019 is useful for small areas.\u00a0 This system allows for some needed variety in the menu. \u00a0The point is that where an Omnivore may go take game or fish if needed, the Vegan must plan a garden ahead for all needs and be able to grow those items themselves.\nAn additional problem in long-term survival is the reluctance to use animal products in even\nnon-food ways.\u00a0 Some items may become unobtainable once the industrial infrastructure begins to dissolve. \u00a0Living on a self sufficient farm is a goal for most of us, for the Vegan it can become necessary unless they are willing to relax their objection to animal by-products that are not used in food items. In climates where cotton doesn\u2019t grow wool may be the only option for clothing. Bio-diesel can be made from waste vegetable oil but it requires preparation now so that the capability exists after SHTF.\u00a0 The same issues apply to candles.\u00a0 If bee\u2019s wax is off limits, how are you planning to make candles for light?\u00a0 Oil lamps will work but just how many acres do you have in peanuts or olives?\nEven more so than for the Omnivore, a Vegan must take a hard look at their life style and determine realistic numbers for how much of various things they use. \u00a0If they do not live in an area where they can produce their own foods and clothing, then stockpiling is the only answer.\u00a0 Surviving SHTF is possible; surviving TEOTWAWKI will be extremely difficult without living in an area where Vegan sustaining farming is possible or you have access to vast amounts of wild plants that you can forage .\nPhotos by:\nVisit Our New Survival Gear Store \u2013 Forge Survival Supply\nWhat's Next?\nSurvival Nutrition\nGet The Newsletter\nSubscribe to the FREE Survival Cache Newsletter and we'll send you a weekly email with new gear reviews, site news, survival tips, and more:\nFirst Name:\nCaptBart March 30, 2011 at 6:17 pm\nJoe,\nIt looks to me like TEOTWAWKI will be a lot more difficult for Vegans. For TSHTF, they simply have to be a lot more careful about their preparations. It will be harder for them to fill gaps in their preps in real time. Not impossible but the planning needs to be very complete. It is also essential for all of us, but for Vegans even more so, to dry run their preps to make sure they've covered the basis.\nCaptBart March 30, 2011 at 6:10 pm\nI just saw a news report of a French couple who is being charged with child abuse for the death of their child. She was a nursing mother and a vegan. Because she didn't make sure that her vitamin and mineral intake was good enough, her milk did not provide sufficient nutrients to keep her child alive.\nThat is the allegation of the prosecutor. Don't know how it will play out but it does emphasize the critical need for supplements and a fully balanced diet. It is critical for all, but for Vegans it is especially critical to monitor their intake. fuller story at http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/03/29\u2026\nChefbear58 March 30, 2011 at 7:44 pm\nNicely done CaptBart. Personally, I don't think that a vegan lifestyle is very realistic in a TEOTWAWKI situation, but I have been proven wrong in the past and I wish all the vegans who are prepping the best of luck. Some options do exist which could be considered by everyone, not just vegans, for sustainable consistent protein sources which they can grow themselves. Mushrooms, as you mentioned are an option. Not necessarily the white, button, or crimini (portobello) mushrooms we are familiar with, I have read about different fungi which can be farmed with minimal effort and infrastructure. The particular fungi I am referring to is called \"Quorn\", it is common in processed vegan foods and from what I understand there are plans to release \"home gardens\" for growing the fungi to the general public in the works. This might be something for folks to investigate further.\nCaptBart April 1, 2011 at 1:38 pm\nChefbear58,\nI went looking for the Quorn home gardens and found several posts indicating that some folks have bad allergic reactions to it. If you are going to make this, or any new to you food, a part of your survival stores, you must try it out first, before TSHTF. You don't want to find out that you are allergic to Soy after you've spent $500 stockpiling it or worse yet, after TSHTF and you have no medical help and no fall back position. If it works for you, great, but try it before you need it.\nChefbear58 April 2, 2011 at 12:59 am\nI haven't heard of the allergic reactions! It's kind of odd, because there are literally hundreds of vegan/vegetarian food products that use it. Although it is heavily processed in those products, I wonder if that makes a difference\u2026\nI am going to have to investigate this further, (not because I care either way\u2026 I eat \"rabbit food\"\u2026 does the garnish on my steak count?!) But out of sheer curiosity! Seriously though, EVERYONE should try EVERYTHING they plan to rely on in an emergency, whether that's a flashlight for the 30min power-outage\u2026 or TEOTWAWKI as a result of [insert you particular \"flavor\" of disaster]. ALWAYS MAKE SURE \u2013 it works/you know how to use it/you can use it safely!/you will eat it/it won't kill you or someone else for a stupid reason (known food alergies are a stupid reason!)\nThanks for the heads-up CaptBart!\nNow to see if I can squeeze in more research between homework/cooking for the church/writing papers/rockfish \"trophy season\"/cooking for my girl (trying to spoil her completely rotten!\nDave March 30, 2011 at 10:38 pm\nI've been an ovo-lacto vegetarian \u2013 I eat eggs and dairy \u2013 for 26 years. My wife has been a vegetarian and an on again \u2013 off again vegan for probably about 28 years. I'm 6 ft. and about 230 lbs. and people are always shocked when I tell them I'm vegetarian. I think my biggest issue in a SHTF situation will be finding enough beer. But seriously, my wife and I are in agreement \u2013 in a SHTF scenario squirrels, rabbits, birds, and anything else is on the menu. And I've got my 10/22 and my Mossberg 500 to make sure of it.\nCaptBart April 1, 2011 at 1:33 pm\nDave,\nIt seems to me that the vegetarian may be able to get by without much more stress than us omnivores. Especially if you can add either fish or fowl to the diet, you are in good shape. Eggs and diary are a big jump in your food supply, chickens and goats can give both while also providing wool and feathers for other uses. Even leaving out mammals as a food source, the other uses are critical and make things easier.\nMinarchist_1776 March 31, 2011 at 7:31 am\nThe base line problem with any of the variants on a \"vegetarian\" diet is that quite simply that's not what we're adapted to eat. That doesn't mean that one is automatically doomed to failure if they try, but it is so much easier to make sure that one is getting all of the trace vitamins, minerals and proteins that one needs in a relatively \"civilized\" situation. Once that civilized support network breaks down, the practicing vegetarian may not be able to get all of the various different things that they need to balance/round out their diet and health issues could arise through time as a result of various dietary deficiencies.\nAlso, depending on where one lives, any sort of vegetarian diet may be just about impossible once the network of civilization breaks apart. If you're far enough north the growing season may simply be too short to grow what you need to get the appropriate nutrients in one's diet. While Inuit/Eskimo populations have been able to survive successfully for centuries on a diet that was almost pure meat, that was also because in the climate where they lived there was essentially no other choice for food. Vegetarians would have rapidly starved to death or been forced to change their dietary preferences.\nIt is significant that most of the areas where vegetarian dietary preferences are common, such as India, are places where agriculture can be practiced easily and where civilizations have existed for thousands of years. As one moves away from areas like that to areas where agriculture is marginal at best and that can be described charitably as \"unsettled\" then vegetarianism becomes a much less viable option. Finally, if one has to \"bug out\" and attempt to live off the land, then not eating meat is going to put one at a significant disadvantage when it comes to making the best use of the food resources that are present in the environment.\nObviously different people will choose a vegetarian diet for different reasons, and some people will take it a lot more seriously than others. As a result there will be people that this comment will not apply to, and I am not trying to be offensive here. Nevertheless, my advice would be that one should not let a dietary preference that one may have adopted simply because it seemed to be a good idea at the time become something that could interfere with their ability to stay alive in a nasty survival situation.\nCaptBart April 5, 2011 at 11:40 am\nI think you have a good grasp of the issue. Dietary choices based on religious and moral grounds run deep and violating those choices will be tough if not impossible. Given that, I think that there is a limited climatic area where vegans, and ethical vegans in particular, can survive. The vegetarian who can consume fish or fowl expands the survival range to almost as large as for the omnivore. It isn't just the food products but it is also clothes, shelter, storage, medicine (some meds use animal products \u2013 forbidden to an ethical vegan) and many other things. I tried not to be discouraging but I think a vegan must be in a self sustaining community or have a huge larder to make it through a major event.\nI was once quoted as saying, \"I'm not vegetarian because I love animals. It's because I hate vegetables and they deserve to die.\"\nThis was many years and many cheeseburgers ago.\nTom April 4, 2011 at 7:17 am\nI'm 6'1\" and 245 pounds, my wife is 5'9\" 160 lbs and my 10 year old son is 5' 100 lbs! We do not look \"gaunt\" or stricken with HIV\" and we have all been vegans for 10 years. And the truth is most non meat eating people don't eat it because our society has turned a traditional food into a drug filled item.\nFranklin AShley May 2, 2012 at 2:31 pm\nNo so, you are biased, there are quite a few Olympic althletes with world records who were or are vegetarians! Most folks don't believe it when they find I am a veggie, lol, less illnesses and for shorter duration. Go to a local veg restruarant and take a 2nd look, healthy vibrant alert energetic people. Now in all walks of life are exttremists, but health reasons were mine to switch. NOt missing \"PINK Slime or BSE(Mad Cow Disease\"!!! or E> Coli.\nYou still stand a good chance of getting E. Coli even if you don't eat meat. http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/outbreaks.html\n8 of 15 cases listed here are from non-meat products (including cheese, cookie dough and frozen pizza).\nSo, statistically, there is no advantage. I might even consider there to be a greater likelihood as vegetables, especially greens and sprouts are not going to be cooked the way meat is. A condition that would probably be amplified in a SHTF scenario.\nSpec March 31, 2011 at 12:28 pm\nOne thing to remember is depending on the amount to time one has been \u201coff meat\u201d , there may be adverse reactions to suddenly eating meat.\nMy wife is a lacto-ovo vegatarian and mistakenly eaten some chilli that had meat in it. Within hours she was throwing up violently. We have prepared for SHTF food needs but long term I think she will have many more days throwing up u til her body can process the meat she is forced to eat.\nCaptBart March 31, 2011 at 5:23 pm\nSpec,\nwell said, sir. This applies, more or less, to any dietary change. Going from our 'normal' diet to eating whole grains tend to cause a laxative (to put it delicately) effect for any one. I have known observant Jews who got physically ill when they accidentally ate pork. That said, for all of us, but especially for the Vegetarian and Vegan it is critically important to plan an extended transition period from pure Vegan to a modified dietary plan. Those like the lacto-ovo vegetarian may have an easier time provided they can handle the physiological impact but it will be difficult for all.\nAgain, realistically \u2013 being brutally honest \u2013 look at your needs; decide what you will give up to survive and plan accordingly.\nNash April 1, 2011 at 4:34 am\nRead THE CHINA STUDY \u2014 30+ year study on how diet affects health. Very informative.\nIn a SHTF situation all those critters that you folks plan on subsisting on will be gone in very short order. Even larger game will be depleted in a short period of time. If you don't plan to grow your own food (or raise your own livestock) then you will be in a bad way after your stockpiled food runs out. Planning to live on wild game alone is not a very good plan.\nIt's a given that your dietary habits would change drastically in survival situation. I would have no problem eating just about anything if it came down to it and, yes, I have plenty of guns and ammo stock piled along with everything else. However, I think stockpiling seeds is the most important thing. Gardens will be very, very important when cheap food goes away.\nCaptBart April 1, 2011 at 1:29 pm\nNash,\nthe human population didn't begin to grow large until we started farming. Hunter \u2013 gatherer cultures must move often and the larger the population, the more often the move. The dietary vegan who can use animal products (not to eat, but for other uses) can use things like wool and honey which increases their chance of success. The ethical vegan who does not use any animal product for any purpose may not be able to exist outside of a very narrow climate range. They have to grow everything \u2013 it can probably be done in a 'vegan community' where enough acreage is under cultivation to provide all needs (cotton, peanuts, soy, etc.) but it will take planning. I would urge our vegan readers to investigate the vegan organizations and see if there are any other preppers there. TSHTF is doable if you plan and prepare properly. TEOTWAWKI will be a lot tougher.\nNash April 2, 2011 at 12:38 pm\nStockpile what you eat everyday and you'll be good for the short term. In a TEOTWAWKI situation all the usual labels (vegetarian, vegan, carnivore, republican, democrat\u2026) will be meaningless anyway, and each of us will do (and eat) whatever it takes to get by. I've seem vegetarians turn to meat eating again in short order when they didn't have any other option, and I'm talking just over a weekend outing! There are far too many of us now to go back to a hunter-gatherer culture. We're going to to have to successfully grow a variety of crops in short order to be successful in TEOTWAWKI. Just about everyone, including city dwellers, can scratch out a garden and start to feed themselves, if they store seeds anyway. Raising livestock is a bit more problematic.\nT.Rapier April 1, 2011 at 10:16 am\nPigs are one of the best animals to raise . They require little space , will eat almost anything and reproduce very fast ! That is why the Spanish seeded them in the Caribbean colonies . Islands have limited space and resources and pigs were the perfect answer for reliable meat .\nCaptBart April 1, 2011 at 1:23 pm\nT.Rapier,\nThe pig has become so successful in the US that it is a major nuisance, sometimes a danger, to large parts of North America. Feral Hogs have attacked people in many, if not most, southern states and do major property damage. They can be eaten but they are not easily killed and are very dangerous if trapped or cornered. As a kid I once spent several hours (seemed like days) up a tree after I found out that a .22 hollow point is the wrong ammo for a large feral hog. He spent quite a bit of time walking all over my rifle, dropped to allow expeditious tree climbing, expressing his displeasure at the loud noise and sting of the bullet.\nThey do have disease issues as do bear and other predators but if the meat is cooked correctly, they do provide protein and other products.\nChefbear58 April 3, 2011 at 7:37 pm\n\"they are not easily killed and are very dangerous if trapped or cornered\"\nHogs, especially boars, have an extended shoulder plate that works like a shield over several of the vital organs it sits directly over the \"kill zone\" (covers the majority of the heart and lungs), which makes it difficult to deliver a clean/quick kill. The way around it, is to try and hit them at an angle sort-of behind and broadside so that you miss the bone-plate and hit the vital organs (best way if using a bow); use a high powered rifle which can smash through the plate and hit the organs, hit it from the front (difficult shot, they usually keep their head down so you are likely to hit the face, like the jaw bone, before your shot can get near the chest/breast; Some folks have had success \"pig-stickin\", using a knife to dispatch the hog, usually use dogs to help wear down the hod and hold them for the finishing blow; you could always gut-shot them, but I try to avoid it at all costs, because it is not quick/clean and I pride myself on being an ethical hunter (I know some reading this article will not understand what I mean by that!); you could pull a head shot, but again they have thick, dense skulls, so you would need a pretty high powered firearm.\n\"They do have disease issues as do bear and other predators but if the meat is cooked correctly\"\nThe most common is trichinosis, it can be prevented by cooking the meat to 170F throughout. The best way to assure this and still keep an edible finished product is to slow-roast -OR- braise the meat. Wild pig also makes EXCELLENT bacon/ham, which is fairly easy to do once you learn the technique.\nCaptBart April 3, 2011 at 7:50 pm\nChefbear58,\nYou may well be the 'answer man' I've been looking for. Not trying to put you on the spot, but does 'jerking' meat take care of the microscopic nasties like trichinosis? I have not seen it addressed in the articles on making jerky and I'd hate to have to do the experiment for real. Any light you could shed on the subject would be appreciated. I'm looking into 'shelf stable' foods. The westerners used smoking and jerking (about the same process in the meat but different processes and tastes \u2013 I think) to create long shelf life protein sources. I have been wondering how safe that is.\nChefbear58 April 4, 2011 at 7:53 am\nTrichinosis is caused by a type of worm, curing does not necessarily kill off those types of critters. Jerking as its known here in the US (application of a spice blend or marinade to meat) does not do anything of consequence other than add flavor. The traditional method you refer to, involves the same application of a rub and marinade, but is also smoked, usually over open coals with damp wood over it. The traditional method is sufficient to kill off most food born pathogens. The key for long term storage would be to reduce the water content as much as possible. If you can get a water activity close to about .85% (think crisp cooked bacon) it should extend the shelf life dramatically and create an environment where things like salmonella and campylobacter will not like.\nBut to explain it properly, I would need pages, and pages\u2026 Plus I am heading out to take a mid-term exam for homeland security class so I will have to cut it short.. sorry\ni have been a vegetarian for 20 years, and a healthy one for about 12 of them (it took me a while to learn about nutrition). some key things for a vegan/vegetarian to keep in their larder are:\n- peanut butter\n- beans (canned and dry) and rice\n- brewer's yeast (full of B vitamins, plus lots of other good stuff)\ni have also recently begun dehydrating my own food, which i am storing int he freezer. ideally, i would like to get a vacuum sealer for long-term storage, but for now i must make do with what i have. as other readers have said, i plan on re-introducing meat into my diet when/if it becomes necessary.\nand for all you die-hard carnivores, don't forget that veggies are also vital for your nutrition. get a good book on wild harvesting and know how to identify edible plants.\nCaptBart April 2, 2011 at 7:01 pm\nleaf eater,\nwell said and it sounds like you have a good plan. I had not thought of brewers yeast for vitamins. Good idea. The more 'shelf stable' our stores the better off we are \u2013 refrigeration can quickly become a memory post TSHTF.\nDave April 2, 2011 at 10:43 pm\nI saw a video on youtube where a guy was storing dry goods with Mylar bags, oxygen absorbers, and an iron. As long as you get all of the air out the bags the food should be good for years. I did a Google search and easily found the bags and absorbers at reasonable prices. The guy in the video said to avoid the cheaper Chinese made oxygen absorbers. I believe the video was posted by envirosponsible (sp?).\nCaptBart April 3, 2011 at 7:56 pm\nDave,\nI'm on uncertain ground here, so if I'm off base I trust our more knowledgeable readers will correct me. I am under the impression that the key is to remove oxygen; the other components of our air (mostly nitrogen) don't really matter. That can be done in any number of ways, including displacing the oxygen with another gas. Carbon dioxide is fairly easy to create and being heavier than normal air with its oxygen, displaces it in a container. The absorbers are easier to use but there are low tech methods to do the same thing if needed. Or at least I think that is true.\nDave April 4, 2011 at 8:39 pm\nI don't know the science behind it as far as how various gases in the air react to perishables. The oxygen absorbers appear to vacuum pack the food in the Mylar bags, so by removing all ,(or nearly all) of the air you've got your bases covered. I know that plastic is more porous so air penetrates it much quicker reducing the shelf life \u2013 so Mylar is better. The absorber is a tab you drop into the bag just before you seal it with the iron, so I would say it is fairly easy and low tech. I haven't tried it yet but I'm planning to soon. I'm looking for good ways to store food that don't require a lot of equipment that are effective and not too expensive. This looks like it might be a good system. Also, you can use large bags for the food stored at home and smaller bags for your cars, your GHB, and your BOB. If people have other good ideas I'm certainly open for suggestions.\nCaptBart April 6, 2011 at 9:25 am\nAbsolutely true \u2013 plastic is not an oxygen barrier. That is why our 5 gallon pails are lined with Mylar bags. A block of dry ice setting in a tray (to protect the food from freezing) can be set on top of the stored item and allowed to sublimate (dry ice doesn't melt to a liquid \u2013 it sublimates directly to CO2). Once it's gone, the O2 content of the pail is essentially zero so the bag can be sealed to keep out air and the the pail sealed to protect the bag. Extends the shelf life substantially. Of course O2 absorber packs are easier and just as effective.\nbostonsurvival April 2, 2011 at 1:49 pm\nI've been vegan for 4.5 years now and got into prepping nearly a year ago and it can be tough to find processed survival foods that are vegan, but I think the best thing for anyone is to really try to store what you eat/eat what you store. I definitely agree, peanut butter, beans, rice are super important to stock up on, as well as pasta. There are even some good vegan mac cheese alternatives (check out Roads End Organics in Vermont). They're all vegan which is also good for anyone that has any dairy allergies (and many are nut and soy free too).\nbostonsurvival April 2, 2011 at 1:50 pm\nP.S.\nTry to stock up on vitamins also, a multi-vitamin is great for anyone (vegan or not) as we most likely won't be getting as much nutrition as usual and will be under stress. From my own research I would highly suggest extra vitamin C and D. Studies have shown that many people (omnivores, vegetarians and vegans), especially up north where I am, are vitamin D deficient and don't get enough from their diet or sunlight, and low D levels have been linked to all sorts of bad stuff. Plus, if the SHTF scenario is a nuclear disaster and we're bugging in some place, we definitely will not be getting the vitamin D we need. veganhealth [dot] org and naturalnews [dot] com are good sites for more info on this.\n"}, {"score": 1624.3457, "uuid": "02d3aa4b-3f33-580a-a39b-720d5c658ad4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0406wb-61-33924", "target_hostname": "vegetarian.about.com", "target_uri": "http://vegetarian.about.com/od/beverage1/a/Difference-Between-Cocoa-And-Cacao.htm", "page_rank": 1.1859428e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Cocoa <em>and</em> Cacao?", "snippet": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Cocoa <em>and</em> Cacao?

Why is the word so similar to cocoa? Is there a purpose in having two strikingly similar words to describe what seems to be the same product? Is there something special about cacao products that distinguishes them from cocoa products?\nFor more on what raw cacao actually is and how people are using it, click here.\nYou Say Tomato, I Say Cacao\nEven for a bi-lingual Mexican-American chocolatier the story of how we have both of these words at our disposal is not easy to tell. The botanical name for the tree that chocolate comes from is Theobroma Cacao. The word cacao comes from the Olmec people from what is now Mexico, and is believed to be the closest pronunciation to the original name of the plant. History shows that chocolate then changed hands from the Olmec to the Mayans to the Spanish. The word cacao is the only word ever used in any of the hispanic languages to describe what English speakers think of as cocoa. It is actually widely believed that the word cocoa has its origins in a spelling mistake. A mistake which was never corrected, and perhaps found easier to pronounce, quite successfully overtook the correct form.\nCheck out this article to learn more about the History of Chocolate .\nThe Great Cacao Comeback\nAs fate would have it, the original spelling was destined to be rebirthed even within the English speaking community due in part to a growing interest in the raw food diet . Manufacturers of raw food products have usurped the more authentic spelling of the word in an attempt to distinguish their products from products which use roasted cacao beans (i.e. raw cacao powder vs. cocoa powder). But the lines are getting blurry as trends in dieting comingle with trends in marketing and trends in linguistics.\nSo today we basically have two words with the same meaning. Cacao will be seen by the chocolate industry and botanists alike as the more accurate or relevant term. Someone in the long arm of the chocolate industry may tell you that cocoa refers to any of the manufactured products of the plant (especially the powder) as well as the bean itself. Interestingly, English seems to be the only language having this conundrum. All other languages just have one word for all of the plants many forms.\nSee this article for nutritional information on raw cacao and why it is used in this new health food movement.\nRelated Articles\n"}, {"score": 1621.7798, "uuid": "458ebf31-6829-5da1-bd5a-ca5b89c41f97", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-40-04006", "target_hostname": "www.vegguide.org", "target_uri": "http://www.vegguide.org/site/help", "page_rank": 6.2547256e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em> Restaurants, Grocers, Bakeries | VegGuide.Org", "snippet": "<em>The</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> this <em>and</em> <em>a</em> restaurant <em>is</em> that <em>a</em> food court vendor probably doesn&#x27;t have their own tables or any sort of table service.

For example, if everything on the menu is vegan but the restaurant offers cheese for pasta dishes on request, then it should still be considered a vegan restaurant. Honey is not considered vegan.\nThe point of defining a restaurant as vegan is to assure any vegan that they can go in and order anything they want without asking questions about the ingredients.\nIf you're not sure, use your best judgement. Remember, the purpose of this guide is to make the lives of vegetarians and vegans easier and more pleasant, not to enforce strict standards of vegan purity on restaurants.\nVegetarian\nFor the purposes of this VegGuide.org, a restaurant is considered vegetarian if it does not serve animal flesh in any form. Please note that sea creatures and chicken are animals, so seafood and chicken meat are not vegetarian.\nVegan-friendly\nThis categorization is far more flexible than the others, and should be influenced by the restaurants's locale. For example, in places like New York City or San Francisco, which have many vegan and vegetarian restaurants, a restaurant offering a single vegan entree would not be considered vegan-friendly. On the other hand, in a small town vegan-friendly may mean a restaurant that is willing to make pasta with marinara sauce.\nParticularly in regions with limited selections for vegans, even minimal vegan-friendliness is worth noting.\nVegetarian-friendly\nLike vegan-friendly, the definition of this term varies by locale. A restaurant need not be vegetarian-friendly to be added to the guide, though there should be some other compelling reason for adding it if it isn't vegetarian-friendly. For example, if a restaurant has a few veg options and serves a cuisine unique for its area, feel free to add it.\nWho pays for this site?\nThis site has pretty low expenses at the moment.

Eat more fish, eat some fish, eat this fish, eat that fish \u2013 for a food supposedly great for brains, the subject of fish and diets sure can make your head hurt! You follow a healthy diet, you exercise regularly and you don\u2019t eat meat or fish \u2013 yet you turn any page in a health magazine and according to the latest article, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don\u2019t eat fish.\nThis report describes the science behind the flawed oily fish phenomenon and explains the research the fish industry does not want publicised \u2013 research which clearly shows that plant-based diets are safer and more protective of health. The report also describes how the public is unimpressed and confused by the \u2018oily fish mantra\u2019. It explains how public health strategies which emphasise oily fish consumption are misplaced and undermine more effective and sustainable health-promoting solutions. The necessity to eat fish is exposed as a myth \u2013 it\u2019s simply not the health food the media would have us believe it is.\nSo what\u2019s the story behind the constant mantra \u2013 fish as part of a healthy diet? It\u2019s the type of fat found in oily fish \u2013 mackerel, salmon, kippers, swordfish, marlin, herring, sprats, trout, pilchards and fresh tuna \u2013 that is at the heart of this particular tale.\nIntroducing Essential Fatty Acids\nNot all fats are damaging to health\nThough most people view dietary fat as quite simply the original sin, our bodies can\u2019t function properly without some fat in the diet. But eating the right type of fat is vital. There are two main types of fat: saturated fats and unsaturated fats. Saturated fat is found mainly in animal products like meat and dairy products as well as most processed foods. Fatty fish, being an animal product is no exception and 30% of its fat content can be saturated.1 Saturated fat contributes to the risks of heart disease by boosting blood cholesterol levels and is a damaging and unnecessary part of the diet.\nUnsaturated fat is found principally in plant foods like seeds, nuts and beans as well as their oils. There are also two types of unsaturated fats: polyunsaturates and monounsaturates, both of which play an important role in the diet. Monounsaturated fats \u2013 like those found in olive oil \u2013 although not essential in the diet, are a good replacement for less healthy fats and may also protect us from heart disease.\nTwo specific polyunsaturated dietary fats are essential to good health. This means that they have important biochemical roles and because they cannot be manufactured by the body\u2019s chemical processes, they must be taken in food. The essential fatty acids (EFAs) are linoleic acid (LA) and alpha linolenic acid (LNA).\nLA is known as an omega-6 fatty acid and our tissues can convert it to give rise to a series of other longer chain omega-6 fatty acids, for instance AA (arachidonic acid). LNA is known as an omega-3 fatty acid and in a similar way, cells in the body can convert it into other longer-chain omega-3 fatty acid family members, such as EPA (eicosapentanoic acid) and DHA (docosahexanoic acid). Although AA, DHA and EPA are physiologically important, they are not strictly EFAs as they can be made in the body from LA and LNA.\nEFAs are important in the normal functioning of all tissues of the body. They are necessary for the formation of healthy cell membranes, the proper development and functioning of the brain and nervous system and for the production of hormone-like substances called eicosanoids (which include prostaglandins). Eicosanoids are important regulators of vital body functions, such as blood pressure, blood clotting, immune responses and inflammatory responses.\nWell documented EFA deficiency in humans is rare. Overt LA deficiency is seen only when it provides less than 1-2% of dietary energy, or 2-5g daily for an adult, an amount which is likely to be provided by even the most meagre diets.2 In severe conditions, symptoms can include dry, cracked, scaly skin, impaired liver function and decreased growth.3 A specific deficiency state arising from inadequate dietary LNA has not been demonstrated in healthy humans.4 However, because of LNA\u2019s role as a precursor for other omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are needed for the development and function of the brain and retina, it is regarded as a dietary essential.\nAlso, due to its role in the regulation of blood pressure and blood clotting, and its ability to reduce blood cholesterol, it is often recommended that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are included in the diet to help protect against coronary heart disease.\nResearch suggests that the levels of essential fatty acids, and the balance between them, may also play a critical role in the prevention and treatment of a range of other chronic diseases including, hypertension, arthritis and other immune/inflammatory disorders, and some cancers.5\nBalancing dietary Essential Fatty Acids\nThe ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids is often used to assess the balance between essential fatty acids in the diet. Over millions of years, humans have consumed a diet that contained approximately equal amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids. In Western societies over the past 150 years, there has been a huge increase in the proportion of omega-6s consumed in vegetable oils (both as cooking oils and in processed foods) from the seeds of corn, sunflower, safflower and soybeans.6 Current estimates of Western diets suggest a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the order of 10-20:1.7\nRecommendations to increase consumption of omega-3 EFAs reflect current understanding that a low ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is linked to increased risk of heart disease. However, all too often, it is oily fish which are promoted as being a good source of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is in spite of the fact that the richest dietary sources of LNA are some seed oils (e.g. linseed oil, rapeseed oil and soya oil) and nuts (particularly walnuts).8 Leafy green vegetables are also a source of LNA.9\nSome nutritionists point to the fact that oily fish contains the longchain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA in a pre-formed state, and that these have heart protective properties. However, promoting fish for this reason ignores the fact that the body can convert plant sources of LNA into EPA and DHA. This has been shown by a number of studies which have demonstrated that plant LNA-rich oils significantly elevate tissue levels of omega-3 long chain PUFAs.10, 11 Of course if this were not the case, then millions of non-fish-eating vegetarians across the world would have increased cardiovascular risk, but all the evidence points to reduced rates of coronary heart disease for vegetarians.12, 13\nThere are simple ways to enhance the conversion of LNA to EPA/DHA in the body. Diets too high in LA may inhibit the production of EPA and DHA from LNA. In practice, replacing oils high in LA like sunflower, corn or soya oil with oils high in LNA like flaxseed (linseed) or rapeseed (canola) oil will help the body produce the necessary EPA and DHA.\nEssential fatty acids and heart disease\nWhat\u2019s behind the fish recommendations?\nAffairs of the heart are the primary reason why fish has come to be viewed as a must-have accessory for a healthy diet. Fish first got the nutritional thumbs up when it was observed that populations like the Japanese and Eskimos with their fish-rich diets have low rates of cardiovascular disease. The pre-formed EPA and DHA fatty acids found in fish can help to reduce the likelihood of clots forming in the blood, help lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lower triglyceride (fat) levels in the body \u2013 all these functions may therefore help to reduce the risks of heart disease. However, the call to eat fish largely ignores the fact that EPA and DHA can also be formed in the body from plant sources of LNA.\nA 2002 American Heart Association (AHA) statement explains that large-scale epidemiological studies suggest that individuals at risk from Coronary Heart Disease benefit from eating plant and marinederived omega-3 fatty acids. The AHA recommends at least two servings of fish per week, especially fatty fish, as well as plant foods that are high in LNA such as soyabeans, walnuts and flaxseed. However, the AHA also states that the recommendations on fish consumption need to be balanced with concerns over\ncontamination of fish with environmental pollutants.14 This is an incredibly important proviso and seriously erodes the idea that fish is \u2018healthy\u2019. (See below for further discussions).\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) in its latest report \u2013 Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases \u2013 makes a similar statement that regular fish consumption (1-2 servings per week) is protective against heart disease. However, whilst it also states that vegetarians can ensure adequate intakes of LNA from plant sources, it fails to give any warnings about the dangers of environmental contamination.15\nFish EFAs vs. Plant EFAs: what does the research tell us?\nMuch of the promotion of fish as heart-friendly has been based on evidence from secondary prevention trials. These trials have investigated whether advising people to eat fish can prevent a second heart attack from occurring. The DART and GISSI trials are the two best known studies and have demonstrated that marine fatty acids significantly reduce mortality in people who already have cardiovascular disease. However, much less publicised are the trials that have looked at the link between plant-derived LNA and the prevention of secondary heart disease. For example, the LYON study has demonstrated that eating plant-derived LNA reduces the risks of secondary heart disease by more than double that found in the fish-based studies! Let\u2019s take a closer look at these studies.\nDART \u2013 Using Dietary Fish to prevent secondary heart disease\nThe DART trial looked at the effects of dietary intervention in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) on subjects who had previously recovered from MI. An MI occurs when blood supply to the heart muscle (the myocardium) is blocked, which can lead to severe pains in the chest. The trial found that male subjects who had been advised to eat about 300g of fatty fish per week had an almost 30% reduction in overall mortality rate over two years, and the effect was observed from an early stage. The advice to increase fish consumption also meant that the subjects had a simultaneous small decrease in the amount of meat, meat products, cheese and eggs in their diet.\nThe researchers believe that the fish oils help normalise heartbeat rhythms \u2013 thus exerting what is called a beneficial anti-arrhythmic effect. Fish oils also seem to work on platelet cells found in the blood which ensure that blood becomes sticky \u2013 vital for instance if you cut yourself and the bleeding needs to be stopped. However, too much stickiness (clumping), can promote strokes and heart disease. The EPA in fish oils seems to prevent this clumping.\nImportantly, the study also showed that although there were fewer fatal heart attacks in the fish advice group, the total number of attacks was not significantly reduced.16 In essence what this means is that although eating oil-rich fish may reduce the risk of dying after a heart attack, they do not necessarily stop another heart attack from occurring.\nA follow up DART study by Ness and colleagues assessed the longterm effect of dietary advice of former DART participants 10 years after the study had first started. Although fatty fish intake was still higher in those subjects in the original \u2018eat fish\u2019 group, the researchers did not observe any substantial long-term survival benefit in participants who had been advised to eat more fish.17\nGISSI \u2013 Using Fish Oil Supplements to prevent secondary heart disease\nThe GISSI study similarly looked at the effect of EPA/DHA on patients who had survived a first heart attack. In this secondary prevention trial, omega-3 fish oil capsules were given to those having suffered an MI and who had Mediterranean dietary habits. Although there was a significant 20% reduction in overall mortality, the dietary regimen prescribed corresponded to a very large amount of fatty fish (100g) being consumed every day.18\nLYON \u2013 Using Plant-Derived LNA to prevent secondary heart disease\nThe LYON study also looked at how essential fatty acids can help prevent a second heart attack. The difference however was that plant-derived LNA was used \u2013 not fish or fish oils. Amazingly, the LYON study achieved a 70% reduction in mortality \u2013 more than twice the reduced risk found in either the DART or GISSI fish-based trials! There was also a reduction in significant coronary events in the LYON study.\nThe food eaten by subjects in the study was based on the typical Mediterranean diet, with two grams per day of plant-derived LNA. Thus participants in the study were advised to eat a largely plantbased diet: more bread, legumes, vegetables (both root and green vegetables) and fruit, less meat, with butter and cream replaced by a plant-based margarine high in LNA. Although fish intake was encouraged, the experimental group ate only seven grams more fish than the non-experimental group leading the researchers to conclude that the favourable EPA increase seen in the experimental group was due to plant-LNA intake, not the fish in the diet. The experimental group also, not surprisingly, were found to have higher levels of antioxidants \u2013 disease-fighting vitamins. Heart protection afforded by such a plant-based diet was found to start quickly and also suggested an anti-arrhythmic effect being responsible for the reduction in heart attack risk.19 Good adherence to the diet was observed and four years on most people on the original trial were still following the diet and significantly, heart protection was still being observed.20\nThe significance of this plant-based diet research is hard to overemphasise. Firstly this trial demonstrates that a diet incorporating plant-derived LNA is clearly superior to fish-derived EPA/DHA in reducing the risk of death from a heart attack. Secondly, it shows that plant-LNA also reduces the risk of having to go through the pain of a second coronary event. Thirdly, it is clear from long-term followups that such plant-based diets can be sustained. And fourthly, longterm heart protection is afforded.\nPlant-derived LNA effectiveness of LYON trial confirmed\nQuite clearly the LYON study has demonstrated that plant-derived LNA is extremely effective in reducing the risks of secondary heart disease. Work by Singh and colleagues have further demonstrated the effectiveness of LNA in reducing total cardiac events in high-risk populations. A 1997 study looked at the relative effects of fish oil and mustard oil on subjects with suspected myocardial infarction. One group of participants was given 20g of mustard oil/day (giving 2.9g LNA daily) and another group was given 1.08g of fish-derived EPA/day. Belching and nausea were two side effects of the fish oil treatment that led to some subjects leaving the trial. Both groups showed a significant reduction in total cardiac events.21\nIn 2002, Singh and colleagues assessed the effect of an Indo-Mediterranean diet rich in wholegrains including legumes, fruits and vegetables, coupled with foods high in plant-LNA from nuts, mustard oil and soyabean oil. This type of diet was given to a group of patients with risk factors for heart disease such as angina (chest pains on exertion) and MI. Those subjects who followed the plant-based diet, rich in LNA, were found to have a significant reduction in risk of non-fatal MI and sudden cardiac death. The authors concluded that omega-3 fatty acids consumed as mustard or soyabean oils, walnuts, leafy green vegetables and wholegrains, rather than fish or fish oil supplements, might also reduce the cardiovascular disease risk in populations that already consume a prudent low-fat diet.22 As explained below, this concurs with research which has found no additional heart-health benefits from consuming fish in populations which are at low risk from heart disease.\nNo benefit from fish for low-risk heart disease populations\nWhilst fish may have a part to play in reducing risks of heart disease in high-risk populations \u2013 i.e. those who have already had a heart attack \u2013 the same cannot be said for low-risk heart disease populations. A systemic review looking at the role of fish in heart disease by Marckmann and Gronbaek in 1999 found that fish consumption is not associated with reduced coronary heart disease mortality in low-risk populations. They conclude that individuals at low-risk of heart disease and with healthy lifestyles do not gain any additional protection for the heart from eating fish. The authors also question whether the apparent protection in high-risk individuals is directly caused by eating the fish itself or whether the link might be explained by other dietary or non-dietary confounders.23\nIn total, six of the 11 studies identified by Marckmann and Gronbaek were unable to conclude that fish consumption protected against death from coronary heart disease. Some other research has also questioned the purported protective properties of fish. Not only did a study in 1997 find no support for the hypothesized link between fish omega-3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease risk reduction, the researchers actually found that consumption of fish omega-3 fatty acids was associated with up to a 30% increased risk of coronary death.24 Other more recent research by Burr et al found that male angina patients given advice to eat oily fish also had a higher risk of cardiac death, particularly in those supplied with fish oil supplements.25 In another study, eight out of 11 adolescents experienced nosebleeds whilst taking fish oil supplements for treatment of genetically related high cholesterol levels.26 And a systematic review of published papers investigating whether marine fatty acids can reduce the risk of certain cancers, like breast and prostate cancer, failed to show any such beneficial association.27\nPlant-based diets \u2013 great for the heart all round\nSo who are these low\u2013risk populations? People who have a low saturated fatty acid diet are considered at lower risk of heart disease as saturated fat is a known risk factor for coronary heart disease. Therefore both vegetarian, and more so vegan, populations are already at reduced risk from heart disease. Indeed, a recent review stated that vegetarians have a 25% reduced risk of dying from heart disease than omnivores.12 In its 2003 position paper on vegetarian diets, The American Dietetic Association states that vegetarians are not only at reduced risk from heart disease, but also have a reduced risk for a host of other degenerative diseases.13\nHaving undertaken research which found that vegetarians and vegans have lower blood pressure than both meat-eaters and fisheaters, Appleby and colleagues have concluded that eating fish to lower blood pressure may therefore be unnecessary.28 But not only can a plant-based vegetarian diet reduce the odds of dying from heart disease in the first place, it can also offer a therapeutic role in the treatment of heart disease. Research has demonstrated that a near-vegan diet can reverse even severe cardiovascular disease and patients following plant-based diets show a significant reduction in the hardening of their arteries.29, 30\nEssential Fatty Acids and brain health\nIt is not only our hearts that need EFAs \u2013 our brains do too. The brain is particularly dependent on the EFAs \u2013 over 50% of our brains are made up of these essential fats.31 Growing brains also need a one-toone balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fats \u2013 it is this balance that promotes the growth of the cerebral cortex, the site of intellect and reasoning.32 Based on these facts it is not surprising that fish is also promoted as essential for infant development and an aid to overcoming both learning and behavioural problems.\nBut once again, fish are not the only source of EFAs \u2013 plant-derived EFAs are an alternative source. The obvious point is that if there was a major problem with a lack of fish-derived EFAs, then veggie and non-fish eating children would come bottom in the intelligence stakes. There has never been any study to suggest this is the case and thousands of healthy intelligent vegetarian and non-fish eating families attest to the fact that brains can function perfectly well without consuming fish!\nIn particular, much attention has focused on the use of fish to manage attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). However, there is a suggestion that the highly processed junk food diet that many children subsist on may be the real cause of behavioural problems. In fact, in their briefing paper on omega-3 fatty acids, even the British Nutrition Foundation (BNF) admit, \u201c\u2026at this stage any link between ADHD and n-3 fatty acid status should be regarded as highly speculative\u201d.33 Whilst EFAs may have a role to play, as ever, to argue that fish is the panacea for combating complex behavioural problems is far too simplistic.\nContaminated fish are a danger to health\nThe environmental picture\nIt\u2019s pretty fair to say that we all buy into the idea that a healthy environment produces healthy kids; and that an unhealthy environment produces unhealthy kids. With fish it\u2019s just the same \u2013 thanks to our polluting activities, the watery worlds of their home environments are anything but fresh and clean. Fish are literally swimming in a sea of human waste, but are still marketed as the holy grail of a healthy diet.\nEnvironmental contaminants stemming from various industrial processes reach all our waterways \u2013 lakes, rivers and ultimately the oceans. One particularly nasty class of these contaminants is termed POPs \u2013 Persistent Organic Pollutants. These poisons have become part of many food chains and get more and more concentrated as they reach each level in the chain. In practice this means that carnivorous fish like salmon take on the toxic load of the smaller fish they eat and become ever more toxic themselves. In turn, humans eat the carnivorous and potentially contaminated fish like salmon, tuna and mackerel, believing them to be good for their health! Mercury, which is also released into the environment by industrial processes, is another POP and recent studies show that fish contaminated with mercury are becoming an increasing cause for concern.\nDioxins and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are among the most dangerous chemicals known to man. Dioxins and PCBs are not only toxic, persistent and bio-accumulative, but they can also be carried long distances in air currents, thereby posing a threat to humans and wildlife living in remote places. Dioxins and PCBs therefore have all the properties of Persistent Organic Pollutants and are recognised as two of the 12 agreed \u201cworst\u201d or \u201cmost toxic chemicals known to man\u201d. They are also fat soluble and found in many foods \u2013 oily fish and fish oil supplements are rich sources of dioxins and PCBs because they accumulate in fat, and oily fish have large deposits of fat. The toxic chemicals which fish pick up through the food chain are often particularly concentrated in their livers, which is an important fact when weighing up the benefits of fish liver oil supplements.\nThe potential human health effects of these chemicals may include some cancers, damage to the immune system, infertility, birth defects, and altered levels of sex hormones.\nDioxins and PCBs in dietary fish and marine fish oils\nBack in 1995, Greenpeace scientists sampled 22 brands of fish oils, 17 of which were sold in health food shops as dietary supplements. Of the 22 sampled, 21 contained high levels of hazardous contaminants, namely the organochlorine pesticides DDT, and lindane, and PCBs.34 Greenpeace reported that anyone taking the recommended dose of the worst contaminated oil capsules, obtained from Norwegian salmon, would receive 128 times the UK estimated daily intake of PCBs.\nIn 1997, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) conducted the first Government survey of dioxins and specific PCB congeners in dietary supplements and medicinal products containing fish oils. MAFF concluded that, \u201cthe results confirm earlier reports of relatively high concentrations of these contaminants in fish oils, particularly fish liver oils\u201d. MAFF also noted that consumption of contaminated fish oils could give rise to exposures above the WHO Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI).35\nMAFF conducted its first comprehensive survey for dioxins and PCBs in 132 samples of marine fish in 1999. All 132 fish samples analysed (cod, haddock, plaice, whiting, red fish, herring, mackerel, salmon and fish fingers) contained dioxins and PCBs.36 A World Wildlife Fund commentary on the findings of this survey concludes that the concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals found in the samples were at a level which meant that some of the EU fish-eating population, particularly children, would regularly exceed the WHO TDI.37 Also following this research, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) recommended that people should only consume on average one portion of oily fish each week to ensure that the \u201cmajority\u201d of individuals do not exceed maximum recommended levels for dioxins and PCBs.36\nRecent surveys carried out in 2002 by both the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the Food Safety Authority for Ireland (FSAI) confirm that fish oils still contain detectable levels of dioxins. The FSA found that 12 of 33 samples of branded fish oil supplements bought from UK retailers contained concentrations of dioxins which exceeded the European Commission\u2019s limit for dioxins in fish for human oil consumption (2ng/kg limit in fish oil for dioxins, in effect from 1 July 2002).38 The Irish study found that 10 out of 15 top selling brands of fish oil and fish liver oil capsules exceeded the new European dioxin level limits and in one case, the dioxin level was five times this maximum limit.39\nIn an October 2002 article entitled \u201cFish \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\u201d, the Consumers\u2019 Association added its caution to the growing numbers warning about contaminants in oily fish. The Consumers\u2019 Association reported that eating more than one portion of oily fish a week increased the chances of exceeding the TDI for dioxins and PCBs, and they estimated that as much as a third of the UK population was exceeding the TDI for PCB contaminants. Their report went on to warn that the high levels of dioxins and PCBs found in the FSA 2002 survey could \u201cput millions at risk\u201d, especially in light of the Consumers\u2019 Association own survey findings that a fifth of people who eat fish also took a daily fish oil supplement.40 The total fish oil market accounts for two percent of the total world fat and food oil production. Fish oils are used widely by the European baking industry and their use is also widespread in the\nmanufacture of products such as biscuits, margarine and ice cream. Greenpeace suggest that the food industry use of fish oils in the manufacture of foods is another route by which people can take in toxic chemicals.41\nMercury in dietary fish\nAccording to COT (The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment), methylmercury (organic mercury) in fish makes the most significant contribution to dietary exposure to mercury. Mercury is a poison that is known to affect the kidneys and central nervous system (CNS).42\nFollowing a comprehensive 2003 survey on the level of mercury contamination in fish by the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Agency advised that \u201cpregnant and breastfeeding women, and women who intend to become pregnant, should limit their consumption of tuna\u2026..and avoid eating shark, swordfish and marlin\u201d. The basis for this advice is the fear that mercury can harm the developing nervous system of an unborn child. The FSA advice goes on to state that children under 16 should also avoid eating shark, swordfish and marlin and that other consumers should eat no more than one portion a week.43\nThe FSA survey showed that almost all fish eaten contains detectable levels of methylmercury and that dietary exposure estimates for some consumers were close to or exceeded safety guidelines. The three species with the highest mercury content were shark, swordfish and marlin, having mean mercury levels of 1.52, 1.36 and 1.09 mg/kg respectively. These are above the safety levels defined by European Community (EC) Regulation 221/2002 which is 0.5mg of mercury/kg for fish in general and 1.0mg/kg for these larger predatory fish. Fresh tuna contained 0.40mg mercury/kg, whereas canned tuna contained 0.19mg/kg.43\nAlongside maximum levels of mercury set for fish, the WHO has set figures for humans. The WHO recommendation is that a Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) of 0.3 mg total mercury should not be exceeded, of which no more than 0.2 mg should be present as methylmercury in a 60kg adult, equivalent to 3.3 mg/kg bodyweight.\nOne study by Storelli and colleagues has sought to determine mercury levels in tuna caught in the Mediterranean sea and calculate from this whether the PTWI could be exceeded. In this study, average total mercury concentrations were 1.18mg/kg wet weight in bluefin tuna and the total mercury concentrations exceeded the maximum level fixed by the EC in over 60% of the bluefin tuna analysed. The estimated weekly intake of bluefin tuna in this population would mean that the PTWI was far exceeded.44 The Storelli team has also found other edible fish in the Mediterranean to be similarly contaminated with mercury. The authors conclude by stating that mercury intake via the consumption of some fish species could be a matter of concern.45 In view of these and other studies, researchers in the field stress that mercury in fish must continue to be monitored closely in order to assess risks of mercury contamination.46\nTo confuse the issue further, different countries give varying advice about mercury-contaminated fish. Officials in Sweden are so concerned about mercury contamination, that official advice states that women should eat no more than one portion a month of oily fish caught in certain places.40\nResearch published in 2003 in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal found that a high proportion of 116 subjects identified as being high fish consumers had blood mercury levels which exceeded the maximum safe level (5ug/l) recommended by the US\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and National Academy of Sciences. Interestingly, within 41 weeks, the blood mercury levels in 65 of 67 subjects who reduced their fish intake fell below this threshold.47\nThis research contrasts well with a study commissioned by MAFF in 2000 into dietary exposures of vegetarians to metals found in food. This study failed to detect any mercury at all in the sampled vegetarian diets. MAFF concluded, \u201cit is reasonable to assume that because the participants in this study did not eat fish, their dietary exposures to mercury will be substantially less than those of the general population\u201d.48\nMercury and Heart Disease\nMercury contamination in fish could also very well limit any heart disease risk reduction benefits supposedly arising from the EFAs they contain \u2013 the major reason oily fish are promoted in the diet in the first place!\nIn 1995, Salonen demonstrated that a high intake of mercury from eating non-fatty fish, and the subsequent mercury accumulation in the body, are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), as well as death from coronary heart disease. An average daily fish intake of 30g or more was associated with a twofold increase MI risk. For each additional 10g of fish intake per day there was an increment of five per cent in the five-year risk of MI. No surprise that the authors of this study concluded by stating that fish may contain agents not so healthy to the human cardiovascular system.49\nA paper published in 2002 by Guallar and colleagues further examines the possibility that mercury increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Mercury may predispose to heart disease by promoting the production of free radicals \u2013 unstable molecules that damage body cells. Guallar\u2019s team found that mercury levels were directly related to risk of MI and concluded that the risk of heart disease in a population may depend on the balance between omega-3 fatty acids and the methylmercury in fish consumed. The Food and Drink Administration (FDA) in America have also advised that high-risk groups such as pregnant women do not eat fish with high levels of mercury like swordfish and shark. The authors of this report say their results raise the possibility that this advice be extended to the general adult population too.50\nMercury and infertility\nMercury is also implicated as a possible cause of infertility. A recent study has revealed that higher blood mercury concentrations are associated with both male and female infertility. Choy and colleagues found that when compared with fertile couples, infertile couples had significantly higher blood mercury levels. What this work also revealed was that within the infertile population itself, those eating more seafood had elevated levels of mercury in the blood. The researchers concluded by stating that \u201creduction in dietary consumption of seafood is a measure that may be effective in controlling the accumulation of mercury\u201d.51\nWild versus farmed \u2013 health and nutritional concerns\nDue to pressures of over-fishing, a greater proportion of fish now eaten is from farmed fish. In fact fish farming is the world\u2019s fastest growing sector of food production. In addition to ethical and environmental implications (including nutrient and chemical pollution and harmful impacts on wild fish populations)52, there are also health and nutritional concerns in relation to eating farmed fish. Whilst oily fish are promoted as heart-friendly on the basis of their fatty acid profile, there are important differences between farmed and wild fish. Farmed salmon, for instance, can contain two to three times less of the heart-healthy omega-3 fats as well as 15% less protein. Farmed fish can also contain chemical pesticide residues as well as dangerous levels of toxic man-made chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).53\nA 2002 study into preliminary examinations of the chemical contaminants of edible fish makes for worrying reading. Researchers have found that farmed salmon show higher levels of PCBs, organochlorine pesticides (OPs) and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) than wild salmon. In fact, the farmed salmon had 10 times greater toxic potential than wild salmon. The most likely explanation for this was that the feed given to farmed salmon \u2013 fish oil and fishmeal \u2013 was itself contaminated with these chemicals from industrial pollution of the sea.54\nResearch conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), published in August 2003, found that on average, farmed salmon, had 16 times the dioxin-like PCBs found in wild salmon. A sample of Scottish salmon was found to have the highest levels of PCBs of all the salmon tested. The EWG noted that in addition to contaminated fishmeal, farmed salmon are intentionally fattened and can therefore accumulate more PCBs than wild salmon.55 In fact, health fears about farmed fish never seem to be far away, whether it\u2019s PCB contamination, the excess use of antibiotics or the administering of additive fish colouring pigments (like canthaxantin, which is banned for direct human consumption). One of the most recent concerns has revolved around the detectability of a banned fungicide residue, suspected of causing genetic mutations that can lead to malignant tumours in humans. More than a year after being banned, 19% of salmon sampled by the Government\u2019s Veterinary Medicines Directorate tested positive for the fungicide Leuco Malachite Green.56\nAnd yet another concern came to light in June 2003 when Greenpeace published results of a study, undertaken by Southampton University, which found that nuclear waste was found in supermarket salmon. The study found that four out of seven tested samples of farmed smoked salmon on sale in leading British supermarkets contained detectable levels of radioactive Technetium-99 waste. Greenpeace concluded that nuclear pollution from Sellafield was contaminating Scottish farmed salmon.57 So, farmed fish are very far from the environmentally friendly and safe choice we are led to believe they are \u2013 and from a health perspective, when fish are farmed they lose some of their protective EFAs. All in all a new alternative is needed to supply EFAs in the diet.\nPublic perceptions and the misguided promotion of fish\nFancy fish? \u2013 UK public unimpressed and confused\nDespite the constant message that fish is a healthy and necessary part of the diet, the UK public just don\u2019t buy it \u2013 metaphorically speaking as well as literally! According to the FSA\u2019s 2002, National Diet and Nutrition Survey of Adults Aged 19 to 64 Years, average oily fish consumption is only 53g a week, representing only about a third of a single portion. This meagre quantity falls well short of the Agency\u2019s advice for people to eat two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily (a portion is approximately 140g). This is also a tiny amount compared to the 200-400g weekly intake of oily fish that have been administered to produce heart benefits in research studies. And in any case, only four out of 10 men (41%) and less then half of women (47%) eat any of the oil-rich fish that provide the healthy EFAs.58\nQuantitatively, fish is far from being the most significant overall source of omega-3 fatty acids in the British diet. Compared to the 14% contribution of total omega-3 fatty acids in the average diet, both vegetables and cereal products are more important dietary sources, contributing 22% and 17% respectively.59\nIn a recent paper, Mantzioris and colleagues discuss the ineffectiveness of recommendations to increase fish consumption. They explain that as modern Western societies consume little fish, an increase in fish consumption to the levels advised would involve major dietary changes. In conclusion they state, \u201cthis dietary approach is not an effective way to achieve an increase in the consumption of n-3 fatty acids at a community or clinical level\u201d.60 Thus, from a public health point of view, encouraging the general population to eat fish in order to gain healthy amounts of EFAs is simply not working. Fish are a high maintenance food \u2013 they go off quickly, are greasy and smelly and in some people can cause stomach problems. With their nice little side order of possible toxic chemicals, fish need one heck of a PR guru! But they had better start soon for many species are facing imminent extinction \u2013 and won\u2019t be around for a quick makeover session with the spin-doctors for very long. And as we have seen, farmed fish is not the solution.\nThe issue of environmental contamination of fish is the principal reason why the FSA from time to time change their recommendations on how much, who should and who shouldn\u2019t eat what types of fish. However, the FSA advice is sometimes far from clear and it is easy to find statements which are contradictory. For instance, advice on the FSA website is clear that two portions of fish should be eaten weekly.61 However, the FSA leaflets entitled \u201cFish and shellfish\u201d and \u201cMercury in fish: your questions answered\u201d, advise that at least two servings of fish should be eaten per week.\nAnd when it comes to oily fish, public confusion reins! A 2002 Consumers\u2019 Association survey found that only a sixth of fish eaters knew the FSA advice to eat oily fish once a week and most people were confused by what was meant by oily fish (14% thought that cod was an oily fish!). More than half thought the advice was to eat two or more portions per week and 61% had no idea that oily fish may contain contaminants. The Consumers\u2019 Association reports that the FSA was unable to provide any clear answers about the health implications of eating more than one portion per week. They also criticise the FSA for not providing any guidance about what constitutes a portion. Just as alarming is the fact that no-one surveyed could give details of the FSA advice about mercury and fish and nobody could name any of the fish which pregnant women, breastfeeding women and children were advised to avoid.40 So, not only are the UK public not interested in eating fish in the amounts recommended, the guidance itself is unclear and misunderstood, and in any case little known. Public confusion rules the day!\nPromoting fish \u2013 A licence to carry on eating an unhealthy diet\nMarckmann and Gronbaek have demonstrated that fish is not a necessary part of the diet for people who are at low-risk of heart disease.23 It is therefore surely better to combat heart disease by encouraging a heart-friendly diet in the first instance \u2013 a plant-based diet. Many people following the current FSA recommendation to eat two portions of fish a week, including one oily portion of fish, may be misleadingly reassured that this \u2018health-promoting panacea\u2019 permits them to carry on with their saturated fat-laden diets \u2013 after all, that side order of oily fish will keep the heart happy! Or else, why not pop a fish pill rather than make changes towards a healthy diet? So, promoting fish as \u2018heart friendly\u2019 could actually deter individuals from making the fundamental dietary changes necessary for real long-term heart and body health. Dietitian Sandra Hood puts this succinctly when she states that \u201cthe consumption of fatty fish is encouraged as a form of damage limitation\u201d.62 A far healthier and simpler solution would be to promote a more plant-centred diet that included EFA-rich seeds, nuts and oils. Plants, not fish, are the way forward for health.\nPlant sources \u2013 towards a more popular source of healthy fats\nPlant EFA\u2019s lead the way\nIf you invented a wish list for an EFA-containing food it would probably read something like this. First and foremost, it would need to be EFA-rich and heart-friendly. Just as importantly, it would need to taste good, be versatile in the kitchen, be environmentally sustainable (so it could be cultivated), not go off too quickly (or come ready-packaged with a protective skin), be less likely to be environmentally contaminated by pollutants like PCBs or mercury, be easily handled (so it didn\u2019t make your hands greasy) and be nonsmelly. Pretty tall order you might think for a food. But plant sources of EFAs fulfil all these criteria and more \u2013 think nuts, seeds, beans and green leafy vegetables. Brown and red algae are now even being grown commercially for EPA and DHA.63\nHumble nuts and seeds are also true wonder foods. They are EFArich, can be grown for indefinite harvests and come protected in a shell or seed. According to one of the world\u2019s experts on EFAs, LNAcontaining seeds are available in fresher conditions than fish oils (because they are simpler to produce), are much less likely to be contaminated with pollutants and are also more stable (coming ready-packaged with the antioxidant vitamin E).64 Additionally, of course from studies like the LYON trials, plant-derived LNA is known to be heart healthy. Plant sources of EFAs have huge advantages over fish sources of EFAs and yet are ignored by nutritionists intent on promoting fish to an unimpressed public.\nAntioxidants in plants protect EFAs\nAntioxidants, such as vitamins C, E and beta-carotene (the precursor of vitamin A) are the body\u2019s main defence against free radicals (for instance, the mercury found in fish) and are found abundantly in plant foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, seeds and nuts. But antioxidants are vital for another important function \u2013 a function that demonstrates why plant sources of EFAs win hands down nutritionally over fish-derived EFAs.\nEFAs spoil very easily, but antioxidants help to slow down the decaying process. This can be evidenced most delightfully if you happen to pass a fish stall \u2013 that \u2018fishy\u2019 smell is an indication that the EFAs present in the fish are starting to putrefy! Plant sources of EFAs like seeds and nuts naturally come ready-packaged with the antioxidants needed to stop them going off \u2013 in particular vitamin E. It\u2019s a bit like one of those special offers you get at the supermarket \u2013 \u2018buy one get one free\u2019. Eating seeds or nuts means you are buying the beneficial EFAs and getting their natural protector (vitamin E) free, all in the same neat package. Not so if you choose to get your EFAs from fish as fish is not a source of vitamin E. As an ironic twist of fate, balanced vegetarian diets, and even more so vegan ones, supply far more of these protective antioxidants than your typical omnivorous diet 65 \u2013 but since the veggie diets eschew some of the harmful foods like meat and fish they probably need these vitamins less in the first place!\nPlant EFA\u2019s defined\nSo, what exactly are the better alternatives to fish-derived EFAs?\nPlant sources of EFAs\n"}, {"score": 1605.3706, "uuid": "4cc0b7e3-7175-5c88-ada9-945584d2308e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0607wb-38-16455", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/diabetes/report/why-do-people-become-diabetic-lifestyle.html", "page_rank": 1.2262538e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "An extensive, 21-year study involving over 25,000 adults in <em>the</em> USA found that diabetes <em>is</em> less frequent among <em>vegetarians</em> <em>and</em> <em>vegans</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Why do people become diabetic?\nLifestyle and environmental factors\nLifestyle plays an enormous role in either increasing or decreasing the risk of developing the disease. Even if both parents have diabetes, it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that the child will develop it, too.\nType 1 diabetes\nIt has been known for many years that type 1 diabetes is triggered by some external stimulus. The widely accepted theory is that a viral or another infection might be the culprit, making the body attack its insulin producing cells by mistake. However, the hypothesis that cow\u2019s milk is the main trigger was put forward in the 1990\u2019s (Karjalainen et al., 1992; Gerstein, 1994; \u00c5kerblom and Knip, 1998) and has been progressively more accepted ever since.\nIf an individual has a certain combination of genes making them more susceptible to type 1 diabetes, the environmental trigger is the key which opens the door to the disease but if the trigger is avoided, diabetes may never develop. The theory is as follows (Campbell and Campbell, 2004; Knip et al., 2005):\nA baby with a susceptible genetic make-up is exposed to cows\u2019 milk early in life, perhaps through an infant formula. The baby\u2019s immune system might be further compromised by a virus infection, increasing the risk for type 1 diabetes. When the milk proteins reach the\nsmall intestine they are not fully digested \u2013 i.e. broken down into individual amino acids \u2013 but are instead broken down into amino acid chains. These fragments may be absorbed through the gut wall into the blood where the immune system recognises them as foreign intruders and begins attacking them through an immune response. Coincidentally, the structure of\nsome of these fragments is identical to the surface structure of insulin producing cells (\u00df-cells) in the pancreas (Karjalainen et al., 1992; Martin et al., 1991) and the body cannot distinguish between the two. Pancreas \u00df-cells are therefore attacked and destroyed by the immune system as well as the milk protein fragments and the infant becomes diabetic. Type 1\ndiabetes is irreversible as the cells cannot regenerate.\nThe process of \u00df-cell destruction can be fast and aggressive, leading to disease manifestation within a few months, or it can be slow and last for years, in some cases even more than 10 years with \u00df-cells being gradually destroyed over this period (Knip et al.,\n2005). However, the fast progression of the disease is rare (Knip, 2002).\nResearch has established which milk proteins are responsible for this dramatic autoimmune reaction. Karjalainen et al. (1992) suggest that the main one is bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is different in structure to human albumin (milk protein). They tested the blood of type 1 diabetic and non-diabetic children for the presence of antibodies against incompletely digested BSA. The results were astonishing \u2013 all diabetic children had antibody levels\nas much as seven times higher than the healthy children and there was no overlap in the antibody levels between the diabetic and healthy children \u2013 i.e. all diabetic children had high levels but none of the non-diabetic children did.\nAfter that, a number of studies ensued and all but one found markedly elevated levels of BSA antibodies in the blood of diabetic children (Hammond-McKibben and Dosch, 1997).\nAnother protein abundant in cow\u2019s milk is \u00df-casein, which also generates a specific immune response (Cavallo et al., 1996). The structure of human \u00df-casein is similar in many respects to bovine \u00df-casein (from cow\u2019s milk) but 30 per cent of the molecule is different in structure. This difference is assumed to be the reason why the immune system reacts to it. Again there are structural similarities between bovine casein and the surface molecules of \u00df-cells in the pancreas, just as there is with BSA, provoking an immunological cross-reactivity \u2013 the\nimmune system attacks \u00df-casein molecules as well as the \u00df-cells (Cavallo et al., 1996; Becker et al, 1995).\nA Chilean study conducted around the same time focused on the combination of susceptible genes and cow\u2019s milk (Perez-Bravo et al., 1996). The findings revealed that genetically susceptible children weaned too early onto cow\u2019s milk-based formula had 13.1 times greater risk of developing type 1 diabetes than children breast-fed for at least three months and who\ndid not have susceptible genes.\nIn 2000, an extensive study of children from 40 different countries confirmed a link between diet and type 1 diabetes (Muntoni et al., 2000). The study set out to examine the relationship between dietary energy from major food groups and type 1 diabetes. Energy intake per se was not associated with type 1 diabetes but energy from animal sources (meat and dairy foods) showed a significant association whereas energy from plant sources was inversely associated with diabetes. In other words, the more meat and milk in the diet, the higher the incidence of diabetes and the more plant-based foods in the diet, the lower the incidence.\nIn the meantime, it was discovered that there are five autoantibodies \u2013 antibodies which will attack their own host body \u2013 and the presence of these autoantibodies can predict the development of type 1 diabetes (Knip, 2002). In addition to the two which attack \u00df-cells, together with two supporting antibodies, there is one which will attack insulin itself. It was suggested that cow\u2019s insulin present in formula milk increases the formation of these\nantibodies (Vaarala et al., 1999). A Finnish study of children at increased risk of type 1 diabetes (having at least one close relative with the disease) showed that the immune system of infants given cow\u2019s milk formula as early as three-months old, reacted strongly to cow\u2019s insulin by forming these specific antibodies (Paronen et al., 2000).\nResults of another study following infants from birth (\u00c5kerblom et al., 2002) showed that exclusively breastfeeding for only a short period followed by the introduction of cow\u2019s milk, predisposed these children to \u00df-cell-destroying autoimmune reactions by inducing formation of four culprit autoantibodies. Other population studies have shown that if three or four of these antibodies are present in blood, the risk of developing type 1 diabetes in the next five to 10 years is 60\u2013100 per cent (Knip et al., 2005).\nType 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes often accompanies obesity. In fact, obesity is the main risk factor, particularly abdominal obesity, and over 80 per cent of people with diabetes are overweight or obese (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007). It has recently been shown that the association between type 2 diabetes and abdominal obesity is equally significant for both\nsexes (Paek and Chun, 2010).\nAccording to latest statistics (NHS, 2011), almost a quarter of adults in England (22 per cent of men and 24 per cent of women) were classified as obese. In addition, 44 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women in England were classified as overweight. The numbers of obese children \u2013 16 per cent of boys and 15 per cent of girls (aged two to 15) \u2013 are also alarming. With these rising numbers of overweight people, the risk of diabetes is ever-increasing.\nPercentage of overweight and obese people in England in 2009 (NHS, 2011):\nAge group\n"}, {"score": 1587.4308, "uuid": "08ebcd88-bf02-5978-b4ec-a47ad971ef23", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-65-22334", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/whitelies/wlreport14.shtml", "page_rank": 1.2256353e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "This dairy-free infant formula <em>is</em> nutritionally complete <em>and</em> can be used from birth.

It also provides all eight of the essential amino acids which the human body requires. Soya milk is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids including omega-3, and is free of cholesterol. Compared to cow\u2019s milk, soya milk contains lower levels of saturated fat and higher levels of unsaturated essential fatty acids which can lower cholesterol levels in the body. Soya products provide an excellent source of B vitamins, calcium, iron and zinc. Soya also contains fibre which is important for good bowel health and can also lower cholesterol.\nIn recent years, soya milk and soya-based products have received much attention because of the phytoestrogens that they contain. Phytoestrogens are plant-made substances that can act in a similar way to the hormone oestrogen, although they are far less potent (Coldham et al., 1997). They are found in many fruits, vegetables, dried beans, peas, and whole grains. Isoflavones are a type of phytoestrogen found in soya beans and include genistein and daidzein. In general, much of the data indicates that isoflavones are beneficial to health. For example, isoflavones may have a protective role against heart disease. The UK\u2019s Joint Health Claims Initiative (JHCI) offers pre-market advice and a code of practice for the food industry, enforcers and consumers, to ensure that health claims on foods are both scientifically truthful and legally acceptable. In 2002 the JHCI concluded its deliberations on a generic health claim for soya protein and blood cholesterol. The claim approved states that \u201cthe inclusion of at least 25 grams soya protein per day as part of a diet low in saturated fat can help reduce blood cholesterol\u201d (JHCI, 2005).\u00a0 In addition to the benefits to heart health, isoflavones have been shown to offer other health benefits. For example, they may have a role in reducing menopausal symptoms; dietary soya supplementation has been shown to substantially reduce the frequency of hot flushes in some postmenopausal women (Albertazzi et al, 1998). While only a few clinical studies have examined the influence of phytoestrogens on bone health, a review of the current research states that the collective data suggests that diets rich in phytoestrogens have bone-sparing effects in the long term, in other words the data indicates that phytoestrogens may be beneficial to bone health (Setchell and Lydeking-Olsen, 2003).\nConversely, research focusing on the hormonal content of cow\u2019s milk has not been widely discussed and surprisingly very little research has been published on this topic. Cow\u2019s milk contains the hormones oestrogen, progesterone and a range of hormone precursors (androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate, and 5\u00aa-reduced steroids like 5\u00aa-androstanedione, 5\u00aa-pregnanedione, and dihydrotestosterone). Some researchers are particularly concerned about the oestrogen content of cow\u2019s milk (Ganmaa and Sato, 2005), suggesting that cow\u2019s milk is one of the important routes of human exposure to oestrogens. What concerns them is that the nature of cow\u2019s milk has changed drastically over the last hundred years, in that for most of the time that a cow is milked, she is also pregnant and therefore secreting hormones into the milk. The levels of these hormones in cow\u2019s milk increases markedly during pregnancy and has been linked to a wide range of illnesses and diseases including certain hormone-dependent cancers such as ovarian and breast cancer.\nConsistent levels of soya isoflavones have been a component of the diet of many populations for centuries and the consumption of soya is generally regarded as beneficial for health with a potentially protective effect against a number of chronic diseases because of their oestrogenic activity. A recent review of the current literature concluded that when viewed in its entirety, the current literature supports the safety of isoflavones as typically consumed in diets based on soya or containing soya products (Munro et al., 2003).\nSoya-based infant formula\nBecause soya-based infant formula is such a popular alternative to cow\u2019s milk formula, it was decided to include a separate section on it here. Soya protein-based nutrition during infancy has a long history of safe use around the world dating back centuries. The first report of soya-based infant formula in the West was recorded in 1909 (Ruhrah, 1909) and soya-based infant formula was used in cases of infantile eczema as early as in the 1920s (Hill and Stuart, 1929). Since these early days soya-based infant formula has come a long way; it now contains all the nutrients needed by an infant and can be used as a safe alternative or supplement to breast milk if necessary.\nSoya-based infant formulas have been more widely used in the UK since the 1960s and are currently fed to approximately one per cent of non-breast fed infants aged four to 10 weeks rising to approximately two per cent of infants aged 10-14 weeks (Hamlyn et al., 2002). However, the UK Foods Standards Agency advises that you should only give your baby soya-based infant formula if your GP or health visitor advises you to (FSA, 2005). They also state that in almost all cases, breast feeding or another type of formula will be a better choice, and suggest that if you are giving your baby soya-based infant formula at the moment, you should talk to your GP or health visitor about changing to a different formula (FSA, 2005). This reflects concerns about the use of soya-based infant formulas. Based largely on anecdotal and animal-based experimental evidence, these concerns have focused on the nutritional adequacy of soya-based infant formula, the effect of phytoestrogens, genetically modified soya and the effects of glucose syrup (which is used in place of lactose). These concerns are addressed below.\nNutritional adequacy\nSoya-based infant formulas are formulated to meet all of the nutrient requirements of the growing infant. A number of studies have documented normal growth and development in infants fed soya-based infant formulas. One study compared weight, length and head circumference of healthy term infants to one year of age, fed either soya-based formula, or exclusively breast fed for at least two months then weaned on to cow\u2019s milk formula. Results demonstrated similar growth in the first year of life between groups (Lasekan et al., 1999). Another, more recent study compared the nutritional status and growth of 168 infants who were allergic to cow\u2019s milk and were fed either soya-based infant formula or extensively hydrolysed whey formula. Results showed that in both groups, nutrient intake and growth were within reference values confirming the safety and effectiveness of the soya-based formula (Seppo et al., 2005).\nThere is currently only one vegan infant soya formula on the market: Farley\u2019s Soya Formula, produced by Heinz. This dairy-free infant formula is nutritionally complete and can be used from birth. It contains no animal products, so it is suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. It is also suitable for infants who require a diet free from lactose.\nPhytoestrogens\nThe role of phytoestrogens in the diet has become a somewhat controversial area with warnings focusing particularly on the safety of soya-based infant formulas. Various animal experiments (primarily using rodents and primates) have suggested that phytoestrogens can elicit oestrogenic effects with respect to sexual development and reproductive function. However, it is widely acknowledged that the results of animal experiments should not form the basis of a public health policy as significant differences in biological function between rodents, primates and humans make the interpretation of these types of experimental studies extremely difficult. Just one single human study has specifically examined the effect of soya formula feeding on sexual development and fertility (Strom et al., 2001). This study examined the association between exposure to soya formula in infancy and reproductive health in adulthood. The results provided no evidence of adverse clinical effects on sexual development or reproductive health of males and females. Indeed the authors of this study stated that their findings were reassuring about the safety of infant soya formula.\nIn 1998 a review on isoflavones, soya-based infant formulas and hormone function reported that growth was normal and no changes in timing of puberty or in infertility rates were reported in humans who consumed soya formulas as infants (Klein, 1998). The author concluded that soya-based infant formulas continue to be a safe, nutritionally complete feeding option for most infants.\nHowever in 2003, in response to concerns about the oestrogenic properties of phytoestrogens the UK Department of Health\u2019s committee of independent experts, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) reviewed the health aspects of phytoestrogens as part of an ongoing programme of reviews on naturally-occurring chemicals (COT, 2003). This report attempted to assess, on the basis of current evidence, if ingestion of soya-based infant formulas poses any risk for human infants.\nThe report compared estimated dietary isoflavone intakes in Western and Eastern populations and found that Eastern populations have a significantly higher intake of phytoestrogens. While in the UK, the US, Australia and New Zealand isoflavone intakes tend to range from around 0.8 milligrams per day to 17.0 milligrams per day, intakes in Japan, China and Korea range from 18.0 milligrams per day to 200 milligrams per day. These figures do not include data collected from one group of vegans in New Zealand whose intake was found to be 140.0 milligrams per day (COT, 2003). The COT estimated that the daily isoflavone intake of a soya formula fed infant is approximately 40 milligrams per day (COT, 2003), above the average Western intake but well within the range of intakes seen in Eastern countries.\nIn a cautionary statement the COT warned that isoflavones may lower free thyroxine concentrations and advised that physicians and other health care workers be aware of possible interactions between isoflavones in soya-based infant formulas and thyroid function, particularly in infants with congenital hypothyroidism. That said, the report concluded that the findings from a wide range of studies did not provide direct evidence that phytoestrogens present in soya-based infant formulas can adversely affect the health of infants. However, they said that the findings did provide evidence of potential risks. For this reason, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) considered there to be no substantive medical need for, nor health benefit arising from, the use of soya-based infant formulas and together with the COT recommended that the Department of Health reviewed current advice on the use of soya-based infant formulas.\nThe report did acknowledge that there is no evidence that populations which habitually ingest high quantities of soya (such as the Chinese or Japanese) have impaired fertility or altered sexual development. Despite this, they recommended that research should be undertaken as a matter of high priority to determine whether ingestion of soya-based formulas can affect infant reproductive development in any way. Interestingly, the United Kingdom and New Zealand are the only countries to have issued such advice with specific reference to phytoestrogens and soya-based infant formulas.\nThis is a controversial issue which has yet to be resolved. The FSA advise that, until a full review of the evidence both supporting and opposing soya formula has been completed, there is no reason to stop your baby having a soya formula if it has been suggested by a health professional. This it would seem is erring of the side of extreme caution given that thousands of babies have been raised on soya-based infant formula.\nGenetically modified soya\nIt is relatively recently that the genetic modification (GM) of organisms (plants and animals) has developed as a technology. However, GM technology has not been welcomed by the British public; many people are deeply suspicious and mistrustful of the science. We have been reassured in the past that certain foods are quite safe to eat only to find that they are not. Many of us will remember in 1990, just before the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, John Gummer feeding his daughter a beef burger and saying that beef was perfectly safe, it was not.\nThe mistrust remains and many questions have gone unanswered. For example, have the transgenic plants grown so far met expectations? Evidence suggests that in many cases they have not met the high yields expected. What is the real risk of transgenic contamination between genetically modified (GM) and unmodified plants? This question refers to the contamination of an unmodified crop with pollen from a GM plant. The pollen of the GM plant will carry copies of the foreign genes that were used confer some additional characteristic to the plant. These may encode pesticide resistance for example along with antibiotic resistance marker genes that were used to identify the successfully modified plants when they were first produced. The question of contamination is difficult to answer as it may be years or even decades before we can assess the full extent of transgenic contamination, but so far evidence suggests widespread contamination has occurred in some parts of the world.\nAnother concern is that the genetic material (DNA or genes) may be transferred from GM foods to bacteria in the human gut and from there into human tissue. There is experimental evidence that DNA from GM soya has been taken up by bacteria in the small intestines of human volunteers (Netherwood et al., 2004). This raises concerns that bacteria in the gut (for example Lactobacillus) might then transfer that DNA into our intestinal epithelial cells. What effect this may have on human health will largely depend on what the gene does; it may do nothing but is that a risk worth taking? Finally, as a result of a lack of funding, scientists are sometimes forced to adopt the corporate agenda, which is not necessarily the same as the public good. For example, Monsanto has used genetic engineering to produce herbicide resistance crops thus increasing sales of its herbicide Roundup.\nGM products, especially soya and maize, are now in so many foods, including baby milks, that it can be difficult to avoid them. We do not yet know enough about this technology to confidently say what the long term effects of it will be but consumers appear to be voting with their shopping baskets by avoiding GM foods as far as possible. The good news for vegan babies is that Heinz state that no GM ingredients at all are used in Farley\u2019s Soya Formula (Heinz, 2005). In addition, SMA Nutrition and Cow and Gate also state that no GM soya is used in their soya-based infant formulas (SMA Nutrition, 2006; Cow and Gate, 2006).\nGlucose syrup and tooth decay\nAnother concern with infant soya formula is that the glucose syrup content may harm teeth. All infant formulas must comply with standards laid down by UK regulations which specify minimum and maximum amounts of carbohydrate (the body\u2019s main form of energy). The carbohydrate in cow\u2019s milk is the sugar lactose, in soya-based infant formula an alternative carbohydrate is used: glucose syrup. Glucose syrup is often confused with sugars but in fact is derived from corn starch and is not the same as glucose or syrup. It is mainly made up of beneficial complex carbohydrates (starches) rather than simple carbohydrates (sugars) which are known to be harmful to teeth. Research has shown that soya infant formulas are no more likely to cause tooth decay than other infant formulas (Moynihan, 1996).\nTooth decay can be the result of many factors, not only the presence of sugars in a food and drink but how they are consumed. It has been shown that prolonged contact of sugary foods and drinks with teeth increases the risk of tooth decay significantly. Children should be encouraged to drink water if they are thirsty as it quenches the thirst, maintains body fluid levels, does not spoil the appetite and is safe for teeth. Fresh fruit juice provides a good source of vitamin C and can be given with meals to help the absorption of iron. However, fresh fruit juices are acidic so may be harmful to teeth and should be diluted with water. Furthermore, juice should be served in a cup rather than a bottle to minimise the risk of tooth decay. Children should be discouraged from consuming sugary carbonated drinks and squashes as these contribute to dental problems, are a poor source of nutrients and tend to displace other more nutritious foods.\u00a0 If normal weaning practices are adopted, soya infant formulas should not cause harm to teeth (Moynihan, 1996).\nIn summary, soya-based infant formulas continue to provide a safe feeding option for most infants. They meet all the nutritional requirements of the infant with none of the detrimental effects associated with the consumption of cow\u2019s milk formulas.\n"}, {"score": 1608.3525, "uuid": "0840202e-8765-5ee3-b531-61c9d6051ab1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1906wb-57-17112", "target_hostname": "www.shalomveg.com", "target_uri": "http://www.shalomveg.com//index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=142&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=80", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "ShalomVeg.com - Being <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em>", "snippet": "diabetic&#x27; reipces are reipces for healthy food.these are low in fat, high in fibre, <em>and</em> <em>vegetarian</em> food <em>is</em> perfect for diabetics as it <em>is</em> very healthy.now there <em>is</em> <em>a</em> HUGH <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>vegans</em> <em>and</em> <em>vegetarians</em> so you must make sure you know <em>what</em> she prefers!!", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1594.0852, "uuid": "0d1302a8-e56b-515d-8552-e42124969981", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0707wb-87-00860", "target_hostname": "www.vegetariantimes.com", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetariantimes.com/resources/why_go_veg/1122", "page_rank": 1.1748658e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "Becoming <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> | <em>Vegetarian</em> Times", "snippet": "I am going back <em>and</em> forth <em>between</em> Vegetarianism <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em>-ism as I get my footing.

Others have made the switch because we want to preserve Earth\u2019s natural resources or because we\u2019ve always loved animals and are ethically opposed to eating them.\nThanks to an abundance of scientific research that demonstrates the health and environmental benefits of a plant-based diet, even the federal government recommends that we consume most of our calories from grain products, vegetables and fruits. And no wonder: An estimated 70 percent of all diseases, including one-third of all cancers, are related to diet. A vegetarian diet reduces the risk for chronic degenerative diseases such as obesity, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and certain types of cancer including colon, breast, prostate, stomach, lung and esophageal cancer.\nWhy go veg? Chew on these reasons:\nYou\u2019ll ward off disease. Vegetarian diets are more healthful than the average American diet, particularly in preventing, treating or reversing heart disease and reducing the risk of cancer. A low-fat vegetarian diet is the single most effective way to stop the progression of coronary artery disease or prevent it entirely. Cardiovascular disease kills 1 million Americans annually and is the leading cause of death in the United States. But the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease is lower in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians, says Joel Fuhrman, MD, author of Eat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss. A vegetarian diet is inherently healthful because vegetarians consume no animal fat and less cholesterol and instead consume more fiber and more antioxidant-rich produce\u2014another great reason to listen to Mom and eat your veggies!\nYou\u2019ll keep your weight down. The standard American diet\u2014high in saturated fats and processed foods and low in plant-based foods and complex carbohydrates\u2014is making us fat and killing us slowly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a division of the CDC, the National Center for Health Statistics, 64 percent of adults and 15 percent of children aged 6 to 19 are overweight and are at risk of weight-related ailments including heart disease, stroke and diabetes. A study conducted from 1986 to 1992 by Dean Ornish, MD, president and director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, California, found that overweight people who followed a low-fat, vegetarian diet lost an average of 24 pounds in the first year and kept off that weight 5 years later. They lost the weight without counting calories or carbs and without measuring portions or feeling hungry.\nYou\u2019ll live longer. If you switch from the standard American diet to a vegetarian diet, you can add about 13 healthy years to your life, says Michael F. Roizen, MD, author of The RealAge Diet: Make Yourself Younger with What You Eat. \u201cPeople who\nconsume saturated, four-legged fat have a shorter life span and more disability at the end of their lives. Animal products clog your arteries, zap your energy and slow down your immune system. Meat eaters also experience accelerated cognitive and sexual dysfunction at a younger age.\u201d\nWant more proof of longevity? Residents of Okinawa, Japan, have the longest life expectancy of any Japanese and likely the longest life expectancy of anyone in the world, according to a 30-year study of more than 600 Okinawan centenarians. Their secret: a low-calorie diet of unrefined complex carbohydrates, fiber-rich fruits and vegetables, and soy.\nYou\u2019ll build strong bones. When there isn\u2019t enough calcium in the bloodstream, our bodies will leach it from existing bone. The metabolic result is that our skeletons will become porous and lose strength over time. Most health care practitioners recommend that we increase our intake of calcium the way nature intended\u2014 through foods. Foods also supply other nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium and vitamin D that are necessary for the body to absorb and use calcium.\nPeople who are mildly lactose-intolerant can often enjoy small amounts of dairy products such as yogurt, cheese and lactose-free milk. But if you avoid dairy altogether, you can still get a healthful dose of calcium from dry beans, tofu, soymilk and dark green vegetables such as broccoli, kale, collards and turnip greens.\nYou\u2019ll reduce your risk of food-borne illnesses. The CDC reports that food-borne illnesses of all kinds account for 76 million illnesses a year, resulting in 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths in the United States. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), foods rich in protein such as meat, poultry, fish and seafood are frequently involved in food-borne illness outbreaks.\nYou\u2019ll ease the symptoms of menopause. Many foods contain nutrients beneficial to perimenopausal and menopausal women. Certain foods are rich in phytoestrogens, the plant-based chemical compounds that mimic the behavior of estrogen. Since phytoestrogens can increase and decrease estrogen and progesterone levels, maintaining a balance of them in your diet helps ensure a more comfortable passage through menopause. Soy is by far the most abundant natural source of phytoestrogens, but these compounds also can be found in hundreds\nof other foods such as apples, beets, cherries, dates, garlic, olives, plums, raspberries, squash and yams. Because menopause is also associated with weight gain and a slowed metabolism, a low-fat, high-fiber vegetarian diet can help ward off extra pounds.\nYou\u2019ll have more energy. Good nutrition generates more usable energy\u2014energy to keep pace with the kids, tackle that home improvement project or have better sex more often, Michael F. Roizen, MD, says in The RealAge Diet. Too much fat in your bloodstream means that arteries won\u2019t open properly and that your muscles won\u2019t get enough oxygen. The result? You feel zapped. Balanced vegetarian diets are naturally free of cholesterol-laden, artery-clogging animal products that physically slow us down and keep us hitting the snooze button morning after morning. And because whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables are so high in complex carbohydrates, they supply the body with plenty of energizing fuel.\nYou\u2019ll be more \u201cregular.\u201d Eating a lot of vegetables necessarily means consuming more fiber, which pushes waste out of the body. Meat contains no fiber. People who eat lower on the food chain tend to have fewer instances of constipation, hemorrhoids and diverticulitis.\nYou\u2019ll help reduce pollution. Some people become vegetarians after realizing the devastation that the meat industry is having on the environment. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), chemical and animal waste runoff from factory farms is responsible for more than 173,000 miles of polluted rivers and streams. Runoff from farmlands is one of the greatest threats to water quality today. Agricultural activities that cause pollution include confined animal facilities, plowing, pesticide spraying, irrigation, fertilizing and harvesting.\nYou\u2019ll avoid toxic chemicals. The EPA estimates that nearly 95 percent of the pesticide residue in the typical American diet comes from meat, fish and dairy products. Fish, in particular, contain carcinogens (PCBs, DDT) and heavy metals (mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium) that can\u2019t be removed through cooking or freezing. Meat and dairy products can also be laced with steroids and hormones, so be sure to read the labels on the dairy products you purchase.\nYou\u2019ll help reduce famine. About 70 percent of all grain produced in the United States is fed to animals raised for slaughter. The 7 billion livestock animals in the United States consume five times as much grain as is consumed directly by the American population. \u201cIf all the grain currently fed to livestock were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million,\u201d says David Pimentel, professor of ecology at Cornell University. If the grain were exported, it would boost the US trade balance by $80 billion a year.\nYou\u2019ll spare animals. Many vegetarians give up meat because of their concern for animals. Ten billion animals are slaughtered for human consumption each year. And, unlike the farms of yesteryear where animals roamed freely, today most animals are factory farmed\u2014crammed into cages where they can barely move and fed a diet tainted with pesticides and antibiotics. These animals spend their entire lives in crates or stalls so small that they can\u2019t even turn around. Farmed animals are not protected from cruelty under the law\u2014in fact, the majority of state anticruelty laws specifically exempt farm animals from basic humane protection.\nYou\u2019ll save money. Meat accounts for 10 percent of Americans\u2019 food spending. Eating vegetables, grains and fruits in place of the 200 pounds of beef, chicken and fish each nonvegetarian eats annually would cut individual food bills by an average of $4,000 a year.\nYour dinner plate will be full of color. Disease-fighting phytochemicals give fruits and vegetables their rich, varied hues. They come in two main classes: carotenoids and anthocyanins. All rich yellow and orange fruits and vegetables\u2014carrots, oranges, sweet potatoes, mangoes, pumpkins, corn\u2014\u00adowe their color to carotenoids. Leafy green vegetables also are rich in carotenoids but get their green color from chlorophyll. Red, blue and purple fruits and vegetables\u2014plums, cherries, red bell peppers\u2014contain anthocyanins. Cooking by color is a good way to ensure you\u2019re eating a variety of naturally occurring substances that boost immunity and prevent a range of illnesses.\nIt\u2019s a breeze. It\u2019s almost effortless these days to find great-tasting and good-for-you vegetarian foods, whether you\u2019re strolling the aisles of your local supermarket or walking down the street at lunchtime. If you need inspiration in the kitchen, look no further than the Internet, your favorite bookseller or your local vegetarian society\u2019s newsletter for culinary tips and great recipes. And if you\u2019re eating out, almost any ethnic restaurant will offer vegetarian selections. In a hurry? Most fast food and fast casual restaurants now include healthful and inventive salads, sandwiches and entr\u00e9es on their menus. So rather than asking yourself why go vegetarian, the real question is: Why haven\u2019t you gone vegetarian?\n"}, {"score": 1591.9781, "uuid": "44d41d5f-7c1d-5c7a-a1c0-3214036f0523", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0304wb-71-02242", "target_hostname": "www.vegetariantimes.com", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetariantimes.com/resources/why_go_veg/", "page_rank": 3.0009515e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Becoming <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> | <em>Vegetarian</em> Times", "snippet": "I am going back <em>and</em> forth <em>between</em> Vegetarianism <em>and</em> <em>Vegan</em>-ism as I get my footing.

I'm trying to be vegan, but I'm not quite there yet.\n\u2014Guest Jeanne\nwhy I am vegetarian and vegan\nI am allergic to milk products. I became vegetarian because my body refused to digest beef, so I quit eating all animals fifteen years ago. The acid reflux, at that time was awful. Now it is more under control but still not completely gone.\n\u2014Guest Carol-Ann Phillips\nSlowly crepted up on being a veg\nI started slowly becoming a vegetarian. I had to give up meat when I was diagnoised with RA. Then when my thyroid messed up big time I found eating almost a total vegetarian diet helped me a lot. I am learning all there is to know about being a vegetarian and what will work for me to keep me healthy.\n\u2014Guest Cheryl E\nI`m a vegatarian because\nI`m a vegatarian not because I love animals or hate plants but because when I see where the meat comes from i see animals in cages and think they've gone mad. I can't eat an animal that was born in captivity then killed even after they could've gotten sick or gone a little mad but if you see their little faces its just like animal cruelty and I can't stand seeing poor dead animals on the side of the road let alone my plate.\n\u2014Guest meg\nWHY???\nVery simple. My wife and I faced serious health problems. We now no longer get sick at all. No flu, colds or any drugs of any kind. Went vegan 6 years ago. Both are over 62.\n\u2014Troupador\nWhy I went vegetarian\nIn late 1974 (at age 23) I read a book about an anti-cellulite diet; on Jan 1, 1975, I quit eating meat, sugar, processed foods, alcohol, etc. Within a few months I looked and felt better (more energetic) than ever. Before the end of the year, I resumed sugar, alcohol, and fish, but never again have I eatten meat or poultry. And I cut out seafood about 10 years ago. So, initially, it was for very 'shallow' and self-serving reasons. Over the years, I've also become concerned about the unnecessary and cruel treatment of animals bred for slaughter, and about the sanitation of the meat and fish consumed by friends and loved ones.\n\u2014Guest New Dawn\nFor the animals\nI've been vegetarian since I was around 6 years old. It was my choice to become vegetarian. I simply can't stand the idea of eating an animal. It makes me terribly sad to see how animals are treated before finally being slaughtered...now I'm working on going totally vegan and getting rid of my fur and leather, too - it makes me feel great that no animals are harmed for my own food or clothing.\n\u2014Guest Jenny\nBecause I have a heart\nI've always loved animals and wanted to become veg at a young age, but I found it too hard. That all changed at age 15, when my mother asked me to cook a whole chicken for dinner. When I reached inside and found the chicken's heart in my hand, I broke into tears. I became a vegetarian because animals have hearts and I have one too.\n\u2014Guest Nina\nwhy i'm going Veg,\nI really would like to go vegan because i have always struggled with the fact of eating a living animal that has experienced cruelty to get to my plate, and also because i want to lose weight.\n\u2014Guest Beth\nIsn't this part of evolution\nReligious or not, if one thinks of animals (not just as sentient beings), the idea of eating animals is akin to cannibalism, the only difference being of degree; it's like a twin vs 6th cousin twice removed or something like that. From an evolutionary stand-point, this is cannibalism. The health reasons are epiphenomenon, but isn't this evolution of morality as a concept (from not hurting other humans to not hurting animals?)\n\u2014Guest Roshan\nPrevious 421-435 of 557 Next\nWhy did you become veg?\nWhy are you vegetarian?\n"}, {"score": 1585.6708, "uuid": "7fd4f47b-1028-57ce-a518-e6c822f6713f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0405wb-09-21640", "target_hostname": "www.channelone.com", "target_uri": "http://www.channelone.com/life/vegan-vs-vegetarian/", "page_rank": 1.1956472e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>Vegan</em> vs. <em>Vegetarian</em> - Channel One News", "snippet": "<em>And</em>, 0.5 percent of young Americans are <em>vegan</em>.

I\u2019ve given propagandistic explanations of what CAFO\u2019s are. I\u2019ve pressured room mates and lovers, gently but manipulatively, to give up corn syrup and non-organic produce. I\u2019ve been even more sneaky and covert. When my little sister, who will eat only four things, revealed that she was under the misapprehension that kosher meat was ethically raised, I didn\u2019t disabuse her.\nThe kosher food industry has been playing its undeserved part as moral intercessor for a while now. An article like this one in Food Quality , shows that non-Jews invest our religious standards for food as a moral litmus that corresponds to their ethics. This revelation makes me feel proud, but also somewhat angry. The world thinks so highly of us that they\u2019re willing to trust our standards, but Agriprocessors showed that the laws of kashrut have nothing to do with the laws of the rest of the world.\nYet non-kosher folks still purchase kosher products 10 times more than kosher Jews. They don\u2019t seem to understand that Agriprocessors proves that the system of kashrut doesn\u2019t reflect contemporary ethics regarding food safety, workers rights or animal rights ( these are ranged in my perceived order of food issues that get people excited).\nInstead, as Rabbi Seth Mandel stated on the panel at Asilomar, kashrut certifying agencies reflect the laws of kashrut, no more and no less. The fact that Hekhsher Tzedek changed its name to Magen Tzedek is exciting because it fosters a possibility for dialog between sects, but it also admits that when we\u2019re talking about worker\u2019s rights and animal rights, we\u2019re talking about something other than the laws of kashrut.\nA statement like that is pretty empowering. We who were listening to Rabbi Mandel suddenly had a clear directive: if 21st century ethical action is your goal, kosher certifying agencies are not going to help you achieve it. We love to pretend that the agencies we entrust reflect our values exactly, that when they say \u201cfit\u201d they mean our kind of \u201cfit\u201d: no blood in our meat and no blood on our hands. Rabbi Mandel, when he made his point, made it quite clear that this trust is false.\nYet people who are neither kosher nor hallal invest the Jewish and Muslim religions with ethical values that they feel are somehow \u201chigher,\u201d more worthy, more righteous, like valuing food safety, workers rights and animal rights above speed, efficiency and profit. It\u2019s a kind of spiritual whitewashing that claims that because food safety is ethical and religions are the origin of ethics, therefore, religions endorse food safety and a kosher item is safe.\nI think I\u2019ve been guilty of the same whitewashing my whole life long. When I showed up at the food conference I was considering the possibility that I might go home with a will to be kosher again. I grew up kosher, and so the idea of kashrut as a high mitzvah is deeply implanted in me. I\u2019ve always been proud of my family for keeping kosher, and I think that\u2019s partly because I too conflated religious ethics with moral ethics.\nInstead, Rabbi Mandel seemed to be to be saying that kashrut as the OU practices it is about obedience, not morals. There seems to me to be a pretty enormous disconnect between Jews who think that kashrut is a system of laws designed by god to help our ancestors eat ethically, and Jews who think kashrut is a system of laws designed by God, period.\nThe former group might think kashrut meant food safety: no scavengers, no diseased animals; ethical distribution of food: leave the corners for the poor, let the land rest for a year; workers rights: free your slaves every seven years; sustainability: let the land lie fallow. It follows that we should then hold our current food system to stringent standards along the same ethical categories. The latter group is talking about obedience, what God asks of us, we do, we have our rules, all we need to do is follow them, and if they\u2019re the rules that God gave us, they work as they are. After all, it\u2019s not like God didn\u2019t know that the industrial revolution was coming when He gave the Torah.\nSo the next question follows: is there a fundamental conundrum between obedience and interpretation? Jews who want kashrut to reflect the ethical choices we have to make in 2009 are asking the same questions that say, radical protestants were asking in 1620: who have we named as our intercessors between ourselves and God, and how much of our obedience is obedience to our intercessors rather than obedience to God? Are the laws as written down at Mount Sinai a reflection of the will of God filtered through the particular cognizant ability of the people who received them or are they marching orders for all time?\nI don\u2019t know, but I got a serious sinking feeling listening to Rabbi Mandel explain to the audience that we\u2019re supposed to either discard or dissect the hindquarters of a kosher animal in order to remove fats attached to the sciatic nerve, the same sinking feeling I got watching the documentary \u201cTrembling Before G-d\u201d . It\u2019s a feeling that means: this is so minute, so complex, so derivative, and reeks so much of human discourse. This is not religion, it\u2019s bureaucracy.\nIn the middle of John Milton\u2019s epic poem, \u201cParadise Lost\u201d , the whole purpose of which is to \u201cjustify the ways of God to man,\u201d God sends the angel Raphael down to Adam and Eve in order to warn them to be especially vigilant because Satan is in the garden. It sounds like a straightforward message, but Adam takes so much pleasure in divine discourse that he spends three books, thousands of lines of poetry, talking to Raphael about subjects as diverse as the war in heaven, the creation of the world and the order of the universe. By the end of their conversation, God\u2019s straightforward warning is made small in a sea of knowledge. My sinking feeling comes from the sense that kashrut is subject to the same dwarfing influence as a result of our love of complexity and the joy we get from communing with God\u2019s word down to it\u2019s most minute and derivative application.\nMaybe I come to this conclusion out of ignorance. I\u2019ve never understood why the laws of kashrut are privileged in Judaism as a greater mitzvah than the laws that say you have to treat strangers well, forgive debts, free slaves and tithe a tenth of your income. Maybe the answer to that question is actually pretty clear, and my prejudice in favor of social justice makes me see it as more important than the Torah really says it is. I\u2019m interested in people\u2019s opinions on this issue, and especially interested in how they came by these opinions.\nPerhaps, when it comes down to it, I, like those ten million Americans buying kosher food for a sense of well-being, am not really practicing Judaism at all, but investing my own sense of right and wrong with a righteous power it doesn\u2019t actually hold. Maybe part of faith is throwing your weight behind a moral system you don\u2019t understand because God says so. But whatever I ultimately decide about kashrut in my life, it won\u2019t be on the authority of the OU\u2019s interpretation. Rabbi Mandel seemed committed to making alliances toward more ethical kashrut at the conference, but one hazy explanation for discarding the entire back end of an animal is enough for me. I\u2019m up for fewer intercessors, more pursuit of knowledge, less talk with the angels, more listening to the message I\u2019ve been sent, though I\u2019m not sure where to find it.\nYou can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed.

Thus, regardless of whether or not the production of meat is inhumane to animals, someone who buys meat is doing nothing wrong. This argument fails to show that meat purchases are morally permissible, however, because our choice to buy meat affects the expected number of animals bred, raised, and slaughtered.\nGiven the size of modern animal agriculture, it seems plausible to assume that a single meat purchase is too insignificant, relative to the vast number of other meat purchases, to be noticed by the manager of a factory farm. If the manager cannot perceive any increase in demand caused by a single meat purchase, no additional animals will be raised or slaughtered, and thus no harm will have been done to animals by the purchase. In other words, it is claimed that most meat purchases are \u201ccausally inefficacious.\u201d\nThis may be true but it is irrelevant to how we ought to make moral decisions under uncertainty. When we make a decision about how to act, we can never know for certain all of the actual consequences that will result from al our possible actions. We may, after making a decision to act in a particular way, come to know the actual consequences that resulted from the one action we decided upon. However, this knowledge is not helpful in making the original decision, since it is not only reached after the fact, but also limited to only one of the many possible actions we may have had to choose from. Consequently, it is more reasonable that we should make decisions, not on the basis of actual consequences (which we can\u2019t know for certain), but on the basis of expected consequences \u2013 the product of those consequences resulting from an action and the probability of those consequences resulting \u2013 that one might reasonably predict given the available evidence. Since the expected consequences, not actual consequences, can be known when making decisions, only expected consequences can help ethical individuals decide what course of action to take.\nActing on expected consequences can be understood in problems of \u201ccontributory causation,\u201d where many people seem responsible for causing something to happen. Jonathan Glover provides an example of contributory causation called The100 Bandits, where 100 bandits descend on a village that has 100 villagers, and each villager has one bowl containing 100 baked beans. Each bandit takes one bean from each bowl, so that each bandit ends up with a bowl of 100 beans. Now, no villager can perceive the difference made by one bean being stolen from his bowl (either at the moment or later, due to malnutrition). Thus none of the bandits would seem to have individually harmed any of the villagers and so none of the villagers should have been harmed. Yet 100 villagers are without lunch and hungry. So something is wrong.\nGlover suggests we approach contributory problems like The 100 Bandits by employing a \u201cdivisibility principle\u201d \u2013 in other words, a single agent is causally responsible for the consequences of a contributory result divided by the number of contributing agents. In this case, the hunger of 100 lunch-less villagers is divided over 100 bandits. Glover would thus say that each bandit is responsible for the hunger of one lunch-less villager. If we accept Glover\u2019s divisibility principle, each bandit ought not to steal 100 beans because he would then be causally responsible for the disutility of one lunch-less villager.\nThere may be a more compelling solution to contributory problems such as this one, however, that does not attempt to reconcile actual causal responsibility with our intuitions about moral responsibility. For in the case of the Bandits, it is not true that none of the bandits is actually causally responsible for harming the villagers. At the very least a handful of the bandits are causally responsible for the villagers\u2019 hunger \u2013 those bandits who complete threshold units. While it is true that no villager can perceive the difference made by one bean stolen from their bowl, each can clearly perceive the difference made by 100 beans stolen from their bowl. Thus there must be some number of beans between one and 100 that is the smallest number of beans a villager can perceive. Call this number the threshold unit. Say, for instance, the threshold unit is 20. Any number of beans stolen below 20 cannot be perceived. Any number of beans stolen between 20 and is perceived only as 20 beans being stolen; between 40 and 59, only as 40 beans being stolen; and so on, up to 100 beans. Thus bandits who cause a 20th bean to be stolen are responsible for the disutility of 20 beans being stolen. For instance, bandits who cause the 100th bean to be stolen from a bowl are responsible for the consequence of 20 beans being stolen, since had they not caused the 100th bean to be stolen, only 80 beans would have been perceived as stolen.\nThis is the approach to take in describing the causal responsibility, after the fact, of agents in similar problems of contributory causation. However, as suggested above, this retrospective description of actual consequences does not help us to decide on a course of action.\nFor this, ethical individuals must combine the knowledge of thresholds with expected consequences. Imagine that the bandits are contemplating stealing beans again. This time, each bandit knows villagers can perceive only threshold units of 20, but each bandit does not know whether he will be stealing a 20th bean from each bowl. Under this uncertainty, each bandit ought to calculate the expected consequence of stealing 100 beans as the probability of completing a threshold unit in each bowl (1/20) times the consequence of perceiving that threshold unit (20) times the number of bowls (100), which equals 100 \u2013 one hungry villager.\nEven if each bandit knows neither the size of the threshold unit nor which bean he is stealing, he can still calculate the expected consequences. In each case he will know that the consequences of reaching a threshold unit times the probability of completing a threshold unit in each bowl is one. (This is so because the size of the threshold unit and the probability of completing it always vary inversely.) Hence the expected consequence of stealing 100 beans will always be 100. The only condition under which the expected consequence will be les than 100 is when the Bandit has information about both the exact size of the threshold unit and the exact position of a particular bean within that unit. In most cases of contributory causation, this kind of information will not be available.\nAs a decision procedure, expected consequences yield the same prescription as Glover\u2019s divisibility principle: don't steal beans. This makes sense, since the sum of all the bandits\u2019 chances of completing a perceptible unit is one and the product of each of these probabilities is also one. One virtue of calculating expected consequences, then, is that it provides the same prescriptions as Glover\u2019s divisibility principle but without a questionable view of actual causal responsibility.\nRecognizing the expected consequences of an action, the \u201ccausal inefficacy\u201d defense of buying meat no longer holds. There must be some threshold at which point a unit of meat demanded by some group of customers is perceived by the grocer. At the very most, the size of this threshold unit is the difference between the demand for no meat and the current demand for meat. Likewise, there must be some threshold where a unit of meat demanded by some group of grocers is perceived by the butcher. And so on, all the way to the farmer. The expected consequence of completing a threshold unit that affects the production and slaughter of animals is thus the product of al the probabilities of completing each threshold unit [p(Al)=p(Grocer)* p(Butcher) *\u2026* p(Farmer)] times the consequence of that entire threshold unit of animal production. It is likely that the probability is quite small. However, the consequence of completing the threshold unit is the consequence of the entire unit, not some portion of it. This consequence is quite large and terrible, since it involves raising and slaughtering a significant number of animals.\nFor example, take the case of The 200 Million Consumers. There are 200 million consumers, each of whom eats 50 farmed animals each year. In this market, there are only ten possible annual outputs of animals for farmers: one billion animals, two billion, and so on, up to ten billion. The difference between each of these annual outputs \u2013 one billion \u2013 is the smallest unit of demand perceivable to the farmer and is thus the threshold unit. Since there are 20 million customers per threshold unit, and only one of these customers will actually complete the unit of which his other purchase is a part, the probability of my completing a unit is one in 20 million. That means by buying meat for the year, an individual has a one-in-20 million chance of affecting the production and slaughter of one billion animals. The expected consequence is then one-20-millionth times one billion, which equals 50 \u2013 that is, raising and slaughtering 50 animals per year. Given the horrors of today's animal agriculture, that is a substantial consequence. These hypothetical numbers are close to the actual numbers for meat production and consumption in the United States.\nAs with The 100 Bandits, in the case of The 200 Million Consumers, only a small fraction of individuals may actually cause harm, as determined after the fact. While at first glance this seems to weaken the argument against buying meat, on closer inspection it makes no difference. Since we can never have perfect knowledge beforehand, only a decision procedure can tell us whether or not we ought to buy meat. An ethical individual must thus use expected consequences to make a decision about buying meat, and the expected consequences of buying meat are terrible.\n"}, {"score": 1560.0718, "uuid": "01ecf557-330e-5f73-8dbb-88f4d6c9fdac", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-65-22331", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/whitelies/wlreport05.shtml", "page_rank": 1.2417993e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation", "snippet": "<em>The</em> high protein, sodium, potassium, phosphorus <em>and</em> chloride content of cow\u2019s milk present <em>what</em> <em>is</em> called <em>a</em> high renal solute load; this means that <em>the</em> unabsorbed solutes from <em>the</em> diet must be excreted via <em>the</em> kidneys.", "explanation": null, "document": "WHITE LIES\nA comparison between human milk and cow\u2019s milk\nThe composition of milk varies according to the animal from which it comes, providing the correct rate of growth and development for the young of that species, thus for human infants, human milk is obviously more suitable than cow\u2019s milk.

While cow\u2019s milk and human milk contain a similar percentage of water, the relative amounts of carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins and minerals vary widely.\nFigure 2.0 A comparison of the carbohydrate (black), protein (white) and fat (grey) components of whole cow\u2019s milk and human milk. Source: FSA, 2002.\nProtein\nThe carbohydrate, protein and fat content of milk from one species is finely tuned to meet the nutritional requirements of that particular animal whether human, elephant, buffalo, camel or dog. Figure 2.0 shows that the protein content in 100g of whole cow\u2019s milk (3.3g) is more than double that of human milk (1.3g); this is because the amount of protein in milk is linked to the amount of time it takes that particular species of animal to grow in size. Growing calves need more protein to enable them to grow quickly. Human infants on the other hand need less protein and more fat as their energies are expended primarily in the development of the brain, spinal cord and nerves.\nThe proteins in milk can be divided into two categories: caseins and whey proteins. Human milk contains these in a ratio of 40:60 respectively; while in cow\u2019s milk the ratio of casein to whey proteins is 80:20. Given that the amount of total protein in cow\u2019s milk is more than double that of human milk, cow\u2019s milk clearly contains considerably more casein than human milk. Casein can be difficult to digest, in fact it is used as the basis of some glues! Infant milks are formulated to contain more whey than casein (the ratio of whey to casein in these milks is similar to that of human milk), and this is why it is thought to be easier for new babies to digest. Casein has been linked to a range of diseases and allergies, including type 1 diabetes (see Diabetes ).\nFat\nThe amount and type of fat present in the milk similarly reflects the requirements of the species of animal producing that milk. Whole milk from a cow contains around four per cent fat whereas milk from the grey seal contains over 50 per cent fat (Baker, 1990); this is because baby seals need more body fat to survive in cold water. Figure 2.0 shows that 100g of whole cow\u2019s milk and human milk contain similar amounts of fat (3.9g and 4.1g respectively). While these values are close, the types of fat vary. Figure 3.0 shows that cow\u2019s milk contains more saturated fat while human milk contains more unsaturated fat.\nFigure 3.0 The fatty acid composition of whole cow\u2019s milk and human milk.\nSource: FSA, 2002.\nFigure 3.0 shows that 100g of whole cow\u2019s milk contains 2.5g saturated fat, 1.0g monounsaturated and 0.1g polyunsaturated fat, while human milk contains 1.8g saturated fat, 1.6g monounsaturated fat and 0.5g polyunsaturated fat (FSA, 2002). These figures demonstrate the higher level of saturated fat in cow\u2019s milk compared to human milk, and the higher level of unsaturated fat in human milk compared to cow\u2019s milk. This imbalance contributes to the unsuitability of cow\u2019s milk for human infants.\nThe higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in human milk reflects the important role of these fats in brain development. In humans the brain develops rapidly during the first year of life, growing faster than the body and tripling in size by the age of one. The brain is largely composed of fat and early brain development and function in humans requires a sufficient supply of polyunsaturated essential fatty acids. The omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) and the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are both essential for brain development and functioning. Both are supplied in human milk but not in cow\u2019s milk (currently AA and DHA-enhanced infant formulas are available, although not mandatory, throughout most of Europe).\nA review of 20 studies of cognitive function of breast fed infants compared to that of formula fed infants concluded that the nutrients in breast milk may have a significant effect on neurological development in infants (Anderson et al., 1999). Cow\u2019s milk tends to be low in the types of fat essential for human brain development; a rapid increase in body size is more of an imperative for cows than rapid brain development, so cows produce milk that is high in body-building saturated fats to help their calves grow rapidly in size.\nSimilarly, the fatty acid composition of cow\u2019s milk is more suited to a calf than to a person. Attempts to alter the fatty acid composition of cow\u2019s milk, and so increase the nutritional value of cow\u2019s milk to humans, have involved experiments feeding cows fish meal and soya beans (AbuGhazaleh et al., 2004) and flax seed (Petit, 2002). Feeding flax seed resulted in a lower omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio, which is thought might improve the nutritional value of milk from a human health point of view by reducing the potential risk of disease. Of course you could just eat the flax seed oil yourself to improve the balance of omega-3 and omega-6 oils in your diet while avoiding the undesirable components of milk.\nTable 1.0 Comparison of the mineral and vitamin components of cow\u2019s milk and human milk.\nCow's Milk (semi-skimmed, pasteurised) per 100g\nHuman Milk(mature) per 100g\n"}, {"score": 1543.1672, "uuid": "e8c708a0-65ad-5e5b-a323-56a849c47f13", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1905wb-43-24650", "target_hostname": "www.shalomveg.com", "target_uri": "http://www.shalomveg.com//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=142&Itemid=80", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "ShalomVeg.com - Being <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em>", "snippet": "Recommend <em>the</em> site to <em>a</em> friend--Click Here diabetic&#x27; reipces are reipces for healthy food.these are low in fat, high in fibre, <em>and</em> <em>vegetarian</em> food <em>is</em> perfect for diabetics as it <em>is</em> very healthy.now there <em>is</em> <em>a</em> HUGH <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> <em>vegans</em> <em>and</em> <em>vegetarians</em> so you must make sure you know <em>what</em> she prefers", "explanation": null, "document": "Like ShalomVeg?\u00a0 Recommend the site to a friend--Click Here\nFriday, 22 February 2008\n"}, {"score": 1526.2357, "uuid": "614af3c6-99e8-5757-ade2-bd62f3558475", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0914wb-74-12390", "target_hostname": "jugalbandi.info", "target_uri": "http://jugalbandi.info/2007/07/the-difference-between-women-and-men/", "page_rank": 1.1762985e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> women <em>and</em> men \u2026 | jugalbandi", "snippet": "\u2013Jai surely, my dear pel, you understand <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> fictional characters in hollywood <em>and</em> bollywood created by MALE scriptwriters, <em>and</em> empirical evidence from <em>the</em> REAL world ??", "explanation": null, "document": "July 30, 2007 at 11:32 pm\nYou know what?

As the two lovers, each in a separate bathtub, stare lovingly out at the sunset, the viewer wonders why they are separated and not entwined in one tub. But this is the age of ED, erectile dysfunction, something that was not spoken of in polite conversation, until the last ten years.\nThe man in the bathtub, previously characterized as impotent or unable to perform sexually, is one of 18 million Americans suffering from ED, a condition that can be alleviated with a small pill, in this case Cialis (tadalafil). With a daily 5-milligram dose he can be ready for sex at any time. What an improvement over Viagra and Levitra, two competing ED drugs that only work for four hours! Drug producer Eli Lilly & Company says sales of the drug exceeded $1 billion in 2007.\nThe little pill comes with its ample list of not-so-serious side effects: headache, facial flushing, indigestion, back pain, nasal congestion, muscle pain, pain in arms and legs, angina, high blood pressure, dry mouth, insomnia, vertigo, unexplained rash, blurred vision, seeing a blue tinge to objects or not recognizing the difference between blue and green, decrease or loss of hearing, migraines, prolonged erection lasting more than four hours, or painful erection lasting more than six hours.\nConsider some serious side effects\nThe really serious side effects are heart attack, sudden death, chest pain, heart palpitations, and stroke.\nLike so many pharmaceuticals, Cialis, the orange pill and its cousins Viagra (sildenafil citrate), the blue pill, and Levitra (vardenafil hcl), also an orange pill, belong to a class of drugs called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. Taken before a sexual episode, these drugs enhance the effects of nitric oxide that relaxes smooth muscles in the penis during sexual stimulation and induces increased blood flow. These PDE inhibitors alleviate the symptoms of ED instead of attacking its cause and developing a cure.\nAccording to the American Urological Association, common conditions that cause ED are vascular disease, diabetes, and neurological disease. Lifestyle choices and side effects of medications are other causes.\nVascular diseases, particularly arteriosclerosis or hardening or narrowing of arteries, account for up to 70% of ED cases due to physical causes. High cholesterol and high blood pressure are other factors in vascular disease and can result in ED.\nDiabetes linked to ED\nDiabetes damages blood vessels and nerves and restricts blood flow needed for an erection. The American Urological Association estimates that 35% to 50% of men with diabetes are troubled with ED.\nLifestyle choices like smoking, abusing alcohol and drugs, and not exercising will also have their effect on blood vessels in the penis.\nMore than 200 drugs, both over-the-counter and prescription medications, can cause ED problems.\nPsychological problems like anxiety, stress, and depression are estimated as the culprits in 10% to 20% of ED cases.\nAccording to two studies reported on May 19, 2008 on washingtonpost.com, ED problems may be a warning signal for serious heart problems. A Hong Kong study of 2,306 diabetic men who had ED but no signs of heart disease were 58% more likely to have a heart attack or coronary problem in the next four years than those with adequate sexual function.\nAn Italian study followed 291 men with diabetes and early heart disease for four years. Those with ED were twice as likely as men without the problem to have major coronary events as well as strokes.\n\"These reports add two things to what we already know,\" said Dr. R. Parker Ward, associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. \" One is that they indicate the importance of erectile dysfunction in diabetic patients in terms of predicting future cardiovascular events. These studies suggest that the additional presence of erectile dysfunction places them at incrementally higher risk. Secondly, they show that even when considered in combination with traditional risk factors, erectile dysfunction offers incremental information about the risk of future cardiovascular events.\"\nImpotence signals blocked arteries\n\"Studies have shown that impotence is often a sign of blocked arteries, and artery blockages are commonly caused by the consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products, which are high in cholesterol and saturated fat,\" says Dr. Neal Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. \"Animal products increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood. This cholesterol enters the blood vessels and creates plaque on the interior walls, which narrows the passageway for blood flow,\" Barnard says.\nBarnard emphasizes that artery blockage can be prevented with diet and lifestyle changes and points to Dr. Dean Ornish's work as proof that a low-fat vegetarian diet \"is the key to beginning the cleanup of your arteries.\n\"I'm suggesting that people get to know vegetarian foods,\" says Barnard. \"Simple foods. Beans, vegetables, fruits and legumes. The good thing is, we're seeing athletes saying, 'That helps my performance.' We're having people who've had erectile dysfunction saying, 'I didn't realize that was reversible by changing your diet and getting circulation back again.'\"\nEat yourself impotent\nIn an article titled \"Eat Yourself impotent\" Dr. John McDougall echoes Barnard's views. \"The same diet that closes the arteries to the heart (heart attacks) and brain (stroke) also closes the arteries to the penis--the result is erectile dysfunction (ED), which means a delay in time for maximal erection, reduced rigidity, and decreased ability to sustain an erection.\"\nDr. McDougall makes an interesting comparison between the diameter of the penile artery and the left anterior coronary artery. \"The penile artery has a diameter of 1 to 2 mm, whereas the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery is 3 to 4 mm in diameter, \" he explains. \"An equally sized atherosclerotic plaque burden in the smaller penile arteries would more likely first compromise flow compared with the same amount of plaque in the large coronary artery causing angina.\"\nDietary and lifestyle changes are at the top of Dr. McDougall's list to alleviate ED problems. \"Fortunately, with a change in diet and a little exercise most of our patients are able to lower their blood pressure and get off of their 'erection deflating' medications, and they are able to reduce their 'plaque burden' by reversing the underlying atherosclerosis,\" says McDougall. \"My male patients, and sometimes their mates, often share with me tales of renewed vigor and vitality. Now there's a valid reason to eat vegetables.\"\nTo those plagued by ED the message is quite clear. The colored pill may provide a few moments of pleasure, but it offers no solution to the problem. Instead of sitting in that bathtub gazing at the sunset and waiting for the pill to take effect, consider a lifestyle change that includes a low fat vegan diet and an exercise program. It might not only help you in the ED department, but it could also improve your overall health.\nReferences:\nBarnard, Neal. \"Doctor in the House.\" PeTA's Animal Times, Fall 2007: 23.\nBarnard, Neal.

At the same time, for many vegans, finding the time to cook, and learning how to make all kinds of new foods, can be daunting and a real obstacle to vegan success.\nWith The 4 Ingredient Vegan as your guide and protector, you can travel far along the way of nutritious and delicious meals through the ease and convenience of processed foods.\nThe 4 Ingredient Vegan is one of The Book Publishing Company's top vegan books of 2011 - sign up to enter their giveaway and win 2 books.\nThe recipes in The 4 Ingredient Vegan are easy, delicious, and mostly quick. They\u0092re all about using shortcut ingredients and time saving tips.\nThere is little gathering & prepping of food to do, because every recipe has just 4 main ingredients, which are often prepared foods, such as vegetable broth, canned beans and soups, frozen vegetables and fruit, chopped nuts or nut butters, miso, nutritional flakes, vegan cream cheese & sour cream, high quality condiments & spice mixes, phyllo dough, noodles etc.\nWhat cooking remains is simple and easy. This kind of food preparation is convenient, fast, and nutritious, ideal for those who work or go to school all day. This cookbook is a meant for people who want to eat healthy but have little time to cook, or who may not enjoy cooking \u0096 but definitely enjoy eating.\nThe authors also make good use of labor saving blenders and food processers in most of the recipes.\nBUT \u0096 isn\u0092t there always a but \u0096 to make this cookbook happen for you, you\u0092ll need a well-stocked pantry and fridge. That means planning and shopping ahead. Fortunately, the authors provide a fairly simple list of pantry staples to get you started.\nI like to think that I avoid processed food, in favor of cooking my own. I do love to cook, and I spend a couple of hours a day at it. But the fact is, I am often busy with other things, and I do use processed foods every day as a matter of convenience and take them for granted.\nIn my kitchen, I always have a few cans of beans, olives, coconut milk, tomato paste and so on, as well as frozen peas, spice mixes, veggie cubes, prepared flavorings and condiments, nut butters, pasta, non-dairy milk, tofu & miso, dried fruit and shelled nuts. I don\u0092t think of them as processed or convenience foods, but they are.\nFrom this cookbook, I can see how taking that minimal use of processed food a few steps further could mean the difference between eating well, and eating junk food, for someone who is too busy or disinclined to do much cooking. It\u0092s a matter of discriminating between good processed food, and bad.\nBad processed food contains ingredients such as trans-fats, gmos, msg, high fructose corn syrup, excessive salt and sugar, artificial preservatives and coloring, with little food value, the most important quality being a very long shelf life.\nGood processed food is made with high quality food, such as organically grown vegetables and beans, generally has a short list of ingredients, and usually needs to be refrigerated and used up quickly after opening to get the maximum nutritional value.\nThe authors of The 4 Ingredient Vegan offer a judicious balance of convenience foods and whole foods, for easy cooking and maximum nutrition\u0085although not always quick. For example, instead of calling for prepared polenta, they teach you how to cook your own, or how to cook lentils (almost a convenience food) instead of opening a can.\nWe enjoyed 2 recipes from the book:\nArtichoke, Leek and White Bean Soup calls for frozen artichoke hearts, fresh leeks, a carton of vegetable broth, a can of white beans, and of course a blender. Besides salt & pepper & olive oil, there were no other flavorings or ingredients to deal with. And it was easy to make.\nIt would have been much less expensive to use homemade broth and cook the beans, but I know that for most people, in that case, this soup wouldn\u0092t have happened. But I\u0092d use fresh or frozen broccoli, instead of artichokes, because broccoli is less expensive, readily available and blends much more easily.\nHearty One-Pot Lentil-Vegetable Supper calls for 4 cups chopped fresh vegetables, 1 carton of vegetable broth, a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes, and 2 1/2 cups brown lentils. As the recipe suggested, I jazzed up the flavor with curry spices and Bragg\u0092s Liquid Aminos (another convenience food I keep on hand).\nInstead of vegetable broth, I used 2 vegan bouillon cubes in 4 cups of water. I also soaked the lentils for several hours before cooking to soften them up and speed the cooking.\nMore Vegan Cookbook Reviews\n"}, {"score": 1494.8564, "uuid": "1c629962-65a5-5b68-82d7-95ffd33b4a40", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0007wb-87-13647", "target_hostname": "erraticimpact.com", "target_uri": "http://erraticimpact.com/~ecologic/html/what_is_a_vegetarian.htm", "page_rank": 1.1857213e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em>?

It has several meditations, yoga poses, and journal-keeping exercises. The Inner Art of Vegetarianism invites people, wherever they are in their paths, into a deeply spiritual, deeply rewarding, daily practice of living a life that honors connections.\" -- The author, Carol J. Adams , July 24, 2000\n\"Carol Adams explores the inner life of spiritual growth with the outer life of practical compassion. She examines the reasons why becoming a vegetarian is deeply wedded to spiritual practice. Adams shows how the practice of creating mindfulness and disciplining the mind meshes with becoming an activist for nonviolence, and reveals how in our busy and stressed-out world it is essential to sustain and replenish the soul through spiritual discipline. This is an empowering book for all those who wish to have their soul nourished and follow the spiritual path of vegetarianism.\" -- The publisher, Martin Rowe , August 11, 2000\nAn exploration of the spiritual path of vegetarianism\nAbout the Author\nCarol J. Adams is the author of the groundbreaking \"The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory\", now in its 10th anniversary edition, and \"Neither Man nor Beast: Feminism and the Defense of Animals\".

There are so many things to quote from this article, I don't know where to begin. Perhaps I should just say, read the article.\nOne of the things that hooked me right away was this:\nThirteen percent of U.S. adults are \"semivegetarian,\" meaning they eat meat with fewer than half of all their meals. In comparison, true vegetarians\u2014those who never, ever consume animal flesh\u2014compose just 1 percent.\nI thought vegans comprised somewhere around 3-4% of the US population these days, but it's pretty hard to get a real statistic. But what about the semi-vegetarian comment ? Before we went vegan, Jane and I considered ourselves \"semi-vegetarian.\" But to say we ate meat with less than half our meals would be a gross understatement of how much meat we ate. That holds true for the people we know who categorize their eating the same way, unless the statistics include snacks...\nThen there was this comment :\nYou'll never find a self-respecting vegan downing a glass of milk or munching on a slice of buttered toast. But the modern adherent may be a little more accommodating when it comes to the dairy of the insect world: He may have relaxed his principles enough to enjoy a spoonful of honey.\nNow, I'm a self-respecting vegan, and I fully expect to have a slice of pizza next time I'm in New York, deliberately. (BTW, pizza in NYC means a slice of cheese pizza, no other toppings.) Some people say it is this attitude specifically that excludes me from being a vegan, but I disagree. I consider myself to be a law-abiding citizen, but I occasionally exceed the posted speed limit (note: this is hard to do... I live in Los Angeles). One or two slices of pizza out of 1,095 meals (365 * 3) still makes me a vegan, in my book.\nBut let's get to the heart of the matter, or the article...\nThere is no more contentious question in the world of veganism than the one posed by honey. A fierce doctrinal debate over its status has raged for decades; it turns up on almost every community FAQ and remains so ubiquitous and unresolved that radio host Rachel Maddow proposed to ask celebrity vegan Dennis Kucinich about it during last year's CNN/YouTube presidential debate. Does honey qualify as a forbidden animal product since it's made by bees? Or is it OK since the bees don't seem too put out by making it?\nWell, I've weighed in on this before... I am a vegan who eats honey . Again, a stance that has some of the vegan community pointing fingers and saying \"You're not a real vegan.\" To that I say, you're entitled to your opinions. I consider myself a vegan. Yes, in the animal, vegetable, mineral categorization, bees are animals. However, they are insects. I would not hesitate to have my house tented or sprayed if I had termites; insects are killed collaterally in the harvesting of my produce... If I'm willing to kill insects in these instances, is it not hypocritical to forego eating honey? If my point of view isn't sufficient enough to sway you, here's what Vegan Action , has to say:\nMany vegans, however, are not opposed to using insect products, because they do not believe insects are conscious of pain. Moreover, even if insects were conscious of pain, it\u2019s not clear that the production of honey involves any more pain for insects than the production of most vegetables, since the harvesting and transportation of all vegetables involves many \u2018collateral\u2019 insect deaths.\n(This group has been established for over 10 years; they are a vegan outreach group. They\u2019re calling it an acceptable vegan behavior. This is the party line I choose to follow.)\nIt's also been pointed out to me that the original definition of vegan, according to the Vegan Society who coined the term back in 1944: \". . . eats a plant-based diet free from all animal products, including milk, eggs and honey.\" To this I reply, (unfortunately) language is organic. In the 1913 Merriam-Webster dictionary, the definition of \"gay\" was:\n1. Excited with merriment; manifesting sportiveness or delight; inspiring delight; livery; merry.\n2. Brilliant in colors; splendid; fine; richly dressed.\n3. Loose; dissipated; lewd. [Colloq.] Syn. -- Merry; gleeful; blithe; airy; lively; sprightly, sportive; light-hearted; frolicsome; jolly; jovial; joyous; joyful; glad; showy; splendid; vivacious.\nToday, Merriam-Webster defines \"gay\" as:\n1 a: happily excited : merry b: keenly alive and exuberant : having or inducing high spirits\n2 a: bright, lively b: brilliant in color\n3: given to social pleasures; also : licentious\n4 a: homosexual b: of, relating to, or used by homosexuals\nBut if you use the word \"gay\" in conversation today, it will be understood to be definition #4. Language is organic; definitions change.\nSome people complain that the fact that some vegans eat honey, while others don't (refined sugar too), causes confusion in the non-vegan sector. Perhaps it does. But \"vegan\" is confusing for most non-vegans anyway. Do you eat eggs, milk, fish? What do you eat anyway? Before you condemn those of us who eat honey, remember, there are no perfect vegans out there.\nReading the Slate article further, the author, Daniel Engber, points out:\n...you can't worry over the ethics of honey production without worrying over the entire beekeeping industry. Honey accounts for only a small percentage of the total honeybee economy in the United States; most comes from the use of rental hives to pollinate fruit and vegetable crops. According to food journalist Rowan Jacobson, whose book Fruitless Fall\ncomes out this September, commercial bees are used in the production of about 100 foods, including almonds, avocados, broccoli, canola, cherries, cucumbers, lettuce, peaches, pears, plums, sunflowers, and tomatoes. Even the clover and alfalfa crops we feed to dairy cows are sometimes pollinated by bees.\nLife for these rental bees may be far worse than it is for the ones producing honey. The industrial pollinators face all the same hardships, plus a few more: They spend much of their lives sealed in the back of 18-wheelers, subsisting on a diet of high-fructose corn syrup as they're shipped back and forth across the country. Husbandry and breeding practices have reduced their genetic diversity and left them particularly susceptible to large-scale die-offs.\nSo, are you vegan if you exploit insects in this way? Would this treatment of mammals be acceptable?\nMr. Engber ends with this:\nAccording to Matthew Ball, the executive director of Vegan Outreach, the desire for clear dietary rules and restrictions makes little difference in the grand calculus of animal suffering: \"What vegans do personally matters little,\" he says. \"If we present veganism as being about the exploitation of honeybees, it makes it easier to ignore the real, noncontroversial suffering\" of everything else. Ball doesn't eat honey himself, but he'd sooner recruit five vegans who remain ambivalent about insect rights than one zealot who follows every last Vegan Society rule.\nThat may be the most important lesson to come out of this debate: You'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\nWhich brings me to my final point. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... There is a small, but vocal, minority of vegans out there who think that if you eschew animal products for any reason other than animal welfare, then you are not a vegan. Or that if you\u2019re not being vegan to the extreme (by this I mean scrutinizing the ingredients and processing of every food item you\u2019re going to ingest) then you may as well eat meat. We emphatically disagree. Every little bit helps, and if that means embracing the omnivores who choose to \u201ceat vegan\u201d one or two days a week, I say welcome to the fold! Yes, you can be vegan one day per week. If you choose to eat honey, I believe you are not \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\" And I have to ask the less flexible members of the vegan community, what exactly is the goal here? Because it seems to me, if you are coming at veganism from an animal rights or environmental perspective, every little bit helps.\nRelated Information:\n"}, {"score": 1486.782, "uuid": "6031f84c-feb0-52a5-bb8c-8766989d8269", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0202wb-03-21171", "target_hostname": "www.llli.org", "target_uri": "http://www.llli.org/nb/nbjulaug00p131.html", "page_rank": 1.1864604e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "LLLI | Raising <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> Child", "snippet": "Researchers studied 404 children at <em>the</em> Farm, <em>a</em> cooperative community in Tennessee that encourages <em>a</em> <em>vegan</em> diet for all, <em>and</em> found no significant <em>differences</em> in growth <em>between</em> <em>the</em> <em>vegetarian</em> children who lived there <em>and</em> non-<em>vegetarian</em> children.", "explanation": null, "document": "New Guinea\nFrom: NEW BEGINNINGS, Vol. 17 No. 4 July-August 2000, pp. 131-133, 151\nThe word \"vegetarian\" may mean different things to different people. There are many distinct categories of vegetarianism, each one embodying a set of dietary guidelines. Some also include ethical and/or religious belief systems. The term generally refers to someone who does not consume meat of any kind, including seafood. The vast majority of vegetarians fall into the ovo-lacto (egg and dairy products) category, meaning that they do consume eggs and dairy products, such as cheese, milk, and yogurt. Ovo-vegetarians eat eggs but not dairy products. Lacto-vegetarians are just the opposite, consuming dairy products but not eggs. Vegans consume no animal products whatsoever. In common usage, the word \"vegetarian\" encompasses all these categories, though vegans sometimes choose to differentiate themselves from the group.\nIt may not make sense to the average omnivore to get so technical. Food is food, right? We define the foods we eat as artificial or natural, processed or unprocessed, harmful or healthful. Vegetarians take it one step further by making the commitment to choose certain foods as part of their way of life.\nEven though health is the number one reason for choosing vegetarianism, not all vegetarians eat a healthful, balanced diet. It is entirely possible to give up meat and still eat candy bars, potato chips, and drink soda regularly. Some of the well-documented health benefits of consuming a well-balanced vegetarian diet include higher fiber consumption, lower intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, lower intake of pesticides, food additives, preservatives, and less chance of contracting meat-borne illnesses such as BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or Mad Cow Disease) and e. coli from contaminated meat products. A diet high in vegetable products and low in animal products has also been linked to cancer prevention and lower risk of heart disease (Marcus 1998).\nPopulations the world over have been raising healthy vegetarian children for hundreds of years. Yet in Western cultures, the idea of vegetarianism for children is often received negatively or at least with some doubt. Even longtime vegetarians and vegans who know quite a bit about maintaining a good nutritional balance for themselves, begin to doubt their ability to raise healthy vegetarian or vegan children. Why is this?\nLack of support, knowledge, and experience are the major factors. If you have never been around vegetarian children, you may wonder if it is even possible to raise healthy children this way. In general, health professionals are not well informed about vegetarian diets, fueling the fire of doubt. In the face of such adversity one would do well to remember that even the American Dietetic Association approves a vegetarian diet for all ages. In their paper Feeding Your Baby the Vegetarian Way, the Association states that \"when their diet is a appropriately planned, babies can get all the nutrients they need to grow and be healthy within a vegetarian eating style.\"\nPediatrics, a well-respected medical journal, reported on a landmark study in 1989. Researchers studied 404 children at the Farm, a cooperative community in Tennessee that encourages a vegan diet for all, and found no significant differences in growth between the vegetarian children who lived there and non-vegetarian children. The vegetarian children were slightly smaller than the average American child from ages one to three, but by age ten had caught up. This is not to say, however, that all vegetarian or vegan children are thin or small. They come in all shapes and sizes.\nThe best time to start teaching good eating habits is in early childhood. Research shows that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol, which increase the risk of heart disease, begin in childhood (Marcus 1998). Though it is difficult to explain the more complicated aspects of vegetarianism to a toddler, a child that age doesn't really require much explanation. They can eat only what they are given, and it is at that time that eating patterns and tastes are beginning to take hold. Around the age of three, children will choose food based on familiarity with it (Yntema 22). Children develop strong opinions about what they like and do not like to eat at this age, though, so it is important to focus on healthful foods right from the beginning\u2014whether you are a vegetarian or not! It may be difficult for a child to switch from white bread to whole grains or from hamburgers to soy burgers, but a child who has never eaten the former learns to love the taste of whole foods and healthy alternatives. Explanations do become necessary around preschool age when children begin to notice that others are eating different foods than they are and have more opportunities to eat outside the home. At this age, they are also beginning to understand more and share in the family's philosophy. Explaining why the family eats one food but not another is easier in the context of a shared family philosophy.\nStill, there is no denying that there are different requirements for the diet of children compared to that of adults. The same holds true for vegetarians. One cannot simply eliminate an entire food group without replacing it with good quality and variety of vegetarian alternatives. Some basic knowledge of vegetarian nutrition is required to ensure that children receive the proper balance of nutrients. Virginia Messina, MPH, RD and Mark Messina, PhD write in their book, The Vegetarian Way, \"Children's nutrient needs are highest for vitamin D, iron, calcium and zinc ... other nutrients of special interest in the diets of vegetarian children are protein, vitamin B\n12\nand riboflavin.\" That said, it is not as difficult to meet those nutrient needs as some would believe.\nBreast milk is the very best option for babies. First solids for babies are generally fruits, vegetables, and cereals so most babies are vegetarian until they start heavier solids, usually protein sources, somewhere between six and twelve months. Contrary to common belief, protein is not difficult to obtain on a vegetarian diet. Protein is very important in the diet, even more so for children than adults, but parents should not be overly concerned about this. According to Messina and Messina, \"When children consume adequate calories, eat frequently throughout the day, and consume a variety of foods, protein deficiency is virtually nonexistent.\"\nAnother common concern is getting enough calcium. The most common source of calcium in the Western world is dairy products, and this is where lacto-ovo vegetarians obtain the bulk of this mineral. It is also a good source of riboflavin and vitamin D (though the body will manufacture vitamin D with adequate exposure to sunlight several times a week). Luckily for those who cannot or choose not to consume dairy, there are plenty of other sources of calcium. These include tofu, dark green leafy vegetables, bok choy, broccoli, beans, figs, sunflower seeds, tahini (sesame seed paste), almond butter, calcium and vitamin fortified soy, nut and rice milks, fortified juices and even fortified breakfast cereals. Many fortified foods are readily available and affordable, which helps ensure that vegetarian children do not suffer from nutrient deficiencies. Parents of children who are dark-skinned or who live in climates where adequate sun exposure is not possible should make sure to include a dietary source of vitamin D.\nEating a wide variety of healthful foods will generally take care of zinc requirements. Foods that are high in protein are usually high in zinc as well. Vegetarian sources include specially fortified cereals, wheat germ, sea vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, cheese, milk, and yogurt, among others (Johnston 1999). There is very little information available on zinc for vegetarian children, but restricting fiber intake somewhat may increase zinc absorption. This is interesting to note, because fiber plays such an essential role in health. \"Small children are much more sensitive to the effects of excess fiber than adults ... adding too much fiber too soon can not only speed things up too much, but the filling effect of fiber can replace more calorie-dense foods ... protein (and other nutrients) don't get absorbed adequately\" (Eisman 20). Including some refined grains (such as white bread or rice) and peeled fruit in the toddler diet can keep the level of fiber manageable.\nAnother easily resolved issue is that of obtaining enough vitamin B\n12\n. Ovo-lacto vegetarians generally do not have worry, as B\n12\nis available from eggs and dairy products. Vegans will want to verify that they have a reliable source of the vitamin in their diet, from supplements or fortified foods. (Some iron-rich foods are also good sources of vitamin C.)\nNo discussion of vegetarian diets for children would be complete without mentioning iron. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency in America. It can affect children regardless of whether they are vegetarian or not (Messina and Messina 183-86). Still, the stereotype of vegetarian children as thin, weak, and pale (all symptoms of anemia) persists. In fact, though meat is the best source of absorbable iron, iron can be found in abundance in plant foods like enriched grains, dried fruits, soy products, broccoli, beans, and nuts. If foods high in iron are served with vitamin C-rich foods or drinks (e.g., orange juice, cantaloupe, strawberries, bell peppers, or watermelon) absorption is greatly improved.\nWith all this talk about whole grains, fruits and vegetables, one may assume that all vegetarian children, if not anemic, are at least very thin. It is an interesting paradox to note that America's obsession with thinness does not carry over to babies. Fat babies are cute and cuddly, thin ones scrawny, by popular opinion. Just as some breastfed babies are smaller than average and others are extremely chubby, some vegetarian babies and toddlers are small and some very large. Regardless of the size of the baby, however, parents would do well to remember that children under two need more fat in their diets\u2014about 25 to 35% of total calories\u2014to support the rapid growth of this early period of life (Melina, Davis, and Harrison 84-87, 113). Avocados are an excellent source of healthy fats, especially for those who do not consume dairy products.\nIt seems that nearly all parents, vegetarian and omnivore, worry about what their babies and toddlers are (or are not) eating. Often parents' level of confidence about what they are feeding their children, how much their children consume, and whether children's nutritional needs are being met, is directly related to their own experience with food. For American parents, these experiences are overwhelmingly dominated by a meat-eating, fast food society. At issue here are two things: basic familiarity with the wide variety of vegetarian options to meat (and dairy products for vegans) and knowledge of vegetarian cooking. Once families familiarize themselves with all the products available and learn to cook delicious vegetarian food, thinking changes from \"what we cannot eat\" to \"what we can eat\" and, eventually, to \"what we choose to eat.\"\nRaising healthy vegetarian children is possible and is not difficult once a parent has done some simple research. Each person who chooses to become a vegetarian should do his or her own research. Take your standard food chart and simply substitute vegetarian or vegan alternatives making sure your child gets the recommended number of servings. When looked at in this way, it becomes clear that the task at hand is really no more difficult than feeding your average picky toddler. Resources exist in many forms available to anyone willing to peruse the magazine or nutrition/cookbook section of the local bookstore, spend an evening surfing the Internet, or contact a local national vegetarian organization. A vegetarian diet for children can not only be adequate but also abundantly healthful.\nRecipes\n"}, {"score": 1486.67, "uuid": "717a1192-7aad-5a2a-b977-86366e211bf8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0711wb-00-05833", "target_hostname": "www.lalecheleague.org", "target_uri": "http://www.lalecheleague.org/nb/nbjulaug00p131.html", "page_rank": 1.2014628e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "LLLI | Raising <em>a</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> Child", "snippet": "Researchers studied 404 children at <em>the</em> Farm, <em>a</em> cooperative community in Tennessee that encourages <em>a</em> <em>vegan</em> diet for all, <em>and</em> found no significant <em>differences</em> in growth <em>between</em> <em>the</em> <em>vegetarian</em> children who lived there <em>and</em> non-<em>vegetarian</em> children.", "explanation": null, "document": "New Guinea\nFrom: NEW BEGINNINGS, Vol. 17 No. 4 July-August 2000, pp. 131-133, 151\nThe word \"vegetarian\" may mean different things to different people.

Once families familiarize themselves with all the products available and learn to cook delicious vegetarian food, thinking changes from \"what we cannot eat\" to \"what we can eat\" and, eventually, to \"what we choose to eat.\"\nRaising healthy vegetarian children is possible and is not difficult once a parent has done some simple research. Each person who chooses to become a vegetarian should do his or her own research. Take your standard food chart and simply substitute vegetarian or vegan alternatives making sure your child gets the recommended number of servings. When looked at in this way, it becomes clear that the task at hand is really no more difficult than feeding your average picky toddler. Resources exist in many forms available to anyone willing to peruse the magazine or nutrition/cookbook section of the local bookstore, spend an evening surfing the Internet, or contact a local national vegetarian organization. A vegetarian diet for children can not only be adequate but also abundantly healthful.\nRecipes\n"}, {"score": 1481.2563, "uuid": "7ff64ac8-84df-5569-89b4-94f5943a9f3c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700wb-97-12553", "target_hostname": "juiceplus.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://juiceplus.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/07/caution-with-a-vegetarian-diet.html", "page_rank": 1.2211117e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Caution With <em>A</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> Diet", "snippet": "No matter <em>what</em> diet you follow, it <em>is</em> important to have <em>a</em> healthy balance of proteins, carbs, <em>and</em> fats, with emphasis on fruits <em>and</em> vegetables.", "explanation": null, "document": "July 03, 2009\nCaution With A Vegetarian Diet\nWhile fruits and vegetables and the nutrients from them (as provided by Juice Plus+\u00ae ) are the most important aspect of a healthy diet, is in important that you pay special attention if you are following a vegetarian diet.

While there are myriad emotional benefits to living a compassionate lifestyle, sometimes it can be challenging to deal with the onslaught of negative feelings that come from a source many of us might not recognize\u2013ourselves.\nHow could we be the ones to blame for our inability to be at peace with our lifestyle choice? This seems completely contradictory to the nature of caring for others through our diets, including ourselves and our own bodies, which benefit greatly from not being subjected to the consumption of\u00a0harmful animal products. But the sad reality is that we are often our own worst enemies when it comes to damaging attitudes surrounding our dietary and lifestyle choices. Many of us ascribe to the false belief that we must suffer or feel like we are sacrificing in order to pursue our vegan lifestyles. Many of us also feel guilty that so many animals and humans experience cruelty related to the animal agriculture industry, and that somehow we aren\u2019t doing enough. I have heard this position expressed by some of the most tireless animal rights advocates and supporters. But even the person whose activism is primarily focused on their choice to eschew animal products should feel uplifted in the knowledge that their ethical and moral decisions have the potential to make a significant difference.\nWe needn\u2019t internalize the belief that we should suffer for our choice to lessen the overall suffering of beings on this planet. According to Geneen Roth , a woman whose groundbreaking work discusses the links between feeling good about one\u2019s diet and overall self-esteem, \u201cTolerating joy means being willing to be happy even though the people around you may be depressed, lonely or sad.\u201d People around us may feel sad or try to make us share their sadness for the problems in the world. They may try to make us feel like we are extremist martyrs for some idealist global cause. We must be strong, and have the courage to resist the temptation to hate ourselves or jettison this movement because of fear or self-denigration. As happy vegans, we have much more power than we have as unhappy vegans. So feel for the animals. Feel compassion. Feel gratitude that you have come into these understandings at a crucial time in history. We have the power to take these insights and transform them, with the help of our global vegan community, into tangible, meaningful changes that will ensure our children and grandchildren do not face the same oppressive forces in their time.\nVegan Uncensored is a weekly space on this blog where people can bring interesting topics of discussion to do with veganism to the fore.

So we have to do a lot of careful reading, especially between the lines\u2026\nThe first secretary of the Vegetarian Society in 1847 was William Horsell who was a prominent \u2018vegan\u2019 running the Society from his London office. He came into inevitable conflict with the strongly \u2018ovo-lacto\u2019 president, James Simpson in Manchester.\nIn September 1849 Simpson began publishing the Vegetarian Messenger, in direct competition with Horsell\u2019s Vegetarian Advocate, and in the summer of 1850 Simpson won. Horsell stepped down as secretary and his journal ceased.\nBut wasn\u2019t the end of Mr. Horsell\u2026 the new Society had been encouraging members in towns and cities across the UK to form local committees, and London duly responded. The extract below is from Fifty Years of Food Reform, by Charles Forward in 1897, p.32:\n\u201cOn November 6th, 1849, a meeting of London Vegetarians was convened at Aldine Chambers . . . . The meeting was adjourned to November 12th, at Aurora Villa, Hampstead, when Mr. Turley occupied the chair, and it was resolved that a local committee should be formed in the Metropolis, consisting of Messrs. Viettinghoff, Wiles, Hodgson, G. Dornbusch, Turley, Edwards, Umpleby, King, Evans, Pratt, Reed, Viessieux, and James Salsbury ; Mr. Horsell being treasurer, and Mr. J. Shirley Hibberd, secretary.\n\u201c. . . Mr. Dornbusch had adopted Vegetarianism about 1843, and was an abstainer from tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, and drugs of every kind. Mr. Dornbusch\u2019s daughter was married to Mr. W. L. Beurle, an active Vegetarian, and one of the prominent workers in the movement against compulsory vaccination.\u201d\nGetting precise details is never easy, but we do know that several of the committee, and other leading members, had been connected with the Alcott House Academy which ran from 1838 to 1848 close to London, and which had been responsible for all known uses of the word \u2018vegetarian\u2019 before 1847. And in Alcott House \u2018vegetarian\u2019 was in all respects what we now call \u2018vegan\u2019. The above references to abstention from tea and coffee were typical of Alcott House (anti-vaccination was partly because of the egg whites used in the vaccine).\nWith the local committees underway the national Vegetarian Society began encouraging local groups to use the term \u2018Association\u2019 to avoid confusion. So in 1852 the London group announced that they were now the \u2018London Vegetarian Association\u2019. But these were branches of the national society, not independent groups.\nThe Vegetarian Messenger (VM) began printing extensive reports from these Associations, usually running to many pages of speeches, and often mentioning the meals. At the end of 1854 we have some contrasting accounts, all from VM, Volume 5:\np.81: \u201cThe monthly meeting of the [London] Association was held on Thursday, September 7th, at the Vegetarian Dep\u00f4t, 492, New Oxford Street. A crowded assembly of ladies and gentlemen enjoyed a repast of the fruits of the season, consisting of pears, apples, grapes, etc., and a supply of wheat-meal bread, oat-cakes, and buns.\u201d [The Vegetarian Dep\u00f4t was run by William Horsell and his partner as a book, journal and pamphlet publishing and distribution base.]\np.84: [a further comment about the same meeting] \u201cIndeed the fruits of the earth have something so pleasant in them that they must be acceptable, and if they were used more, the beauty of the Vegetarian diet would sooner be appreciated.\u201d [this was a thinly veiled sideswipe at the egg/dairy eaters \u00a0\u2013 if the comment had been too obvious it would never have been printed in the VM]\np.113 [the meeting of October 5th] : \u201c. . . almond, currant, and lemon syrups in iced water, formed very agreeable beverages.\u201d [they never used tea or coffee]\nAll these reports from London are in stark contrast with the Associations in the cities of the north of England. This one from the Leeds Vegetarian Association meeting of October 17 is typical:\np.116 : \u201c\u2026a delightful repast consisting of tea, milk, brown and white bread, biscuits, plum-cake, moulded rice, with preserves, barley, pudding, apples and pears.\u201d [the limited \u2018fruits of the earth\u2019 seemingly something of an afterthought]\nThe activities of the London Vegetarian Association were not going down at all well with the President in Manchester. It has to be taken into account that the majority of the Vegetarian Society members were in the north of England, and most of the leaders were closely connected with the Bible Christian Church. They did not merely accept the use of eggs/dairy/honey, they actively promoted it as God\u2019s given food \u2013 as in \u2018the promised land flowing with milk and honey\u2019 (Exodus 3:8). We still see something similar today from some Hindus in India who regard cow\u2019s milk as sacred, and therefore see vegans as \u2018heretics\u2019, treating them with some hostility.\nThe differences came to a head in early 1856, when William Horsell was elected secretary of LVA. James Simpson responded by replacing Horsell with a \u2018local secretary\u2019 of his own choice, more loyal to the Manchester viewpoint.\nIn a letter dated 5th May 1856, Simpson expressed his concerns that Horsell would bring the vegetarian movement: \u201c. . . under the imputations and objections which ought carefully to be avoided.\u201d\u00a0 Referring to his action of replacing Horsell: \u201c. . . any steps taken by the association at all unfavourable to the general interest of the movement being thus somewhat modified, as far as our control of the public influence of Vegetarianism in London will permit.\u201d [quoted from \u2018Of Victorians and Vegetarians\u2019 by James Gregory, 2007, p.48]\nExactly what happened after that does not appear to have been recorded by anyone, but the London Vegetarian (i.e. vegan) Association seems to have soon fizzled out in disarray. A few years later a new London group opted out completely, but that\u2019s another story\u2026\nFurther notes from VM: In its first five volumes, the Vegetarian Messenger only twice commented directly on the eggs/dairy issue. The works of the American Sylvester Graham (right) were being published in England by William Horsell from his Vegetarian Dep\u00f4t in London.\nIn the very first article of the first issue of VM (Vol.1, p.2, Sept. 1849) there was a mention of Sylvester Graham with an oblique reference to his \u2018simple\u2019 diet. The two-page article went on to make it clear the VM saw eggs/dairy as an integral part of vegetarianism. The following summer saw the final issue of Horsell\u2019s Vegetarian Advocate, which included a two page article by Graham, arguing against butter and cheese.\nVM made no further comment until late 1854 -\u00a0 Vol.V., p.4:\n\u201cMr. Graham, in his Science of Human Life, has been the leading advocate of the adoption of the Vegetarian system in dependence upon fruits, farinaceous [starchy] substances, and vegetable products alone, without the addition of animal substances, such as milk, butter, eggs, or cheese . . .\u201d [they don't seem to have been aware that Graham was heavily influenced in this by Dr. William Lambe from London, in his book of 1815.]\nThe VM claimed the Vegetarian Society took no view either way, leaving it for individuals to decide, \u00a0\u2018however\u2026\u2019 and they followed with a two page article by John Smith from Yorkshire (northern England), author of the most popular vegetarian diet book of the day. He warned against eliminating all animal products on various health grounds, ultimately seeing it as a risk of \u201c . . . Vegetarian principles brought into disrepute.\u201d\nOn page 76 of the same volume (later in 1854) the VM printed an article on \u2018The Designation of the Society\u2019. This acknowledged the confusion around the word \u2018vegetarian\u2019, without being very specific, and threw out the idea of replacing the word with \u2018Dietetic Reform\u2019, so potentially becoming the \u2018Dietetic Reform Society\u2019. This appears to have received no response at the time, but 20 years later it was London that took up that idea. But that is also part of the next story\u2026.\nFor a detailed history of veganism from 1806 see: www.ivu.org/history/vegan.html\nIVU on Facebook: www.facebook.com/InternationalVegUnion\n"}, {"score": 1454.7465, "uuid": "ad0b91db-3d1a-5cbb-a974-c4c9e84a886c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0703wb-66-00427", "target_hostname": "www.veggies.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.veggies.org.uk/directory/detail-75-147.htm", "page_rank": 1.1723467e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Thames Valley <em>Vegans</em> <em>and</em> <em>Vegetarians</em> :: Reading :: Climate Change", "snippet": "# <em>What</em> <em>Is</em> <em>the</em> <em>Difference</em> <em>Between</em> Baking Soda &amp; Baking Powder? # Round Up of Nottingham\u2019s 2010 Free Food Give-Aways <em>A</em> social &amp; active group based around Reading.

They understand that each of us is born with a certain intrinsic nature, raised to follow specific beliefs, and taught to hold particular prejudices. Over time, we discover new \u201ctruths\u201d and abandon others, altering our attitudes, principles, and values.\nEven though we can recognize that our belief system changes over time, at any given point, most of us believe our current opinions are \u201cright\u201d \u2013 our convictions well founded, our actions justified. We each want to think we are, at heart, a good person. Even when, years later, we find ourselves reflecting on previously held beliefs with a sense of bemusement (or worse), it rarely occurs to us that we may someday feel the same way toward the attitudes we now hold.\nEffective advocates understand this evolution of people\u2019s views, and, furthermore, recognize they can\u2019t change anyone\u2019s mind. No matter how elegant an argument, ultimately, real and lasting change comes only when others are free to explore new perspectives. Of course, there is no magic mechanism to bring this about. The simplest way to encourage others to open their hearts and minds is for our hearts and minds to be open, believing in our own potential to learn and grow. I believe sincerity and humility are imperative for advocates, because no one has all the answers.\nRecognizing this, I worked for years to set aside everything I thought I \u201cknew,\u201d so as to find what is fundamentally important. I came to realize that virtually all our actions can be traced to two drives: a desire for fulfillment and happiness, and a need to avoid or alleviate suffering. At the core, something is \u201cgood\u201d if it leads to more happiness, and something is \u201cbad\u201d if it leads to more suffering. This may seem simplistic at first, but it really does allow us to cut through confusion, providing a straightforward measure by which to judge the consequences of our actions and evaluate our advocacy.\nIn his book Painism, Richard Ryder points out, \u201cAt its extreme, pain is more powerful than pleasure can ever be. Pain overrules pleasure within the individual far more effectively than pleasure can dominate pain.\u201d Because of this, I believe that reducing suffering is the ultimate good, and must be our bottom line.\nPrinciples of Advocacy\nIf you are reading this, you are obviously concerned about more than just your own immediate pleasure. The question then is: How can we best make a difference in a world where suffering is so widespread?\nA basic understanding of human nature shows that all of us have an affinity for the known and immediate. Most people working for a better world concentrate on those closest to them, geographically or biologically. Even those who look beyond species often focus on either the familiar or the fantastic, with a majority of resources spent on cats and dogs, endangered species, or campaigns focused on high-profile animals.\nFurthermore, we all want to feel that our efforts have accomplished something concrete, that we\u2019ve been \u201cvictorious.\u201d It often doesn\u2019t matter how significant the accomplishment is \u2013 or even if the world is truly better off \u2013 but only that something tangible has been achieved.\nTaking into account these predispositions and our bottom line of reducing suffering has led Vegan Outreach to formulate two guiding principles to maximize the amount of good we can accomplish:\nSet aside personal biases.\nRather than focusing on what appeals to (or offends) us personally, we challenge ourselves to approach advocacy through a straightforward analysis of the world as it is, striving solely to alleviate as much suffering as possible.\nRecognize our severely limited resources and time.\nIt is an inescapable fact: when we choose to do one thing, we are choosing not to do another. There is no way around it. Instead of choosing to \u201cdo something, do anything,\u201d we challenge ourselves to pursue actions that will likely lead to the greatest reduction in suffering.\nWhy Vegan Outreach?\nBased on these two principles, Vegan Outreach seeks to expose the cruelties of factory farms and industrial slaughterhouses, while providing honest information on how to make cruelty-free choices. Our emphasis on ethical eating is derived from our principles of advocacy, not vice versa. No philosophy, lifestyle, or diet has any value in and of itself. Rather, the significance of promoting cruelty-free eating is that it allows us to alleviate as much suffering as possible, for three reasons:\nChickens raised for meat (above, courtesy of USDA) and eggs (below, courtesy of CAA).\nThe Numbers\nNinety-nine of every hundred animals killed annually in the United States are slaughtered for human consumption. That\u2019s ten billion land animals \u2013 more than the world\u2019s entire human population \u2013 raised and killed for food each year in this country alone.\nThe Suffering\nIf these billions of animals lived happy, healthy lives and had quick and painless deaths, then a concern for suffering would lead us to focus our efforts elsewhere. But animals raised for food must endure horrible cruelties. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of advocating on behalf of these animals is trying to describe the suffering they endure: the confinement and overcrowding, the stench, the racket, the extremes of heat and cold, the attacks and even cannibalism, the hunger and starvation, the illness, the mutilation, the broken bones and failing organs, etc. Indeed, every year, hundreds of millions of animals \u2013 many times more than the number killed for fur, in shelters, and in laboratories combined \u2013 don\u2019t even make it to slaughter. They actually suffer to death.\nThe Opportunity\nIf there were nothing we could do about these animals\u2019 suffering\u2014if it all happened in a distant land beyond our influence\u2014then, again, our focus would be different. But exposing factory-farming and advocating ethical eating is, by far, our best option for making a better world. We don\u2019t have to overthrow a government. We don\u2019t have to forsake modern life. We don\u2019t have to win an election or convince Congress of the validity of our argument. We don\u2019t have to start a group or organize a campaign. Rather, every day, every single person makes decisions that affect the lives of farmed animals. Informing and inspiring people to open their hearts and minds to making compassionate choices leads to many fewer animals suffering.\nNearly everyone wants a better world. We oppose injustice and violence and wish we could do something to stop it. What can we do about starvation and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa? We can donate money, write letters, or try to get the government to intervene and give more aid. All of those efforts, though well meaning, are often far removed from having a proportionate or long-term impact.\nFocused, effective animal advocacy, however, allows us to have an immediate and profound influence every single day. Preventing animals from being bred for factory farms may not appear to be a particularly exciting or inspiring goal, especially compared to the plight of individual animals or the urgency of the latest tragedy. But if we are to alleviate as much suffering as possible, we need to maximize our impact; through vegetarian advocacy, every single person we meet is a potential victory!\nVariations on a Theme\nThe logic outlined above seems straightforward to me now, but I didn\u2019t arrive at these conclusions overnight. Before founding Vegan Outreach and seeking to maximize our impact, Jack Norris and I followed the \u201cdo something, do anything\u201d philosophy, trying to fight many different forms of animal exploitation through various methods of advocacy \u2013 from letter writing campaigns to scores of protests and everything in between, including civil disobedience.\nEven within the realm of exposing factory farms and promoting vegetarianism, there are many different options. Vegan Outreach seeks to reach as many new people as possible with our illustrated booklets, which provide detailed and documented accounts of the realities of modern agribusiness, along with honest and useful information about making compassionate choices. Similarly, the Christian Vegetarian Association\u2019s booklet Would Jesus Eat Meat Today? reaches out to many people through their existing ethical framework. This allows CVA to advocate to a vast audience for whom other approaches may be less effective.\nJoe Espinosa wears a \u201cbody TV\u201d while handing out copies of Why Vegan? at a festival in Chicago (courtesy of Protecting Animals USA).\nOthers focus on harnessing the power of video footage, such as Meet Your Meat ( meat.org ). Certain groups take out free spots on public access TV; others, like Compassion Over Killing, air commercials. Some activists wear a \u201cbody TV,\u201d which presents a powerful message and attracts people who may otherwise ignore a leafleter. The Internet is also providing new and exciting advocacy opportunities. Many regional groups provide important resources and information, from publishing local shopping and dining guides to organizing social gatherings and building a supportive community.\nWe need everyone\u2019s efforts if we are going to bring about change as quickly as possible. There is much to do: we must reach and influence those who might be willing to go vegan; reach and influence those who might be willing to go vegetarian; reach and influence those who won\u2019t (now) go veg, but who might eat fewer animals or stop buying meat from factory farms \u2013 and support all these people as they continue to learn and grow. Outreach to each of these audiences is necessary if we are to help a large and diverse society evolve to a new ethical norm. No single tactic or message will be optimally effective for everyone. This is why Vegan Outreach produces a range of literature \u2013 our advocacy booklets Compassionate Choices (the least graphic, with friendliest cover; useful for displays, talks, tabling, leafleting), Even If You Like Meat (designed primarily for leafleting colleges), and Why Vegan? (for situations where people won\u2019t be put off by the word \u201cvegan\u201d), as well as our informative follow-up, Guide to Cruelty-Free Eating (with detailed nutrition information and advocacy advice). With these tools, anyone, in any situation, can be a highly effective advocate for the animals.\nAdvocacy for Maximum Change\nVegan Outreach works for maximum change \u2013 the greatest reduction in suffering per dollar donated and hour worked \u2013 by presenting the optimal message to our target audience. Of course, with an infinite budget, we could provide a customized message to everyone. Given our limited resources, though, Vegan Outreach focuses on young adults \u2013 particularly college students \u2013 for three main reasons:\nThe Relative Willingness and Ability to Change\nObviously, not every young adult is willing to stop eating meat. But relative to the population as a whole, this age group tends to be more open-minded and in a position where they aren\u2019t as restricted by parents, tradition, habits, etc.\nThe Full Impact of Change\nEven if young people and senior citizens were equally likely to change, over the course of their lives, the young can save more animals. They not only have more meals ahead of them, but also have more opportunities to influence others.\nThe Ability to Reach Large Numbers\nWhether at a college or outside a concert, for a relatively small investment of time, an activist can hand a copy of Even If You Like Meat or Compassionate Choices to hundreds of young people who otherwise might have never viewed a full and compelling case for compassion.\nLeft: John Sakars provides Compassionate Choices to the crowd at a Warped Tour concert in Mississauga, Ontario. Right: A student activist leaflets the University of Florida\u2019s busy Gainesville campus (courtesy of Casey Constable).\nChoosing the optimal message is vital. Some argue that we should appeal to self-interest by attributing great health benefits to a vegan diet. But consider, for example, how much money and time that respected health organizations have spent on the ineffectual campaign to convince people to simply add more fruits and vegetables to their diets. Furthermore, claims that veganism prevents / reverses heart disease or that meat causes colon cancer can be met not only with examples of vegans who died of those diseases, but with counterclaims that soy causes breast cancer, that the Atkins diet has been proven superior, or that people with a certain blood type can\u2019t be vegetarian. No matter the underlying truth, the public will believe the claims that support the status quo and the path of least resistance.\nOf course, if you were to ask to the average individual what is important, personal health would come before factory farming. As advocates, however, we\u2019re not trying to reinforce people\u2019s existing concerns and prejudices. Rather, our goal is to reveal hidden truths and have people open their hearts and minds to the idea of expanding their circle of consideration. Although few turn away from a graph of heart-attack statistics or relative water usage, and many turn away from Meet Your Meat, it isn\u2019t because the latter is the \u201cwrong\u201d message. Rather, unlike abstract statistics of waste production or cancer rates, revelations of obvious cruelty cannot be debated, ignored, or forgotten; they have a personal, emotional impact and demand a real response.\nExposing what goes on in factory farms and slaughterhouses surely isn't going to persuade everyone at this time. But it is far better if 95% turn away revolted and 5% open their minds to change than if all politely nod in agreement as they continue on to McDonald\u2019s for a \u201chealthy\u201d chicken salad.\nDespite the efforts of thousands of people over the course of decades, trying to appeal to everyone hasn\u2019t worked. It is well past time to give up the idea that there is some perfect, noncontroversial, self-centered argument that will magically inspire everyone to go vegan.\nIf our goal is to advocate for the animals, that is what we should do \u2013 because it works! Pointing out that eating meat causes unnecessary suffering is honest, straightforward, and the only argument people can\u2019t refute or nitpick. Showing people the plight of farmed animals is a highly effective means of creating fundamental, lasting change. Again and again, revealing factory farming\u2019s hidden but undeniable cruelty to animals has proven the most compelling reason for changing one\u2019s diet \u2013 and maintaining that change \u2013 in the face of peer pressure, tradition, the latest fad, etc. Because of our efforts at exposing the animals\u2019 plight, awareness is now growing every year: factory farms \u2013 unknown to most people only two decades ago \u2013 are now commonly condemned as ethical abominations, with new ballot initiatives, laws, and corporate reforms abolishing the most egregious abuses. Every year, Vegan Outreach\u2019s hundreds of leafleters find increased interest in our booklets. We regularly receive feedback like, \u201cI had no idea what went on! Thank you so much for opening my eyes!\u201d\nA student considers the plight of farmed animals while walking across the campus of Ohio\u2019s Miami University (courtesy of Leslie Patterson).\nAnd yet, there are many, many more people to reach. The simplest way to get information to people is to stock displays with Vegan Outreach literature: libraries, music and bookstores, co-ops and natural food shops, coffeehouses, and sympathetic restaurants.\nYouth, though, is where the animals get the biggest bang for the buck. Vegan Outreach\u2019s Adopt a College program, a network of activists leafleting local campuses (and concerts and other venues), serves to reach out methodically to our prime audience. This is the first systematic, nationwide plan to create maximum change by taking the animals\u2019 plight to the most receptive people. We know this works, and you can join the others who are part of this powerful, efficient, effective activism. You don\u2019t need to start a group, or publish a web site, or organize anything \u2013 you just need to take suffering seriously and devote some of your time or money to making a difference; we\u2019ll provide all the materials and guidance you need. Going out to leaflet for the first time might seem intimidating, but most activists get over their nervousness once they hand out their first few booklets. They\u2019ll also tell you how rewarding leafleting can be. Vegan Outreach is often able to put new activists in touch with experienced leafleters, which can make it even easier to get started.\nBeing a part of Vegan Outreach will vastly increase your ability to make a difference. Whether you leaflet or finance the distribution of our booklets, for every person you help convince to go vegetarian, you double the impact of your life\u2019s food choices. If, for example, you provide booklets to sixty new people tomorrow and just one decides to go vegetarian, you will have changed that person's life forever. More importantly, you'll have saved, with just a small investment of time or money, as many animals as you'll save with every choice you make during the rest of your life!\nIn other words: if we agree that being vegetarian is vital, then we must recognize that being a part of effective animal advocacy is many, many times more important.\nEffective Advocacy = Focus\nAnyone who has been vegetarian for more than a few minutes knows the many roadblocks \u2013 habit, tradition, convenience, taste, familiarity, peer pressure, etc. \u2013 that keep people from considering the animals\u2019 plight. Many people are looking for an excuse to dismiss us. Knowing this, we can\u2019t give anyone any reason to ignore the terrible and unnecessary suffering on factory farms and in slaughterhouses.\nIf we want to be as effective as we possibly can be for the animals, it is essential that we recognize and avoid common traps. Remember: Our message is simple. We shouldn\u2019t distract people by offering every piece of information that strikes us as somewhat anti-meat. Nor should we try to address every tangential argument, letting our discussions degrade into debates over Jesus\u2019 loaves and fishes, abortion, politics, desert islands, evolution, Grandpa\u2019s cholesterol level, etc. Nothing can counter the fact that eating animals causes unnecessary suffering.\nSimilarly, we can\u2019t afford to build our case from questionable sources. Factory farms and slaughterhouses are hidden from view, and the industry\u2019s PR machine denies the inherent cruelties (\u201cAnimals are treated well, slaughterhouses are strictly regulated\u201d). The public won\u2019t believe otherwise just because we say so. We must present them with well-documented information\u2014from industry sources or respected, nonpartisan third parties\u2014and indisputable photos and videos.\nIt\u2019s also extremely important to consider how the public will respond to certain information. No matter how reasonable or powerful a claim may seem to us, and no matter how we think the public should react, we can\u2019t make claims that may be \u201cmisinterpreted.\u201d Even those from highly regarded sources can have disastrous repercussions. Health or environmental claims that primarily denigrate beef or red meat, for example, are often taken by the public as a reason to eat more chickens.\nOur focus must remain on the animals, not ourselves or our particular diets. Our choices don\u2019t need to be defended; our lifestyle is not an end in itself. Living ethically is not about following a dogma, nor is it avoiding a list of forbidden ingredients. It is only a tool for opposing cruelty and reducing suffering. Remember, our goal is not to express our rage at animal abuse, or show how smart and enlightened we are. We don\u2019t want to \u201cwin an argument with a meat eater.\u201d We want people to open their hearts and minds to the animals\u2019 plight. It all simplifies to this:\nBuying meat, eggs, and dairy causes unnecessary suffering.\nWe can each choose not to cause this suffering.\nStaying Healthy\n\u201cStaying Healthy on Plant-Based Diets\u201d is a detailed article on nutrition by Jack Norris, RD (shown above). You\u2019ll find an abridged version in our Guide to Cruelty-Free Eating and the full article with references at VeganHealth.org\nWhile leafleting colleges across the country in the mid-90s, Jack was often told, \u201cI was veg for a while, but I didn\u2019t feel healthy.\u201d This real-world feedback, still heard by leafleters today, stands in stark contrast to the \u201cvegetarianism is a wonder diet/meat is a deadly poison\u201d message favored by some activists.\nEven a moderate health argument doesn\u2019t hold sway over most people \u2013 especially young people. But the health argument is worse than an inefficient use of our limited resources. When we recite amazing claims, the public often hears it as dishonest propaganda. This ultimately hurts animals, because most people will then dismiss all animal advocates. Those few who do try a vegetarian diet because of its purported \u201cmagical properties\u201d will likely quit if they don\u2019t immediately lose weight, increase their energy, etc. They will then tell everyone how awful they felt as a vegetarian, and how much better they feel now as a meat eater. Just one failed vegetarian can counter the efforts of many advocates.\nThe nutritional case historically presented by vegetarians was so bad that, in 2001, Jack became a registered dietitian in order to evaluate nutrition research firsthand and provide sound recommendations. If we want to do our best to prevent suffering, we must learn and provide a complete, unbiased summary of the nutritional aspects of an ethical diet, including uncertainties and potential concerns. Doing so leads people to realize we are not simply partisan propagandists, and creates healthy spokespeople for the animals!\nCountering the Stereotype\nJennifer Greene hands Even If You Like Meat booklets to concertgoers at Madison Square Garden.\nSociety\u2019s stereotype of animal advocates and vegans is a significant roadblock to widespread change. \u201cVegan\u201d no longer needs to be explained when referenced. But unfortunately, the word is often used as shorthand for someone young, fanatical, and antisocial. This caricature guarantees that veganism won\u2019t be considered \u2013 let alone adopted \u2013 on a wide scale.\nRegrettably, the \u201cangry vegan\u201d image has some basis in reality. Not only have I known many obsessive, misanthropic vegans, I was one myself. My anger and self-righteousness gave many people a lifetime excuse to ignore the realities hidden behind their food choices.\nAs a reaction to what goes on in factory farms and slaughterhouses, very strong feelings, such as revulsion and outrage, are understandable and entirely justified. The question, though, isn\u2019t what is warranted, but rather, what helps animals. I have known hundreds of outraged activists who insisted, \u201cAnimal liberation by any means necessary! I\u2019m willing to do anything!\u201d Yet few of these people are still active, and animal liberation remains in the future.\nIf we truly want to have a fundamental, lasting impact on the world, we must deal with our emotions in a constructive way. We need to ask ourselves:\nAre we willing to direct our passion, rather than have it rule us?\nAre we willing to put the animals\u2019 interests before our personal desires?\nAre we willing to focus seriously and systematically on effective advocacy?\nIt is not enough to be a vegan, or even a dedicated vegan advocate. We must remember the bottom line \u2013 reducing suffering \u2013 and actively be the opposite of the vegan stereotype. Just as we need everyone to look beyond the short-term satisfaction of following habits and traditions, we need to move past our sorrow and anger to optimal advocacy. We must learn \u201chow to win friends and influence people,\u201d so that we leave everyone we meet with the impression of a joyful individual leading a fulfilling and meaningful life.\nAn Activist\u2019s Life = A Meaningful Life\nMatt Ball, the author of A Meaningful Life, with his wife and daughter, Anne and Ellen Green.\nI\u2019m not saying we should put on an act of being happy. Rather, as thoughtful activists, we can be truly happy!\nLooking at the long arc of history, we see how much society has advanced in just the last few centuries. It was over two thousand years ago that the ideals of democracy were first proposed in ancient Greece, but only during the eighteenth century did humanity see even the beginnings of a truly democratic system. Not until late in the nineteenth century was slavery officially abolished in the developed world. In all of human history, only in the last hundred years was child labor abolished in the developed world, child abuse criminalized, women given the vote, and minorities given more rights.\nMany people worked diligently to bring about those ethical advances for humanity. Because of the number of individuals suffering and the reason for this hidden brutality, I believe animal liberation is the moral imperative of our time. If we take suffering seriously and commit to optimal advocacy, we too can bring about fundamental change. We can already see progress in just the past decade \u2013 public concern for farmed animals\u2019 interests and condemnation of factory farms, as well as more vegetarians, near-vegetarians, and vegetarian products. Our advocacy\u2019s focus, tools, and programs have also improved immensely during that time \u2013 Adopt a College, for example, was only launched in 2003.\nAnimal liberation can be the future. As the magazine The Economist concluded, \u201cHistorically, man has expanded the reach of his ethical calculations, as ignorance and want have receded, first beyond family and tribe, later beyond religion, race, and nation. To bring other species more fully into the range of these decisions may seem unthinkable to moderate opinion now. One day, decades or centuries hence, it may seem no more than \u2018civilized\u2019 behavior requires.\u201d\nWe can be the generation that brings about this next great ethical advance. We should revel in the freedom and opportunity we have to be part of something so profound, something fundamentally good. This is as meaningful and joyous a life as I can imagine!\nFewer than four hundred years ago, the Inquisition sentenced Galileo to prison for pointing out that the Earth is not the center of the physical universe. With our efforts, society will recognize that humans are not the center of the moral universe, and will look back with horror and disgust on the subjugation of animals for food. This century can be the one in which society stops torturing and slaughtering our fellow earthlings for a fleeting taste of flesh.\nIt is up to us to make this happen.\nWe have no excuse for waiting \u2013 we have the knowledge, the tools, and the truth. Taking a stand against cruelty to animals requires only our choice. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, Jr.:\nThe arc of history is long\nAnd ragged\n"}, {"score": 1451.1919, "uuid": "231c90fa-caa4-5192-9180-31cece2385af", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0500tw-06-23045", "target_hostname": "tropicalcuisine.com", "target_uri": "http://tropicalcuisine.com/2012/03/01/submit-your-tropical-vegetarian-vegan-and-raw-recipes/", "page_rank": 1.2442458e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "Submit your tropical <em>vegetarian</em>, <em>vegan</em> <em>and</em> raw recipes!", "snippet": "Thus I decided to put <em>a</em> call out to recipe concocters <em>and</em> cooks of tropical Australia to contribute your <em>vegetarian</em>, <em>vegan</em> <em>and</em> raw food recipes to <em>a</em> collection I will publish as tropical cuisine: <em>vegetarian</em>. ", "explanation": null, "document": "By clare , March 1, 2012\nAbout Clare and tropical cuisine\nMany of you probably already know me, but a quick intro for those who don\u2019t and some info too about this project.\u00a0 In November 2010, after two years of research, recipe development, writing, editing and publishing, I released my cookbook tropical cuisine: cooking in clare\u2019s kitchen.\u00a0 Just after its release I was astonished to receive the Gourmand World Cookbook Award for Best Innovative Cookbook in Australia.\u00a0 I then went on to reach 4th place internationally in the same category at the Awards ceremony in Paris, March 2011.\nIf you have seen tropical cuisine, then you will know that I don\u2019t talk a lot about the philosophies that lie behind my approach to food, preferring to \u201cdo\u201d instead.\u00a0 I follow Stephanie Alexander\u2019s perspective of providing people with straight forward recipes and sound cooking and preparation advice that produces flavoursome food.\u00a0 If this works, as it seems to be doing thus far with tropical cuisine: cooking in clare\u2019s kitchen, then I am happy, because the outcome is increased use of fresh, local, un-processed non-proprietary products.\nI am of the view, as many of us increasingly are, that there is an alarming and unnecessary amount of highly processed and proprietary food (or more accurately, \u201cfood-like substances\u201d as Michael Pollan so correctly describes them) in our food chain and food choices.\u00a0 Even in organic and health food stores there is an increase in more highly processed products.\nBeing creatures of appetite, as we humans are, my contribution to switching people back onto cooking-from-scratch and produce-based eating is to provide reliable, easily used advice and recipes that make it easy for people to cook from scratch with fresh ingredients and end up with fabulously tasty food.\nPeople can make this switch with or without ideological, philosophical or economic reason for doing so.\u00a0 I want to reach a broad range of people, including those who have no relationship with local food, vegetarian, vegan or raw food movements, and I have done so with my current cookbook.\u00a0 From my perspective, the more people who are eating well and eating locally sourced foods, the better for them, and for us all.\nDiet \u2013 the ways we choose to eat \u2013 is influenced by such a broad range of factors, from sensory preference, ideology, culture, tradition, spiritual practices, geography, environment, economy and health requirements.\u00a0 I personally eat a lot of fruit, vegetables and herbs and also eat meat.\u00a0 I mention this so you can choose whether you wish your recipe to go into a collection compiled and edited by an omnivore.\nI respect the many good reasons people choose to be on vegetarian, vegan, and raw food diets, which is why I\u2019m compiling this volume.\u00a0 And I also respect that some may not want to contribute to this volume with an omnivore at the helm.\u00a0 I hope that this collection will contribute to our local tropical food economy and encourage more people to use (and maybe also grow at home) more of what is available in our incredibly lush part of the world.\nTropical cuisine: vegetarian\nTropical produce including tropical fruits from all over the world have been widely established in Far North Queensland now for over 40 years.\u00a0 Both traditional owners and post-colonisation residents of tropical Australia have also made use of our many indigenous foods.\u00a0 There are individuals and families all across tropical Australia who have long been creating recipes and cooking with particular produce, and have developed great techniques and recipes for dealing with particular fruits, vegetables, greens, fungi, grains, seeds, root crops, sea vegetables, herbs and spices.\nWhat we don\u2019t have much of, however, is forums to share this precious body of knowledge.\u00a0 In the research for tropical cuisine: cooking in clare\u2019s kitchen I became really aware of this fact; how there is so much knowledge out there, but it is very hard for someone new to the tropics to access this body of culinary wisdom.\u00a0 If we are going to develop a stronger, more vital and sustainable local agricultural, horticultural and food supply chain in Far North QLD and tropical Australia more broadly, it needs to be way easier for people to get to know and use the sort of produce which grows brilliantly in our climates.\nThus I decided to put a call out to recipe concocters and cooks of tropical Australia to contribute your vegetarian, vegan and raw food recipes to a collection I will publish as tropical cuisine: vegetarian.\u00a0 It will be published as an ebook to manage costs and speed the availability of the book to readers.\u00a0 Visually it will be as rich, tempting and well designed as tropical cuisine: cooking in clare\u2019s kitchen.\nTropical cuisine: vegetarian will be a comprehensive collection of recipes, from pickles, preserves and sauces through to snacks, salads, soups, drinks, mains, side dishes, desserts and baking.\u00a0 It will also contain a vegetarian version of the produce encyclopaedia that is present in tropical cuisine: cooking in clare\u2019s kitchen.\nBenefits to you\nEvery recipe contributed that gets into the ebook or on my website (if there are too many contributions to fit into the ebook) will receive:\na copy of the ebook package.\u00a0 The ebook package is a PDF version of the book (which looks like an electronic version of the printed book, with double pages spreads) and a Kindle OR ePUB version of the book (for reading on e-readers).\na head note (the paragraph under the recipe title that says a bit about the recipe) that names the contributor\nif you have a website that relates to food and gardening the head note can also include a live link to your website\nthis means if people wish to they can click on it and be taken to your website (further guidelines on appropriate websites are available by giving me a call).\nIn this way the ebook will not be a static production, but a dynamic network of information and links across people, businesses and communities in tropical Australia who are involved with tropical produce and vegetarian, vegan and raw food living.\u00a0 It will be a way of giving locals easier ways of finding out about likeminded people and businesses.\u00a0 It will help you share your passion or business with local and international likeminded individuals.\u00a0 It will give your talents international exposure, as the ebook will go for sale on the international market.\u00a0 If you are interested in publishing your own recipe or similar book it will give you a taste of the process involved, and connect you to your potential audience.\nHow to contribute\nThe notes below may look a bit daunting, but they\u2019re not really.\u00a0 What I explicate below can be summed up briefly in the statement \u2013 don\u2019t muck with nature.\u00a0 This is a recipe collection to celebrate the flavours, textures and sheer goodness of our tropical produce \u2013 our fruits, vegetables, greens, fungi, grains, seeds, root crops, sea vegetables, herbs and spices.\nThe recipe must be your original material.\u00a0 A very general rule of thumb is that if you have written up the method in your own style or \u201cvoice\u201d, and/or if you have adjusted the ingredients in some way (a bit more or less, translated from imperial to metric, added or removed an ingredient) then you can say that it is your recipe.\nIf you have general tips on the use of produce that you may not see as a recipe (such as \u201ctry black sapote with a squeeze of lime juice\u201d) please still contribute such information.\u00a0 This collection is about providing straightforward recipes and flavour combinations for people to try, although there will certainly be room for some more complex recipes if the final product is seductive, delicious and/or nutritious enough for the reader to warrant the extra effort.\nYou must live (or have lived) in the tropics or subtropics and grow (or be able to grow) the main ingredient/s at home and/or be able to source them in your region from other local home-gardeners or farmers.\nBrand name ingredients? Nup. You might own a local food brand, and as mentioned above you are welcome to submit your webpage to be embedded as a link in the top of a recipe, but the ingredient list itself must give generic terms for the ingredients (such as \u201cdehydrated mango\u201d, or \u201craw cacao chocolate\u201d or \u201cbiodynamic milk\u201d).\nHighly processed ingredients? Niet. This point needs a bit of exploring, particularly in regards fats and oils, because that means no margarines, no treated oils (ie. no \u2018light\u2019 olive oil for instance) no rice bran spread.\u00a0 Straight rice bran oil, virgin olive oil, nut oils, coconut oil, butter, etcetera \u2013 all fine.\nThis point also therefore excludes ingredients such as condensed milk.\u00a0 The general rule to follow if trying to work out whether one of your ingredients is highly processed or not is to ask \u201cif I, or the reader, had access to the right information and produce could I/they produce this ingredient themselves at home?\u201d\nI also like Michael Pollan\u2019s general rule for determining the difference between food and food-like substances (highly processed derivatives of foods):\nif it has an ingredient list that includes things the ordinary person wouldn\u2019t have in their pantry (like high fructose corn syrup, or xanthan gum);\nif the ingredient list includes three or more number codes or incomprehensible ingredient names;\nthen it\u2019s a food-like substance.\nFoods are things our grandparents and great-grandparents would recognise such as fruits, vegetables, greens, fungi, grains, seeds, root crops, sea vegetables, herbs and spices and the simple products (ground meal, flours, etc) that come from them.\nProprietary kitchen gadgets or machines? No. That means for instance that Thermomix fans will need to provide recipes in a format useable in a standard kitchen.\u00a0 On top of hand held manual kitchen gear, the range of kitchen gadgets and machines you can presume are in the readers kitchen include such things as: hand or electric beaters; bench top blender and/or hand-held stick blender; food processor or a range of manual alternatives (such as graters, hand beater, whisk, etc.); kitchen scales; and measuring cups, jugs and spoons.\nThe focus is on produce and pantry staples. Produce may be fresh or simply processed such as by being dehydrated, ground, milled, rolled, dried, pickled or frozen.\u00a0 Any treatment the produce has undergone (dehydrating, pickling, etc) must be a process the reader can do at home themselves if they choose to.

But since the time animals emerged\u2013only 600 million years ago\u2013plants and animals have co-evolved in remarkable ways. The first seeding plants evolved 350 million years ago, and their reproductive strategy relied on animals to spread the seeds.\u00a0 The flowers that so delight us were produced by plants to attract nectar-eating creatures such as bees who transfer pollen from one plant to another.\u00a0 Plants seem to know when their pollinating species are active and in proximity from such indicators as bark-nibbling and pecking, and plants may conserve moisture and energy by not fruiting until migratory or hibernating pollinators are present.\u00a0 The point of fruit, nut, grain, and nectar production by plants is for animals to eat it, and thus to aid in the propagation of plants.\nThird, while humans and other animals sometimes eat the entire plant or otherwise destroy the plant during feeding or harvesting, the cost of meat production in terms of the amount of plant protein needed to feed an animal to produce meat is so high that people are responsible for far less plant consumption by eating plants directly rather than eating the animals who ate the plants.\u00a0 It takes approximately 20 pounds of plant protein to provide one pound of beef.\u00a0 The plant protein/meat ratio is lower for the production of other kinds of animal flesh, but a pound of any kind of meat costs several times more plant protein than if one eats the plant protein directly.\u00a0 This was basically the argument used by Francis Moore Lappe in DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET, when she pointed out that many more people could be fed (and fewer plants would lose their lives) if people adopted a vegetarian diet.\nIt is true that no individual can exist without some other organisms losing their lives\u2013even if it is only incidental or accidental.\u00a0\u00a0 Not even a vegan diet\u2013which forbids all animal products including eggs, dairy products, and honey\u2013ensures that no animals were killed or injured during the production of the food.\u00a0\u00a0 Mice and other field dwellers are always killed or dislocated during planting and harvesting, and insects and so-called vermin species may in fact be even more ruthlessly persecuted by organic farmers than by more typical agribusinesses because the profit margin may be smaller on the typically smaller organic farms.\nBut if one truly believes that killing a carrot is as bad as killing an animal, then the moral imperative is to refrain from eating either instead of eating both.\u00a0 Thousands of years ago, the Jains of India categorized life-forms by order of sentience, as a guide to eating in the spirit of \u201cahimsa\u201d\u2013the guiding principle of Jainism which directs people to live their lives so as to do the least harm to others.\u00a0\u00a0 Single-celled organisms (which had not yet been scientifically discovered) were listed as the lowest form of life.\u00a0 Next were listed plants, then fungi, then animals.\u00a0\u00a0 Using the principle of ahimsa as a guide, some Jains to this day refrain from eating whole plants such as carrots and potatoes or fungi such as mushrooms, but Jains still acknowledge that eating animals is many times worse in terms of causing unnecessary pain and suffering than eating whole plants.\nKim Bartlett is publisher and president of Animal People , the world\u2019s leading independent publication devoted to ecoanimal issues.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nADVERT PRO NOBIS\nIF YOU CAN\u2019T SEND A DONATION, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, AND YOU THINK THIS PUBLICATION IS WORTH SUPPORTING, AT LEAST HELP THE GREANVILLE POST EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE BY MENTIONING IT TO YOUR FRIENDS VIA TWEET OR OTHER SOCIAL NETWORKS!\nWe are in a battle of communications with entrenched enemies that won\u2019t stop until this world is destroyed and our remaining democratic rights stamped out.

Baking powder contains baking soda, but the two substances are used under different conditions.\nBaking Soda\nBaking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate . When baking soda is combined with moisture and an acidic ingredient (e.g., yogurt, chocolate, buttermilk, honey), the resulting chemical reaction produces bubbles of carbon dioxide that expand under oven temperatures, causing baked goods to rise. The reaction begins immediately upon mixing the ingredients, so you need to bake recipes which call for baking soda immediately, or else they will fall flat!\nBaking Powder\nBaking powder contains sodium bicarbonate, but it includes the acidifying agent already ( cream of tartar ), and also a drying agent (usually starch). Baking powder is available as single-acting baking powder and as double-acting baking powder. Single-acting powders are activated by moisture, so you must bake recipes which include this product immediately after mixing. Double-acting powders react in two phases and can stand for a while before baking. With double-acting powder, some gas is released at room temperature when the powder is added to dough, but the majority of the gas is released after the temperature of the dough increases in the oven.\nHow Are Recipes Determined?\nSome recipes call for baking soda, while others call for baking powder. Which ingredient is used depends on the other ingredients in the recipe. The ultimate goal is to produce a tasty product with a pleasing texture. Baking soda is basic and will yield a bitter taste unless countered by the acidity of another ingredient, such as buttermilk. You\u2019ll find baking soda in cookie recipes.\nBaking powder contains both an acid and a base and has an overall neutral effect in terms of taste. Recipes that call for baking powder often call for other neutral-tasting ingredients, such as milk. Baking powder is a common ingredient in cakes and biscuits.\nSubstituting in Recipes\nYou can substitute baking powder in place of baking soda (you\u2019ll need more baking powder and it may affect the taste), but you can\u2019t use baking soda when a recipe calls for baking powder. Baking soda by itself lacks the acidity to make a cake rise. However, you can make your own baking powder if you have baking soda and cream of tartar. Simply mix two parts cream of tartar with one part baking soda.\nLoading\n"}, {"score": 1416.8165, "uuid": "68966e65-03d5-5ef2-a685-a16d707dec84", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0010wb-31-21112", "target_hostname": "vegetarian.about.com", "target_uri": "http://vegetarian.about.com/u/ua/healthnutrition/healthyvegetariandiet.htm", "page_rank": 1.2342454e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> Diet - Have you lost weight or improved your health on <em>a</em> <em>vegetarian</em>", "snippet": "After reading several books &amp; studies that drew several ties <em>between</em> M.S. <em>and</em> diet, <em>the</em> choice to go <em>vegan</em> was easy.", "explanation": null, "document": "Have you lost weight or improved your health on a vegetarian diet or a healthy vegan diet?

I've lost many pounds, can't really say how many, but I'm smaller now than I was in high school. I find that it's hard to live without a glass of cold milk occasionally and cheese , well, it's not a spectator sport and I have yet to find a substitute worthy of the name. But I have very few issues with diverticulitis now and my hair, my nails, my skin, especially my facial skin, are all healthier than ever. No more splitting nails and acne is finally going away. That has been a problem all my life, but since I stopped eating red meat , the acne has cleared up so that I have pretty skin. And I agree with bluewormy, all around me my friends are getting old and have health problems galore and I still get up and leave them in the dust!!\n\u2014Singing.Swan\nMultiple Sclerosis\nI was diagnosed with M.S. in 06/2011. After reading several books & studies that drew several ties between M.S. and diet, the choice to go vegan was easy. It has only been a few months so I'm not ready to scream \"cure\", but I'm feeling better than I have in 15yrs (I'm 33), I'm sleeping well, my focus has improved and all symptoms have disappeared. My neurologist responded by saying that this may be the natural progression of the disease (ie: symptom relapse, followed by remission), but let me just say that I'm very encouraged by how quickly they went into full remission, almost immediately, after I changed my diet, overnight & cold turkey (no pun intended). I have not taken any M.S. \"disease modifying drugs\" yet, and considering the price (in excess of $3500 per month), low efficacy (0 to 30%) and side effects (many of which are as scary as the disease itself), I may never take any if this strict diet (along with exercise) can keep me walking, talking, and working for the next 35yrs.\n\u2014JB\nThe vegetarian advantage\nI went vegetarian two years ago. I'm 42, within two months of starting my life changed completely, I lost an excess of 17kg and my entire outlook on life changed. Now i consume only raw veggies and fruit and the occasional cheese carefully chosen by their manufacturing process. I do not consume cooked food any more and i actually see ovens and cookware as antique collectables. Who ever decided that we have to consume cooked food? ( As if the creator made a mistake somehow) !. and i no longer use harmfull chemicals to clean excessive dishes and cookware. I do not buy packaged processed food and in so doing i dont contribute to excessive waste.I often do research on food and health and the conclusion i got is that the food we eat should be a simple selection of what we actually need and modest in quantity relative to our activity levels and weight maintenance requirements. Living healthy and being well is a matter of common sense. Think and be well.\n\u2014Guest Peter\nApproved Vegan Diet\nI live in a community where everyone is vegan. This is our way of life.

Recently, at a ILAT conference, I was pleasantly suprised with a 10 course menu and the only non-veg served for others was grilled salmon and carrot cake.Each and everyone enjoyed the vegetarian experience. Being a vegetarian is a joyful healty choice which needs self-discipline and persistence.\n\u2014Guest Vani Nair\nThe Switch\nI actually went vegetarian for 4 months in 2009 to lose weight for a job. That combined with excercise really worked. But what I am noticing now that I've gone back to being a vegetarian is an increase in energy. I am a truck driver and I remember when I used to drink energy drinks to combat fatigue. But going vegetarian has actually helped me as far as bowel movements, health, mental thoughts, and I have to attribute this to God. I agree with the people here that are saying that they are against eating flesh. The US government has even recognized that meat can be interchanged with beans on the food pyramid. In sum, this is a great lifestyle and I hope to be able to maintain it for at least 1 year this time (hopefully longer). God bless you all.\n\u2014kashbmaryd\nGloria's story\nI have been vegetarian for the last 45 yrs. because I dont like the idea of eating animals. I am very healthy, no cholesterol, blood pressure.

I tried over-the-counter medications, sleeping on an incline, baking soda...nothing seemed to work. A health assessment revealed that I had a high triglyceride level, my HDL was beginning to rise and my LDL was almost non existent. I'd been listening to people who worked for some major food processors, and decided I'd finally had enough. I went lacto-vegetarian. My heartburn is now gone, my triglycerides have taken a nose-dive, my HDL is under control and my LDL is rapidly rising. My doctor is still skeptical, and insists that the initial tests must have been mistaken. That's all right, I'm happy and will remain vegetarian and healthy.\n\u2014Guest mothernyx\n20 years Vegetarian\n4 years ago I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.

A vegan aspires to avoid all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives.\nIn fact, if one person is unkind to an animal it is considered to be cruelty, but where a lot of people are unkind to animals, especially in the name of commerce, the cruelty is condoned and, once large sums of money are at stake, will be defended to the last by otherwise intelligent people.\nRuth Harrison, Animal Machines\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a vegetarian and a vegan?\nA vegetarian does not eat any dead animals, or parts of them. This means no meat, poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks, etc.), fish or other water animals (like shrimp and crabs), or any by-products of these animals, like gelatin or animal fats or cheeses made from rennet taken from the stomachs of calves.\nA vegan will not eat any of these either but will also strive to avoid all animal products for food (milk and milk products, eggs, honey) since these also cause pain and suffering. They also avoid animal products \u2013 leather, silk, pearls, wool or even paint brushes made of animal hair, as well as products that have been tested on animals.\nThe vegan genuinely believes that \u201cThou Shalt Not Kill\u201d means exactly what it says, no more no less. It certainly does not mean \u201cThou Shalt Not Kill, except for the pleasure of eating the bodies of the slain or drinking the milk intended by nature for the slaughtered calf; the vain desire to adorn the human body with fur, feathers, or skin of another animal; or because it is a very profitable business to breed or catch animals for the experimental laboratory where they will be starved, burned, gassed, poisoned or mutilated and otherwise tortured and then killed.\nEva V Batt\nA vegan diet is good for you.\nResearch shows that vegans have lower rates of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, rheumatoid arthritis, and several types of cancers . It also reduces the chance of food poisoning. And of course you avoid all the hormones and antibiotics that are pumped through animals raised for food. Our anatomy and our primate ancestry suggest that the natural diet for human beings is an almost vegan diet.\nA vegan diet is good for the animals\nIf you\u2019re already a vegetarian you\u2019ve undoubtedly helped reduce animal suffering, but the dairy and egg industries also cause immense suffering. (See farmed animal abuse ). An average Indian non- vegetarian is responsible for the lives of more than 70 living creatures a year. (Calculate one chicken per week (52), a couple of goats (2), a couple of calves killed for milk that rightly belongs to them (1 \u2013 2) and many fish! That\u2019s a lot more than 70.)\nEating meat causes suffering, fear, social deprivation, loss of natural environment, loss of liberty, mutilation and illness to 56 billion animals every year. Many animals spend thousands of miles on the road to hell. Becoming a vegan is the most effective step you can take to end this cruel practice. Each one can save more animals with their diet choice than almost any other way\nIsn\u2019t man an amazing animal? He kills wildlife \u2013 birds, kangaroos, deer, all kinds of cats, coyotes, beavers, groundhogs, mice, foxes and dingoes \u2013 by the million in order to protect his domestic animals and their feed. Then he kills domestic animals by the billion and eats them. This in turn kills man by the million, because eating all those animals leads to degenerative \u2013 and fatal- health conditions like heart disease, kidney disease, and cancer. So then man tortures and kills millions more animals to look for cures for these diseases. Elsewhere, millions of other human beings are being killed by hunger and malnutrition because food they could eat is being used to fatten domestic animals. Meanwhile, some people are dying of sad laughter at the absurdity of man, who kills so easily and so violently, and once a year, sends out cards praying for \u201cPeace on Earth.\u201d\nCoats, C. David from Old MacDonald\u2019s Factory Farm\nFish too.\nBillions of fish are caught each year. All too often unwanted species are also caught and left to die without reason. Fish are sentient creatures and feel pain. They die by suffocation which is extremely painful and which can sometimes take many minutes. Today Canada is killing thousands of baby seals brutally, by clubbing because they are competing with Canadian fishermen for the catch! So a fish eater is indirectly responsible for more deaths than the ones he sees on his table alone.\nCommercial fishing has decimated the aquatic environment. Shrimp nets kill countless sea turtles. Dragging trawlers kill all life including the plant life that fish thrive on, at the bottom of the ocean. Over-fishing is causing extinction of species that are fished as well as those that depend on these fish for food.\nToday, fish are also victims of the factory farming system. They are often farmed in floating cages or in artificial ponds. Because of the large numbers involved, and the restricted movement, disease spreads rapidly, often also to wild specimens, and the water gets highly polluted. Each vegetarian or vegan will save at least half a ton of fish in a lifetime.\nA vegan diet is good for the environment\nHere are just a few of the many reasons why \u2013\n260 million acres of virgin forest have been cleared for cropland to support a meat centered diet, depriving countless species of habitat. This is growing at the rate of about 50 million acres a year!\nOvergrazing contributes to desertification in many countries.\nVegans need less land. An acre of quality land can produce 10,000 pounds of green beans, 30,000 pounds of carrots, 50,000 pounds of tomatoes\u2013but only 250 pounds of beef.\nAnimal husbandry contributes to water shortages. It takes 500 litres of water to produce 1 kg of potatoes, 600 litres of water for 1 kg of wheat, 2000 litres of water for 1 kg of rice, but 100,000 litres of water to produce 1 kg of beef. Livestock consume a high percentage of the world\u2019s water supply.\nLivestock produces 15-20 percent of all the methane, a major atmospheric pollutant and greenhouse gas, responsible for global warming. A recent UN report states that the world\u2019s livestock is responsible for more greenhouse gases than all the worlds cars together! A depleted ozone layer, higher rates of ultraviolet B radiation and increased incidences of skin cancer is the result.\nManure produced by livestock releases ammonia into the atmosphere, a major causes of acid rain.\nManure from factory farms pollutes our water too. A typical battery egg factory with 60,000 hens produces around 165,000 pounds of excrement each and every week. The dumping of this waste inevitably ends up in our water system.\nThe world\u2019s petroleum reserves would last for only 13 years if all humans were non- vegetarians but 260 year if all humans were vegetarian.\nVeganism helps end starvation\nEveryday 840 million people around the world, including 200 million children go hungry. 60 million people die of starvation each year but much of the world\u2019s grain harvest (40%) goes to feed livestock.\n80% of the corn grown is consumed by livestock. Other high quality foods such as wheat and soy that could be fed to humans are being fed to animals.\n5 kgs of plant protein is fed to chicken to obtain 1kg of animal protein, upto 16 kilos of grain to produce 1 kilo of meat or milk.\n20 vegetarians can be fed on the amount of land needed to feed one non-vegetarian. It is far more ecological to grow grains, fruits and vegetables than raise animals. It takes just .07 hectare to produce enough food for a vegan.\nThis is my protest against the conduct of the world. To be a vegetarian is to disagree\u2013to disagree with the course of things today. Starvation, world hunger, cruelty, waste, wars\u2013we must make a statement against these things. Vegetarianism is my statement and I think it\u2019s a strong one.\nIsaac Bashevis Singer\nSlaughterhouses are some of the worst workplaces. The workers are poor, often illiterate, and sometimes children. They are treated almost as callously as the animals dying by the billions in those same facilities. The pay is low, turnover is high, and injuries and illnesses are frequent and often severe.\nWhat does veganism involve?\nVeganism involves the openness to change in order to prevent suffering, the willingness to be creative and to cook healthy tasteful meals. If a vegan eats in a healthy way, he or should not need any nutritional supplements. However, because vitamin B12 is manufactured by bacteria which are found in abundant supply in milk and meat, but not in large numbers in our present day sanitised and sometimes irradiated fruits and vegetables, vegans may find it beneficial to take B12 supplements once or twice a week.\nIt does take some work to learn how to eat and to get used to it. Of course you will miss a few things at first, like cheese and milk chocolate but there are vegan alternatives available, so don\u2019t despair.\nAs long as there is conscious life on Earth, there will be suffering. The question becomes what to do with the existence each of us is given. We can choose to add our own fury and misery to the rest, or we can set an example by simultaneously working constructively to alleviate suffering while leading joyous, meaningful, fulfilled lives. Being a vegan isn\u2019t about deprivation or anger. It\u2019s about being fully aware so as to be fully alive.\nMatt Ball, Vegan Outreach\nEconomic aspects\nGood vegan food costs much less than meat. Organic food costs more than the regular stuff but being richer in nutrients, you will find that less is needed to meet your nutritional needs. In the long run, you\u2019ll be satisfied with less food, which reduces costs. The economic benefits should be counted in terms of money saved on medical expenses and hours of time saved by not being sick!\n\u2018Thou shall not kill\u2019 does not apply to murder of one\u2019s own kind only, but to all living beings; and this Commandment was inscribed in the human breast long before it was proclaimed from Sinai.\nCount Leo Tolstoy\n"}, {"score": 1395.1215, "uuid": "19632550-0349-5c6b-8200-44929f15aad8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0307wb-67-19986", "target_hostname": "cats.about.com", "target_uri": "http://cats.about.com/od/catfoodfaqs/f/obligatecarnivores.htm", "page_rank": 1.2122824e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Please explain <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Carnivores <em>and</em> Obligate Carnivores", "snippet": "<em>The</em> short answer to your question <em>is</em>, &quot;Cats need <em>a</em> meat diet to thrive.&quot; * Check <em>the</em> Bag - Part Two - <em>a</em> Premium Brand of Cat Food Please explain <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> Carnivores <em>and</em> Obligate Carnivores&gt;", "explanation": null, "document": "vegetarian cat food\nQuestion: Why are cats described as \"obligate carnivores?\"\nThe following sentence makes sense to most people: \"Cats are carnivores.\" The following sentence is unclear: \"Cats are obligate carnivores.\" What the heck does the word \"obligate\" add to the sentence \"Cats are carnivores?\"\nAnswer:\nThere is a fine, but extremely important distinction between the two terms as related to cats. Let's start with the definition of \"carnivore.\" The simplest definition is: \"an animal which eats flesh.\" The American Heritage Science Dictionary (from Dictionary.com) goes a bit further:\nAny of various generally meat-eating mammals of the order Carnivora. Carnivores have large, sharp canine teeth and large brains, and the musculoskeletal structure of their forelimbs permits great flexibility for springing at prey. Many carnivores remain in and defend a single territory. Dogs, cats, bears, weasels, raccoons, hyenas, and (according to some classifications) seals and walruses are all carnivores.\nNot all Carnivores are Obligate Carnivores\nHowever, not all members of the order Carnivora are obligate (obligatory) carnivores.The difference? Take bears, for example. While bears kill and eat flesh, most of their species are omnivorous (eating both animal flesh and plant material.) We humans are omnivorous; so are dogs. Omnivores can live quite well on a combination of both meat and plant foods. Our intestinal tracts are quite long, and can do a satisfactory job of digesting, extracting the nutrients we need, including protein from legumes, rice, and some vegetables, and eliminating the rest as waste.\nWhy are Cats Obligate Carnivores?\nCats \"guts\" are much shorter than ours. They do not have the ability to fully digest and utilize the nutrients in plant material. Although theoretically, they might get enough protein from plant material to exist, they need taurine in order to thrive. Taurine is found primarily in the muscle meat of animals, and is most highly concentrated in the heart and liver.\nIn the wild, cats may get a small amount of grain and other plant material from the stomachs of their prey, but our domestic cats really do not need large amounts of grain. Corn is a good example. Corn is a cheap source of protein, and many of the \"supermarket brands\" of dry cat food are packed with corn in various forms, e.g., corn bran, corn germ meal, ground corn , corn gluten, corn gluten meal . If I could give you one rule of thumb only, it would be to shy away from any cat food containing corn, especially listed at or toward the the top of the ingredients. (Pet food ingredients are generally listed in descending order by dry weight.)\nIt should also be noted that some manufacturers practice \"splitting\" to keep corn from the very top of the list. Splitting is carefully calculating the percentage of each kind of corn so that the aggregate total weighs more than any other ingredient, however none of the corn ingredients is listed at the very top. There is nothing illegal about this practice, but it puts the consumer at a disadvantage. It would be much more transparent if manufacturers were required to list the percentage by weight of each ingredient. Corn is not only a poor source of protein, it is a known allergen to some cats.\nWhile some cat food manufacturers add small amounts of vegetables and fruits to their formulas, the premium foods always have named meat protein high on the list of ingredients. The fruits and vegetables are generally added for their vitamin and mineral content, and sometimes for their probiotic value.\nVegetarian Cat Food\nSome vegetarian humans prefer not to handle meat in any form, and purchase commercial vegetarian foods for their cats. Although these foods meet the AAFCO nutritional standards for a \"complete and balanced diet,\" they have come by it artificially. In my opinion, it's much like using bleached flour for white bread, then adding back the nutrients one would get naturally from a good, whole-grain bread. How can you be sure you've added back all the nutrients?

The vegetarian movement in the U.S. is now maturing after the three decades since it began mushrooming in the 1960s/\n1970s. After years of experience, some are finding things haven't worked out for them in the long term as well as hoped. Evolutionary science is also confirming our ancestors were serious omnivores. Where does this leave those in the movement who offer the vegetarian prescription as the optimum nostrum for the ecological and health ills that beset society, and more importantly, where does it leave you? At the\nBeyond Veg\nsite, of course. Here, we give you our take on the situation, and what the website is all about.\nIdealism vs. Realism in Raw Foods . A call for more realism and honesty in the raw-\nfoods movement so that raw-\nfooders themselves don't end up getting hurt, with the potential bonus result that outsiders might even start taking what truths and helpful ideas there are in the raw-foods movement seriously when the aura of offputting fanaticism is overcome. Get the message and get real--\nyou have only the chains of illusion to lose, and the marginality of the raw-foods movement\nto forgo.\nFor a plain-English translation of the available data from evolutionary science on humanity's \"original\" diet, plus a look at how far back in time cooking goes, not to mention a sober appraisal of the results of predominantly raw-\nSetting the Scientific Record Straight on Humanity's Evolutionary Prehistoric Diet and Ape Diets . With the ever-\naccumulating scientific data of recent years about human dietary evolution, the vegetarian picture of a prehistoric Garden of Eden has become hopelessly outdated. So has the \"comparative anatomy\" argument for vegetarianism, which is no longer supportable given the advent of modern field studies on apes. And the ape studies are themselves increasingly moot where human diet is concerned, given the availability of the direct evolutionary data now available on early human diet. In looking at these two areas of the scientific evidence, this thoroughly documented discussion also explores the differences between Natural Hygiene's essentially \"subjective\" model for dietary \"naturalism\" vs. the \"functional\" model of science based on evolutionary evidence.\nFire and Cooking in Human Evolution, Rates of Genetic Adaptation to Change, Hunter-Gatherers, and Diseases in the Wild . The issue of the potential value of cooked foods and how far back they go in human evolution is not as simple as most raw-\nfoodists like to think. While the question remains somewhat ambiguous given the current state of the scientific evidence, this examination of the prehistoric picture of fire discovery and use--\nplus other assorted issues regarding diet and health in the wild--\ndigs up many nuggets for consideration.\nindeed--\nraw-\nfood vegetarian diets can get real results and promote healing, as many of us already know: in the short-term, that is. However, in the long-term they can lead to real problems (including deficiencies) for some individuals, which shouldn't be surprising since such diets are a restriction of the evolutionary human diet--\na restriction not everyone can handle. Also covered is the way in which efforts to restrict diets based on idealistic concepts of \"purity\" can lead not only to physical problems, but to a vicious cycle of self-\nperpetuating, circular mental logic. The end result for those prone to taking things too far can be psychological and behavioral imbalance and fanaticism, which the individual themselves often remains oblivious to, and can become trapped in indefinitely. A conclusion suggests pointers for avoiding such traps and maintaining your sanity and open-\nmindedness.\n(Note to those who have seen the above interviews previously in Health & Beyond: The versions here on\nBeyond Veg\ncontain significant updates and additional observations--\nthere are links near the top of each of the title pages to take you directly\nto them.)\n"}], [{"score": 1387.3951, "uuid": "3ac043e3-ebd7-5476-855b-a97f26ef1e93", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0706wb-40-31978", "target_hostname": "www.vrg.org", "target_uri": "http://www.vrg.org/journal/dietitian.htm", "page_rank": 1.2038663e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Choosing <em>and</em> Using <em>a</em> Dietitian -- <em>The</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> Resource Group", "snippet": "She might work with you to put it all together in <em>a</em> menu plan; <em>and</em> indeed, many clients prefer to go home with something very structured <em>and</em> reassuring like that.

Where does this leave those in the movement who offer the vegetarian prescription as the optimum nostrum for the ecological and health ills that beset society, and more importantly, where does it leave you? At the\nBeyond Veg\nsite, of course. Here, we give you our take on the situation, and what the website is all about.\nIdealism vs. Realism in Raw Foods . A call for more realism and honesty in the raw-\nfoods movement so that raw-\nfooders themselves don't end up getting hurt, with the potential bonus result that outsiders might even start taking what truths and helpful ideas there are in the raw-foods movement seriously when the aura of offputting fanaticism is overcome. Get the message and get real--\nyou have only the chains of illusion to lose, and the marginality of the raw-foods movement\nto forgo.\nFor a plain-English translation of the available data from evolutionary science on humanity's \"original\" diet, plus a look at how far back in time cooking goes, not to mention a sober appraisal of the results of predominantly raw-\nSetting the Scientific Record Straight on Humanity's Evolutionary Prehistoric Diet and Ape Diets . With the ever-\naccumulating scientific data of recent years about human dietary evolution, the vegetarian picture of a prehistoric Garden of Eden has become hopelessly outdated. So has the \"comparative anatomy\" argument for vegetarianism, which is no longer supportable given the advent of modern field studies on apes. And the ape studies are themselves increasingly moot where human diet is concerned, given the availability of the direct evolutionary data now available on early human diet. In looking at these two areas of the scientific evidence, this thoroughly documented discussion also explores the differences between Natural Hygiene's essentially \"subjective\" model for dietary \"naturalism\" vs. the \"functional\" model of science based on evolutionary evidence.\nFire and Cooking in Human Evolution, Rates of Genetic Adaptation to Change, Hunter-Gatherers, and Diseases in the Wild . The issue of the potential value of cooked foods and how far back they go in human evolution is not as simple as most raw-\nfoodists like to think. While the question remains somewhat ambiguous given the current state of the scientific evidence, this examination of the prehistoric picture of fire discovery and use--\nplus other assorted issues regarding diet and health in the wild--\ndigs up many nuggets for consideration.\nindeed--\nraw-\nfood vegetarian diets can get real results and promote healing, as many of us already know: in the short-term, that is. However, in the long-term they can lead to real problems (including deficiencies) for some individuals, which shouldn't be surprising since such diets are a restriction of the evolutionary human diet--\na restriction not everyone can handle. Also covered is the way in which efforts to restrict diets based on idealistic concepts of \"purity\" can lead not only to physical problems, but to a vicious cycle of self-\nperpetuating, circular mental logic. The end result for those prone to taking things too far can be psychological and behavioral imbalance and fanaticism, which the individual themselves often remains oblivious to, and can become trapped in indefinitely. A conclusion suggests pointers for avoiding such traps and maintaining your sanity and open-\nmindedness.\n(Note to those who have seen the above interviews previously in Health & Beyond: The versions here on\nBeyond Veg\ncontain significant updates and additional observations--\nthere are links near the top of each of the title pages to take you directly\nto them.)\n"}, {"score": 1382.6604, "uuid": "22dcaba2-f682-5b7b-9676-03ef860c612e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0605wb-31-06527", "target_hostname": "www.vegetarian.org.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/One-in-Nine/", "page_rank": 1.196876e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation - One in Nine", "snippet": "<em>The</em> VVF ask why breast cancer cases are rising <em>and</em> investigates <em>the</em> role of diet Find more information at www.vegetarian.org.uk&#x2F;campaigns&#x2F;breastcancer <em>The</em> <em>Vegetarian</em> &amp; <em>Vegan</em> Foundation (VVF) <em>is</em> <em>a</em> science-based charity that promotes human health through <em>the</em> promotion of <em>a</em> <em>vegetarian</em> or <em>vegan</em> diet.", "explanation": null, "document": "About the Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation\nVegetarian & Vegan Foundation\nThe Vegetarian & Vegan Foundation (VVF) is a science-based charity that promotes human health through the promotion of a vegetarian or vegan diet.

By the time you reach your thirties, or certainly your forties, you will probably know someone who has, or has had breast cancer. It's the most common cancer affecting women in the UK. Each year, there are over 40,000 new cases. One in every nine women in the UK will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives. Although less prevalent, breast cancer occurs in men too, affecting one in 300 men during their lifetime.\nIt has been widely publicised that the chances of surviving breast cancer have greatly improved. Not so well-publicised is that the chance of developing breast cancer is a good deal higher too than it was in the 1970s. Between 1971 and 2003, the incidence of breast cancer has increased by a staggering 80 per cent. However, the total number of women dying from breast cancer has remained fairly constant.\nA number of potential causative risk factors are generally accepted including the early onset of periods, late menopause, having a first child late in life and, of course, genetics. Many people think that their risk of developing breast cancer is beyond their control, that \"fate\" will decide. This type of genetic fatalism results from the much-publicised link between genes and breast cancer. However, less than 10 per cent of all breast cancers are caused by faulty genes, the vast majority are caused by environmental factors including diet. Despite a growing body of scientific evidence, there is a widespread reluctance to acknowledge the role of diet in breast cancer risk.\nNumerous studies link the consumption of red meat to breast cancer. A range of mechanisms by which red meat leads to an increased risk of breast cancer have been proposed including the presence of carcinogens in meat, the hormone treatment of beef cattle (banned in Europe but practiced widely in the US) or a high intake of haem iron (a highly bioavailable form of iron from meat) which can induce tumour growth. Other studies suggest animal fat may be involved as it can raise steroid hormone levels, and high hormone levels are linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\nThe role of hormones and growth factors present in cow's milk is also a growing concern for many scientists. The hormone content of milk is very different from that of milk produced 100 years ago as modern dairy cows (including organically farmed cows) are frequently impregnated while still producing milk. In fact, two-thirds of retail milk in the UK is taken from pregnant cows, when the hormone content of the milk is markedly elevated. Cow's milk has been shown to contain over 35 different hormones and 11 growth factors. A recent survey of the published data on the occurrence of hormones in cow's milk and milk products argues that, in the light of modern dairy farming methods, there is a need to update the data concerning hormonal levels in milk and milk products.\nOther scientists are concerned about another bioactive molecule found in milk; a growth factor called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). This growth factor sends a strong signal in breast milk (including human and cow's) from mother to infant directing fast growth and development. IGF-1 is not destroyed during pasteurisation and may be absorbed across the gut wall into the bloodstream. Higher circulating IGF-1 levels are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and other cancers.\nThis is undoubtedly difficult for many people to accept as it is deeply entrenched in the British psyche that cow's milk is a natural and normal drink for people of all ages. However, most people in the world don't drink milk after weaning; they are lactose intolerant. This means they cannot digest the sugar in milk (lactose). For lactose to be digested, it must be broken down in the intestine by the enzyme lactase to its component monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Glucose can then supply energy to the young animal. All young mammals possess the enzyme lactase and can therefore digest lactose, but this ability is lost in most humans after weaning (commonly after the age of two). In global terms lactose intolerance is very common, affecting around 70 per cent of the world's population. So, contrary to popular belief in the West, not drinking milk beyond weaning is the norm.\nThere is some good news though. Many studies show how plant-based foods may offer a protective role against breast cancer. Increasing your intake of vegetables (especially salad vegetables) may help. Increasing the amount of (cereal) fibre in the diet may also reduce breast cancer risk by lowering oestrogen levels. Fibre also protects bowel health, slows sugar and fat absorption and lowers cholesterol. Good sources include fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, pulses, nuts and seeds. Meat and dairy foods do not contain any fibre.\nIt is beyond the scope of this report to attempt to review all the scientific studies investigating the role of diet in breast cancer. However, this report aims to provide a representative sample, including some key studies. Two consistent themes are very apparent throughout the scientific literature: animal-based foods (meat, animal fat and dairy foods) are linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and plant-based foods (fruit and vegetables, especially salad vegetables and fibre), are linked to a lower risk of this disease.\nIn summary, this report presents a substantial and representative sample of the evidence showing how dietary factors make a significant contribution to the risk of breast cancer.\nFor more information on what is the healthiest diet for prevention of, and for those who have, breast cancer see the VVF guide A Fighting Chance. A guide to healthy eating to help prevent and overcome breast cancer. For more information on the detrimental effects of consuming cow's milk and dairy products see the VVF's fully-referenced scientific report White Lies.\nHow breasts grow\nFigure 1: Female Breast\nBreast development\nDuring puberty the sexual organs mature, the secondary sexual characteristics (such as breasts and body hair) develop and reproduction becomes possible. During this time girls develop milk-producing glands called lobules at the back of the breasts. These lobules are connected to tiny tubes called ducts that can carry milk to the nipple. The lobules, ducts and blood vessels are surrounded by fatty tissue and connective tissue called stroma which is attached to the chest wall (see Figure 1.0).\nThe male breast\nMen have much less fatty tissue in their breasts than women but can still be affected by breast cancer. Men's breast tissue contains ducts, but only a few, if any, lobules.\nLymph nodes\nThe lymphatic system is an important part of the immune system that helps the body fight infection. It is made up of a network of thin vessels that spread into tissues throughout the body. A clear fluid called lymph circulates around the system transporting infection-fighting cells called lymphocytes that help remove foreign matter and cellular debris. Lymph nodes act as filters and may swell up when a possible threat (such as a bacterium) is identified. Generalised lymphadenopathy (when all the nodes of the body are swollen) may indicate a systemic illness such as an infection or cancer.\nBreast Awareness\nWhat to watch for\nIt is important to know how your breasts look and feel normally so that you can spot any changes as they occur. Early detection of breast cancer increases the chances of effective treatment. There are several changes to watch for:\nIf one breast becomes larger than the other\nIf a nipple becomes inverted\nRashes on or around the nipple\nDischarge from one or both nipples\nSkin texture changes (puckering or dimpling)\nSwelling under the armpit or around the collarbone (where the lymph nodes are)\nA lump that you feel is different to the rest of your breast tissue\nContinuous pain in one part of the breast or armpit (not a common symptom)\nWhat to do next\nIf you do notice one or more of these changes then make an appointment to see your GP as soon as you can but try not to worry too much as most breast symptoms do not turn out to be breast cancer. Non-cancerous or benign breast conditions that may cause breast changes include fibrocystic mastopathy, mastitis and fibroadenoma, to name but a few.\nDifferent types of breast cancer\nWhen breast cancer does occur, cells in part of the breast grow in an uncontrolled way. If the cancer is not treated, the cells can spread within the breast or even further, travelling to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells have not spread, it is called non-invasive breast cancer. If the cancer cells develop in the ducts, the cancer is called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), if they occur in the lobules, it is referred to as lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). If the cancer cells have spread (metastasised) into the surrounding breast tissue, lymph glands or further within the body, it is called invasive breast cancer.\nBreast Cancer\nNumber crunching\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in the UK and one in nine women will have this disease at some point in their lives (NHS Direct, 2007). Women in the US now have an astonishing one in eight lifetime chance of developing breast cancer (American Cancer Society, 2007). There are over 40,000 new cases in the UK every year, representing a third of all cancers in women. Between 1971 and 2003, the incidence rates of breast cancer have increased by 80 per cent (National Statistics, 2005). In the UK in 2005 there were 12,509 deaths from breast cancer (99 per cent in women, one per cent in men). Breast cancer accounts for 17 per cent of female deaths from cancer in the UK (Cancer Research UK, 2007).\nFigure 2.0 Incidence of, and mortality from, breast cancer in\nEngland and Wales between 1971 and 2003. Source: National\nStatistics, 2005.\nFigure 2.0 shows that while the incidence of breast cancer has risen sharply, mortality from breast cancer has remained fairly constant over the same period thanks largely to improved diagnostic methods and more efficient treatment. For women in the UK, there are similar numbers of deaths from lung and breast cancer. Deaths Figure 2.0 Incidence of, and mortality from, breast cancer in from breast, lung and large bowel cancer together England and Wales between 1971 and 2003. Source: National account for nearly half (45 per cent) of all female Statistics, 2005. deaths from cancer (Cancer Research UK, 2005).\nMale breast cancer\nAlthough less prevalent, breast cancer does occur in men too; one in 300 men in the UK will have breast cancer at some point in their lives (NHS Direct, 2007). Furthermore, the incidence of breast cancer among men is increasing. One large-scale study of more than 2,500 American men with the disease showed that between 1973 and 1998 the incidence of breast cancer among men increased by 26 per cent (Giordano et al., 2004). This study found that men tended to have larger tumours which had spread further by the time they sought help. That said, breast cancer remains a rare disease among men. Lung, prostate, bowel, oesophageal and stomach cancer are the five biggest causes of cancer death among men in the UK (Cancer Research UK, 2003).\nBreast cancer around the world\nDisease incidence rates measure the number of new diagnoses per 100,000 people during a defined time period (usually a given year). Age standardisation, often referred to as 'age-adjustment', is used to eliminate the confounding effects of differences in the age composition of different populations. This allows us to make statistical comparisons of incidence rates between different populations.\nThe age-adjusted incidence rates for breast cancer per 100,000 women differ markedly from one country to another. For example, Uruguay has a very high rate at 114.9, followed by 92.1 in the US and 87.1 in Israel. Much lower rates are seen in Korea at just 12.7, 20.0 in Mali and 16.1 in Thailand (Ganmaa and Sato, 2005). In response to this discrepancy, an increasing amount of attention is now focusing on the links between diet and breast cancer, particularly the relationship between the consumption of animal-based foods (meat and milk) and breast cancer.\nPopulation studies\nStudying cancer incidence among particular groups of people can provide useful insights into the causes of disease. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently reported breast cancer incidence is substantially lower, and survival rates higher, in South Asians living in the UK than other women (Farooq and Coleman, 2005). The authors of this study suggested that differences in diet and lifestyle could explain the different rates observed.\nEarlier research published in the British Journal of Cancer also showed that South Asian women living in the UK are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than other women, but found that the risk varied according to their specific ethnic subgroup. This research showed that Muslim women from India and Pakistan are almost twice as likely to develop breast cancer as Gujarati Hindu women. This study examined the diet and found that the Gujarati Hindu women were more likely to be vegetarian and therefore had more fibre in their diet due to their higher intake of fruit and vegetables (McCormack et al., 2004). There are several mechanisms by which the diet might influence breast cancer risk. One possible mechanism is through an effect on hormones: increasing the amount of fibre in the diet may reduce breast cancer risk by altering the levels of female hormones (oestrogens) circulating in the blood (Gerber, 1998).\nOestrogen sensitive cancers\nOestrogen receptor-positive cancer (also called oestrogen-sensitive cancer) is when there are specific proteins on the cancer cell's surface that respond to the hormone oestrogen by causing the cell to grow. Oestrogen receptor-positive cancer makes up around 75 per cent of breast cancers in postmenopausal women and around 50 to 60 per cent in premenopausal women (Breast Cancer Care, 2007). Determining whether a breast cancer tumour is positive for oestrogen receptors can help to guide treatment and determine prognosis.\nCurrent national guidelines recommend that women who have oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer should usually be offered hormone therapy and women with oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer should be offered chemotherapy (Cancer Research UK, 2002).\nThe Causes of Breast Cancer\nThe risk of developing breast cancer is very small in young women and increases as women get older; more than half of breast cancers occur in women over the age of 65 (Cancerbackup, 2007). Some factors may slightly increase a woman's risk of developing the disease, these are listed below:\nHaving had breast cancer\nHaving benign (non-cancerous) breast disease\nGenetics - breast cancer in the family (see below)\nEarly puberty/menstruation - before the age of 11\nLate menopause - after age 54\nHaving a first child late in life\nHaving no or few children\nNot breast-feeding long term\nOverweight and obesity - particularly for postmenopausal women\nModerate to heavy consumption of alcohol\nOral contraceptives (the pill) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may very slightly increase the risk of breast cancer\nIn addition to the above, studies have included a small number of chemicals identified as mammary carcinogens or hormone disruptors which may have implications for breast cancer. However, evidence is emerging for associations between breast cancer and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organic solvents (Brody et al., 2007). PCBs are persistent organic pollutants that do not degrade easily and so are widespread in the environment. They are generally present at low concentrations in most foods, especially fat-containing foods such as milk and meat (FSA, 2000). PAHs are ubiquitous in air pollutants produced from vehicle exhausts (Brody et al., 2007). Organic solvents are commonly used in detergents (citrus terpenes), dry cleaning (tetrachloroethylene), paint thinners (toluene and turpentine), nail polish removers and glue solvents (acetone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate) and in perfumes (ethanol).\nJust how much some of these factors contribute to the risk of breast cancer is difficult to say. However, the aim of this report is to investigate the somewhat overlooked role of dietary factors. That said, the role of genetics in breast cancer deserves further discussion.\nThe genetic link\nMuch has been made of the link between genes and breast cancer. The genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have received the most attention since they were first discovered in 1994 and 1995 respectively. A fault in either of these two genes can increase the chances of getting breast cancer. However, even among women with high-risk BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, evidence suggests that nongenetic (environmental) factors influence risk. A substantial review of the research, published in the journal Cancer, reported that more women born after 1940, carrying a fault in either, or both of these genes, were diagnosed with breast cancer by the age of 50 than those born before 1940 (Brody et al., 2007). In other words, the women born after 1940 were exposed to some environmental factor that increased their risk of developing breast cancer.\nThere are two other very rare genes which are thought to account for less than two per cent of all breast cancers: the P53 gene and the AT (ataxia telangiectasia) gene (Cancerbackup, 2006).\nIt is important to remember that having an abnormal gene does not mean that a person will definitely develop breast cancer, but does mean they are considerably more at risk of developing the condition than someone who does not have one of the abnormal genes. Interestingly, with a faulty gene, the probability of developing cancer has increased over the last 30 or more years from about 40 per cent to about 70 per cent, probably due to environmental and lifestyle factors (CANCERactive, 2007). In other words you can cut your risks, even if you have a faulty gene, by making changes to your diet and lifestyle.\nThe discovery of genes linked to breast cancer has given rise to a certain degree of 'genetic fatalism', encouraging some to think that their chances of getting breast cancer are entirely down to fate. However, scientists estimate that only around five to 10 per cent of breast cancers are due to inheriting abnormal genes (Cancerbackup, 2007). This means that the vast majority of cancers (90 per cent) are not caused by abnormal genes. Secondly, it is important to remember that having an abnormal gene does not mean that a person will definitely develop breast cancer, but does mean they are more at risk of developing the condition than someone who does not have one of the abnormal genes.\nDietary Factors\nAn increasing body of scientific evidence links certain foods (such as meat and dairy products) to an increased risk of breast cancer. Conversely, other studies have identified foods that may lower the risk. As communications technology advances, scientists have become more able to compare disease rates and dietary patterns around the world. This has afforded them some useful incites into the causes of disease.\nEast versus West\nCross-cultural studies show that as the consumption of a typical Western diet (containing high levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein) spreads from country to country, so does the incidence of the so-called 'diseases of affluence' (such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and certain cancers, including breast cancer). It has been suggested that the incidence of these diseases varies because of genetic differences between different races. However, when people migrate from an area of low incidence of the so-called affluent diseases to an area of high incidence, they soon acquire the same high incidence shared by the population into which they have moved. This correlation must then be attributed, at least in part, to environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle.\nSo if certain diets and lifestyles increase the risk of these diseases, it stands to reason that you can reduce the risk of disease by changing your diet and lifestyle.\nAs the typical Western diet pervades around the world, it takes with it typical Western diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity and certain cancers. The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that dietary factors are estimated to account for around 30 per cent of all cancers in Western countries and 20 per cent of cancers in developing countries. They predict the number of cancers linked to diet in developing countries will grow as these countries become more urbanised (WHO, 2007). Other estimates are even higher. In 1997, the World Cancer Research Fund published a substantial review of the scientific literature linking foods, nutrition, food processing, dietary patterns and related factors, with the risk of human cancers worldwide (WCRF, 1997). The report concluded that policy-makers should now recognise that the incidence of cancer throughout the world can be reduced by 30 to 40 per cent by feasible changes in diets and related lifestyles.\nSadly there has never been a better time to observe the detrimental effects of the Western diet as countries in the East (such as China and Japan) move from a traditional plant-based diet rich in fruit, vegetables and grains towards a more Western diet characterised by meat, dairy and processed foods.\nIn a recent study, the effects of a Western diet on breast cancer risk was assessed among participants of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a large population-based survey involving 1,446 Chinese women from Shanghai diagnosed with breast cancer and matched to 1,549 control subjects without the disease (Cui et al., 2007). The authors of the report identified two distinct dietary patterns which they describe as \"vegetable-soy\" including a high intake of vegetable, soya products and fish and the Western-style \"meat-sweet\" diet characterised by various meats, poultry, fish, confectionary, puddings, bread and milk. The \"vegetable-soy\" diet contained higher levels of fibre, vitamins C and E and soya protein while the \"meat-sweet\" diet was rich in total and saturated fat.\nResults showed no overall association of breast cancer risk with the \"vegetable-soy\" pattern but demonstrated that a Western-style diet could double the rate of breast cancer among postmenopausal overweight women. Previous work has suggested that a \"vegetable-soy\" type diet can lower the risk of breast cancer. However, the authors of this study found that the \"vegetable-soy\" diet did not protect from breast cancer. This, they suggested, might due to the negative effects of the fish content of the \"vegetable-soy\" diet, or that cooking the vegetables may have diminished their protective effects (see below). The authors of this study concluded that for postmenopausal women in traditionally low-risk Asian populations poised to adopt foods characteristics of Western societies, the low consumption of a \"meat-sweet\" dietary pattern plus successful weight control may protect against breast cancer.\nRed meat\nWhile previous work has shown that red meat increases the risk of bowel, stomach and pancreatic cancer, recent research now links red meat to breast cancer as well (Cho et al., 2006). Researchers from Harvard Medical School in Boston looked at the diets of over 90,000 premenopausal women (aged 26 to 46) over 12 years and found that women who ate more than one-and-a-half servings of red meat per day (the equivalent of a sausage and a burger) almost doubled their risk of oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The authors of this study concluded that a high red meat intake may be a risk factor for breast cancer.\nThey suggest several biological mechanisms that may explain how this occurs. For example, cooked or processed red meat is a source of carcinogens (cancer-causing agents such as heterocyclic amines, N nitroso-compounds, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), that may increase breast cancer risk. Hormone treatment of beef cattle for growth promotion (banned in European countries but not in the United States) is also a concern. Red meat is a source of haem iron (a highly bioavailable form of iron and a major source of stored body iron), which has been shown to enhance oestrogen-induced tumour induction. Finally, they state that fat intake in general has been hypothesised to raise steroid hormone levels (see below). However, in a previous study, this research group found that intake of animal fat, but not vegetable fat, was related to elevated risk of breast cancer (Cho et al., 2003).\nExactly how red meat may increase the risk of breast cancer remains unclear. This uncertainty inevitably casts some doubt on the role of red meat as a causative agent, particularly among enthusiastic meat-eaters. However, the mechanism by which red meat causes bowel cancer was only just proposed recently (Lewin et al., 2006) despite its causal role being suspected for many decades. In other words, we know that increasing consumption of red meat increases the risk of developing breast cancer, but scientists do not yet know exactly how.\nAnimal fat\nSome studies link dietary fat to the risk of breast cancer. Case-control studies use a group of people with a particular characteristic (for example older women with lung cancer). This particular group is selected and information collected (for example, history of smoking), then a control group is selected from a similar population (older women without lung cancer) to see if they smoked or not, then a conclusion is drawn (smoking does or does not increase risk of lung cancer). A combined analysis of 12 case-control studies designed to examine diet and breast cancer risk found a positive association between fat intake and this disease. It was concluded that the percentage of breast cancers that might be prevented by dietary modification in the North American population was 24 per cent for postmenopausal women and 16 per cent for premenopausal women (Howe et al., 1990).\nIn 1999 researchers at the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California Medical School in Los Angeles published a review of 13 dietary fat intervention studies that were conducted to investigate the effect of fat intake on oestrogen levels. The results showed decreasing dietary fat intake (to between 10 and 25 per cent of the total energy intake) reduced serum oestradiol levels by between 2.7 and 10.3 per cent. It was concluded that dietary fat reduction can result in a lowering of serum oestradiol levels and that such a dietary modification may help prevent breast cancer (Wu et al., 1999).\nHowever, other studies of fat intake and the incidence of breast cancer have yielded conflicting results. The discrepancy in results may reflect the difficulties of accurately recording fat intake. Dr Sheila Bingham of the Dunn Human Nutrition Unit in Cambridge has developed a data-collection method which may overcome these problems. Bingham used food frequency questionnaire methods with a detailed seven-day food diary in over 13,000 women between 1993 and 1997. The study concluded that those who ate the most animal saturated fat (found mainly in whole milk, butter, meat, cakes and biscuits) were almost twice as likely to develop breast cancer as those who ate the least. It was also concluded that previous studies may have failed to establish this link because of imprecise methods (Bingham et al., 2003).\nIn a subsequent prospective cohort study involving over 90,000 premenopausal women, researchers from Harvard Medical School confirmed that animal fat intake was associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer (Cho et al., 2003). Red meat and high-fat dairy foods such as whole milk, cream, ice-cream, butter, cream cheese and cheese were the major contributors of animal fat in this cohort of relatively young women. Interestingly, this research did not find any clear association between vegetable fat and breast cancer risk; the increased risk was only associated with animal fat intake. It has been suggested that a high-fat diet increases the risk of breast cancer by elevating concentrations of oestrogen. However, the authors of this study suggest that if this were true a diet high in animal fat and a diet high in vegetable fat should both lead to higher rates of cancer, and that was not the case in this study. They do state that the fatty acid composition in fat from animal and vegetable sources differs greatly and may therefore have different associations with breast cancer risk. So it could be that a high-fat plant-based diet has less effect than a high-fat diet containing lots of meat and dairy products. They also suggest that some other component such as the hormones in cow's milk might play a role in increasing the risk of breast cancer.\nOestrogen\nThe conflicting effects of animal and vegetable fats on breast cancer risk have led many research groups to focus on the endogenous (naturally produced) hormonal content of animal-based foods, which has not been widely discussed. Oestrogens are contained in meat and eggs, but the major source of animal-derived oestrogens in the human diet are cow's milk and dairy products which account for 60 to 80 per cent of the animal-derived oestrogens consumed (Hartmann et al., 1998).\nFurthermore, the milk produced now is very different from that produced 100 years ago; modern dairy cows are frequently impregnated while still producing milk (Webster, 2005). Two-thirds of milk in the UK is taken from pregnant cows with the remainder coming from cows that have recently given birth. This means that the hormone (oestrogen, progesterone and androgen precursor) content of milk varies widely. It is the high levels of hormones in animal-based foods that have been linked to the development of hormone-dependent cancers such as breast cancer.\nNumerous studies show that women consuming a Western-style diet tend to have different hormone profiles compared to women eating traditional diets. This means the level of oestrogen in their blood varies according to the type of diet they have. For example, a review of studies carried out over a 10 year period in the Department of Clinical Chemistry at the University of Helsinki in Finland showed that women who consume a high-animal fat, high-animal protein diet with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars have higher levels of oestrogen in their blood (Adlercreutz, 1990). This study also made the observation that the hormone pattern (high oestrogen), found in association with a Western-type diet tends to prevail among breast cancer patients. In other words, what you eat can affect the level of oestrogen in the blood, and high oestrogen levels are found in women with breast cancer.\nA number of other studies confirm that women with breast cancer tend to have higher levels of circulating oestrogens. Prospective studies follow groups of people over time. Generally these people are alike in many, but not all, ways (for example, young women who smoke and young women who do not). The prospective cohort study will then look for a link between their behaviour and a particular outcome (such as lung cancer). A prospective study conducted on the island of Guernsey examined serum levels of the oestrogen hormone oestradiol in samples taken from 61 postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer an average of 7.8 years after blood collection (Thomas et al., 1997). Compared to 179 age-matched controls, oestradiol levels were 29 per cent higher in women who later developed breast cancer.\nAnother prospective study (this time from the US) compared oestrogen levels in 156 postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer, after blood collection, with two age-matched controls for each cancer patient (Hankinson et al., 1998). Results showed increased levels of the hormones oestradiol, oestrone, oestrone sulphate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate in women\nwho subsequently developed breast cancer thus providing strong evidence for a causal relationship between postmenopausal oestrogen levels and the risk of breast cancer.\nIn a review looking at the relationship between breast cancer incidence and food intake among the populations of 40 different countries, a positive correlation was seen between the consumption of meat, milk and cheese and the incidence of breast (and ovarian) cancer (Ganmaa and Sato, 2005). Meat was most closely correlated with breast cancer incidence, followed by cow's milk and cheese. By contrast, cereals and pulses were negatively correlated with the incidence of breast cancer. The authors of this review concluded that the increased consumption of animal foods may increase the development of hormone-dependent cancers. Among dietary risk factors of particular concern to the authors were milk and dairy products, because so much of the milk we drink today is produced from pregnant cows, in which hormone levels are markedly elevated.\nMilk contains many biologically active (bioactive) molecules including enzymes, hormones and growth factors. In 1992, Pennsylvania State University endocrinologist Clark Grosvenor published an extensive review of some of the known bioactive hormones and growth factors found in a typical glass of milk in the US. The list included seven pituitary (an endocrine gland in the brain) hormones, seven steroid hormones, seven hypothalamic (another brain endocrine gland) hormones, eight gastrointestinal peptides (chains of two or more amino acids), six thyroid and parathyroid hormones, 11 growth factors, and nine other biologically active compounds (Grosvenor et al., 1992).\nA more recent survey of the published data on the occurrence of hormones and bioactive constituents in cow's milk and milk products also provides an extensive list of gonadal, adrenal, pituitary, hypothalamic and other hormones (Jouan et al., 2006). The authors of this survey state that there is a need to update the data concerning hormonal levels in milk and milk products, especially in the light of changes in the genetic background of dairy cattle in the last decades, as well as in animal feeding and husbandry and new processes that have emerged in the milk industry (Jouan et al., 2006).\nThe enormous detrimental health effects of consuming cow's milk and dairy products are more widely discussed in the VVF's fully-referenced scientific report White Lies. This report describes how the saturated animal fat, animal protein, cholesterol, hormones and growth factors in dairy products are linked to a wide range of illnesses and diseases including some of the UK's biggest killers such as heart disease, diabetes, prostate cancer as well as osteoporosis, eczema, asthma, Crohn's disease, colic, constipation and even teenage acne.\nFor more information on British dairy farming methods see Viva!'s fully-referenced report The Dark Side of Dairy.\nIGF-1 signalling trouble\nIn addition to the animal fat, various chemical contaminants and hormones found in animal-based foods, certain growth factors have been implicated in the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. In particular, a growth factor called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has attracted much attention.\nIGF-1 is a signalling molecule produced in the liver and body tissues of mammals. It promotes cell growth and division, which is important for normal growth and development of mammals. However, IGF-1 levels decline with age, consistent with their role in growth.\nOver the last decade IGF-1 has been linked to an increased risk of childhood cancers, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and cancers of the pancreas and prostate (LeRoith et al., 1995; Chan et al., 1998) and gastrointestinal cancers (Epstein, 1996). Indeed IGF-1 may be used as a predictor of certain cancers, in much the same way that cholesterol is a predictor of heart disease (Campbell and Campbell, 2005).\nIGF-1 from cows is identical to human IGF-1 in that the amino acid sequence of both molecules is the same (Honegger and Humbel, 1986). Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and there are 20 different amino acids. All proteins consist of amino acids joined together like beads on a string and the nature of the protein (how it behaves) is determined by the order in which the amino acids occur along the string. In both human and bovine IGF-1 the same 70 amino acids occur in exactly the same order, which would suggest that bovine IGF-1 behaves the same way in humans as it does in cows.\nAs stated above, two-thirds of milk in the UK is taken from pregnant cows. It is not only the hormone content that is markedly elevated at this time; the amount of IGF-1 present is also higher in milk produced by pregnant cows. IGF-1 is relatively stable to both heat and acidic conditions and can therefore survive the harsh conditions of both commercial milk processing and gastric acid to maintain its biological activity (Playford et al., 2000). Some scientists are concerned that IGF-1 not destroyed during pasteurisation may cross the intestinal wall in the same way that another hormone, epidermal growth factor (EGF), has been shown to do. EGF is protected from being broken down when food proteins (such as the milk protein casein) block the active sites of the digestive enzymes (Playford et al., 1993). This allows the molecule to stay intact and cross the intestinal wall and enter the blood. Dr J.L. Outwater of the Physicians Committee For Responsible Medicine (PCRM) in Washington, DC, warns regular milk ingestion after weaning may produce enough IGF-1 in mammary tissue to encourage cell division thus increasing the risk of cancer (Outwater et al., 1997).\nFurthermore, some research shows that various hormones and growth factors (including oestrogens, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyrotropin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor) can affect IGF-1 production within the body (Yu and Rohan, 2000). This indicates that certain foods, such as cow's milk, may increase endogenous IGF-1 production in humans. So diet can determine the amount of IGF-1 present in the blood.\nThe critical role IGFs play in regulating cell growth and death has led to much speculation about\ntheir involvement in cancer development (Yu and Rohan, 2000). IGF-1 regulates cell growth, development and division and can stimulate growth in both normal and cancerous cells. Indeed, IGF-1 has been shown to stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cells in the laboratory and it has been suggested that it may be involved in the transformation of normal breast tissue to cancerous cells (Outwater et al., 1997). The concern here is that if IGF-1 can cause human cancer cells to grow in a Petri dish in the laboratory, it might have a cancer-inducing effect when consumed in the diet. This is very worrying as even small increases in serum levels of IGF-1 in humans are associated with increased risk for several common cancers including cancers of the breast, prostate, lung and colon (Wu et al., 2002).\nIn the first prospective study to investigate the relationship between the risk of breast cancer and circulating IGF-1 levels, researchers at Harvard Medical School analysed blood samples originally collected from 32,826 women aged between 43 and 69 years during 1989 and 1990 (Hankinson et al., 1998a). From this group, 397 women were later diagnosed with breast cancer. Analysis of IGF-1 levels in samples collected from these women compared to samples from 620 controls (without breast cancer) revealed a positive relationship between circulating IGF-1 levels and the risk of breast cancer among premenopausal (but not postmenopausal) women. It was concluded that plasma IGF-1 concentrations may be useful in the identification of women at high risk of breast cancer.\nTaken together, the scientific literature strongly suggests a link between high circulating IGF-1 levels and cancer, but what has this to do with diet? The answer is a lot: circulating IGF-1 levels are higher in people who consume milk and dairy products. US researchers from Harvard Medical School investigating the link between IGF-1 levels and diet examined IGF-1 levels in 1,037 healthy women (Holmes et al., 2002). The most consistent finding of this study was a positive association between circulating IGF-1 levels and animal protein intake which, in this study, was largely attributed to cow's milk intake.\nResearchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Washington investigated the link between plasma levels of IGF-1 and lifestyle factors in 333 people (Morimoto et al., 2005). They too found that milk consumption was linked to IGF-1 levels. This concurs with an earlier study, from Creighton University in Omaha, NE, which observed a 10 per cent increase in blood levels of IGF-1 in subjects who increased their intake of non-fat milk from fewer than 1.5 servings of dairy foods to three servings per day (Heaney, 1999). Furthermore, a study from the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford noted that vegan men had a nine per cent lower serum IGF-1 level than meat-eaters and vegetarians (Allen et al., 2000). This strongly suggests a link between the consumption of cow's milk and dairy products and higher IGF-1 levels circulating in the blood.\nOne study actually quantified the effect of cow's milk on circulating IGF-1 levels in 54 Danish boys aged two-and-a-half years old (Hoppe et al., 2004). In this study an increase in cow's milk intake from 200 to 600ml per day corresponded to a massive 30 per cent increase in circulating IGF-1.\nResearchers at Bristol University investigating the association of diet with IGF-1 in 344 disease-free men found that raised levels of IGF-1 were associated with higher intakes of milk, dairy products and calcium while lower levels of IGF-1 were associated with high vegetable consumption, particularly tomatoes (Gunnell et al., 2003). In their study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, it was concluded that IGF-1 may mediate some diet-cancer associations.\nIn conclusion, the research shows that nutrition has an important role in determining serum IGF-1 levels (Yaker et al., 2005). Whether the increase in IGF-1 caused by cow's milk occurs directly (by IGF-1 crossing the gut wall), or indirectly (as a result of the action of other factors), the evidence suggests that some component of cow's milk causes an increase in blood serum levels of IGF-1, which in turn is linked to various cancers.\nBovine somatotrophin (BST)\nMammalian milk production is regulated by a complex interaction of hormones. Bovine somatotrophin (BST) is a natural growth hormone that occurs in cattle and controls the amount of milk that they produce. In 1994 Monsanto began marketing a synthetic version of BST, known as recombinant BST (rBST), which was sold as Posilac. Injecting dairy cows with rBST alters their metabolism to increase milk production by up to 15 per cent. Since its introduction in 1994, Posilac has become the largest selling dairy animal pharmaceutical product in the US. Sold in all 50 states, rBST is used in around one-third of the nine million dairy cows in the US (Monsanto, 2007).\nWhile the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permit the use of rBST, its use is associated with severe animal welfare problems, for example increasing the incidence of lameness and mastitis. For these reasons, the use of rBST in the EU was prohibited in 2000. Indeed Canada, Japan and many other countries have banned the use of rBST because of its effects on animal health and welfare. However, there are no restrictions on the import of rBST dairy products, or any requirement to label them.\nThe government's Veterinary Medicines Directorate does not carry out any testing of imported milk (Defra, 2006). Furthermore, Defra confirmed in correspondence with the VVF that, since the EU is a single market, once a product has entered, if it is transported on to another country within the EU, then the origin of the product will be the EU country rather than the originating country (Defra, 2006). In 2005, the UK imported over 1,000 tons of dairy products (mainly ice-cream) from the US (Defra, 2006a); these figures have declined from over 5,000 tons in both 2001 and 2002 but still remain a concern, especially as the consumer has a limited chance of discriminating against imports from the US. The sensible option is to avoid all dairy products.\nMilk production increases in cows treated with rBST because it promotes the production of IGF-1 which then stimulates the glands in the cow's udders to produce more milk. Research shows that rBST use on dairy cows can substantially increase the levels of IGF-1 in their milk (Prosser et al., 1989). This raises concerns about the potential biological action of IGF-1 from cow's milk in humans especially because IGF-1 from cows is identical to human IGF-1. Professor Samuel Epstein,\nan international leading authority on the causes and prevention of cancer, warns that converging lines of evidence incriminate IGF-1 in rBST milk as a potential risk factor for both breast and gastrointestinal cancers (Epstein, 1996).\nSo why should this concern us if we do not allow the use of rBST in the UK? Well in terms of human health, the concern is that milk and milk products imported from countries that permit the use of rBST may lead to the consumption of foods that promote increased levels of IGF-1 in humans. In 1999, the minister of state, Baroness Hayman, referred to a report from the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) which stated that while the use of rBST does not increase the level of BST found naturally in cow's milk, there is a two-to-five fold increase in the level of IGF-1 in the milk, which she acknowledged may be implicated in the occurrence of colonic cancer. However, Hayman reiterated the VPC's view that the risk to human health was likely to be extremely small. Hayman also suggested that just 0.3 per cent of total milk and milk products imported into the UK come from the US where rBST is authorised for use (UK Parliament, 1999).\nThe damaging effects of dairy\nIn recent years an increasing body of evidence has accumulated linking the consumption of cow's milk and dairy products to breast cancer. In her book Your Life in Your Hands, Professor Jane Plant CBE, Anglo American Professor of Applied Geochemistry at Imperial College, London, describes a very personal and moving story of how she overcame breast cancer by excluding all dairy products from her diet (Plant, 2007). Plant was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987. She had five recurrences of the disease and by 1993 the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system. She could feel the lump on her neck, and was told that she had just three months to live, six if she was lucky. However, Plant was determined to use her scientific training to find a solution to this 'problem'. She began comparing breast cancer incidence in the UK to that in other cultures.\nAs stated above, the age-standardised breast cancer incidence rate allows the comparison of cancer rates between populations that may have a different age structure. Plant looked at breast cancer incidence rates in rural China where, in 1997, the disease affected 11 out of every 100,000 women (compared to 70 in the UK). This rate was trebled in Chinese cities, probably Plant suggests, because of the pollution and an increased exposure to a more Western style diet. Interestingly, she observes, Hiroshima and Nagasaki have similar rates to those found in Chinese cities. Both places were attacked with nuclear weapons so you might expect to see some radiation-related cancers. However, by moving to Hiroshima and adopting a Japanese lifestyle, Plant reveals, a UK woman would slash her risk of developing breast cancer by half!\nFurthermore Plant observed that among wealthy Chinese women with a more Western lifestyle (for example in Malaysia and Singapore), the rate of breast cancer is similar to that in the West. Furthermore, epidemiological evidence shows that when Chinese women move to the West, within one or two generations their rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality increase to match those of their host country. This suggested that diet and lifestyle (rather than genetics) must be a major determinant of cancer risk.\nPlant decided to investigate the role of diet in breast cancer risk. She examined the results of the China-Cornell-Oxford project on nutrition, environment and health (Campbell and Junshi, 1994). This project was based on national surveys conducted between 1983 and 1984 in China. The project was a collaboration between T. Colin Campbell at Cornell University in the US, Chen Junshi from the Chinese Academy of Preventative Medicine, in Beijing, China, Li Junyao at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, and Richard Peto from Oxford University in the UK. The project revealed some surprising insights into diet and health. For example, it showed that people in China tend to consume more calories per day than people in the US, but only 14 per cent of these calories come from fat compared to a massive 36 per cent in the West. This coupled to the fact that Chinese people tend to be more physically active than people in the West, is why obesity affects far more people in the West than in China.\nHowever, Plant's diet had not been particularly high in fat; indeed she describes it as very low in fat and high in fibre. Then Plant had a revelation: the Chinese don't eat dairy produce. Plant had been eating low-fat yogurt and skimmed organic milk up until this time, but within days of ceasing all dairy, the lump on her neck began to shrink. The tumour decreased and eventually disappeared, leading her to the conviction that there is a causal link between the consumption of dairy products and breast cancer. Although Plant received chemotherapy during this time, it did not appear to be working and so convinced was her cancer specialist that it was the change in diet that saved her life, he now refers to cancer mortality maps in his lectures and recommends a dairy-free diet to his breast cancer patients.\nPlant eventually defeated cancer by eliminating dairy products from her diet, replacing them with healthy alternatives and making some lifestyle changes. Her book recounts not only her own story but that of others and it contains much research using the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Plant advises that if you do only one thing to cut your risk of breast cancer, make the change from dairy to soya (Plant, 2007). Providing breast cancer patients with sound dietary advice could greatly increase survival rates. Taken together, these observations show that a plant-based diet can reduce many of the risk factors associated with breast cancer.\nRed alert\nIt's not just the food itself that can affect the risk of breast cancer; how you cook the food can influence its role in this disease. Recent evidence linking the consumption of barbequed and smoked meats to breast cancer was provided by a large study published in the journal Epidemiology (Steck et al., 2007). This study shows that postmenopausal (but not premenopausal) women with a high lifetime intake of grilled, barbequed and smoked meats have a 47 per cent increased risk of breast cancer. This study also reported that big meat-eaters who also skimp on fruit and vegetables were found to have a massive 74 per cent increase in risk. The authors concluded that these results support the accumulating evidence that the consumption of meats cooked by methods that promote carcinogen formation may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Why this effect was not seen in premenopausal women is unclear. That said, it would seem prudent for women of all ages to avoid barbequed and smoked meats in order to reduce the risk of breast cancer.\nThink and Eat Positive\nIt's not all gloom and doom though, there are many things you can do to protect yourself against breast cancer and other diseases. For example: stopping smoking, losing weight, exercising more and cutting down on alcohol. Changing the way you eat is vital and in your control.\nFruit and vegetables\nFruit and vegetables can protect against breast cancer through a variety of mechanisms involving their antioxidant, fibre and other nutritional content (Michels et al., 2007). Indeed the evidence linking fruit and vegetable consumption to a reduced risk of breast cancer is accumulating.\nA large-scale US survey published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute called the Nurses' Health Study, reported a negative association between premenopausal breast cancer and women consuming five or more vegetables per day compared with those consuming less than two vegetables per day (Zhang et al., 1999). In other words, premenopausal women who ate the most vegetables had a lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate the least. The authors concluded that the consumption of fruits and vegetables high in specific carotenoids (nutrients found in brightly coloured vegetables and fruits such as carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, kale, spring greens and tomatoes) may reduce breast cancer risk among premenopausal women. This, they noted, applied particularly to those who were at a higher risk because of a family history of breast cancer or consumption of alcohol.\nAnother study looking at the role of diet and breast cancer risk in 8,984 Italian women over nineand-a-half years follow-up (the length of time that passes between the start of the study when information is collected and the end of the study when the participant's health status is assessed) recorded 207 cases of breast cancer (Sieri et al. 2004). This study identified four dietary patterns among the participants: salad vegetables (mainly consisting of raw vegetables and olive oil); Western (mainly consisting of potatoes, red meat, eggs and butter); canteen (pasta and tomato sauce); and prudent (cooked vegetables, pulses and fish, with little or no wines and spirits). Results showed that only the salad vegetables dietary pattern was associated with significantly lower (34 to 35 per cent) breast cancer incidence. Women with body mass index of less than 25 had an even greater risk reduction (50 per cent). Whereas for women with body mass index above 25, the salad vegetable dietary pattern had no protective effect. The authors suggest this latter finding may reflect how leaner women might be more health conscious and how overweight women may be dieting and so consuming more vegetables than they would normally. These findings provide compelling evidence that a healthy diet, containing plenty of salad vegetables, can protect against breast cancer.\nThree years later, a further 31 breast cancer cases had occurred among this cohort and new analysis revealed that that the salad vegetables dietary pattern offered a significant amount of protection (75 per cent lower), against a specific subtype (HER-2-positive) of breast cancer (Sant et al., 2007). HER-2positive breast cancers have higher than normal levels of a protein known as HER-2 on the surface of the cancer cells. This protein encourages the cancer cells to grow which is why HER-2-positive cancers tend to grow faster than those that are HER-2 negative. Approximately 20 to 25 per cent of breast cancer patients are described as having HER-2-positive breast cancer (Breast Cancer Care, 2007a).\nTaken together, this research suggests that fruit and vegetables play an important role in protecting against breast cancer. This is certainly an area that warrants further investigation.\nFolic acid\nFolic acid (folate) is an important B vitamin necessary for the production of red blood cells and the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA - the blueprint for life). It is also required for the normal methylation of DNA. This refers to the 'flagging' of genes with a methyl group (a group of carbon and hydrogen atoms) that is used to mark out specific genes for expression (activation). This process is essential for normal growth, development and function. If the methylation process is disrupted, unregulated gene expression may lead to uncontrolled cell division or cancer.\nThe deficiency of certain vitamins has been said to mimic the effects of radiation damage to DNA. Indeed a low intake of folic acid could increase the risk of several cancers, including breast cancer, whereas a sufficient intake of folic acid and related B vitamins may protect against this disease (Wang et al., 2006).\nSeveral studies show how dietary folic acid might protect against breast cancer, particularly among women who are at an increased risk as a result of high alcohol consumption. A prospective study of 17,447 Anglo-Australian women (among whom there were 537 cases of invasive breast cancer) investigated the effects of dietary folic acid on the relation between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk (Baglietto et al., 2005). Results showed that women who had a high alcohol consumption coupled to a low intake of folic acid had an increased risk of breast cancer, but those with a high alcohol consumption and a moderate to high intake of folic acid had no increased risk. It was concluded that an adequate dietary intake of folic acid might protect against the increased risk of breast cancer associated with high alcohol consumption.\nFolic acid is found in many foods including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chick peas and brown rice. Other useful sources include fortified breakfast cereals, wholegrain bread and certain fruits (oranges and bananas).\nFibre\nFibre has been hypothesised to reduce breast cancer risk through a number of mechanisms including the inhibition of oestrogen reabsorption back into the bloodstream, the inhibition of human oestrogen synthetase (an enzyme that we use to make oestrogen) leading to a reduction in oestrogen production and finally, a reduction in the levels of steroid hormones called androgens which influence levels of oestrogens and proliferation of breast tissue or by some mechanism involving insulin and IGFs (Cade et al., 2007). As stated above, IGF-1 is associated with an increased breast cancer risk and IGF-1 levels are influenced by diet.\nFibre intake and breast cancer incidence was investigated among a large group of women called the UK Women's Cohort, which included high number of vegetarians to allow for meaningful comparisons with fish and meat-eaters (Cade et al., 2007). This study showed that in premenopausal, but not postmenopausal women, those who ate 30 grams of fibre per day had half the risk of those who ate less than 20 grams. These findings suggest that in premenopausal women, total fibre is protective against breast cancer; in particular, fibre from cereals and possibly fruit. Dietary fibre has been shown to regulate oestrogen levels in the body. The researchers believe that this may explain why the effects of increased fibre intake were only seen in premenopausal women and not in postmenopausal women.\nThis is the first large prospective study to show a relationship between total fibre intake and risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Previous analysis may have missed such a relationship between fibre and breast cancer by combining premenopausal and postmenopausal results together.\nThe average person in the UK eats 12 grams of fibre per day. To increase your intake you could choose a high-fibre cereal for breakfast or switch from white bread and pasta to wholemeal and ensure you have at least five portions of fruit and vegetables per day.\nEat your greens!\nIt is well-documented in the scientific literature that cruciferous vegetables (such as spring greens, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and kale) help protect against cancer. Some of this activity has been attributed to a compound in these vegetables called sulphurophane which has attracted much attention since its discovery in 1992. The mechanism underlying this compound's anti-cancer activity has remained unclear until 2004. In a study published in the US Journal of Nutrition scientists proposed just how this compound may offer protection (Jackson and Singletary, 2004). Keith Singletary and colleagues at the University of Illinois exposed malignant human breast cells to sulphurophane in the laboratory and saw that it inhibited cell division and DNA synthesis in the cancer cells. In other words, this compound inhibited the growth of cancer cells, but not normal cells.\nSingletary suggests that sulphurophane works by disrupting cellular components called microtubules. These are long slender cylinders of a protein called tubulin that are required for the normal separation of the duplicated chromosomes during cell division. If this process is disrupted then cells cannot divide. These findings may be useful in developing new treatments for breast cancer. In the meantime, including a wide range of vegetables in the diet, including the cruciferous varieties, could offer immediate benefit.\nThe soya connection\nThere is strong evidence that soya intake during adolescence may reduce the risk of breast cancer later in life. The Shanghai Breast Cancer Study investigated the role of soya in breast cancer by looking at the dietary history of 1,459 breast cancer cases and 1,556 age-matched controls in China (Shu et al., 2001). This study found that women who consumed the most soya as teenagers had half the risk of breast cancer as adults. This inverse association was observed for each of the soya foods examined (tofu, soya milk and other soya products) and existed for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The authors of this study suggest that a substantial difference in breast cancer incidence between Asian and Caucasian women and increasing breast cancer incidence among Asian-Americans may be explained, at least in part, by soya food intake during adolescence. They state that their study emphasises the importance of initiating cancer intervention programs early in life.\nA year later, scientists investigating the link between adolescent soya intake and breast cancer asked over 1,000 Asian-American women (including 501 breast cancer patients) how often they ate soya foods such as tofu, soya milk and miso. This study also found that women who consumed soya at least once a week during adolescence had a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (Wu et al., 2002).\nResults showed that those who were high soya consumers as both adolescents and adults had a 47 per cent reduction in risk of breast cancer. Those who ate little soya as adults but had eaten it regularly during adolescence showed a 23 per cent reduction in risk. Women who were low consumers during adolescence and high consumers during adulthood showed little reduction in risk. These studies suggest that high soya intake during adolescence reduces breast cancer risk and the risk continues to fall if people continue to eat soya as an adult.\nIn an attempt to draw the scientific evidence together, a team lead by Professor Bruce J. Trock from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD, performed a review of 18 studies on soya exposure and breast cancer risk published between 1978 and 2004 (Trock et al., 2006). Results showed a modest association between a high soya intake and a reduced breast cancer risk. The authors warn that this result should be interpreted with caution and that recommendations for high-dose isoflavone supplementation to prevent breast cancer or prevent its recurrence would be premature. However, they do state that there is no evidence to suggest that consumption of soya foods, in amounts consistent with an Asian diet, is detrimental to breast health, and go on to say that such a diet is likely to confer benefits to other aspects of health. In other words, the research looks promising but more evidence is needed.\nThe low rate of breast cancer in Japan and the high rate of survival amongst those who are affected is often used to promote soya foods as being beneficial - or at least, not being harmful - for breast cancer patients. Some researchers, however, are cautious and think that even the small oestrogenlike effect of soya foods may be detrimental for women who have gone through the menopause, whose natural oestrogen levels have dropped and who have been diagnosed with oestrogen-receptor positive (hormone sensitive) breast cancer (PCRM, 2002).\nTheir concern is that the weak oestrogen activity of soya isoflavones may stimulate the growth of tumours which are sensitive to oestrogen. This is not a concern for premenopausal women, who have much higher levels of oestrogens which are many times more potent than phytoestrogens.\nThese concerns are based largely on the results of a small number of in vitro (test tube) and animal studies but as these have produced mixed results their relevance to human breast cancer patients remains unclear.\nTo date there have only been two human studies on this subject, the findings of which were also unclear (Petrakis et al., 1996; Hargreaves et al., 1999). The cautious approach would be for postmenopausal women at risk of breast cancer to limit the amount of soya products they eat to three or four a week.\nOn the whole, the evidence suggests that consuming moderate amounts of soya foods is much more likely to benefit health rather than harm it, both in terms of breast cancer risk and other chronic diseases.\nFor more information on foods that can help fight cancer see the VVF's easy-to-read colourful guide A Fighting Chance. A guide to healthy eating to help prevent and overcome breast cancer available from: www.vegetarian.org.uk/campaigns/breastcancer. This guide summarises the key findings this report and provides vital information on a range of cancer-busting foods. It also includes a seven-day meal plan with inspiring healthy recipes such as our ever-popular Tortilla Wraps with Mango Salsa, Quinoa Superbowl Salad and the fabulous Summer Berry Compote.\nConclusion\nIdentifying specific foods (or components of them) that can increase the risk of, or even cause, certain diseases, is notoriously difficult. There are many problems associated with trying to tease out the links between diet and disease. For example, most diet and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted in industrialised countries (North America, Europe and Japan). Comparing the diets between industrialised and developing countries rather than within them could offer more insight as the diets between these countries tend to vary more. This may permit a better comparison, for example, of a plant-based diet versus an animal food-based diet or a soya versus non-soya diet.\nAnother problem is that self-reported diets (food diaries and food frequency questionnaires) are often assessed with considerable measurement error. Furthermore, most studies tend to focus on the diet consumed as an adult, whereas strong evidence suggests dietary influences before adulthood can affect breast cancer risk later in life. For example, research shows that a high soya intake during adolescence can reduce the risk of breast cancer later in life. The average follow-up time may be too short to determine significant conclusions. The effect of diet on different sub-types of cancer such as: oestrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, genetic (due to faulty genes), epigenetic (not due to genes) warrants further investigation. For example, salad vegetables have been shown to lower the risk of HER-2 positive breast cancer. The positive effect of some foods may be masked by the negative effects of others. For example, in the Shanghai Study the authors suggest that the potential positive effect of vegetables and soya foods may have been countered by the negative effects of fish in the diet. Furthermore, the effects of specific diets (such as macrobiotic, organic, wholefood, raw food or vegan) have not been sufficiently studied.\nThe supposed health benefits of meat and dairy foods have been vigorously promoted by the meat and dairy industries for decades. For example, the idea that meat is essential for iron and protein is deep-rooted and is often used to pressure would-be veggies back to the butchers. The reality is that we do not need saturated animal fat, animal protein or cholesterol. We do not need the trans fatty acids in processed foods. We do not need the amount of salt and sugar we consume. We do however need to move towards a plant-based, wholegrain diet containing a wide range of fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, nuts and seeds for the nutrients that will promote a long and healthy life.\nThese, of course, are the same foods which contain protection against disease in the form of antioxidants and fibre. What is killing the Western world are the degenerative diseases associated with affluence. It is clear that the same diet that is good for preventing breast cancer is also good for preventing heart disease, obesity, diabetes and so on.\nThe milk debate deserves a special mention here as the notion that cow's milk is a natural and healthy drink for humans is so deeply entrenched in the British psyche, yet the evidence suggests milk may be doing us more harm than good. Of course we need calcium for our bones and teeth\n(and blood clotting, muscle function and regulating heart rhythm). But despite the dairy industry's powerful marketing machine, more and more people are beginning to wonder if cow's milk really is the best source of calcium. It certainly is not for most of the world's people. Claims that dairy is best carry strong overtones of cultural imperialism and simply ignore the 70 per cent of the global population who obtain their calcium from other sources - people such as the Japanese who traditionally have consumed no dairy yet have far better health than British people and live considerably longer.\nMilk has been part of the human diet for less than 6,000 years; this is very recent in evolutionary terms. It is not just that most people don't drink it; they cannot because their bodies will not tolerate it. Up to 100 per cent of some ethnic groups are lactose intolerant. In global terms lactose intolerance is very common, occurring in around 90-100 per cent of Asians, 65-70 per cent of Africans, but just 10 per cent of Caucasians (Robbins, 2001). This suggests that the health claims made for milk owe more to marketing than science.\nThe dairy industry has spent many years and many millions of pounds promoting the notion that cow's milk is good for us through expensive advertising campaigns such as the 'White Stuff'. Now, because of an increasing body of evidence, there are signs of a growing realisation that milk is neither natural nor healthy. In fact, research is moving in the opposite direction now, showing that the more dairy and animal protein that is consumed, the higher the incidence of osteoporosis and other diseases.\nThe rate at which some cancers are increasing is a huge matter of concern. When Professor Jane Plant wrote the first edition of Your Life in Your Hands in 2000, one in 10 UK women were affected by the disease. Now, in 2007, one in nine women are expected to develop breast cancer at some point in their lives! Since 1971, the incidence of breast cancer in the UK has increased by 80 per cent. These figures should be shouted from the rooftops! An increasing number of researchers are in no doubt that cow's milk and dairy foods are responsible.\nA point that is consistently overlooked is that two-thirds of the UK's milk comes from pregnant cows and as every mum knows, hormone levels during pregnancy can rise dramatically. This is no laughing matter as breast, prostate, ovarian and colorectal cancer are all implicated. These cancers and the so-called diseases of affluence, such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and even osteoporosis, occur increasingly in the countries that consume the most dairy products. It is not rocket science\u2026 cow's milk and dairy products cause disease.\nThe conclusions of this report are drawn from a huge body of research from academic institutions all around the world. While the majority of this work was performed in an academic environment (involving clinical trials or statistical analysis), some is of a more personal nature. Professor Jane Plant's spirit and courage in overcoming breast cancer through the elimination of all dairy could not fail to inspire the increasing number of women who are affected by this disease. Plant did not set out to promote one type of diet above another but as a scientist (geochemist) she took an analytical approach to the problem of breast cancer and ultimately found the solution: a dairy-free diet.\nIn summary, this report provides a compelling argument that the consumption of animal-based foods is linked to the development of breast cancer. The combined findings of over 50 scientific papers from reputable peer-reviewed journals such as the British Medical Journal and the Lancet leave no doubt that diet is linked to breast cancer risk. Taken in their entirety, they indicate a causative role for red meat, animal fat and dairy foods. This report provides a vital source of information for health professionals, enabling them to make better-informed choices in recommending dietary changes to breast cancer patients and women considered to be at risk of this disease.\nThe official approach to the causes of breast cancer (and other so-called diseases of affluence) remains extremely equivocal and dietary advice seems to be based far more on not upsetting particular vested interests than improving the public's health. As a consequence, the incidence of these diseases continues to rise remorselessly because public health policy is aimed, almost exclusively, at treatment rather than prevention.\nOnly when prevention becomes the priority will the avoidance of animal products be seen as central to improving public health. The World Health Organisation believes that the only way we can improve our health is through informed opinion and active co-operation. We agree! As a science-based health charity, the VVF provides unbiased information on which people can make informed choices. We monitor and interpret scientific research on diet and health and communicate those findings to the public, health professionals, schools and food manufacturers. Importantly, we have no commercial or vested interests and offer a vital - and what sometimes feels like a solitary - source of accurate and unbiased information.\nSo it is up to individual members of the public and independent-minded health professionals to find out what they can about diet and heath. Meanwhile, government health policy continues unchanged, like Nero fiddling while Rome burns.\nBe a bosom buddy...\nTell your friends about it by giving them our easy-to-readguide with seven-day meal plan and recipes.\nA Fighting Chance: a Guide to Healthy Eating to Help Prevent and Overcome Breast Cancer. \u00a32.40 (inc p&p) available from VVF\nThis new easy-to-read colourful guide summarises the key findings of the VVF's scientific report on breast cancer and provides vital information on which foods can help fight cancer.

More and more people are overweight than ever before however, there are more and more crash diets that can be potentially deadly. Part of me wants to say that in general overweight and obesity are not exactly vegan issues. But I also know that\u2019s a crock. Even vegans and vegetarians can be unhealthy, overweight or obese. Keep this in mind: a junky diet is a junky diet, meat or not.\nSeveral of my friends have struggled with diets and weight loss over the years, but now as being two steps away from being a nutrition professional, I am more aware of what they are doing, could be doing and the potential consequences. This first blog is just a warm up on medically supervised diets and then I\u2019ve possibly got some interviews lined up to talk with people who are on them. So stay tuned!\nFirst, what IS a medically supervised diet? \u2013 Fortunately, or unfortunately medically supervised diets can vary widely. They can range from extreme intake restrictions or even to fads like HCG ( Human Growth Hormone ) injections (there is science behind my aversion to this diet. More on this particular topic in a future post.). But generally they consist of a medical professional such as a doctor or nurse practitioner, that monitor you for things like jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes due to liver failure), malnutrition, kidney failure, allergic reactions and more. Many times they take blood samples to evaluate vitamin and mineral balances as well.\nSecond, what you get for the money you pay the medical staff? \u2013 This varies also. Sometimes you get supplements, pills, medications and other times you get blood work, encouragement, meal plans or advice. It all just depends on the program you\u2019re on and the type of supervision you\u2019re receiving.\nFinally, should you trust a medically supervised diet? \u2013 Let me point out that physicians and nutrition professionals are often at odds with one another. Doctors rarely get nutrition training in medical school. Yes, that\u2019s right. Doctors RARELY get nutrition education to become doctors. Yet, we are instructed to \u201cconsult your physician before starting a diet or exercise plan\u201d. In truth, they often know very little about nutrition. They know a great deal about the human body, but not what feeds it.

Having received a dire report from Georgia-based prison design firm Rosser International Inc., San Bernardino County was expecting a shortfall in inmate beds and a doubling of their inmate population by the year 2020. Against this background, the County began accepting bids for a 500-inmate private prison.\nTerry Mooreland, CEO of Maranatha Private Corrections LLC was among the individuals who bid on the project. There was only one catch. Mooreland\u2019s bid included a stipulation that if he was awarded the bid, inmates serving sentences at his facility would be offered a vegan diet.\nAs fate would have it, Mooreland won the bid and in 1997 began to build what became the Victor Valley Medium Community Correctional Facility in Adelanto, California; which is about 120 miles northeast of Los Angeles. Once operational, this facility saw remarkable results for seven years, before a dispute over inmate phone revenue led the State of California to cancel their contract with Mooreland.\nIt is unbelievable that something as silly as phone revenue could cause a State to end one of the most remarkable prison success programs in the country, where inmates got out and stayed out. At the time, the State of California had a recidivism rate of 95%. This is the percentage of former prisoners who are rearrested. The Victor Valley facility enjoyed a recidivism rate of less than 2%.\nSo, what was the key factor behind this success? A vegan diet.\nUpon arrival, new inmates attended an orientation where they received two clear choices. They could live on one side of the prison which operated using the standard California Department of Corrections (CDC) guidelines and food menus; or, they could live on the side of the prison operated under the \u201cNEWSTART\u201d program which included a vegan diet, bible studies, job training and anger management.\nIn a video-taped interview obtained by Vegetarian Spotlight, Victor Valley nutrition services coordinator Julianne Aranda explains that \u201cwhat we eat not only affects us physically, but it affects our mental attitude, our aggressiveness and our ability to make good decisions\u201d. In interview after interview it was clear that the NEWSTART program staff was in agreement that the mind and body must be cleaned up in order for the inmates to achieve positive behavioral changes.\nInitially, although the State of California was very supportive of the NEWSTART concept, they told Moorland they didn\u2019t believe that even five inmates (of the 500) would accept that kind of a diet. In fact, they told Moorland that inmates would probably \u201cburn the place down before they became vegetarians\u201d. However, once the program was in progress, the opposite became true. On average, 85% of the inmates chose the NEWSTART side while only 15% chose the CDC program.\nThe remarkable behavioral changes could even be seen outside in the prison yard where according to prison officials, nobody \u201cowned\u201d or controlled the yard. Typical lines drawn between blacks, whites, hispanics, gang members and other groups were non existent. On the NEWSTART side, everyone played basketball together and had great fellowship. The CDC side of the house had the same racial divisions experienced at any other prison.\nIn testimonials, inmates assert that the surprisingly good-tasting food led them to feel better, have greater energy, increased stamina and reduced problems with acne. Indeed the effectiveness of a vegan vegetarian diet in rehabilitation has been scientifically validated.\nAlthough the State of California apparently preferred to pursue phone revenue over rehabilitated inmates, the success of the Victor Valley facility gives us something to think about. Could this kind of a diet help us in raising our children?\n"}, {"score": 1367.9849, "uuid": "45d55968-9761-50c7-9d09-6fddc5a420f8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1210wb-28-15232", "target_hostname": "www.shared-vision.com", "target_uri": "http://www.shared-vision.com/sv_features/20061201/mindful_meat_eating_or_vegetarian_vegan", "page_rank": 2.9330598e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Mindful Meat Eating or <em>Vegetarian</em>&#x2F;<em>Vegan</em>? | Today&#x27;s Vancouver Woman", "snippet": "My understanding <em>is</em> clear about <em>the</em> <em>differences</em> <em>between</em> <em>a</em> <em>vegetarian</em> plant-based diet versus one that includes specialty meat <em>and</em> I would consider <em>the</em> change to vegetarianism only if prescribed by my doctor.

I have enjoyed many vegetarian meals and even have a friend with whom I share vegan meals, from time to time. My understanding is clear about the differences between a vegetarian plant-based diet versus one that includes specialty meat and I would consider the change to vegetarianism only if prescribed by my doctor. Thankfully, he has not. His belief, as is my own: moderation.\nFrom a culinary perspective, creating exciting vegetarian meals is challenging and fun. The food can be quite fulfilling as a main meal, but not every day. Life is too short. Of all the things we can do each and every day (sleep, work, play, have sex, and eat), why even consider limiting dining opportunities to just vegetables, legumes, fruits, and nuts with the amazing variety of flesh food available?\nI purposefully try to limit my daily intake of meat and avoid conventional meat sources altogether. My company, Hills Foods Ltd., is a leader in the supply of \u201ccertified\u201d organic meats, game meats, and specialty poultry. We are constantly invited to dine at some of the best establishments in town for openings, fundraisers, or product introductions. When confronted by the dazzling array of high-end appetizers at a Bocuse d\u2019Or fundraiser or a sit-down dinner presented by Culinary Team Canada, we are obligated (thankfully!) to get down to business and taste everything. What good foodie wouldn\u2019t? Saying no to such mag\u00adnificently prepared meat would be bizarre.\nMore Recommended reading:\n1. Much Depends on Dinner by Margaret Visser\n2.

The Pantropheon or A History of Food and its Preparation in Ancient Times by Alexis Soyer\nWhy do so many of us eat meat? Why do we have such sharp teeth? I wonder. Hmmm? Reading Reay Tannahill\u2019s book, Food in History (Three Rivers Press, 1995), is a good eye opener for those who are on the fence. Other more scientific publications explain the significant benefits of consuming wild meat as opposed to farm-raised, conventional livestock. Another good read is The Driving Force: Food in Evolution and the Future, by Michael Crawford & David Marsh (HarperCollins, 1989).\nThe more I read about the industrialization of traditional proteins for food such as chicken, pork, beef, and lamb, the more I am sold on the certified-organic philosophy of producing meat and wild meat for the table. People have selectively bred overweight animals, which are unhealthy themselves and unhealthy to eat. Modern-day, intensive, high-energy feeding systems create mountains of excess fat in our domestic animals. Choose your source of protein carefully. Research. Ask the hard questions of your supplier: Where does it come from? How is it raised? Farmed or wild? Additive free, grain-fed, non-medicated? Etc.\nMy first choice for protein is wild-harvest muskox or caribou. It\u2019s the epitome of protein: rich flavor, clean, and unadulterated. Trucking meat and/or produce for thousands of kilometres is really not something we should do every day, if we wish to support a local, sustainable food supply. But, once in a while, what a treat!\nMany vegetarians/vegans use the example of animal cruelty in defence of their chosen life path. Yes, there are cases of questionable practices, but we have the right to choose our source of protein supply. Should we look to Pamela Anderson for advice on food choices? Perhaps Sir Paul and his ex? I don\u2019t think so. Look to science, not Entertainment Tonight!\nMore recently, we have been dining on wild-harvest kangaroo meat from Australia. A quick saut\u00e9 of kangaroo loin, a slow-braised wild Arctic muskox rib, or a fine roast of caribou will always get my taste buds trembling with anticipation. The idea of a Pemberton Meadows natural beef T-bone steak on the barbeque wouldn\u2019t have me thinking twice of driving across town to enjoy a local treat.\nSmaller meat portions and a wide variety of locally grown produce are comforting to me. Vegetarian diet? Not for this wild-meat guy. When it comes to diet, I recommend moderation, balance, wild, and clean.\nMeat is Murder\nNo matter how that animal was treated, the meat on your plate is bleeding. It\u2019s dead meat. Flesh like yours. Flesh like mine.\nBy Sarah Kramer\nI am not the vegan police and it is not my job to bust you. What you do is your business. But those of you who are vegan-curious, read on.\nFor the uninitiated, vegans don\u2019t use or consume animal products. No eggs, milk, butter, cheese, chicken, fish, etc. We don\u2019t wear wool, silk, or leather and everything we buy is animal friendly: containing no animal ingredients and not tested on animals.\nIt might sound like a tough row to hoe, but on the contrary, I live an honourable, compassionate life knowing that I not only tread lightly on the earth but I also don\u2019t contribute to any suffering.\nMy cookbooks (govegan.net) are not just about food but include how to live a vegan lifestyle in a fun, easy manner. It doesn\u2019t have to be a difficult undertaking, and armed with a good cookbook or three, being vegan is just that much easier.\nI encourage readers to tread lightly on the planet. Recycling is obvious. Riding or walking, rather than driving. Using canvas rather than plastic bags. Composting. Shopping locally and supporting independent businesses. For me, being vegan is high up on that list.\nA big issue for vegan-friendly people who can\u2019t quite make that final step to becoming vegan is the worry that they won\u2019t acquire enough nutrients. What I tell them is that meat contains absolutely nothing you cannot obtain from a vegan diet. Protein, minerals, and vitamins are all available. There is no proof that a person must eat animal flesh to be healthy; yet there is overwhelming proof that a vegan (or plant-based diet) is healthiest. It can keep your weight regulated, reverse heart disease, help type-2 diabetics reduce the need for medication, reduce high cholesterol, reduce the risk of cancers of the colon, lung, and skin . . . need I go on?\nIf you\u2019re still not sure, please make ethical purchases: local, organic, or free-range products. While your choices are not necessarily \u201ccompassionate,\u201d you are supporting businesses that handle their animals in a mindful way. I still think you\u2019re eating death on a plate\u2014but who am I to judge?\nFive quick reasons to be vegan:\n1. You\u2019ll smell better. The rotting meat in your colon makes you smell like a slaughterhouse.\n2. Vegans tread softly on the planet. 20 vegetarians can live off the land required by one meat eater.\n3. Vegan food is delicious.\n4. A vegan lifestyle is healthier.\n5. You love your dog. You love Spot. Would you eat Spot? No. So why would you eat a different type of animal and not give it a second thought?\nA new trend in the meat-and-dairy industry is to capitalize on the sympathy of the educated, conscientious consumer. Dairy companies are now selling soy \u201cmilk.\u201d Some \u201ctofu dogs\u201d are made by meat companies. To ease flip-flopping consumers\u2019 concerns about eating animal products, some meat companies are using eco- labelling, so consumers can purchase without guilt because their products are free farmed, certified humane, or cage free.\nPAY ATTENTION! These are just decorative words to keep you even more disconnected from what you eat. While I welcome a world where animals are treated with dignity and respect, these companies are still peddling dead flesh. The labels are to pacify you, so that you don\u2019t feel guilty about what\u2019s on your plate. I\u2019m not trying to be outrageous, but it\u2019s a simple fact: meat is flesh. No matter how that animal was treated, the meat on your plate is bleeding. It\u2019s dead meat. Flesh like yours. Flesh like mine.\nIn the end, I hope you make educated choices. Where you spend your money is a pow\u00aderful way to express yourself. Support locally owned businesses and buy local fruits and veggies, whenever possible. Please avoid pur\u00adchasing veggie products made by dairy and/or meat companies. And support companies that have animal welfare in mind, not profits.\nAnd GO VEGAN!\n"}, {"score": 1366.1986, "uuid": "bfbcbacb-f4e4-5bba-b703-aeca272575dd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0011wb-91-08508", "target_hostname": "vegetarian.about.com", "target_uri": "http://vegetarian.about.com/od/vegetarianvegan101/qt/VegPantry.htm", "page_rank": 7.4503284e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "How to Stock Your <em>Vegetarian</em> Pantry - <em>Vegan</em> pantry essentials - <em>Vegetarian</em>", "snippet": "Spices are really <em>what</em> create <em>the</em> <em>difference</em> <em>between</em> basic dishes <em>and</em> exotic ethnic cuisines.

On the occasion that I do, there is often one difference in our opinions about what is vegan and what is not. That difference is honey.\nI have participated in many discussions and debates arguing on the side of bees, alone. I am going to ask you now, why do you think honey is vegan? If you think that it is, I want you to think about the reasons why you think so. I will now explain to you why I feel honey is not vegan, and then I will ask you the same question again.\nThe number one reason why honey is not vegan is simply that the bees are literally enslaved. They live in giant man-made bee camps where they work hard to make honey. This honey is then stolen by humans who either consume it or seek to gain profit from the bee\u2019s hard work. If you are vegan for ethical reasons, then it is likely that you have accepted the idea of specieism. So what is the difference between consuming dairy and consuming honey? There are ways to harvest honey without harming bees just as there are ways to harvest milk without harming cattle. Assuming these methods are being applied in both situations, the cow produces the milk with much less effort than the bees collectively produce honey. Thinking about it in this way, I would say I would feel less guilty about taking the milk. I do not know anyone who calls themselves vegan that consumes dairy.\nAssuming that you are not speciest, if you are vegan and you are using honey then you must also be alright with the idea of human slavery. I know this is a dreaded comparison, but when we are talking about specieism then what is the difference? Most likely, you are not in favor of human slavery although you support the slavery of an animal, the honey bee. If you are an anti-speciest vegan, then this makes you a hypocrite. I believe slavery is wrong no matter what, regardless of the treatment of the slaves.\nIt is possible to get honey where the royal jelly that the bees need is not harvested. You can get honey from beekeepers who wear a suit that does not allow the bee to sting them, resulting in bee deaths. You can also obtain honey where the bees are not smoked out of the hive first before harvesting. But just like with the myth of humane meat (free range cattle/chickens/etc.), how do you really know where your honey is coming from and how it is harvested? The only way to know is if you are harvesting the honey for yourself or if you personally know the beekeeper and you have visited and investigated their facilities.\nWhat does vegan mean? I know that everyone\u2019s personal definition of what being vegan means to them is different. The literal basic definition of a vegan is a vegetarian that omits all animal products from the diet. Does this mean you don\u2019t credit bees as being an animal? In that case I guess a whole new world of insect cuisine is about to open up for you! In fact, it should be ok for you to start using silk now! While you\u2019re at it I guess wool is ok as well. I mean, you can harvest wool without hurting the sheep. Oh wait\u2026. Sheep are mammals not bugs so they deserve respect, I almost forgot.\nBees are living creatures that are enslaved by humans. If you are ok with this, then you are speciest against bees. I don\u2019t see any other way you can argue on the side of slavery other than if you are speciest. I want you to keep in mind that honey is so important to bees, they will die to protect it. So I am asking you again, why do you think honey is vegan?\nWith all that being said, even I am guilty of exploiting the bee slaves. I do not consume honey but I do consume almonds, apples, and other various crops that are pollinated by bees in a way that is pretty much horrific . So don't feel too bad from my opinion piece calling you a hypocrite, for I also am a hypocrite. It's honestly hard to be vegan and be perfect, it's hard to be anything and be perfect. As I've said in previous articles , being vegan is about sticking to what you think is right and doing the best you can, just always remember that.\nSteven Garnett | Facebook | @stevengarnett\nSteven is currently pursuing a B.A. in history and women's studies\u00a0at East Tennessee State University.
