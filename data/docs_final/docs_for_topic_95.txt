Do you protect the ecology? No matter what you say, my guess is that you do neither.\nFirst, let\u2019s define \u2018Environment\u2019 and \u2018Ecology\u2019. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica \u2018Environment\u2019 is a complex of physical, chemical and biological factors that affect an organism or an ecological community thereby determining its form, and survival. These factors include the atmosphere, climate, continental landform, the hydrosphere (the water ecosystem of planet Earth) and the oceans.\nIf you can imagine yourself enclosed within a big box - bottom, top and four sides \u2013 the inside of that box is your environment. The box might be sitting on the beach, in the middle of a field, on top of a mountain, or any one of a million or more places, but your environment is constrained by the bottom, four walls and the top of that box. In other words, what surrounds you is your environment. It is active, forever changing, depending on a whole range of variables.\nEcology, on the other hand, is the conditions caused by organisms on their environment. Things like increasing populations, food scarcity, pollution of the environment, global warming - extinctions, both of plant and animal species - are all ecological, i.e., affecting the ecology.\nThe recent eruption of an Icelandic volcano with the almost unpronounceable name of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull made a considerable impact on our environment, both locally and globally. The question is, was it environmentally good, or bad? Well, that all depends on the viewpoint from where you are observing its effects.\nAs an inhabitant of Earth, from your viewpoint it is probably considered to be environmentally bad \u2013 the eruption injected millions of tons of fine ash into the atmosphere, cutting out the Sun\u2019s rays and making breathing difficult for many. It definitely altered your environment considerably. If it had been really bad, it could have blocked out the Sun for an extended period of time bringing on an Ice Age.\nHowever, the alterations it made are short-lived. The long-term effects are negligible. The volcano also spewed out millions of cubic metres of new rock, rock rich in minerals that will assist in the growing of vegetation and such like. Look at Hawaii - it consists of a chain of lush, tropical islands, made entirely by volcanic eruption. In fact, without volcanic eruptions and weathering, the Earth as we know it today wouldn\u2019t exist. So is the eruption good or bad? The Earth is more than 4.5 billion years old. It has changed its environment many, many times, so when we talk about changing the environment, what we\u2019re talking about is changing our environment.\nEven flashy looking hybrids consume loads of energy to make.Like all live systems, the Earth will do its best to achieve equilibrium, i.e., the least energy demanding state. Water will always flow downhill, never up, trying to reach equilibrium. \u00a0All Earth\u2019s systems will try their best to reach that condition. The question is, will we be able to live under that set of conditions?\nWe have been pumping massive quantities of combustion exhaust gases and other volatile substances into the atmosphere for at least the last 300 years, since the Industrial Revolution. We have been dumping our sewage into the oceans with nary a thought for the inhabitants of the sea. But the Earth survives. It just moves the equilibrium line left or right accordingly. The big question is \u2013 Can we survive within those limits? Our tolerance is much finer than that of the Earth, we are but a minute or so in its twenty-four hour lifespan. The question is, why should it care?\nSo much for the environment. We are also changing the ecology by our behaviour. Unlike the environment, to which, by our behaviour we can make substantial changes, ecology is not a reversible system. Once we change things by what we do, it is very hard, and very expensive to reverse trends.\nLong ago, the Earth was hotter, wetter and covered by dense vegetation but man began to show his domination and, to provide room for growing his food, chopped down the trees. It is still being done in parts of the world even as you read this \u2013 slash and burn cultivation. And it will continue for as long as the global population continues to rise. What these people fail to understand is that all the nutrients from the soil are in the crowns of the trees! They took hundreds of years in many cases to reach the sizes they are today. When a tree died, it fell to the ground, decayed and provided nourishment for the next cycle, but now we chop down the trees, drag them away to use them for firewood, fence posts and furniture without returning the nutrients to the soil. The result is that they only get one, or two growing seasons out of the land before they have to chop down more trees.\nThe effect on the land is even more devastating. The soil becomes dried and powdery with no roots to hold it together then, when it rains, gets washed down into the rivers, blocking dams, overflowing river banks \u2013 causing landslides and killing people.\nToday, there is a lot of hype about being eco-friendly or environment friendly. It is all relative, and not very meaningful in most cases. Are you eco-friendly? Not unless you change your lifestyle completely - which you won\u2019t do - can you even remotely be classified as eco-friendly? Do you throw away garbage? Empty drinks bottles? Cans? Plastic containers? Old clothes, newspapers, everyday cast-offs? If you answer yes to even one of these, then you\u2019re not being eco-friendly.\nIn present-day lifestyle it is very difficult. But you can try. Do you separate your trash? Glass, plastic, aluminium, paper, cardboard \u2013 can all be separated out for recycling. It all depends on whether you feel it is worth it or not. Why go to all that trouble when there\u2019s another 6.999999999 billion people who don\u2019t? And there is the problem \u2013 I\u2019ll do it if you do it. The question is who starts? Containers set out by well-meaning Town Councils in Singapore for separation of materials are abused and filled with all sorts of rubbish by thoughtless, ignorant people. And yet, they are the first to squeal when the Council doesn\u2019t collect garbage from their front door every morning!\nSo, many changes will have to be made before you can even consider calling yourself eco-friendly. What about the environment? We see advertisements daily about such and such a car \u2013 hybrids - environment friendly, because they run on electricity and/or hydrogen. But you cannot compare an electric car to a petrol engine or diesel engine car simply by its emission levels into the environment. You have to begin at the mining for the iron ore or aluminium ore, the drilling for the oil and gas which goes to the making of the plastics that will be made into the vehicle \u2013 up until it sits in the showroom a hybrid or petrol driven vehicle has exactly the same environmental impact!\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there. The production of petrol is a fairly refined process, but its combustion products pollute the atmosphere, so does that make it environmentally unfriendly? What about the hybrid car? The hydrogen comes from basically the same refining process as the petrol, the electricity to charge the battery most likely is made by power stations that burn oil, natural gas or coal and what is environmentally friendly about any of them?\nSo in reality you can\u2019t claim that something is environmentally friendly unless you sum all of the polluting activities it goes through to get to the final product. You can only compare one similar product to another and classify one of them through your findings as being environmentally friendlier than the other. \u00a0It\u2019s a comparative study.\nEven you are not particularly environmentally friendly when you consider you are breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide. Doesn\u2019t seem much when you\u2019re talking about yourself, but figuring in the other 6.5/7.0 billion people with an average lung capacity of 5 litres or thereabouts, that\u2019s an awful lot of CO2 being emitted.\nHaving said all that, there is so much more that can be done, and should be done to becoming environmentally friendlier than we are at present. As I said before, the Earth will survive. The question is, will we?\n"}, {"score": 1928.7308, "uuid": "e845c96e-a343-5a06-81f7-283855b4d6e0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-70-31261", "target_hostname": "www.spiritofchange.org", "target_uri": "http://www.spiritofchange.org/green-living-environment/earthtalk-environmentally-friendly-high-mileage-hybrids", "page_rank": 1.1739445e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "EarthTalk: <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> High Mileage <em>Hybrids</em> - Spirit of Change", "snippet": "Automakers are scrambling to create smaller, <em>more</em> efficient and less toxic batteries for <em>hybrids</em> and other vehicles, Berman reports.

Not surprisingly, top honors went to a hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle, Honda\u2019s Insight, which pairs an efficient electric motor with a gasoline engine to save gas and minimize emissions. Unfortunately, the Insight, launched in 1999, will soon be discontinued due to declining sales.\nTo determine a car\u2019s rankings, in addition to fuel efficiency, ACEEE factors in the pollution generated by a given vehicle based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions ratings. While the Insight does not have as clean an exhaust rating as Toyota\u2019s hybrid Prius, it has slightly better highway mileage (56 versus 51 miles per gallon), making it the overall winner. Other top green models on ACEEE\u2019s list include various versions of Honda\u2019s Civic (particularly its natural gas version) and Toyota\u2019s Corolla and Matrix. The Hyundai Accent, Kia Rio, Mazda 3, Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion also placed well.\nRegarding batteries, hybrid advocates insist that the nickel-metal hydride batteries found in the Toyota Prius, Honda Insight and other hybrids contain far fewer pollutants than the lead-acid types present in traditional gas-powered cars. Furthermore, carmakers are keen to keep such batteries out of landfills, with Toyota even offering to buy back spent hybrid batteries for $200 so it can recycle them.\nAccording to Toyota: \u201cEvery part of the battery, from the precious metals to the plastic, plates, steel case and the wiring, is recycled.\u201d Meanwhile, Bradley Berman of the website, HybridCars.com, reports that, \u201cHonda collects the battery and transfers it to a preferred recycler to follow their prescribed process: disassembling and sorting the materials; shredding the plastics; recovering and processing the metal; and neutralizing the alkaline material before sending it to a landfill.\u201d Automakers are scrambling to create smaller, more efficient and less toxic batteries for hybrids and other vehicles, Berman reports.\nAnother option for green consumers is a diesel car that runs on biodiesel, a fuel derived from renewable crops (and which works seamlessly in most diesel engines). AutoWeek magazine reports that a biodiesel-powered Volkswagen Jetta TDI has the best overall fuel economy of any new car on the road today under \u201creal-world driving conditions\u201d (which include, among other things, traffic congestion, use of air conditioning and high speeds). In AutoWeek\u2019s test-drive comparison, the Jetta TDI achieved nearly 50 miles per gallon using B20 biodiesel (two parts vegetable oil, eight parts regular diesel), edging out even Toyota\u2019s Prius, which only scored 42 mpg using gasoline.\nThe EPA is revising its own testing procedures for the 2007 model year to try to get more in line with real world driving conditions. As a result, fuel economies displayed on window stickers will change. Some cars, especially smaller vehicles and hybrids, will lose as much as 12 percent in their ratings.\nCONTACTS: ACEEE\u2019s Green Book Online, http://www.greenercars.com ; http://www.hybridcars.com ; AutoWeek Magazine\u2019s \u201cAre We There Yet?\u201d http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060424/FREE/60417021/1008 .\nGot an environmental question?

It lets you get to Point A to Point B relatively quickly. Walking or riding the bike may not be an option for the items that a person needs to carry out his daily life, although most towns of a few thousand people will have grocery and drug stores to meet the population\u2019s needs.\nIf you are lower middle class or working poor, you may even want an environmentally car, even though most of the newer environmentally cars are out of your price range, but in this case, the best step is to get cars with smaller engines that will also save on your gasoline costs.\nFinding a good, environmentally friendly car is often a challenge. Environmentally conscious magazines sell kits to convert a car to bio diesel, ethanol and other fuels. The kits, as long as the buyer installs them properly work. Using such kits requires that a person have mechanical competence and a lot of time to do the conversion.\nFor now, those who are in a situation where they do not have to wait for an environmentally friendly vehicle to enter their price range can drive hybrid cars, electric cars, or cars that get high gas mileage. The hybrid, as long as acceleration is not a concern for the owner is the most viable option. Hybrids contain two drive shafts and can switch between all-electric and all-gasoline operation. During normal driving, the car will switch trains depending on which drive shaft can handle the tasks asked of it more efficiently. Users who run a hybrid correctly never have to plug it into an electrical outlet.\nElectrical cars have their own problems. While they do not produce emissions, they do not really save fossil fuels. They indirectly burn a different type in most areas of the United States. All electric vehicles will most likely indirectly use coal, unless a person lives near an electric dam, a nuclear power plant, a wind farm, or a solar panel. In the end, electric cars are not quite as environmentally friendly as most consumers believe they were. Options that make the cars more environmentally friendly are in development, but it is best to hold off for now. Limited range has also hurt the sale of the purely electric vehicle.\nThe most viable option for the moment is to find a car that has good city and highway mileage and passes the California emissions test. You will still emit carbon dioxide into the air, but you will emit less. High gas mileage means you will need less fuel to get back and forth to work, church, school and shopping.\nArchive\n"}, {"score": 1658.1624, "uuid": "7a411f3d-4271-5d49-ae16-46d48d5f20e8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0902wb-51-01399", "target_hostname": "www.hybridcenter.org", "target_uri": "http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-watchdog-hybrid-vs-diesel.html", "page_rank": 2.7221945e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>Hybrid</em> Watchdog: <em>Hybrid</em> vs. &quot;Clean <em>Diesel</em>&quot; \u2014 Tale of the Tape", "snippet": "So how do <em>diesels</em> fare against the efficient <em>hybrids</em> that currently hold the eco-<em>friendly</em> vehicle mantle? In short, <em>hybrids</em> still carry the day.", "explanation": null, "document": "UCS Info on Electric Cars\nHybrid Watchdog:\u00a0\u00a0Hybrids vs. \"Clean Diesel\" \u2014 Tale of the Tape\nIn an environment where American consumers are increasingly more concerned about the ecological, economic, and energy-related impacts of their travel, hybrid vehicles have garnered the lion\u2019s share of recent attention as a near-term solution to those challenges. Yet when it comes to fuel-efficient drivetrains, hybrids are not alone. U.S. interest in diesel engines for passenger vehicles has seen a recent resurgence, in part because of creative automotive engineering. A number of the performance and emissions pitfalls that plagued diesel technology over the years have been addressed, bringing the latest round of what automakers call \u201cclean diesel\u201d vehicles a newfound respect among automotive enthusiasts.\nSome of this new attention is warranted. Today\u2019s diesel cars are meeting emissions levels that\u2014for a diesel vehicle\u2014would have been hard to imagine a mere decade ago. Like some of their hybrid counterparts they also offer impressive fuel economy compared to many conventional vehicles on the road. Such information has prompted some to speculate about whether today\u2019s diesels might be deserving of the eco-friendly mantle currently held by efficient hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid.\nSo how do today\u2019s diesels fare compared to today\u2019s most popular hybrids? This edition of the Hybrid Watchdog takes a closer examination of the issue, and identifies exactly which parameters to consider when making such comparisons. Let\u2019s dig in\u2026\nUnder the Hood: Diesel Fuel Economy\nOne of the biggest draws of diesel technology is their impressive fuel economy. Diesels achieve higher mpgs (miles per gallon) due to two main factors. First, the compression ignition combustion process that occurs inside diesel engine cylinders is more efficient than the spark ignition process that occurs in gasoline engine cylinders, wasting less energy as the fuel is converted into mechanical motion.\nSecond is the fact that on a per-gallon basis, diesel fuel contains about 13 percent more energy than gasoline. This higher energy density helps push the vehicle farther down road, getting it\u2014quite literally\u2014more miles per gallon. As we\u2019ll see shortly, however, the impressive fuel economy numbers of diesels don\u2019t tell the whole story when it comes to assessing other attributes such as global warming, or oil dependence performance, or air pollution.\nGlobal Warming Pollution\nWhen comparing the global warming performance of two vehicles, most consumers simply compare their respective fuel economies. While there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns. Generally, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the better it is from a global warming standpoint.\nWhile this is a good general rule, it is important to note that using fuel economies to compare the global warming performance of two vehicles is only applicable when the two vehicles operate on the same fuel. Different fuels have unique concentrations of carbon, in a similar way that, say, different types of soda contain different amounts of sugar. This \u201ccarbon content\u201d affects how much CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned.\nDiesel fuel, in addition to containing more energy per gallon than gasoline, also has comparably higher carbon content. On a full fuel cycle basis (that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent more CO2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline. This characteristic of diesel fuel is why using a fuel economy comparison between gasoline and diesel vehicles to determine global warming benefits can be misleading. If a diesel vehicle consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline powered vehicle, for example, its global warming benefit would in reality only be about 15 percent better than the gasoline vehicle.\nOil Dependence\nA similar story holds when it comes to oil dependence. According to the joint U.S. EPA-DOE website, www.fueleconomy.gov , approximately 13 percent more crude oil is required to produce a gallon of diesel fuel than to produce a gallon of gasoline.*\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, from an oil security standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn\u2019t capture the full picture. Using our previous example, a diesel vehicle that consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline-powered vehicle would, in fact, consume only 15 percent less crude oil than the gasoline vehicle.\nAir Pollution\nAll vehicles sold today are tested in a laboratory for tailpipe emissions and given a certification level \u2014 a grade, effectively \u2014 that specifies how clean the vehicle is in the emissions of four major pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (PM). Today\u2019s \u201cclean diesels\u201d are certified to meet what\u2019s known as the federal \u201cTier 2 bin 5\u201d emissions standard, along with an equivalent standard in California commonly known as \u201cLEV II\u201d.\nMeeting the \u201cbin 5\u201d standard is a significant achievement for diesels which, because of the diesel combustion process, produces high levels of NOx and PM in the engine cylinders. However, the \u201cbin 5\u201d certification is an exceedingly common standard for today\u2019s gasoline vehicles. Most of today\u2019s hybrids and even some conventional gasoline vehicles are considerably cleaner, certified to \u201cbin 3,\u201d \u201cbin 2,\u201d (the lower the bin number, the better for the environment) and even the near-zero-emission California \u201cPZEV\u201d certification.\nTale of the Tape\nSo how do diesels fare against the efficient hybrids that currently hold the eco-friendly vehicle mantle? In short, hybrids still carry the day. While diesels offer impressive fuel economy and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts. Below is a sample comparison between two similar vehicles, one diesel and one a gasoline hybrid, that illustrates this point. Note, there are no diesel and hybrid models that allow for a pure apples-to-apples comparison on every major attribute; we chose these models for their popularity and market comparability.\nComparing the Environmental Performance of diesels and hybrids\nMiles Per Gallon (MPG): The mpg ratings for the civic hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel Jetta in highway driving (45 versus 40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).\u00a0 This reflects the benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.\nOverall, the hybrid Civic (42 mpg) out-performs the diesel Jetta (33 mpg) in combined city and highway fuel economy by 27 percent. It should be noted that a vehicle\u2019s fuel economy is highly dependent on manufacturers design decisions.\u00a0 For example, the diesel Jetta could have a better mpg, but the vehicle designers chose to achieve higher acceleration rather than better fuel economy.\nGlobal Warming Pollution: The mpg values help you determine how far you can go on a gallon of fuel, but more information is needed to accurately determine the global warming impact of a vehicle. Comparing the global warming emissions per mile, or carbon footprint, allows a direct comparison between two vehicles, while the EPA greenhouse gas score shows how a vehicle relates to the rest of the fleet.\nCarbon Footprint: The carbon footprint provides an estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and driving 15,000 miles annually.\nThe Civic Hybrid emits an estimated 4.4 tons of CO2-equivalent per year, while the Jetta releases 6.4 tons per year, or approximately 45 percent more global warming emissions.\nEPA GHG Score: While the diesel Jetta might appear to be a global warming laggard based on the previous comparison, the EPA GHG score puts these emissions into a broader context. The GHG score ranks all vehicles on a scale of 1 to 10. Both the diesel Jetta and Civic Hybrid are top scorers when compared to all other available vehicles in the showroom. The Jetta receives an 8 while the Civic Hybrid scores a 10.\nOil Dependence: Comparison of petroleum consumption estimates show that the diesel Jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum than the Civic Hybrid.\nAir Pollution: EPA also provides a similar score for comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.\u00a0 The bin 2 certification earns the Civic Hybrid a 9 on EPA\u2019s Air Pollution score, while the diesel Jetta\u2019s bin 5 certification earns it a middle-of-the-road score of 6.\nConclusion\nEnvironmentally speaking, today\u2019s diesels are a significant improvement over their recent ancestors and can offer notable fuel economy improvements over conventional gasoline vehicles. However, the exceedingly impressive tailpipe emissions and fuel economy performance of today\u2019s most popular hybrids allow them to outperform their diesel counterparts. Nevertheless, diesels can offer global warming and petroleum reduction benefits compared to their conventional gasoline counterparts.\nMany new models of diesel and hybrids will be entering the marketplace in the coming years with varying levels of environmental performance. It will be up to the automakers to decide whether these technologies are used to their full potential to reduce emissions, or whether they\u2019re tapped to improve vehicle power and performance. When comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers should just be aware that \u201cperformance\u201d in the categories of air pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a function of the vehicle\u2019s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its emissions control system and even of the fuel\u2019s chemical makeup.\nAdditional Resources for Vehicle Comparisons\nThe HybridCenter.org comparison chart provides comparison of different hybrid models and their non-hybrid counterparts.\nEPA-DOE website www.fueleconomy.gov includes annual carbon footprint estimates, as well as annual crude oil consumption estimates and air pollution scores for every make and model on its site, allowing you to compare gasoline, diesel, and hybrid-electric vehicles side by side.\nFor Air Pollution and Global Warming pollution scores,\ninformation is available at www.epa.gov/greenvehicles as well as the California Air Resources Board\u2019s website, http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/ .\nNotes\n* UCS calculations using Argonne National Labs GREET1.8b model.\n1) Performance data obtained from Car and Driver ( www.caranddriver.com ).\n2) Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price from vehicle manufacturer website.\n3) Carbon footprint values obtained from www.fueleconomy.gov .\n4) US EPA GHG Score obtained from www.epa.gov/greenvehicles\n5) Petroleum consumption estimates available from fueleconomy.gov\n"}, {"score": 1568.6134, "uuid": "2d235b5b-f81b-5f43-9552-06cf3f8135cd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0104wb-66-19408", "target_hostname": "www.autoweb.com.au", "target_uri": "http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_109173/title_The-Peugeot-308-Hybrid-The-Environmentally-Friendly-Car-for-the-Next-Generation/newsarticle.html", "page_rank": 1.2529372e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "The Peugeot 308 <em>Hybrid</em> \u0096 The <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> Car for the Next", "snippet": "The Peugeot 308 <em>Hybrid</em> \u0096 The <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> Car for the Next Generation At the Frankfurt Motor Show Peugeot will showcase its new 308 <em>Hybrid</em> HDi, <em>which</em> emits just 90g&#x2F;km of CO2 and reduces fuel consumption by 38% in the Combined Cycle compared to <em>a</em> standard 308 HDi.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Peugeot 308 Hybrid \u0096 The Environmentally Friendly Car for the Next Generation\n3 September, 2007\nImage Gallery\nAt the Frankfurt Motor Show Peugeot will showcase its new 308 Hybrid HDi, which emits just 90g/km of CO2 and reduces fuel consumption by 38% in the Combined Cycle compared to a standard 308 HDi.\nIn its pearlescent white and green colour scheme, two colours chosen as symbols of purity and ecology, the 308 Hybrid HDi demonstrator is the eagerly anticipated star of the environmental section of Peugeot\u2019s stand at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show.\nThis new 308 Hybrid HDi demonstrator represents another step on the path towards the planned commercialisation of the technology in 2010.

Fuel consumption in the combined cycle is 3.4 litres per 100km and 90g/km of CO2 or a reduction of 38% compared to an equivalent 308 diesel HDi model.\nIn addition, the engine has been designed to meet the future Euro V directive which comes into force in 2009 and offers the possibility of driving exclusively in electric or \u201cZEV\u201d (Zero Emission Vehicle) mode for journeys in regulated urban centres.\nThe excellent aerodynamic performance of the 308 hatchback and the use of Michelin\u2019s new Energy Saver tyres, which reduce rolling resistance, help to enhance further its performance.\nA step towards commercialisation\nCompared to the previous 307 Hybrid HDi demonstrator presented in 2006, the focus of the development has now switched to concentrating on the packaging of the hybrid technology into the structure of the new 308, and to ensure its compatibility with the future Euro V emission standards.\nTo ensure a competitive purchase price, priority has been given to using as many components as possible from current Peugeot vehicles. This has enabled the number of specific parts associated with the hybridisation of the 308 to be reduced by around 30% compared to the previous 307 Hybrid HDi demonstrator.\nA simple, automatic technology\nThe vehicle is started by a customary ignition key but, unlike a conventional vehicle, this does not start the diesel engine. Instead by pressing the accelerator pedal with the gearbox in automatic mode, the electric motor powers the vehicle. The diesel engine only operates when required and is controlled by a stop and start system. All the powertrain operating modes are controlled by a Power Train Management Unit (PTMU) according to the driver\u2019s requirements.\nThe driver is informed in real time of the power train operating mode by a schematic diagram on the vehicle\u2019s colour multifunction display. Other information is also available, such as the battery charge status or the power train operation mode.\nWell equipped and without compromise\nThe comprehensively equipped demonstrator has all the standard equipment of a Premium Pack 308 and also includes a panoramic glass roof and the RT4 multi-media system with a retractable colour display screen. The level of standard equipment, interior space, interior brightness, dynamic qualities and driveability are no different to those of the standard 308.\nGeneral dynamic performance is also comparable to a standard 308 HDi. In-gear acceleration, however, both in town and on the open road, is improved with the Hybrid HDi. Indeed, during in-gear acceleration, the diesel engine is backed up by the electric motor which is able on demand to deliver a power boost.\nOptimised Hybrid HDi technology\nThe parallel hybrid power train consists of a 1.6 litre HDi DPFS 80kW diesel engine and an electric motor with a continuous output of 16kw. The Power Train Management Unit (PTMU) selects the right distribution of power from both units to meet the requirements of the driver and minimise fuel consumption.\nThe electric motor alone is responsible for starting and driving at low speed, while only the diesel engine is used on open roads and motorways, with both units coming into play simultaneously to provide quicker acceleration. The system is fitted with a 6-speed electronically controlled manual gearbox able to operate in automatic or manual sequential mode.\nTo extend the battery range, kinetic energy recovered during phases of deceleration and braking is used to recharge the batteries. A special button provides access to an all-electric \u201cZEV\u201d Zero Emission Vehicle mode. Operation of the diesel engine is then restricted to more pronounced acceleration phases or high speed driving. This \"ZEV\" mode provides total absence of exhaust emissions and noise pollution.\nTechnical description of main specific components\nThe electric motor is of the synchronous type with permanent magnets, developing a continuous power of 16kW and a torque of 79Nm. However, intermittently its output can attain 22kW and 128Nm.\nAn inverter regulates the 150 to 260 volt current from the high voltage battery pack supplying the electric motor in accordance with the torque requirements determined by the Power Train Management Unit (PTMU).\nA new generation battery pack has been developed which delivers an output of 200 volts. It is housed in the spare wheel well and does not, therefore, reduce the available boot volume. The batteries are of the Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) type.\nA converter converts the 200 V from the battery pack into 12 V to supply the vehicle equipment in phases of solely electrical operation.\nManaged braking maximises the recharging of the batteries during phases of deceleration and braking. An Intelligent control of the braking optimises the distribution between regenerative electric braking and traditional dissipative hydraulic braking. The braking management system gives priority to braking efficiency over the recovery of energy.\nMain technical characteristics\n"}, {"score": 1545.2596, "uuid": "43397193-b8a6-5242-bef4-579742fa8fd7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1210wb-27-24277", "target_hostname": "www.eetonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.eetonline.com/design/automotive-design/4207375/Diesels-challenge-hybrids-for-efficiency--low-emissions", "page_rank": 1.171348e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Diesels</em> challenge <em>hybrids</em> for efficiency, low emissions", "snippet": "So this changing consumer behavior and the strong government involvement via rules, regulations and incentives for <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em> cars leads the automotive market towards <em>a</em> new generation of cars to satisfy this trend of \u201cgreen transportation\u201d.", "explanation": null, "document": "Diesels challenge hybrids for efficiency, low emissions\nHenning Hauenstein, International Rectifier\n9/16/2010 2:00 AM EDT\nNot too long ago the car makers where competing with each other on performance\u2014mainly measured by horsepower and acceleration. Fuel economy did not have high attention in the benchmarks for premium cars. This has changed recently and fuel economy is suddenly a major trait that every OEM has on its list.\nThis trend was not only driven by environmental regulations of various governments but the fuel price itself. Also consumer behaviors have changed a lot and our society is undergoing a paradigm change with regards to our transportation concepts and mobility behavior.\nThese days more and more new car customers are looking at the datasheets and specifications for fuel consumption and emissions. The prestige and image of many cars are now largely driven by its benchmark fuel efficiency and emission values rather the pure horsepower backed driving performance and acceleration. So this changing consumer behavior and the strong government involvement via rules, regulations and incentives for environmentally friendly cars leads the automotive market towards a new generation of cars to satisfy this trend of \u201cgreen transportation\u201d. And that\u2019s the main reason why hybrid-electric Vehicles (HEVs) are showing up in every fleet and product line of the major car manufacturers.\nWhat we often forget, especially here in the U.S., is that fuel efficiency and low emissions are not only achieved via revolutionary game-changing technologies like the emission-free electric powertrain of a hybrid vehicle. Looking at the fuel efficiency of currently available or shortly announced HEVs, you would be surprised that this fuel efficiency can be pretty closely matched by a modern diesel engine using state-of-the-art direct fuel injection systems and an electronically controlled and well optimized motor control unit. The big difference comes with the price \"bump up\" for the technology that the buyer pays.\nA diesel engine typically adds only moderat cost compared to a comparable gasoline engine (in the range of approximately $1-2,000). The price adder of HEVs vs their traditional standard combustion engine version is normally at least 2-3 times as high. The reason for this is that hybrid-electric vehicles need to incorporate a complete electric powertrain plus all the energy management and storage systems, a high voltage battery, and plenty of electric systems like inverter, converter, and charger applications into the vehicle architecture.\nTherefore the additional electronic content in a HEV is much higher than the little electronics in the motor control unit plus some diagnostic and monitoring sensors which are needed to build a very efficient direct fuel injection system for a modern diesel aggregate in a much more cost effective way.\nChecking the numbers\nLet\u2019s look at the table below, which shows the average highway fuel consumption in miles/gallon of HEVs vs diesel. There is not much difference between similar sized and powered diesel and HEV cars. The emission values of those cars are also in a comparable range. Only the pure city consumption of the HEVs seems to be superior since the HEV-engine typically shuts down (so called start-stop mode) every time the car is stopped in a traffic jam or at red lights. But adding relatively low cost start-stop functionality to a regular diesel engine (so called micro-hybrid) would push the diesel city mileage likely into the same range as the one advertised for gasoline-HEVs.\nLooking at these numbers the diesel solutions could offer quite some threat to the penetration of HEVs. In countries in Europe where diesel is a well established engine type and the consumer acceptance is at least as high for gasoline powered aggregates we see already a very strong market penetration of diesel while HEVs seem to sell much harder compared to U.S. or Japan, for example.\nDuane Benson\n9/10/2010 7:43 PM EDT\nNice profile of the potential of diesel. And, fortunately, given that as the author states, his company wins with wide-spread adoption of either diesel or HEV, I'm betting this is more balanced than so much of what we read on the subject these days.\nI think it is important to have a lot of research going into HEV and pure electrics, and we need early-adopter purchases, but in the near-term, the planet could probably get the best reduction in fuels use and pollutants per buck by looking to solutions like modern diesel and super efficient gas power plants. I wonder how much fuel we could save simply by reducing the horsepower in all vehicles by ten or twenty percent.\nThat's probably the real hold-up. We want power and lots of it. To satisfy that desire, we have big gas engines and hybrids that are more about increasing horsepower than fuel economy.\nCode Monkey\n9/16/2010 11:29 AM EDT\nI think HEVs will benefit once solar has dropped in cost to the point that consumers have excess power and need a place to put it.\nI drive a Jetta TDI myself, powered by B100 biodiesel produced from recycled fryer oil.\ncdhmanning\n2/3/2011 7:32 PM EST\nExcept that most car usage takes the car away from the home during the day (while the sun is shining) and would want to recharge during the night (when PV doesn't work).\nMike99\n9/17/2010 12:41 PM EDT\nI drive one of the Citroen babies (1.2L turbo-deisel) 5 years ago in Spain for several weeks over 4000Km; less than 4L/100km doing 120Km/hr. Experience: smooth, powerful, miserly like US automakers / customers don't have a clue.\nWe don't get out enough nor realize the joke we are. Thanks for your article and quiet significant observation.\nps: did you ever have to change one of those HEV batteries, do you know how often you have to in the car's life & related $, any idea of that environmental overall impact? Time to look at the numbers (all of them including 'electric vehicles').\nI also converted/drove a Natural Gas conversion dual fuel minivan; a local after-market update shop on a Pontiac minivan. Technology easily applied ($2500) after mfg. and paid-for using a local sales-tax rebate, that is developed to production levels in Italy (over .5M NG vehicles in use). I can gas-up at home with a compressor appliance outside my garage. Engine life is extended with higher octane rating / cleaner burn. Gasoline is still there with a dash-mounted switch.\nIt's out there, just get to it. Good hunting .. & travelling.\nMike\nBob Lacovara\n9/20/2010 3:44 PM EDT\nI drove a Citroen 1.2L Diesel in Spain more like 15 years ago. At the time, one of my other cars had a Chevy 350 cu in (that's about 5.7L for you kids). At first, I though I might as well get out and walk. But once I figured out that I couldn't shift it like an American sports car, the Citroen and I came to a pleasant understanding: it was a wonderful, if small, car. Bell hops at the hotels would ask me where I was from, how I liked the car, and usually, what I drove at home in the US. I would tell them that my engine at home was 5 times as large, and some would wonder at my Spanish: once, a fellow said \"Chevy?\" and I smiled yes... it was fun.\nI miss that car: it was well built, and I couldn't complain of the fuel economy. I wouldn't buy a hybrid: for one thing, I tend to tow a trailer once in a while, and my tastes run to an FJ Cruiser, but I'd certainly consider a large-enough vehicle with a Diesel powerplant.\nMani.Srinivasan\n9/22/2010 2:33 AM EDT\nNice article.. I recently moved from a Gasoline car to a Diesel..and never once regretted. It's pheomenal torque, performance and low emission will put a gasoline to shame. And contrary to popular belief you do get quality fuel in India- and India' commercial tansports run on diesel.. The only reason diesel cars sell less in India than gaoline is due to the premium you pay for Diesel. And given that US does not have such issues, Diesel could make a killing if the mindset could change.\nRJMDA\n12/15/2010 9:20 AM EST\nMost people like Diesel cars in India because Diesel is cheaper than Gasoline (Rs.39 Vs Rs.59 As of Nov. 2010)\nhenkmol\n9/22/2010 3:17 AM EDT\nHi guys and girls (if any...). The higher carnot efficiency of diesels is obvious. Europe is typical diesel country about 1/3rd of all ordinary cars is a diesel here. Why? because of fuel efficiency. Only the taxation of these diesel cars holds us back otherwise they would be the majority. We drive two VW diesels, a polo 1.8 sdi doing 20 km/l if driven in a sporting manner but well behaved 24 km/l if you hold back on the paddles. Not slow at all. Second is a two-metric-tonne T5 transporter van. Big thing. Drives 13 km on a liter of diesel. Thats a lot of cargo bay + 5 person seats (double cab version) and yet using less than the average SUV. And it does not drive like an old truck, no it is actually like a nice car. Silent, reasonably fast, has airco, cruise control etc. No big deal. This how we keep our holidays affordable...\nBest regards Henk Mol\nroldan\n9/22/2010 3:42 AM EDT\nAs a customer, I can understand the comparison between HEV and diesel cars. As an engineer, I don't. Diesel cars are competing with gasoline or fuel cells. They are a way to store energy. HEV are not storing energy, but are providing a way to transform chemical energy into mechanical motion. They are competing with the standard mechanical powertrain.\nWhat about an HEV powered by a diesel engine?\nhenkmol\n9/22/2010 6:00 AM EDT\nWell that is what PSA in france is going to do later. Use a diesel + electric to recuperate the brake energy. At present the HEVs is mainly used by major auto oems to get the fleet averge CO2 emission into the legally prescribed level. Read well, the fleet average. So you start by cleaning up your prestigious models that people want to buy because it confirms the status they want to display... Why would you buy a gas guzzling large car or SUV? Its just Human to do so! It is beatifull, mighty, rich in its expression of your status and an expression of your wealth and social position. Look at the LX400H series hybrid SUVs - drive a large heavy car and yet have a CO2 performance of a middle size car.\n"}, {"score": 1526.2565, "uuid": "639ca3c3-72ea-53be-b583-bdcaaacc92d2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1501wb-77-23344", "target_hostname": "www.businessfleet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.businessfleet.com/Article/Story/2010/07/Gas-Hybrid-and-Diesel-A-Lifecycle-Cost-Analysis.aspx", "page_rank": 1.2216165e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "Gas, <em>Hybrid</em> and <em>Diesel</em>: <em>A</em> Lifecycle Cost Analysis - Business Fleet \u2013 List", "snippet": "Access our career coaching services Most fleets want to be <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em>, but are often hamstrung by fiscal constraints when procuring greener vehicles.

These were made mainly from vegetable oils, starch and sugar.\nMore recently \u201csecond-generation\u201d biofuels are being produced using \u201cbiomass to liquid\u201d technology, including biomethanol, biohydrogen, HTU diesel and Fischer-Tropsch diesel.\nEarly users of bio-ethanol have included Nickolaus Otto (for combustion engines he built in the 1860s) and Henry Ford (originally for his famous Model T car in the early 1900s).\nIn the 1890s Rudolf Diesel conceived his diesel engine to run on peanut oil.\n3.2.2 Biodiesel\nBiodiesel can be produced from any fat or oil using a process called \u201ctransesterification\u201d.\nVegetable oil could be used in older indirect injection system diesel engines when operated in hotter climates.\nNowadays vegetable oil has to be processed into\u00a0 biodiesel before it can be used in a modern diesel engine.\nIt is the most commonly used biofuel in Europe.\nIt is currently mainly manufactured from vegetable oils and has an energy content that is about 10% lower than that of petroleum diesel.\nEN 14214 is the common international standard for biodiesel. A \"B\" factor is used to indicate the level of biodiesel in a fuel mixture. B40 indicating the fuel contains 40% biodiesel, etc.\nBiodiesel can be used as B100 or blended with petroleum diesel in most modern diesel engines.\nIn 2006 Soybean and rapeseed oils accounted for about 90% of all biodiesel.\nOther sources include, but are not limited to, sunflower, mustard, canola, palm oil, hemp, algae and jatropha.\n3.2.3 Ethanol\nEthanol is ethyl alcohol and it is the world\u2019s most commonly used biofuel. Bio-ethanol is typically produced from crops such as sugar cane/beet, wheat and corn.\nNote: Ethanol can also be produced from other sources, such as petroleum and coal.\nIn 2007 countries with bio-ethanol programmes include Brazil, China, Columbia, Sweden and the USA.\nSubject to the suitability of the engine it can be used as an alternative to, or blended with, unleaded petrol. An \u201cE\u201d number is used to indicate the petrol to ethanol ratio.\nE85, for example, representing a mixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent petrol.\nEthanol, with water content of not more than 1%, can be blended with petrol in varying ratios.\nE10, sometimes called gasohol, can be used in the engines of most modern cars.\nIn February 2006 E20 became the standard ethanol-petrol mixture sold in Brazil.\nIn 2007 Brazil was the world\u2019s largest producer of ethanol, which it derives from sugar cane.\nCars can be made to run on E100 but problems have been\u00a0 encountered starting the engine when the temperature is below 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).\nEthanol contains about 27% less energy than petrol (84,000 BTUs per US gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).\nCars running on ethanol currently use more fuel per mile than those running on petrol. Differences of up to 15% have been reported. Check this % .\nFuel economy is expected to improve significantly as higher compression engines designed to run only on E100 become available.\n3.2.4 Butanol\nButanol is an alcohol fuel and can be produced from the same crops as ethanol; mainly sugar cane/beet, wheat and corn. It can also be produced from fossil fuels.\nButanol contains about 4.3% less energy than petrol (110,000 BTUs per US gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).\nIt is less corrosive than ethanol.\nIn 2006 no production vehicles were known to be approved for use with 100% butanol. Information on butanol-petrol blends/ratios, level of production, usage, etc. required.\n3.2.5 Methanol\nMethanol is methyl alcohol. It is frequently referred to as wood alcohol.\nIt is currently (2007) more cost effective to derive methanol from the natural gas methane.\nIt can also be produced from light petroleum products and coal.\nWhen produced from a biomass it is called biomethanol.\nMethanol is much less flammable than petrol and this has limited its use as fuel for internal combustion engines.\nMethanol contains about 45% less energy than petrol (63,000 BTUs per US gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).\nMethanol has been used as a fuel for fuel cells. See Green Cars, Section 8.7 .\nMethanol is corrosive to certain metals, including aluminium.\nPure methanol has been used in certain racing cars since the 1960s, including the American Indianapolis 500 event up to the end of the 2005 season. It has also been used in drag racers.\n3.2.6 Yield of Oil from Crops\nNote: All figures are in US gallons per acre (4,840 square yards or about 4,050 square metres).\nCorn (18), Soybean (48), Peanuts (113), Rapeseed (127), Jatropha (202), Oil Palm (635) and Algae (10,000).\nAlgae, which has a natural oil content of more than 50%, produces over 200 times more oil per acre than soybeans.\nOne report indicated that if America relied soley upon soybean to provide all it\u2019s current transportation and heating needs, the crop would occupy an area equal to twice the size of the country.\n\u00a9 copyright - form and function\n"}, {"score": 1420.2825, "uuid": "3d739cb3-89f5-5a5b-a126-68c2cb749752", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0409wb-78-20114", "target_hostname": "www.dailypost.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/special-features/2011/10/27/why-have-environmentally-friendly-vehicles-become-popular-55578-29673554/", "page_rank": 1.1781989e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Why Have <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> Vehicles Become Popular?", "snippet": "<em>Hybrid</em> cars combine <em>a</em> traditional combustion engine with an electric motor to offer drivers <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em> cars with high levels of performance.", "explanation": null, "document": "Why Have Environmentally Friendly Vehicles Become Popular?\nAdvertisement Feature\nLow emission cars\nFor many people, environmentally friendly vehicles are the desired product when it comes to upgrading their car. With there being a constant public focus on the environment and the ways in which our lifestyles affect it, more and more people are beginning to turn to environmentally friendly vehicles. So why are these vehicles becoming some popular? And what benefits do they offer to motorists?\nEnvironmentally friendly vehicles have become popular due to the shift in public attitude over the environment. Nowadays consumers are far more conscientious over how their actions and lifestyles affect the environment and there is a genuine desire for people to protect the planet. With climate change and global warming becoming common terms within our vocabulary people are beginning to embrace eco cars in an attempt to combat these harmful effects.\nWhat is an Eco Car?\nAn eco car is typically a vehicle which offers more environmental benefits that a traditional vehicle. This will mean that it will be a vehicle with improved fuel efficiency and lower carbon dioxide emissions. Low emission cars are available in a number of formats and not all of them will use alternative energy sources. Instead, some will use traditional engines in a more efficient way and may even combine them with modern power sources in order to reduce their harmful effects.\nWhat Types of Eco Car Are Available?\nAs stated, low emission cars can take a variety of different forms. In terms of new designs there are three types of car which offer environmental benefits: electric cars, hybrid cars and alternative fuel cars. Electric cars are vehicles which are run purely from an electric motor. They have to be charged at designated stations in the same way traditional vehicles are filled up with fuel. Hybrid cars combine a traditional combustion engine with an electric motor to offer drivers environmentally friendly cars with high levels of performance. The car is powered by the conventional combustion engine with excess energy being captured and used to charge the battery which powers the electric motor. Alternative fuel cars use gases, such as Hydrogen, as their power source\nWhy Are Eco Cars Popular?\nThere are a number of reasons why eco cars are popular, the first of which is the environmental benefits which they offer. Eco cars have lower carbon dioxide emissions than traditional vehicles and therefore help to reduce an individual\u2019s carbon footprint. This reduces the effects of climate change and global warming whilst also helping to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air.\nAlong with this low emission cars and other forms of eco vehicle can offer people a number of financial benefits. Lower fuel consumptions mean that people are spending less on petrol and diesel. Along with this eco cars typically have a lower road tax charge than conventional vehicles and may even be exempt from it altogether. This means that drivers are able to go green whilst saving money \u2013 making these vehicles incredibly popular.\nShare\n"}], [{"score": 1410.2069, "uuid": "0264a228-5103-5c4f-8e77-e5e59304d1ce", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700wb-26-35564", "target_hostname": "www.roadandtravel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.roadandtravel.com/awards/2008/earthangel/earth-angel-award.htm", "page_rank": 1.1970887e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "General Motors Wins 2008 EARTH ANGEL Award : Celebrating <em>Environmentally</em>-<em>friendly</em>", "snippet": "Learn <em>more</em> about the <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em> initiatives of the EARTH ANGEL Award automaker nominees.

As the story opposite explains, the measures mean greener drivers will pay much lower road tax charges.\nAlthough almost no-one will escape the duty altogether - despite the Chancellor's claims in his Budget speech on Wednesday - the new rates of duty do give drivers genuine financial incentives to move to greener cars. Nor was the Budget announcement an isolated measure, with ministers increasingly keen to persuade drivers to act more responsibly.\nOn Monday, the Department of Transport announced that a new one-mile car-share lane will open next year at a West Yorkshire junction. It will allow cars carrying more than one person priority entry from the M606 southbound on to the eastbound M62, apparently cutting rush-hour journeys by an average of eight minutes.\nAs a happy by-product, car sharing lanes should ensure there are fewer cars on the road overall, and reduce the costs of motorists who share.\nRising fuel prices have already encouraged many drivers to become more environmentally-friendly, with a third (11.5 million) of British motorists cutting back on road journeys over the last 12 months.\nSome use their cars only for essential journeys while others have increased their use of public transport, research by the insurer More Than suggests. In fact there are all sorts of ways you can cut your motoring costs while being greener.\nMAKE SOME CAR BUDDIES\nYou could save up to \u00a31,000 on transport costs every year by car or liftsharing, according to the organisation Liftshare.\nVery simply, this involves two or more people sharing a car and travelling together. Typically the party will consist of the vehicle's owner with others usually contributing towards the cost of fuel.\nUsing up what would ordinarily be free seats in cars can prove a simple way of cutting the cost of driving and reducing congestion and pollution.\nLiftsharing can happen informally, where friends, family or neighbours take turns to give each other lifts, or more formally through the increasing number of council run schemes or through online services such as www.liftshare.co.uk .\nOn this site, users register regular or one-off journeys they are about to take and are put in contact with other travellers who are going their way.\nDrivers are not permitted to make a profit from providing a lift, but a contribution from passengers can include an appropriate amount towards wear and tear. \"Fares\" must be decided in advance, and the driver is not permitted to act as a taxi, picking up strangers along the route.\nCAR CLUBS\nIf you drive less than 6,000 miles in a year, joining a car club could save you between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500 a year, according to the organisation Carplus. Car clubs are typically run by local councils or private businesses and allow the short-term hire of cars, freeing members up from car maintenance and tax costs.\nThis \"pay-as-you-go\" approach to driving also reduces the amount of unnecessary car journeys, helping to combat pollution and congestion.\nDrivers can expect to pay a joining fee of up to \u00a340, a deposit of around \u00a3100, hourly charges of up to around \u00a34.50. In addition, there's a fuel charge per mile of up to around 18p. Typically, once you are a member of a club, you simply book the time you need, enter a pin to access the car and then drive off.\nAt www.carplus.org.uk you can track down car clubs in your area or check out the guidance it offers on starting your own informal car club.\nCity Car Club (08453 301 234 www.citycarclub.co.uk ) has cars stationed in reserved parking bays in locations nationwide including Edinburgh, London, Bath, Bristol, Brighton & Hove, Litchfield, Huddersfield, Poole and Portsmouth.\nGO ELECTRIC\nWhile electric cars can sometimes cost \u00a35,500 more than conventional vehicles, according to the Energy Saving Trust ( www.est.org.uk 020 7222 0101), they can cost as little as 1p a mile to run.\nIn addition, electric cars are not subject to road tax and, as an added bonus for London drivers, enjoy 100 per cent congestion charge discount. Drivers living in areas where residential parking demands paying for a permit might also find that they get a discount on this cost.\nElectric cars use a battery and electric motor to power the vehicle meaning they have no emissions at the point of use.\nDue to the capacity of the battery, their range is limited to about 60 miles or less between recharges, making them best suited for city-based users.\nElectric vehicles can be recharged by plugging them into an existing electrical socket and some city councils are installing electric recharging points in car parks or on-street.\nThe G-Wiz model ( www.goinggreen.co.uk ) claims to consume just one quarter of the energy of a similar sized petrol car. The makers say it costs around \u00a31.64 a day to run, equivalent to around 600 miles per gallon. The list price is \u00a38,299, but it is currently on offer at \u00a37,799 and orders for cars placed by 31 March come with free leather seats worth \u00a3499.\nHYBRID CARS\nHybrid vehicles, such as the Toyota Prius, Honda Insight and Honda Civic IMA, run on a combination of a petrol engine and an electric motor powered by an energy storage device such as a battery pack.\nAll hybrids use regenerative braking, which means that energy is put back into the battery when braking. This improves energy efficiency and also reduces brake wear.\nHybrid technologies improve fuel efficiency and therefore provide considerable fuel savings compared with a normal petrol vehicle. While models might cost between \u00a31,000-\u00a33,000 more than conventional cars, running costs are two thirds that of equivalent petrol fuelled vehicles, according to the Energy Saving Trust.\nHybrids also benefit from reduced vehicle excise duty and do even better after the Budget. In addition they are exempted from the London congestion charge.\nCHOOSE LESS POLLUTING STANDARD CARDS\nThe Vehicle Certification Agency guide ( www.vcacarfueldata.org.uk ) provides information on the fuel economy and emissions performance of all new cars on the market in the UK.\nThe guide indicates there can be significant differences (up to 45 per cent) in the fuel economy of different models using the same fuel within the same size range and that by choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicles you could save \u00a3900 per year assuming your vehicle is doing 20,000 miles a year.\nUsing Government data, Friends of the Earth ( www.foe.co.uk ) calculated the cost of fuel needed to drive a car 12,000 miles a year and found that for drivers wanting a smaller car, buying a Citroen C2 rather than a Ford Fiesta could result in a fuel cost saving of up to \u00a3460 a year.\nAlternatively, drivers looking for a family car could go for a Toyota Prius, rather than a Ford Mondeo and pick up fuel cost savings of about \u00a3630 a year. Even those unpopular 4x4 drivers have a choice, because by opting for a Toyota RAV 4 instead of a Land Rover Discovery generates fuel cost savings of around \u00a31,500 a year, or \u00a3120 a month, suggest the Friends of the Earth findings.\nAlso bear in mind that the company car tax system is skewed to reward drivers of fuel efficient vehicles.\nCHANGE THE WAY YOU USE YOUR CAR\nYou could begin to save money and help cut your carbon emissions by getting into some good fuel-saving ways suggested by the Vehicle Certification Agency.\nThese ideas include avoiding using your car for short journeys and using public transport, bicycles or taking a walk as often as you can. Also, get into the habit of driving off as soon as possible after starting your engine rather than leave it ticking over. Driving smoothly helps too, as harsh acceleration and heavy braking have a significant effect on fuel consumption and driving more smoothly saves fuel.\nDriving at high speeds significantly increases fuel consumption so think about slowing down. Observing speed limits on motorways, for example, will save fuel.\nAlso, avoiding carrying unnecessary weight by removing roof racks when you don't need them and ensuring tyres are inflated to the correct pressure for the vehicle will cut the amount of fuel you use, as will only using the air-conditioning sparingly.\nBudget promises zero tax for eco-friendly drivers\nThe much-trailed suggestion that the Chancellor would hit drivers of 4x4 \"utility\" vehicles (the so-called \"Chelsea tractors\") came true this week. Mr Brown has targeted vehicles that belch out more than 225g of carbon dioxide per kilometre with a new higher rate of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) of \u00a3210 a year.\nMeanwhile, VED on the lowest-emission vehicles is now zero. But since electric cars are already exempt, no new cars will actually qualify for the zero rating, as the carbon emissions required (less than 100g per kilometre) has been set so low.\nThe best-known ecofriendly car, the Toyota Prius (right), has emissions of 104g a kilometre, which puts it into the second-lowest VED band, with a duty of \u00a340. It is joined by petrol-driven cars such as the Peugeot 107, the Toyota Aygo, the Smart city coup\u00e9, Daihatsu's Charade and Sirion and the Vauxhall Corsa.\nSome small-engine diesel models also qualify for the \u00a340 band. They include the Citro\u00ebn C2 and C3, the Renault Clio, the Peugeot 206, the Fiat Panda, the Ford Fiesta, the Vauxhall Corsa, the Peugeot 1007 and the Smart forfour.\nAt the other end of the scale, VED goes up in bands as emissions increase. The top rate will hit cars such as the Range Rover.\n'I saved a load of money sharing'\n\"I found a way to save money immediately, as well as benefit the environment, with no outlay at all,\" says Rhydian Lewis, a 30-year-old network engineer and enthusiastic lift-sharer from Chepstow.\nNot long after registering on Liftshare.co.uk he received an e-mail requesting a lift-share. \"As it turned out, the chap who had got in touch sat about 30 metres away from me in the office and lived up the road from me in Cwmbran,\" Rhydian explains.\n\"We started to share the drive, and then a couple of other guys from Wales noticed us sharing and joined in. That saved me a load of money.\"\nRecently, Rydian went freelance and often works from home, but he estimates a total of five years lift-sharing saved him around \u00a34,500, both through reduced fuel costs and toll savings on the Severn Bridge.\n\"The environmental benefit has been massive, too,\" he adds. \"That may not have been my immediate priority but it's a great side effect.\"\nThe Toyota Prius: a hybrid car\nWednesday's Budget piled the pressure on motorists to become greener, with higher duty to pay on the most polluting new cars.

Because we figure that if we lay out the pros and cons of the two main alternatives \u2014 gasoline-electric hybrids and clean diesels \u2014 you\u2019re smart enough to reach your own conclusions. Of course, we\u2019re also pretty confident Volkswagen\u2019s TDI clean diesel models will look pretty good by comparison.\nThat understandable bias aside, let\u2019s take a closer look at these two popular car choices:\nGasoline-Electric Hybrids\nThe first thing you should know about hybrid vehicles, which combine a traditional gasoline engine with a battery pack and one or more electric motors, is that they\u2019re not all created equal.\nGenerally speaking, there are two types: Mild hybrids like the Honda Civic Hybrid use their electric motors mainly to boost the performance of their smallish gasoline engine, which means they typically get better mileage on the highway than they do around town. Full hybrids like the Toyota Prius, on the other hand, can operate on battery power alone for short distances, making them more fuel-efficient in stop-and-go traffic than they are on the highway. While several hybrid models place highly on the EPA\u2019s list of the greenest vehicles on the road, there are several issues you should be aware of:\nNo one expects a hybrid to be all that exciting to drive, but be aware that most also have small quirks\u2014like a surging feeling when you step on the brake pedal\u2014that owners say takes some getting used to.\nDon\u2019t be fooled into thinking that a \u201cHybrid\u201d badge automatically means a particular model is the best choice for the environment. In fact, there are a number of new non-hybrid models on the road that are actually more fuel-efficient and/or less-polluting than some hybrids.\nThe greater complexity of hybrid powertrains means there\u2019s more that can go wrong. This includes replacing the vehicle\u2019s large, expensive battery pack at the end of its useful life.\nCheck to see if the federal government\u2019s Alternative Motor Vehicle tax credit is still available on the hybrid you\u2019re considering. Many of the most popular models no longer qualify.\nTDI Clean Diesel\nWhen it comes right down to it, Volkswagen\u2019s new generation of turbocharged \u201cclean diesel\u201d models combine impressive fuel economy* with the simplicity and durability of diesel engines. In addition, the TDI engines in both the Jetta sedan , SportWagen and the Touareg SUV are certified to meet the same tough government emission standards\u2014known as \u201cTier 2 Bin 5\u201d\u2014as the cleanest gasoline-electric hybrids.\nFinally, the abundant low-end torque TDI engines\u2014combined with Volkswagen\u2019s sporty European handling\u2014make Volkswagen\u2019s three clean diesel models hands-down winners in the fun-to-drive department. Other factors to consider:\nBecause of their sturdier construction, it\u2019s not uncommon for diesel engines to still be going strong after 250,000 miles with little more than regular maintenance (which is now complementary on all VW models for the first 36 months or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first**).\nWith a 14.5-gallon fuel tank and EPA estimates of 41 mpg on the highway*, the Jetta TDI can go nearly 600 miles on a single fill-up. Of course, this also depends on your driving style and the type of roads you travel.\nWhile gasoline and diesel prices fluctuate, TDI models\u2019 fuel economy numbers mean you\u2019re still likely to end up spending less at the pump compared to some hybrids.\nAll three Volkswagen TDI models are still eligible for the federal government\u2019s Advanced Lean Burn Technology Motor Vehicle tax credits of up to $1,300, depending on the model you purchase.***\n*Jetta TDI EPA estimates 30 mpg city / 41 mpg highway. Your mileage will vary.\n**The Volkswagen Carefree Maintenance Program covers the vehicle\u2019s 10K, 20K and 30K scheduled maintenance intervals except for the Volkswagen Routan. The Routan Carefree Maintenance Program covers the vehicle\u2019s 6K, 12K, 18K, 24K, 30K and 36K scheduled maintenance intervals. Coverage is during the term of the new vehicle limited warranty, at no additional charge. The program covers 3 years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. See dealer or vehicle maintenance program booklet for details. Does not include routine wear and tear on parts such as brakes, tires, wiper blades, light bulbs, etc.\n***Tax credit submitted under Notice 2006-9 and Internal Revenue Cod, Section 30B relative to the 2009 Volkswagen Jetta 2.0L TDI Sedan and SportWagen and Touareg 2 TDI. Available to taxpayers who purchased a qualified vehicle on or before December 31, 2010. Leased vehicles are not eligible for the tax credit. Only a limited number of full tax credits are available.

Keep these considerations in mind:\nHybrid or conventional gas engine?\nThere are many choices of hybrid vehicles on the road today, but there are also cars powered by conventional gas engines that offer amazing fuel economy, super-low emissions and are a blast to drive, too.\nUnderstand the math\nA hybrid vehicle is often more expensive than a conventionally powered car, so don\u2019t buy one for the fuel savings. It will take years to recoup your investment. Instead, buy it because you\u2019re committed to burning less fuel on your daily commute.\nResearch your charging options\nPlug-in electric vehicles are great, provided there are charging stations available. If you work within 35 miles of where you live, you can probably get away with charging overnight at home, but if you work further than that, you\u2019ll need to investigate what charging stations are available.\nClean diesel power\nForget the days when diesel engines were dirty, smelly slowpokes clogging up highway. Modern diesel engines are clean, efficient, affordable and powerful.\nTax credits\nCurrently, the federal government does not offer a tax credit for clean diesel or hybrid-powered vehicles. Plug-in hybrid and fully electric cars are eligible for a federal tax credit up to $7,500. And keep in mind that it\u2019s a tax credit not a rebate at the time of sale. Also, check for any tax credit offered by the state in which you plan to register your car.\nVisit with us today to learn more about the environmentally friendly vehicles we have to offer.\nSchedule a Test Drive\n"}, {"score": 1309.4943, "uuid": "57e723ce-cc94-5b4a-afd9-4450e02d6040", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100wb-82-14141", "target_hostname": "www.carhistory4u.com", "target_uri": "http://www.carhistory4u.com/green-cars/alternative-fuels", "page_rank": 1.9673259e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "Car History 4U - <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> &#x2F; Green Alternative Fuels", "snippet": "o The description \u201cAlternative fuels\u201d used in this section refers to sources of energy, other than petrol and standard <em>diesel</em>, that can be utilised to power <em>a</em> vehicle and <em>which</em> are derived from renewable <em>or</em> sustainable sources. o Alternative fuels that can be used to power <em>a</em> vehice fall into three main", "explanation": null, "document": "The motor car - a concise history.\n\"a reminder for some, an introduction for others\"\nEnvironmentally Friendly / Green Alternative Fuels\n3.1 Introduction\nThe description \u201cAlternative fuels\u201d used in this section refers to sources of energy, other than petrol and standard diesel, that can be utilised to power a vehicle and which are derived from renewable or sustainable sources.\nAlternative fuels that can be used to power a vehice fall into three main catagories: Biofuels,\u00a0Hydrogen and Natural Gas.\nNote: No fuel other than that recommended by the manufacturer should be used in a vehicle.\nTo explore this subject in greater depth please see Green Cars, Section 10 (Green Web Site Links) .\n3.2 Biofuels\n3.2.1 Introduction\nA biofuel is a gas, solid or liquid fuel that has been produced from a recently living organism or its metabolic by-product.\nBiofuels used in vehicles are usually in either a liquid or gas form.\nSources of biofuels include sugar cane/beet, a range of vegetable oils, algae, animal fats and sewage.\nThe two main \u201cfirst-generation\u201d biofuels have been bio-ethanol and bio-diesel. These were made mainly from vegetable oils, starch and sugar.\nMore recently \u201csecond-generation\u201d biofuels are being produced using \u201cbiomass to liquid\u201d technology, including biomethanol, biohydrogen, HTU diesel and Fischer-Tropsch diesel.\nEarly users of bio-ethanol have included Nickolaus Otto (for combustion engines he built in the 1860s) and Henry Ford (originally for his famous Model T car in the early 1900s).\nIn the 1890s Rudolf Diesel conceived his diesel engine to run on peanut oil.\n3.2.2 Biodiesel\nBiodiesel can be produced from any fat or oil using a process called \u201ctransesterification\u201d.\nVegetable oil could be used in older indirect injection system diesel engines when operated in hotter climates.\nNowadays vegetable oil has to be processed into\u00a0 biodiesel before it can be used in a modern diesel engine.\nIt is the most commonly used biofuel in Europe.\nIt is currently mainly manufactured from vegetable oils and has an energy content that is about 10% lower than that of petroleum diesel.\nEN 14214 is the common international standard for biodiesel. A \"B\" factor is used to indicate the level of biodiesel in a fuel mixture. B40 indicating the fuel contains 40% biodiesel, etc.\nBiodiesel can be used as B100 or blended with petroleum diesel in most modern diesel engines.\nIn 2006 Soybean and rapeseed oils accounted for about 90% of all biodiesel.\nOther sources include, but are not limited to, sunflower, mustard, canola, palm oil, hemp, algae and jatropha.\n3.2.3 Ethanol\nEthanol is ethyl alcohol and it is the world\u2019s most commonly used biofuel. Bio-ethanol is typically produced from crops such as sugar cane/beet, wheat and corn.\nNote: Ethanol can also be produced from other sources, such as petroleum and coal.\nIn 2007 countries with bio-ethanol programmes include Brazil, China, Columbia, Sweden and the USA.\nSubject to the suitability of the engine it can be used as an alternative to, or blended with, unleaded petrol. An \u201cE\u201d number is used to indicate the petrol to ethanol ratio.\nE85, for example, representing a mixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent petrol.\nEthanol, with water content of not more than 1%, can be blended with petrol in varying ratios.\nE10, sometimes called gasohol, can be used in the engines of most modern cars.\nIn February 2006 E20 became the standard ethanol-petrol mixture sold in Brazil.\nIn 2007 Brazil was the world\u2019s largest producer of ethanol, which it derives from sugar cane.\nCars can be made to run on E100 but problems have been\u00a0 encountered starting the engine when the temperature is below 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).\nEthanol contains about 27% less energy than petrol (84,000 BTUs per US gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).\nCars running on ethanol currently use more fuel per mile than those running on petrol. Differences of up to 15% have been reported. Check this % .\nFuel economy is expected to improve significantly as higher compression engines designed to run only on E100 become available.\n3.2.4 Butanol\nButanol is an alcohol fuel and can be produced from the same crops as ethanol; mainly sugar cane/beet, wheat and corn. It can also be produced from fossil fuels.\nButanol contains about 4.3% less energy than petrol (110,000 BTUs per US gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).\nIt is less corrosive than ethanol.\nIn 2006 no production vehicles were known to be approved for use with 100% butanol. Information on butanol-petrol blends/ratios, level of production, usage, etc. required.\n3.2.5 Methanol\nMethanol is methyl alcohol. It is frequently referred to as wood alcohol.\nIt is currently (2007) more cost effective to derive methanol from the natural gas methane.\nIt can also be produced from light petroleum products and coal.\nWhen produced from a biomass it is called biomethanol.\nMethanol is much less flammable than petrol and this has limited its use as fuel for internal combustion engines.\nMethanol contains about 45% less energy than petrol (63,000 BTUs per US gallon compared to 115,000 BTUs for petrol).\nMethanol has been used as a fuel for fuel cells. See Green Cars, Section 8.7 .\nMethanol is corrosive to certain metals, including aluminium.\nPure methanol has been used in certain racing cars since the 1960s, including the American Indianapolis 500 event up to the end of the 2005 season. It has also been used in drag racers.\n3.2.6 Yield of Oil from Crops\nNote: All figures are in US gallons per acre (4,840 square yards or about 4,050 square metres).\nCorn (18), Soybean (48), Peanuts (113), Rapeseed (127), Jatropha (202), Oil Palm (635) and Algae (10,000).\nAlgae, which has a natural oil content of more than 50%, produces over 200 times more oil per acre than soybeans.\nOne report indicated that if America relied soley upon soybean to provide all it\u2019s current transportation and heating needs, the crop would occupy an area equal to twice the size of the country.\n3.3 Hydrogen\n3.3.1 Vehicle Fuel\nHydrogen, typically stored as a liquid and used as a gas, can be used as a fuel in:\nA slightly modified version of the petrol powered internal combustion engine.\nA fuel cell.\n3.3.2 Hydrogen Data\nHydrogen (H2) is the most abundant element in the universe. It is designated \u201catomic number 1\u201d.\nAt normal atmospheric temperatures and pressures hydrogen is a flammable gas.\nIt is a solid between absolute zero of minus 273.16 degrees C and its melting point of minus 259.34 degrees C, when it becomes a liquid.\nIt remains a liquid in the small band of 6.47 degrees C, until it rises to its boiling point of minus 252.87 degrees C. Note: Water has a boiling point of plus 100 degrees C.\nIt is usually stored as a liquid because when it is converted to gas, hydrogen expands and takes up about 840 times more space.\nIt is the lightest of the gases. About one-fifteenth the weight of air.\n3.3.3 Hydrogen Production\nOn our planet hydrogen exists mainly as part of other compounds and has to be extracted from them; such as water, fossil fuels, natural gas and\u00a0 coal. It is therefore a manufactured fuel.\nIn 2006 extracting hydrogen consumed about 60% more energy than the resulting hydrogen provided.\nTwo of the most common ways of producing hydrogen are by steam reforming and electrolysis.\nSteam reforming, mainly from natural gas, is currently the most cost effective and hence the most popular method.\nElectrolysis, which extracts hydrogen from water, is currently a much more expensive process.\nFor every one litre of petrol about four times the amount of liquid hydrogen is required to obtain the same amount of energy.\nTo store liquid hydrogen at between minus 259.34\u00a0 and minus 252.87 degrees C it must be kept in a pressurised and thermally insulated container.\nDue to the very low temperatures involved liquid hydrogen will slowly evaporate from its container.\n3.3.4 Cars Using Hydrogen\nFor cars using hydrogen powered fuel cells see Green Cars, Section 8 .\nBMW: BMW\u2019s Hydrogen 7 car has an internal combustion engine that can run on petrol or hydrogen. When was it first produced?\nThe car was powered by a 350 hp (260 kW) 12-cylinder engine.\nMazda: In 2004 Mazda introduced the RX-4 Hydrogen RE, rotary engined, concept car. It was designed to run on petrol or hydrogen.\nThe car has a maximum range of 341 miles (546 km) when running on petrol or 62 miles (99 km) when running on hydrogen.\nIn March 2006 Mazda started to deliver these cars to customers.\n3.4 LPG & CNG\nLiquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

Check 'em out!\nHow come nobody sells a hybrid diesel car?\nFor those of you familiar only with the sooty smoke belching from older big-rig trucks or the foul smells from 1970s diesel cars, the question may come as a surprise. But modern diesel engine design coupled with the much-cleaner types of diesel fuel increasingly available (particularly \"biodiesel\") make diesel vehicles a surprisingly environmentally-friendly choice. Diesel-hybrid-electrics would be an obvious positive development. So why don't we see them?\nI suppose the answer varies depending upon where you are. In the US, the diesel fuel available in most locations remains the old, dirty, high-sulfur variety, so a hybrid diesel actually wouldn't be a significant improvement in emissions; once low-sulfur regulations take effect in 2006, this may change. In Europe, where advanced-technology \"clean\" diesel autos are one-third to one-half of the auto market and growing, some diesel cars already get mileage roughly equivalent to hybrids, so I suspect there's simply less demand.\nThe irony is that diesel hybrids could be far more efficient and clean than anything now on the market, without any leaps in technology. The combination of modern clean diesel engines , Prius-style serial hybrid-electric systems , and biodiesel /vegetable oil fuels could provide amazing mileage, cleaner air, and vastly reduced petroleum dependency. Comfortable, powerful sedans could get upwards of 80 miles per gallon and be carbon-neutral.\n(More in the extended entry...)\nIt's certainly not that diesel hybrids are somehow impossible. Diesel-electric hybrid buses are available and have been rolled out in (among other places) Seattle, Washington and Apeldoorn , in the Netherlands. As for autos, Ford, GM, and Daimler-Chrysler each built prototype diesel hybrids a few years ago which got mileage in the 70-80 mpg range. But the automakers opted not to produce them, as the cars couldn't meet strict air pollution rules while running on the sulfur-laden American diesel.\nCombining the power of diesel engines with the efficiency of hybrid technologies can have terrific payoffs. Last year, MIT's Laboratory for Energy and the Environment produced a study (PDF) comparing total lifecycle energy efficiency and greenhouse emissions (including use, production, fuel production, and eventual disposal) of idealized advanced internal combustion, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. Diesel hybrids turned out to be much better than gasoline/gasoline-hybrid cars, and highly competitive with the best hydrogen fuel cell systems (even assuming optimistic fuel cell vehicle development). But the best hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will require entirely new hydrogen production, storage, and fueling facilities; reformed-gasoline fuel cells (which are more likely to be used, as they would not require the wholesale replacement of fueling stations) fared much worse.\nIt's particularly notable that the results in the MIT study were based on the assumption that the diesel fuel would be petroleum-based. One of the compelling aspects of diesel engines is their ability to run on biodiesel , a fuel which does not actually contain any petroleum. Biodiesel is synthesized entirely from plants -- usually soy in the US, and canola/rapeseed in Europe -- and is therefore carbon-neutral: the soy/canola grown to create biodiesel pulls from the air the same amount of carbon the eventual combustion produces. Biodiesel is available both straight or in mixes with regular -- and, up until recently, somewhat less expensive -- oil-based diesel. These fuels are referred to by the percentage of biodiesel in the mix, from B5 (five percent bio) all the way to B100 (straight biodiesel); B20 is a relatively common mix. A variety of companies supply biodiesel around the world; adventurous types can even make biodiesel at home , using vegetable oil.\n(Vegetable oil can be used to run diesel engines directly, although doing so can be somewhat risky. SVO, or \"straight vegetable oil,\" can gum up the engine at lower temperatures, so there are SVO-conversion kits available for diesel vehicles which use a small amount of regular diesel or biodiesel to warm up the engine first. This is one way that hybrid technology could really show its strengths: a hybrid-SVO could warm up the SVO with an electric heater while running on batteries at lower speeds, much like the current Prius does. Such a system could easily use regular diesel and biodiesel, as well.)\nEuropean automakers are testing the water to see if American buyers, long ago turned off by earlier diesel technology, would be willing to give diesels another chance. The carmakers may want to wait for a couple of years; the 2006 change-over to clean diesel will make diesel vehicles much more attractive. The manufacturers should take advantage of the wait to license the Toyota hybrid system (as Ford did earlier this year ) and integrate it with their advanced clean diesel engines. Stylish sedans coupling the power of a diesel engine with extreme fuel efficiency better than anything coming out of Japan -- dealers wouldn't be able to keep them in stock.\nI love this idea. In the forums I've seen online, diesel enthusiasts and hybrid enthusiasts seem to always be at odds. There's no reason why we should be. A diesel hybrid would resolve that divide.\nPosted by: Jennifer on 3 Jun 04\nWhen I hear the word \"diesel\", I automatically think carcinogenic and mutagenic particulates in the exhaust. Which is why I hate being stuck behind a diesel vehicle, be it a truck, bus, or Mercedes 300D.\nI admit I'm completely ignorant of biodiesel and so-called \"clean diesel\". What kinds of carcinogens and mutagens are present in these forms of diesel? What studies have been made to show either a total lack or dramatic reduction in both? (I would assume that \"clean\" means non-cancer causing, but maybe I'm wrong there too.)\nWhen I hear biodiesel I think, argibusiness looking for new markets.\nHow can I learn more?\nPosted by: Brian Dear on 3 Jun 04\nBrian,\nClean road diesel (also known as ultra low sulfur diesel) is limited to particulate density of 30ppm, less than 10% of particulate density of standard road diesel; future efforts can bring that down to 15ppm. The EPA has more info on clean diesel. Studies by the Australian government show a significant reduction in harmful emissions with ULSD. The DieselNet site has more info, but some of it is only available to paid subscribers. It has good links to material from other sources, though.\nThe production of biodiesel in large enough quantities to sustain a transportation network would certainly involve agribusiness. But agribiz is not the sole catalyst for biodiesel research; as I indicated in the post, the carbon-neutral nature of biodiesel, along with the simplicity of its production, make it a much more sustainable fuel resource. Biodiesel.org has some info, but they do seem to be allied with big ag. Journey to Forever may be more to your liking.\nPosted by: Jamais Cascio on 4 Jun 04\nThe VW Lupo (a diesel) already has some elements of hybrid technology, including a continuous automatic transmission and electric motor for lower RPMs. From what I understand it gets around 80 mpg and is about the size of a mini cooper, and costs quite a bit less.\nI wish they would sell them here in the US but the quality of our diesel is too low. In 2006 this is supposed to change due to federal regulation, so at that point VW and other companies could sell these types of cars in the US.\nAs far as the drawbacks of diesel are concerned, they have been taken care of. VW double-insulates the engine cage to make sure that noise is sufficiently dampened, and their are scrubbers on the exhaust to minimize the soot. And scrubbing the exhaust is unnecessary when using the high-grade diesel fuels. Test-drive a diesel and you will see that things have changed quite a bit. VW offers three diesel models in the US right now, all of which get about 40mpg city/45 highway: Golf, New Beetle and Jetta. The diesel Jetta also comes in a wagon version. They are all really nice cars.\nPosted by: Carl Youngblood on 4 Jun 04\nDiesel engines are perfectly suited for hybrids.\nDiesels operate most effeciently when run at a\nconstant rpm and in a given temp range, both of which fit the hybrid model very well.\nFor many years diesel trains have been driven\nby a large diesel engine generating electricity to charge a battery bank turning electric motors to drive the train. It's the only way trains could get enough torque to start moving, but it is also exactly the model used by todays 2nd-gen hybrid autos. In a sense diesel locomotives were the first \"hybrids\".\nDiesel engines are much simpler than gasoline engines, will burn about anything, and use\nstandard fuels which require much less refining than gasoline, and are safer to store and transport. And that doesn't even consider biodiesel. We could drastically reduce our reliance on petroleum by going the diesel hybrid route.\nPosted by: Howard on 4 Jun 04\nFor those interested in the effeciency of diesel/electric hybrids at the locomotive scale, there is a nice simple overview at:\nI am extremely interested in diesel hybrid cars.\nPosted by: Howard on 4 Jun 04\nBio-diesel could forstall the ever depleating oil reserves said to be overwelmed by demand by 2016.

I'd like to point out that it's not only vege oil that can be used in diesel cars. As a NZer, I'm excited by my government's move toward re-using our meat industry by-product - tallow - as a fuel. Even better than growing crops to produce fuel, is using a waste product that would otherwise be of little profit for the meat industry, and be an environmental problem to dispose of. Companies like ASDA in the UK are already using chicken fat from their cooked chickens to fuel their trucks, thereby saving money and tax, and helping the environment. There is so much opportunity to improve the environment while boosting business at the same time. I hope more people will cotton on to this soon.\nPosted by: Jess Macfarlane on 7 Jun 04\nI found the article extremely stimulating.

Please explain.\nI reside in Trinidad in the Caribbean and purchased a Mitsubishi 4WD L200 4 door pickup with 2.5L normally aspirated diesel and the only way they come here is with a manual trans.\nFor the past 5+ years the engine has been operating with a fuel mix of 25% dirty sulphur laden diesel and 75% kerosene - A1 Jet fuel. The exhaust is perfectly clean. You take a gasoline engine with the best tuning and this is cleaner.\nI am interested in the bio-diesel technology because the cleaner the burn the happier I am for the enviroment. My mix requires nothing special. Kerosene may not be readily available in the US or other locations. Here, kero was cheaper than diesel but the price was raised earlier this year to make them equal at TT$1.50 per liter. The US$1.00 is valued at TTS6.30 to give a comparison or US$0.24 per liter. We drill oil and have refineries and ship the products overseas. That is our local price.\nBy the way, in all these years, nothing has had to be touched on the engine besides the replacement of the coolant pump 2 years ago. The mileage being clocked, hard miles in the boonies as well as highway, is 350,000 kilometers fairly trouble free with minimal exhaust pollution.\nFrom my addres you will realise that I am a friend of the enviroment using solar, wind and water as alternative renewable energy sources and encouraging others to do the same.\nPosted by: M.

The co-operation between municipal authorities, consultants, and industries should encourage the development, testing, and marketing of less harmful alternatives for hazardous products. The Chemical Sweep programme was a three year project aiming to study the use of dangerous chemicals in products, production, and daily use. Special campaigns were targeted at car maintenance, chemicals, and cadmium batteries. The Chemical Sweep programme can be regarded as an example for good practice for the following reasons:\npioneering the phasing out of dangerous chemicals at local level;\nstandard setting for the banning of dangerous chemicals in Sweden;\nraising the environmental awareness in the industry;\nnew product information for customers;\nnew co-operation with the cities of Stockholm and Malm\u00f6.\nConcept and aims\n49\nAt the end of the 1980s, Swedish municipalities got increased responsibilities in different environmental areas. In regard to chemical wastes, cities have the duty to control large parts of the life-cycle of chemical products. In Gothenburg, the projects of the Chemical Sweep programme had been designed to provide a testing ground for the upgrading of a comprehensive approach to environmental legislation in Sweden. To a certain degree, the success of local pioneering efforts in the specialised field of hazardous waste also help to speed up the nation-wide development. In 1993, the Swedish Government presented the Ecocycle Bill. This bill stated that more efficient resource management, and the cyclic management of materials, is essential if sustainable development should be achieved. It also stated that an Ecocycle society must be economical with resources, reduce its impact on the environment, and preserve biological diversity. After the bill was adopted by parliament without amendments, the government appointed a special expert committee, the Ecocycle Commission, with directives to propose strategies for Ecocycle principles in the goods sector. The Ecocycle Bill has the following basic objectives:\nThe flow and use of chemicals hazardous to human health and the environment should be reduced, and the flow of harmful chemicals should be stopped as far as possible;\nThe substitution principle should be promoted internationally, and Sweden should develop further applications;\nEfforts should be made to increase the knowledge about chemicals harmful to health and the environment. In principle, this work should be paid for, and carried out by industry in accordance with \u0091the polluter pays principle\u0091;\nChemical control should be carried out by international co-operation as far as possible, with Sweden as an active force in environmental protection efforts.\nAccording to a government decision of 1991, municipal responsibilities should be used to play an active role in the avoidance and handling of wastes, particularly special hazardous and toxic wastes. In the changed context of national and regional strategies for environmental protection, environmental policy activities in Gothenburg had been reviewed. It was the first time in Sweden that a city has started to tackle the problem of environmental pollution from industrial substances. Already in 1988-89, the local government carried out the Project Gothenburg (EPG), an investigation into how the environmental situation in Gothenburg could be considerably improved within the next ten years. Concerning environmental impacts of economical activities, EPG gave special attention to the issues of emissions of hazardous substances, production methods, and waste related problems. The findings of the study laid the basis for a number of actions, especially in co-operation with industry and business.\nThe philosophy of projects in the sector of ecological industry is to offer a service, rather than to prosecute companies for non-compliance with environmental legislation. The idea is to reduce, eliminate, or substitute this special group of chemicals and to identify, develop, and test less harmful alternatives in the areas of manufacturing, sales, and use. This substitution rule originates from the provision in the new Swedish Environmental Code (previously, National Act on Chemical Products), which states that handling or importing a chemical product must involve such steps and precautions as are needed to prevent or minimise harm to human beings and the environment. This includes avoiding chemical products for which less hazardous substitutes are available. In short, the local environmental authority is in a strategic position to bridge the gap between control and co-operation. The main task is to bring together know-how and competence from outside and inside the industries. Therefore, the City decided to design two innovative environmental protection programmes in the industrial sectors. The Chemical Sweep programme and the Clean Lubricants project should channel innovative expertise into the development of environmentally adapted products at industrial sectors that are particular important to safeguard the industrial base of the Gothenburg economic structure (the Clean Lubricant programme is described in detail in a separate case study).\nWith the Chemical Sweep programme, the municipality regards itself as a promoter who brings together manufacturers, dealers, and users of chemically hazardous products and encourages them to exchange the hazardous chemicals for less dangerous substances. There was a three year educational and technical assistance programme between 1990-1992. It provided information, advice, and technical assistance to facilitate a change-over to environmentally friendly products. As a result, the project on Car Wash Detergents is still running, and the updated results are distributed to interested parties.\nThe Chemical Sweep programme focused on several restricted substances (especially nonyl phenol etoxylates, 1,1,1-trichlorethane, and methyl chloride), as well as on the use of cleaning products, batteries, pesticides, cutting fluids, and diesel fuels. This allowed the project to get involved with the development of new environmentally adapted products and methods of production, and to help stimulate the marketing of these products and methods (compare results and impacts).\nImplementation\n49\nThe Chemical Sweep programme was started with an extensive publicity campaign which included a press conference, mass media statements, and printed materials such as brochures, displays, and stickers. In addition, the staff of Chemical Sweep presented the programme at a number of exhibitions and trade fairs.\nThe next step was to contact the main users of products which contained the targeted hazardous substances in order to urge them to stop using certain environmentally harmful products. This request was supported by an appeal of the municipal Environmental Protection Office. Furthermore, information on the National Act on Chemical Products and on less environmentally hazardous alternatives was provided. A copy of the information package was sent to manufacturers and importers. All in all, the mailings included manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retail distributors, trade and occupational user groups, businesses, industries, public sector organisations, and private households. This attitude survey was the first project of the Chemical Sweep programme. The majority of people demonstrated a positive attitude towards a change to environmentally friendly products, and they expressed a willingness to change their consumption. Furthermore, the survey revealed that people expect the authorities to give information and advice on all kinds of chemical products and their properties. With this background, the project makers define three major themes for the projects:\nThe use of nonyl phenol etoxylates, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methyl chloride should be stopped where possible;\nthe routine use of dangerous chemicals should be radically restricted;\nfurther know-how on the ecological effects of chemical substances should be elaborated and passed on to the public.\nIn order to limit the use of chemicals the programme had to target industries, as well as the end users. Therefore, the spectrum of projects shows a wide range in the fields of activities. The following projects had been implemented:\nA survey on products with methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane;\nA survey on different types of cleansing products containing nonyl phenol etoxylates;\nA survey on the environmental demands of car wash detergents;\nA survey on the possibilities for a changeover to less environmentally harmful types of fuels;\nA survey on the environmental damage caused by dangerous additives in cutting fluids;\nA survey on the potentials to replace nickel-cadmuim battery rechargeable cells ;\nA survey on chemicals in cleansing products;\nA survey on the possibilities to ban chemicals in painting shops;\nA compilation of an environmental calendar;\nA compilation of a booklet on gardens without poisons.\n1. Project on methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane\nMethylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane are contained in products for degreasing, paint removal, cleaning, and similar applications. As existing information on the products and their chemical contents was found to be insufficient, the project aimed to find out which products contained the dangerous substances and could be removed from use.\n2. Project cleansing products containing nonyl phenol etoxylates\nCleansing products contain nonyl phenol etoxylates, which are harmful to the user as well as to nature, as they are toxic and have a low level of biodegradability. A survey of 50 cleansing products detected ten products with nonyl phenol etoxylates. The project managers and the Environmental Protection office tried to persuade manufacturers to voluntarily stop the use.\n3. The Car Wash Detergents project\nDue to the large quantities used in the city, and the problems created by these substances in water treatment, a pilot project was initiated to offer a testing-ground for a comparative use of different products in car washes. As a consequence, the Chemical Sweep programme aimed to pursue new methods in the field of dangerous substances in car detergents. In co-operation with the local car wash operators, criteria for environmentally adapted car wash detergents were formulated. The manufacturers of car wash products were invited to submit products which met the criteria (no inclusion of toxic, allergenic, or carcinogenic substances, high safety standards, maximum of 5% organic solvents, etc.) The products were tested in a winter season product trial. The testing was not only limited to products, but also included cleansing techniques and equipment. Finally, one existing, and seven newly developed products were accepted and tested. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that certain dirty products have to be accepted in order for the effectiveness of degreasers to reach the overall substitution goal. The testing was supervised by representatives from Chemical Sweep, the Environmental Protection Office, the City of Gothenburg Water and Sewage Department, the Gothenburg region local government association, the Petroleum Dealers National Association, and two car wash companies.\n4. The project on less environmentally harmful types of fuels\nThe goal of Milj\u00f6fordon in Gothenburg is to support and increase the pace of development of the emerging market for alternative fuels and environmentally adapted vehicles in the region. This is being accomplished by offering advice to, and sharing knowledge with, companies and public departments about vehicles, fuels, car dealerships, and other related matters. A particular initiative has involved the availability of mixed gasoline-ethanol with 10% ethanol, at some gasoline stations.\n5. The project on dangerous additives in cutting fluids\nThe project targeted the use of cutting fluids which are mainly used in machining operations in the engineering industry. Thirteen chemicals in cutting fluids are listed at the so-called Restriction commission of the National Chemicals Inspectorate and the National Environmental Protection Agency. The use of these chemicals should be either eased, or severely limited. The Chemical Sweep project aimed to study the situation in the City of Gothenburg and to investigate the possibilities to restrict the use. New insight into the environmental impacts should encourage users to limit the use.\n6. The project on rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery cells\nThe replacement of mercury cadmium batteries was the second on-going project of the Chemical Sweep programme in the City of Gothenburg. Due to the initiative of the Chemical Sweep staff, and with the help of a simultaneous information campaign, shops agreed to sell only nickel hydride batteries. The sale of ordinary mercury disposable batteries completely ceased.\n7. The project on chemicals in cleaning products\nThe project was co-ordinated with the environmental protection offices and water and sewage works in the cities of Stockholm, Malm\u00f6, and Gothenburg. The aim was to publish a manual for high volume users of detergents, especially laundries and other cleaning businesses, and to compile information on washing powder for private households. The manuals contain specific information on washing powder components, the health risks, the environmental impacts, the range of alternative environmentally adapted products, the methods of using such products, and a glossary on special washing chemicals. The manuals also aim to provide informed details on distribution and purchase. Further actions were concerned with the promotion of the distribution, the use, and the handling of washing and cleaning products.\n8. The project on chemicals in painting shops\nThe project on methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane established the basis for the substitution of painting materials. As a complementary way of speeding up the phasing out of such products, the Chemical Sweep project approached the paint retailers. They are in a favourable position to influence such changes as they exercise economic power. This was done to familiarise paint retailers with the ecological problems, to offer them viable information on alternative products, and also to give Chemical Sweep an overview of the retail situation. An intention was to establish an oversight of chemicals in paint stores in order to help close the cycle on banning chemicals from further use.\n9. The study on gardens without poisons\nA booklet on chemical use in gardens contains information on the use of dangerous substances such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and certain phosphorus compounds. It draws attention to the impact on the ecological system, as well as on the food chain. The information had been submitted by experts from the Agricultural Council, the Botanical garden, the Museum of National History, and the gardening industry.\n10. The Environmental Calendar\nThe idea of an environmental calendar was realised in the process of developing information on gardens without poisons. As an information tool, it should influence the behaviour and attitude of young people.\nResults and Impacts\n49\nThe various Chemical Sweep projects have opened up some important avenues for a phasing out of dangerous substances, a setting up of new environmental standards, and for increasing environmental awareness amongst producers and users. The following results have been achieved:\n1. Project on methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane\nThe project established a register on the products and the manufacturers of products containing methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. In consequence, the Environmental Protection Office succeeded in convincing distributors and shops to remove the products from their shelves. The findings of the project contributed to the process of speeding up the change to alternative methods of production and to the introduction of less environmentally harmful products. There had been gains in the following areas:\nfifteen companies from the paint removal business in Gothenburg and four neighbouring municipalities stopped the use of approximately 40 different products containing methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane before March 1991;\npetrol filling stations were successfully targeted to substitute products containing methylane dichloride with alternative products;\nprinting companies had been encouraged to replace substances with methylene dichloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane in as many production processes as possible.\n2. Project cleansing products containing nonyl phenol etoxylates\nBy 1992, the environmental authority had succeeded in reaching an agreement with manufacturers to stop the use of nonyl phenol etoxylates in all kinds of cleaning products.\n3. The Car Wash Detergents project\nSeven of the newly tested products proved to create less environmental pollution than the products which were in widespread use. The test revealed that the use of the new products eliminates aromatic hydrocarbons and results in smaller amounts of substances which are toxic and which have a low biodegradability upon reaching the municipal sewage treatment plant. A substation rule has been invoked, and car washes have been requested to use the tested products. The Environmental Protection Office gave notice on project results to all car wash installations in Gothenburg, and today approximately 90% of the car washing stations in Gothenburg use environmentally-adapted car wash detergents. According to the national Act on Chemical Products, dangerous chemical products shall be replaced if less dangerous alternatives are available. In consequence, from December 1992 onwards, the Environmental Protection Office started to carry out related inspections. The project has greatly influenced the use of car washing detergents all over Sweden. Furthermore, it has been beneficial for the producers, as it improved their know-how on the procedures of environmental safety assessment.\n4. The project on less environmentally harmful types of fuels\nThere is an increasing variety of environmental vehicles available on the Swedish market. These vehicles run on fuels that are more environmentally friendly than gasoline and diesel \u0096 primarily methane gas, ethanol, or electricity. Although the product range is expanding rapidly, environmental vehicles enjoy less marketing support than ordinary cars. That makes a desirable market-impact more difficult to attain. At the same time, the interest for alternative vehicles is increasing among customers and public departments that want to help create a better environment \u0096 especially in larger cities such as Gothenburg. One fuel-related legislative advancement is that only \u0091environmental diesel class 1\u0091 is currently available at petrol stations in Sweden.\n5. The project on dangerous additives in cutting fluids\nThe study on the additives in cutting fluids reported on the types of cutting fluids, markets, prices, different additives, choice of fluids, handling, and distribution channels. An overview of the impacts of additives in cutting fluids had been presented at seminars of the metal workers\u0091 union. However, the impact of the project is hardly measurable, as the report contained no proposals for change. So far there has been no review of the situation.\n6. Alternative to rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery cells\nA result of the recharging without cadmium project was the introduction of metal hybrid batteries, and to some extent, also lithium oxide batteries in Sweden. At the start of this Chemical Sweep programme, the alternative (nickel) hybride battery was almost unknown in Sweden. Although there had been some difficulties with the performance in certain applications, the less toxic batteries proved to be suitable for many high-energy output appliances; such as mobile telephones, video cameras, or shavers. Additional activities were stimulated as manufacturers and importers agreed to redesign products so that they would function well with the environmentally adapted batteries. This development can be regarded as an important step to encourage manufacturers to take into account environmental matters. Currently, all major companies have models which can be used with metal hybride batteries (e.g. Toshiba, Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola, Braun, Philips). A ban has been proposed on the sales of closed nickel-cadmium batteries, but it is uncertain if the proposal will be passed by the Council of Ministers.\nThe success of this project may also impact environmental progress in Europe as the Swedish Department of the Environment put forward a PM 1995-10-26 to the European commission to change the existing directives on environmentally dangerous batteries (91/157/EEC and 93/86/EEC).\n7. The project on chemicals in cleaning products\nThe manuals on the Good Choice of Chemicals established a basis for the introduction of environmentally adapted washing and cleaning products. As a result, supermarkets started to stock up to 50% of environmentally adapted laundry, washing, and cleaning products. In addition, there had been supporting measures to promote sales (e.g. better display, additional labelling, information guides, and mailings to area customers). An updated version of the manual was published in 1998.\nFurther activities are related to laundries in apartment buildings. The Chemical Sweep distributed to all owners of apartment houses and tenant / owner associations plastic-covered signs containing washing tips for a cleaner environment. This labelling action, which was called Wash Soft, proved to be a great success as the first thousand copies were sold out within a few weeks. The action was supported by public media attention, and the idea spread to neighbouring municipalities. Of even greater impact has been the environmental labelling systems implemented by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and Nordic Environmental Labelling.\n8. The project on chemicals in painting shops\nThis project had been mainly concerned with the supervision of the retailers as the final link in the chain. A series of inspections were made together with the municipal offices. The results underline the need for further action:\nonly a few products with dangerous substances had been returned to the suppliers;\nin general, the knowledge of problems is low, especially in painting and decorating businesses;\nlabelling of products is often unclear;\ninspections should be extended to other industries and trades.\n9. The study on gardens without poisons\nFifty thousand copies of the booklet on gardens without poisons were printed in the first edition and distributed to all house owners in Gothenburg. In addition, experts from the botanical garden offered a new information service.\n10. The Environmental Calendar\nThe Environmental Calendar had a circulation of 16,000 copies. 12,000 had been distributed via schools, while the remaining copies were handed out by libraries and as a replacement of the Environmental Protection Office\u0092s traditional Christmas card. As a consequence, a large number of young people, as well as environmental project partners were reached.\nActors and Structures\n49\nResponsibility for supervision of the Chemical Sweep programme rested with the Gothenburg Environmental and Health Protection Agency. Implementation took place as a co-operative process involving programme staff, manufacturing industry representatives, and industrial user groups. The Chemical Sweep programme has been managed by a permanent staff of three. A project manager, a researcher, and an information officer had been employed full time, and external experts provided consultancy for special projects.\nFinance\n49\nChemical Sweep was initiated in 1989 by the Environmental Protection Committee of Gothenburg, and was funded by the Municipal Council. The total budget had been 6,000,000 Swedish crowns, or 2,000,000 Swedish crowns per annum. The expenses were distributed to the different projects and the management of the programme as follows:\nEmployees, offices, computers, telephone etc.\n50.0%\n"}, {"score": 1272.0571, "uuid": "f3a633a5-e052-5b1a-8df4-55e9092ec1b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0406wb-71-08642", "target_hostname": "www.backpacker.com", "target_uri": "http://www.backpacker.com/green_guide_environmentally_friendly_traveling_hiking/nature/12184", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Backpacker Magazine - <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> Traveling, Hiking", "snippet": "And I was aware that the BLM and Forest Service have been grading dirt roads all over the West, making <em>more</em> trailheads than ever accessible to regular cars.

It might be a washout from the monsoon rains that hit California's southern Sierra in spring. A small boulder juts from one end, and a loose, lumpy swale of a shoulder rises from the other. It's the kind of obstruction that, if you're driving a high-clearance vehicle, might cause you to dip below 5 mph, until you ka-thunk over it, and then you would be on your way without another thought. If, on the other hand, you're driving a lime-green, vegetable-oil-powered Volkswagen Beetle with nearly tread-free tires and 6 inches of clearance, then you'd be forced to do what John and I are doing. Namely: Pace around, study the rut from various angles, and ponder the immutable fact that the road to planetary change is almost always winding and bumpy.\nWe had our warnings. First was the guy back at the Twin Oaks General Store wearing a chef's coat and a David Carradine kung fu ponytail who was sucking on a cigarette in the shade. He told me the road gets graded once a year. \"They don't do it until the rains stop,\" he said.\nI looked up. The sky was an unblemished blue. The entire landscape, in fact, seemed drier than the after-party at the National Spelling Bee. \"You think it might rain soon?\"\nHe shrugged. \"Don't know. But they haven't been up there to grade it yet.\" Which, of course, was all that really mattered. Still, I had one more question: Had he ever driven it before it was graded?\n\"Once,\" he said. \"Wouldn't do it again.\"\nYet we'd flown and driven more than eight hours to get here, so we pushed on, undeterred. Even the sign at the turnoff from Walker Basin Road didn't slow us: \"Extreme caution\u2013narrow road\u2013blind curves.\"\nWe turned in and climbed 5 miles, things getting dicey\u2013a crater there, some jaw-rattling washboards there\u2013but always viable. Until now. Up ahead is 8,440-foot Piute Mountain, the first summit we'd planned to bag on our four-day road trip. John votes to drive until we're officially punked. I'm not so sure. It's our first full day out in the lime-green Beetle. We're going to hike the Pacific Crest Trail and hit a backcountry hot spring and hammer up to a couple of other high places. Does it make sense to blow the car up this early?\nA pickup approaches. I slide into the car, back into a pullout. Before the truck passes, I yell at the driver to hold up. The cowboy type behind the wheel stops and looks over. Something passes over his face: I register bemusement, maybe a tinge of dismay. \"What's it like up ahead?\" I ask.\nHe smiles in that cowboy way, without actually moving his mouth. \"It gets a little worse.\" And then he ka-thunks over the rut and drives off. I get out and walk over to John.\n\"OK,\" I say. \"Let's try it.\"\nThe trip started as a challenge. I'd been harassing my buddy Chris for buying a new SUV instead of something a little more planet-friendly. \"Remind me,\" he said, \"what is it you drive on your hiking trips?\"\n\"Right,\" I said. \"But that's on hiking trips.\"\n\"Ah, so it's OK as long as you're hiking?\" Chris asked. \"Bet you get great gas mileage on those dirt roads. Tell you what: Let's see you start leading by example.\"\nThat's easier said than done, of course. There are functional reasons for renting a four-wheel-drive on my annual backpacking pilgrimages out West. There are places\u2013much of Utah's canyon country, for example\u2013you simply can't access without bouncing down high-clearance dirt roads.\nStill. Chris had a point. It did annoy me to pump all that fossil fuel into those thirsty brutes. Enough outings like that and your carbon footprint stretches to Wilt Chamberlain proportions. And I was aware that the BLM and Forest Service have been grading dirt roads all over the West, making more trailheads than ever accessible to regular cars.\nAt first, I considered renting a hybrid from Hertz or a fuel-sipping Subaru 4WD. Then I Googled something better: A company named Bio-Beetle recently began renting biodiesel cars in Los Angeles. Biodiesel is an all-natural, 100-percent-renewable fuel usually made from vegetable oil. In some such cars, you can dump the contents of a commercial deep fryer into the gas tank. On the road, it's Eau de Hardees.\nBio-Beetle is a small enough operation that Shaun Stenshol, the owner, picks up the calls. He turns out to be a character. In his environmental-activist days, he backpacked into the Nevada desert to disrupt bomb testing. Bio-Beetle is his kinder, gentler protest against the military-industrial complex. Stenshol was happy to rent me a car, but warned that I could only refill in L.A. or elsewhere on the coast. But he estimated the Beetle could cover 350 to 400 miles on a full tank, and he could stash five gallons in the trunk. I did some quick math: That would get me on the PCT in the southern Sierra, and maybe over to some desert peaks, and back again.\nThe plan was coming together. It looked like a sweet road trip and a satisfying in-your-face to Chris\u2013but maybe something more, too. The way I figured it, I'd be creating a new travel template for planet-conscious adventurers, one that said: You can go on big trips, and use less fossil fuel than if you were driving your regular car. (Sure, there's irony in flying cross-country to avoid using gasoline in a car, but that's one step back for two steps forward. And in this case, BACKPACKER purchased carbon offsets for our air travel.)\nJohn, a longtime buddy with a forestry background and a fondness for the absurd, signed on to ride shotgun. There would be comical moments: John is 6'4\"; I'm 6'7\". Crouched inside the Beetle, we'd look like a couple of performance-fabric-wearing circus clowns. There were other issues, too. What if we crunched the numbers wrong, and ran out of gas in the Mojave? If the car smelled like French fries, what would those larcenous Sierra black bears do with it? Would we return from the trail to find a stripped-down chassis?\nPioneers, I decided, have to take a few chances. That's what makes them pioneers\u2013along with their ludicrously zealous sense of mission. By the time I'd booked my flight, I'd convinced myself that driving the car up sketchy dirt roads was nothing less than a moral imperative.\nAnd then we saw the car. Did I mention it was a shimmering lime green? The hue and round shape suggested a scoop of sorbet, as if an hour in the severe California sun would turn it into a syrupy, emerald puddle. The words POWERED BY 100% BIODIESEL FUEL appear in large letters on the doors. Shawn had pasted his web address (bio-beetle.com) onto the back window, and, just in case those subtle messages failed to resonate, he'd slapped a Biodiesel: No War Required sticker on the rear bumper.\nBut it was the dimensions that really stunned me. The interior was tiny, so small that we had to leave two Alpacka rafts behind in Stenshol's office. Before driving off, I measured the car's clearance with my Pilot Precise Rolling Ball pen. The Beetle's oil pan was barely an inch above. Inside, my right knee jammed between the steering wheel and dashboard.\nNonetheless, the car did fine in the Saturday midday rush hour. It's hard to get noticed in L.A., but as we crept north on I-5, I sensed people throwing looks our way. In Bakersfield, where we stopped for supplies, people approached to ask what we were promoting. One guy hoped we were a rolling billboard for a new biodiesel station. In a gas station, the cashier asked, \"Biodiesel? Cool!\" Then he said, \"What is it?\"\nThe southern Sierra turn out to be the perfect place for this adventure. The American Lung Association's latest State of the Air Report, which was featured in the newspaper that day, concluded that Bakersfield no longer had the nation's worst air. Now it was second to L.A. These people needed us.\nWhich is why, up on Piute Mountain Road, I decide to go for it. Lewis and Clark had to eat their horses. The Donners had to eat the other Donners. This was the least we could do to break new trail. I decide to try the shoulder, craftily approaching from an angle. Somehow, I end up hung up, tires spinning. I retreat and try again, to no avail.\nPlan B is this: We turn back and head north to Miracle Hot Springs, which my guidebook describes as an abandoned resort that's now a secluded sanctuary for clothing-optional bathing. There, we set up our tent, roam the foothills, and then hike 10 minutes down a steep slope to three artificial pools of various temperatures set along the Kern River.\nIt's a Sunday, late afternoon, so it's no surprise to find that a small crowd of six or ten regulars has gathered to do what regular crowds at such places do: sit and chat quietly, tiptoe into the frigid river, and beer up. When word gets around about our mission, people approach to ask about the car and issue murmurs of approval. At one point, someone spots a huge beaver in the river, and everyone stops what they're doing and watches the animal slice through the swift, cold current. A rope swing hangs nearby, untouched.\nThe scene is even better in the morning, before the sun has climbed the ridge. All is still except for swaying vapors of steam. As the sulfuric water rinses away the last of our jet lag, though, we arrive at our first philosophical divide. I'm ready to beeline for the PCT, and John wants to loiter. \"If we're really committed to halting global warming,\" he asks, dropping his head back and closing his eyes, \"wouldn't it be better to not drive anywhere at all?\"\n\"The car can't do the world any good sitting here,\" I say. \"Anyway, I'm here to hike and camp. You know, do things.\"\nHe cracks an eyelid. \"You're so ADD,\" he says.\nJohn is a strange combination of kinetic energy and inertia. He's usually a greedy-for-experiences, Kerouac-type traveler. He can also be a bit of a sloth. A single parent, he recently shipped his only child off to college and gained 15 pounds. John's clearly on board for the stop-global-warming part of this hiking adventure. The hiking part, not so much.\nHe is, in other words, becoming Katz to my Bryson. I remind him of our mission. \"Would Lewis and Clark sit in hot springs while the Northwest was waiting to be mapped?\"\n\"Hey,\" he says. \"They took two years to get there. I bet they had a day to spare.\"\nI clamber out and dangle the keys in his face. \"Mule train's leaving,\" I say, grinning.\nBy late morning we approach Chimney Peak Recreation Area via 11-mile Canebrake Road. At the entrance, we see the road is designated, oxymoronically, a \"national backcountry byway.\" Such routes \"typically accommodate high-clearance vehicles and are mostly made up of slow-speed, narrow secondary roads.\" But a \"normal car\"\u2013uh-oh\u2013can usually travel the road \"by using a little extra care in a few places.\"\nAll of which is fine, except that before breaking camp earlier, I'd made a discovery. Sorting through our stuff, I saw the rental agreement. I usually file such things where I won't encounter them, but given what's ahead, I scanned the fine print. And sure enough, Article 2 says I'll be liable for all damages if any of a number of things occurs during the rental. One of them is this: \"Vehicle is used on unpaved roads.\"\nThis causes a twinge. Normally I'm happy to flout such rules, but I like Stenshol, and I like his small, gestating business. I'd rather it wasn't him. But we're in too deep. Standing there at the Canebrake Road entrance, I convince myself that he'll ultimately be happy to be part of the solution.\nThe road turns out not so bad. It's filled with squirrelly loose sand that confers the same feeling you get driving over a steel-grate bridge, but we rumble effortlessly to Chimney Rock Campground, the gleeful punk-pop chords of Green Day's \"American Idiot\" rattling the windows. We can't find the PCT intersection that the maps promised, though, and there's no one else around. After a while, we continue up to Kennedy Meadows, the next PCT crossing point.\nOn the 4-mile hike to Clover Meadow, where we intend to camp, we encounter prickly-pear cacti and sequoias with massive trunks and syringelike needles. We find impossibly tiny red flowers that John, holder of a forestry degree, can't identify. We keep spotting a beautiful yellow bird with a red face\u2013a Western tanager, I figure out later. Lizards glide away at almost every turn, over jumbles of precariously perched granite. We talk the way people talk on trails, in a shambling fashion. We talk about the massive burn area we saw on the road to Kennedy Meadows, and how it's one of nature's little ironies that fire is so damaging and so useful. We comment on how much sequoias screw with your sense of perspective. In the late afternoon, we sprawl out on a vast, perfectly flat hunk of rock that rises about 10 feet off the ground: God's own chaise lounge.\nLying back, it hits me why I'm so eager to have this trip go well. Climate change is a dodgy issue for me. I care deeply about my 3-year-old son inheriting a hale, healthy planet, and try to do what I can. I recycle. Turn lights off. I've changed my bulbs. But I remain a sinner. I'm able to hold only so many things in my head in the course of a day, and remembering to bring a spork to the office rather than using the disposable cutlery available in the company caf\u00e9 isn't one of them. I keep accumulating plastic cups, because I'm either too lazy or I forget to use my Nalgene. I can bike to work, but too often don't make time. Habits. I'm good at forming them, lousy at breaking them. This trip would help me atone.\nWhen we return, the parking lot is mostly empty, and it occurs to me that we're not getting as many people on board with the whole vegetable-oil-powered road trip idea as I'd hoped. But damned if we aren't having fun.\nWe don't get far heading west from Kennedy Meadows on our third day before meeting this sign: \"Road closed ahead due to snow.\" Even though it's early May, Sherman Pass, at 9,200 feet, is still clogged.\nIn the other direction, straight east, are the alien wonders of Death Valley. We may not have enough fuel to get back to Los Angeles, but on the map we see Telescope Peak, at 11,049 feet the park's high point, beckoning from its western fringes. And just like that, we have a mission that simply can't be halted.\nThat is, until we're stopped far up Mahogany Flat Road. We've rattled up for miles now, shuddering across Death Valley's world-famous washboards, when we reach Thorndike Campground. There, we drain our spare container of biodiesel into the Beetle. Curious, I dip my finger in; there's no onion-ring aroma, but I do pick up a tincture of Wesson.\nThe trailhead is just another 1.5 miles up. But 100 yards beyond Thorndike, I pull up to a pothole that from the Beetle's cockpit looks like an abyss. We scout ahead. It gets no better (actually, it gets worse) and the road tips upward toward ski-jump grade. The rest of the way, we're on foot.\nThe trail to Telescope Peak is 7 miles long and gains nearly 3,000 feet of elevation. We hike into the evening and camp where we can glimpse the massive sweep of Death Valley, the lights of Vegas glowing to the east. Sitting there drinking tea, John looks around and sees, 20 yards away, an enormous jackrabbit, its periscope-like ears plying the dusk air.\nI boil water for our freeze-dried meals, and we eat, and as night falls we see a UFO. Off to the southeast, a brightly glowing light appears; it looks like a car, until it begins floating and zigzagging through the air. We stare at this for a long while, and even though we later conclude that there's probably some kind of laser show going on down on the edge of the national park, it doesn't spoil the effect.\nThen I flick on a headlamp and stare at the empty Backpacker's Pantry containers: not very green of us. There are other wrappers\u2013for pistachios, for M&Ms, for coffee. Those bad habits again. We're creating a lot of garbage. I'd been too busy beforehand to buy bulk pasta and beans and avoid sending a bunch of crap to the landfill. And then it hit me: The lime-green vegetable-oil-powered Beetle isn't going to change the world. We even wind up not having quite enough Wesson to get back, and have to buy some regular diesel near L.A., blemishing the purity of the journey.\nNo. To really make something happen, I'm going to have to start by working on my own entrenched habits, by influencing people to do better by righting my own ship, leading by example. Redemption lies in everyday life, not in an off-kilter if stupendously fun 700-mile road trip.\nIn the morning, our final day, I'll head off without John up the flanks of Telescope, and we'll each have our own solo moment up high. My view will be astonishing, and I'll have the inevitable moment of simultaneously questioning my own significance and feeling like the ruler of the cosmos.\nBut for now, it's dark, and soon it's completely quiet, both inside my head and out, and there are more stars overhead than thoughts anyone can have in a lifetime. And I think, this is it. This is a very good place to start.\nFormer Senior Editor David Howard now almost always remembers to fully inflate the tires on his 2001 Volkswagen Passat.\n"}, {"score": 1263.081, "uuid": "e737762d-3f40-5c2d-9f4b-f2b040ab3f79", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1310wb-15-13126", "target_hostname": "www.cmbol.com", "target_uri": "http://www.cmbol.com/news/detail/2012/04/2012040517531313.shtm", "page_rank": 1.536276e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Hamm compactor,Hamm Launches New <em>Environmentally</em> <em>Friendly</em> Compactor,news1", "snippet": "Hamm H20i <em>is</em> equipped with <em>a</em> 215-hp Deutz 6-cylinder <em>diesel</em> engine <em>which</em> meets Tier 4-Interim emissions requirements.

Ferguson will work alongside Glasgow-based ship designers Seatec UK and Dutch electrical specialists Imtech Marine & Offshore to deliver the project. In conjunction with the shipbuilder and Imtech, Seatec will develop the detailed design for the new ferries, undertake all the naval architecture and marine engineering, and prepare all of the drawings and documentation necessary for the shipyard to construct the vessels.\nThe deal, said to be worth over \u00a320 million, was awarded to Ferguson following a competitive tender process against strong foreign competition. The contract covers construction of two sea-going ro-ro passenger and vehicle diesel electric and battery powered hybrid ferries. Each ferry will accommodate 150 passengers and 23 cars or two HGVs and will be fitted with a Cargotec ship to shore stern ramp.\nThe vessels will be powered by three diesel generator sets, each rated at about 330kWe, with one in operation for normal conditions, lithium ion batteries being used to provide at least 20% of the power. The gensets will feed power to a 400V switchboard, which will supply power to two 375kW electric propulsion motors (0-600rpm). The propulsion system is completed by two 1,375kW Voith Schneider propellers, type VSP 16 R5 EC/90, to provide a service speed of 9 knots. The battery banks will provide additional power to operate the vessel.\nSUBSTANTIAL CUTS IN FUEL USAGE\nInnovative \u2018green\u2019 technology supplied by Imtech Marine includes the two lithium battery banks of about 700kWh, reducing fuel and CO2 consumption by at least 20%. The vessel design and power configuration additionally realizes 19%-24% savings of power input to the propulsion units compared with a conventional diesel mechanical solution.\nWhen in port, the ships will completely turn off the propulsion power plant and switch to batteries and, ultimately, shore connection which will result in significant cost savings and further reduction of the carbon footprint. Next to a substantial reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, noise levels will be reduced. The ferries will charge overnight and, in the future, CMAL aims to use energy from wind, wave or solar systems for charging the batteries, making the vessels even more environmentally friendly.\nImtech Marine\u2019s office in Glasgow, UK, will coordinate the supply and installation, handle the day-to-day project management and will offer after-sales support for the pioneering project. Imtech will train CMAL employees in the operation of hybrid systems. The ferries will undergo a week of sea trials and this will be followed by an additional 21 days to test the vessels on all routes operated by CMAL.\u00a0The first vessel is expected to be delivered in the summer of 2013 and the second a month later.\nIt has been four years since the last commercial ship was fully built and delivered on the Clyde and this project will save existing jobs and create new jobs and apprenticeships in the area. Alex Neil, cabinet secretary for Infrastructure & Capital Investment said: \u201cThe technology will be cleaner, quieter and cheaper to operate and maintain than ever before. It will help Scotland reach our ambitious climate change targets, and demonstrates the vast economic potential of developing green technology and moving to a low carbon economy\u201d.\nWith a length of 43.50m, a breadth of 12.20m and a draught of 1.73m, the newbuildings will have an estimated gross tonnage of 450tons and 135dwt. They will be operated by CalMac Ferries and will be used for many of the short crossings between the Clyde and the Hebrides. The first of the two new vessels is expected to be operational on the Sconser-Raasay route on Skye by May 2013, with the second vessel coming into operation in August of that year.\n\u201cThe technology will be cleaner, quieter and cheaper to operate and maintain than ever before\u201d\nImages for this article - click to enlarge\nUnless otherwise stated, all images copyright \u00a9 Mercator Media 2012.

One is the engine and other is propulsion power. Most hybrid cars obtainable in the market have a blend of gasoline and electric engines whilst some have a mixture of diesel and electric engines. Hybrid cars create much less pollution and are counted much more economical than the standard conventional cars, hence regarded as to be good for the environment.\nAbout Honda Civic Hybrid\nHonda began progressive work on their Hybrid method in 1990. The Honda Civic Hybrid has the peculiarity of becoming India\u2019s initial and one of the greatest Hybrid cars in the world. It not only delivers a high fun-to drive quotient, but also is environmental friendly and fuel efficient. The Civic Hybrid exploits the Honda Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) technologies in which the inner combustion engine is directly attached to and supported by an electric motor.\nHonda Civic Hybrid Technology\nIn the technology utilized for Civic Hybrid, there is an increased horsepower which when combined with a continuous variable transmission, provides a smooth and influential ride. Eventually, the Civic Hybrid considerably reduces fuel utilization without having trailing its performance.\nAn Overview\nStyle has its new definition with the Honda Civic Hybrid. Small things that are done make you go a long way in determining who you are. Hence, giving attention to details, the Civic Hybrid is all about tiny touches.\nIn a latest Premium Pearl White color, the body-colored door handles and power side mirrors with incorporated turn indicators add to the noticeable design of the Civic Hybrid. The classy Honda Civic Hybrid is undoubtedly eco-friendly with much less fuel consumption. You can experience the inevitable excitement as you turn on the ignition.\nStyling and Safety\nThe Civic Hybrid\u2019s exterior design has a roof micro-antenna and an aerodynamic trunk spoiler that positive aspects the fuel economy. There is one more design which comes with Hybrid-distinct aluminum wheels and emblems.

Reaction from passengers using the service has been equally favourable.\nPart of the modular Gemini 2 product family that is also available in diesel (DL) form, the HEV Double Deck is an exceptionally environmentally-friendly vehicle, powered by just a 1.9 litre Turbo Diesel GM engine and a Siemens ELFA\u00ae hybrid drivetrain. Its 37kWh Valence Lithium Ion batteries offer advanced energy storage for power captured by the vehicle\u2019s regenerative braking system, a feature much in evidence thanks to hilly terrain in and around the famous Roman city.\nWith the huge capacity of the integrated battery system continually being recharged, once the bus reaches the town centre it can run almost entirely off battery power, meaning that the diesel engine is hardly being used and therefore fuel emissions are cut to an absolute minimum. This not only meets the emissions requirements for city centres that have been set out by the European CIVITAS Renaissance Initiative, but also provides passengers and driver alike with a smoother and quieter ride.\nThe early success of the specially branded hybrid bus in Bath, two months into the six month trial in helping to improve air quality and further reduce emission levels, is sure to generate fresh renewed interest from other cities right across the UK.\nLeon Daniels, FirstGroup UK Bus Customer Service & Communication Director said; \u201cWhilst London and one or two other big conurbations are implementing advanced hybrid bus technology, here is a case where air quality is being improved in an historic and environmentally-sensitive city and I\u2019m delighted the people of Bath are at the frontline of this cutting edge technology.\u201d\nMark Nodder, Wright Group Managing Director commented; \u201cTo date, Hybrid Electric Vehicle investment has been very London-centric, but two rounds of the Green Bus Fund and innovative schemes such as the CIVITAS Renaissance Project in Bath are providing an important and much welcomed incentive to a technology which is becoming increasingly mature and, hopefully within a foreseeable timeframe, increasingly mainstream.\u201d\nDrive to Fitness\n"}, {"score": 1179.7843, "uuid": "4267583d-bfce-527f-89d4-7a08ff80e0d0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-36-27153", "target_hostname": "respectourplanet.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://respectourplanet.typepad.com/hybridboat/page/4/", "page_rank": 1.1737143e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Hybrid</em> Boat", "snippet": "For those of you who do not own <em>a</em> Toyota Prius, <em>a</em> <em>hybrid</em> vessel typically uses two <em>or</em> <em>more</em> distinct power sources and <em>a</em> combination of <em>a</em> <em>diesel</em> engine (in our case, Tier 2 marine <em>diesel</em> engines) with one <em>or</em> <em>more</em> electric motors.", "explanation": null, "document": "The Power of Batteries\nThe Hornblower Hybrid is\u00a0a\u00a0technological\u00a0advancement\u00a0many years in the making, harnessing energy from the sun and the wind, combined with diesel engines, to propel the vessel. And although most of our visitors are excited about the wind and solar technology, we don't want our guests to forget about another important technology component: Battery Power!\nTo give a quick review, power from the wind turbines and solar panels are stored in the battery banks that power navigation tools, lighting and other electronic needs. \u00a0Any excess power is stored in the main propulsion battery banks that allow for zero emissions mode. \u00a0Without the battery banks, the\u00a0Hornblower Hybrid would have nowhere to store power!\nTo remind our devoted blog readers about the power of batteries, our team of engineers have compiled some fun facts about the batteries on the Hornblower Hybrid:\n\u2022 There is approximately 2,300 pounds of batteries\u00a0in each of the two boat hulls, totaling\u00a04,600 pounds\u00a0of batteries!\n\u2022 Each battery bank holds 380 volts.\n\u2022 It would take around 15,000 AA style batteries to\u00a0equal the battery banks on\u00a0the\u00a0Hornblower Hybrid.\n\u2022 It takes approximately 5 hours to recharge the\nbatteries.\n\u2022 The boat has a battery pack about 17 times as\nlarge as the one found in the Prius.\n\u2022 The Hornblower Hybrid can do up to 7 knots on\nbattery power. \u00a0(A knot is 1.15 mph).\nJust a reminder, we recycle batteries on Alcatraz Landing in San Francisco. \u00a0So if your camera runs out of batteries after an all day photo shoot on Alcatraz Island, please feel free to drop them off with any Alcatraz Cruises staff member and we will dispose of them properly.\nPosted at 09:50 AM | Permalink | Comments (1) | TrackBack (0)\n07/28/2009\nGrowing Trend: Vehicle-Fleet Hybrid Retrofits\nRecently we wrote about the advantages of recycling and reusing a diving vessel for the Hornblower Hybrid and discussed the environmental benefits of retrofitting a used boat. On top of saving energy, another long term goal was to ignite a trend towards hybrid retrofits in the water transportation industry.\nIn the meantime, hybrid retrofits have become a budding trend in the land transportation industry, with Fed Ex increasing its North American hybrid truck fleet by 50 percent after last week's announcement of 92 additional retrofitted delivery trucks. Fed Ex claims to have the largest hybrid package delivery fleet in the U.S. with a total of 264 hybrid trucks. The repurposed vehicles are 44 percent more fuel efficient than standard FedEx delivery trucks and produce 96 percent fewer particulates and 75 percent fewer smog-causing emissions.\nPacific Gas & Electric Co. is also looking toward a future in hybrid retrofits. \u00a0PG&E was one of 14 utility companies to asses a hybrid diesel-electric truck in it's vehicle fleet, which could potentially cut fuel consumption by 30 to 60 percent.\nIf we are moving toward a future of hybrid vehicle fleets, the logical next step would be hybrid vessel fleets. The technologies used on the Hornblower Hybrid are not limited to just this vessel or the current route it operates to Alcatraz and Angel Island in San Francisco. \u00a0It can be used on almost any vessel, even a fleet of vessels! Our company was just the first to hire an engineering team to design and integrate the systems, making it the first successful implementation of a hybrid\u00a0passenger\u00a0ferry in the United States. \u00a0We can offer our services to other vessel operators who would like a hybrid vessel(s) as well.\nPosted at 01:28 PM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n07/21/2009\nHornblower Hybrid vs. Toyota Prius\nThe Hornblower Hybrid has often been referred to as \"a Prius on\u00a0steroids\" and when asked to explain the functions of our hybrid vessel, our team often refers to the capabilities of the Toyota Prius as an easy explanation. \u00a0So how do these two hybrid vehicles compare?\nSimilarities\nLike the Prius, that can be propelled by gasoline (petrol) and/or electric power, the Hornblower Hybrid is a diesel-electric vessel that also switches between these two modes of power. \u00a0Accessories such as dashboard lights and air conditioning on the Toyota Prius, are powered by the battery pack just like the Hornblower Hybrid that uses power stored in its battery banks to power navigation tools, lighting and other electronic needs. \u00a0Another\nsimilarity is the display screens onboard the Hornblower Hybrid that show energy flow\u00a0to/from the engines and battery bank as well as the battery charge level. \u00a0The Prius also has an energy monitor on its multi-function dashboard display.\nDifferences\nThe main difference between the two hybrid vehicles is the Hornblower Hybrid's customized drive system that lets the captain monitor the vessel's energy needs and choose the most efficient power sources. For example, when the boat is idling at the dock, the engines are shut off and the electric motors run simply off the energy stored in the battery banks.\nThe Toyota Prius instead makes that choice for the driver, automatically switching from gasoline engine to electric mode, for example, when idling at a stoplight or driving at low speeds. \u00a0We are not making any claims that the Hornblower Hybrid technology is better than Toyota, just different, in that one technology lets you choose between the two modes and the other makes the choice or you.\nWhen comparing the Hornblower Hybrid and the Toyota Prius, the most important comparison to make is their fuel efficiency. \u00a0Compared to a typical ferry boat that burns 25 to 30 gallons of diesel per hour, the Hornblower Hybrid uses between 5 to 7 gallons per hour. The 2010 Prius can reach up to 51 mpg compared to a typical compact vehicle that can get 30-40 mpg.\nLike the Toyota Prius, that led the way for more fuel-efficient cars, we hope the Hornblower Hybrid will spark change in the maritime industry for more fuel-efficient boats in the future.\nPosted at 10:17 AM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n07/14/2009\nPeddle Power! How Many Bikes Would it Take to Power the Hornblower Hybrid?\nDuring the construction of the vessel, the Hornblower Hybrid team saw the opportunity to make the new hybrid ferry an educational tool and seized it, adding many learning components throughout the boat. \u00a0The Hornblower Hybrid comes equipped with many educational tools onboard including a large display of diagrams and educational photos in the pilothouse. Signs are also posted throughout the vessel with information on the \"green\" components of the boat, including countertops made of recycled glass to show passengers firsthand how materials can be reused to reduce our impact on the planet.\nOne of the boat's most popular education tools, however, is an exercise bike that is hooked up to a miniature, functioning representation of the same system that directs solar and wind turbine power to the battery pack. \u00a0Passengers can peddle the bike and actually generate power for the Hornblower Hybrid's batteries. Designed with children in mind to learn how much energy it takes to generate power, the bike has become more popular with adults who are not shy about giving a few elbows to get their turn at peddling.\nSo how much man power would it actually take to generate enough energy to power the boat? According to our project engineer, we would need 1,500 bikes onboard to power the Hornblower Hybrid at 10 knots. That's a lot of bikes!\nWe hope this makes our guests think more about the energy they use at home and encourages them to make environmentally friendly decisions in their daily lives. \u00a0That being said, make sure to come in your best shape, get ready to peddle and we will see you onboard!*\n* You can join us on the Hornblower Hybrid by purchasing tickets for our Island Hop tour to Alcatraz and Angel Island. \u00a0Tickets can be purchased at www.alcatrazcruises.com.\nPosted at 05:15 PM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n07/07/2009\nYou host a party, your friends show up, you serve vodka\u00a0martinis, you dance, you mingle, say good-bye, clean up the mess and recycle the empty bottles.\nSurprisingly, this is how countertops are made in\u00a0the \u201cgreen\u201d world.\nYou heard right. \u00a0As part of our dedication to Respect Our Planet, all countertops on the Hornblower Hybrid are made from recycled glass \u2013 two thousand Skyy Vodka bottles to be more exact. Vetrazzo, Inc., a certified Bay Area Green Business, created and designed all countertops onboard the vessel made from approximately 85% post-consumer recycled glass.\nLike Hornblower and companies, Vetrazzo cultivates a workplace that demonstrates a respect for people and the planet and we are proud to partner with local green businesses that share our mission for a cleaner and greener environment.\nThe Hornblower Hybrid is \u201cgreen\u201d in many other ways beyond its clean energy capabilities and recycled glass countertops. The vessel includes other environmentally friendly components such as:\n- Carpet: contains Everset Fibers, made from\u00a0post consumer recycled materials and is recyclable.\n- Lights: the boat is fully equipped with an LED lighting system\n- Interior Signage: printed on Plyboo (left), 100% renewable plywood bamboo made from sustainable sources\n- All interior modifications meet the USGBC LEED criteria for recycled content\nFor more information on Vetrazzo please visit www.vetrazzo.com\nPosted at 09:07 AM | Permalink | Comments (1) | TrackBack (0)\n06/02/2009\nSave Energy and the Planet: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!\nReduce, Reuse, Recycle - some may call these the \"3 R's\" but our team at Hornblower refers to these three words as important guidelines to build a hybrid ferry.\nIn 2005, Hornblower Cruises & Events was awarded a 10-year contract to provide transportation across the San Francisco Bay to Alcatraz Island. The National Park Service contract stipulated that our fleet include ferries that were built or refitted to a higher level of environmental standards. Not only did our company accept the challenge, but our team of engineers went above and beyond. After refitting two existing vessels with new engines that reduce emissions by 50% and comply to Tier 2 standards, Hornblower has taken the next step by introducing a hybrid ferry to to its \"green\" fleet.\nThe Hornblower Hybrid, now complete and in full time service to Alcatraz and Angel Island, not only reduces emissions during operation but also saved energy during vessel construction.\u00a0 Instead of starting from scratch, Hornblower acquired an aluminum commercial dive boat to convert into a hybrid ferry. The retrofit, repower and refurbishment took several months to complete and almost 90 percent of the former dive boat was refitted.\nBy Reusing and Recycling a used diving vessel, Hornblower saved 735,000 KWh of electricity in the construction/retrofit of the vessel. That is equivalent to taking more than 60 U.S. homes off the grid for one year,\u00a0significantly Reducing our environmental impact.\nPosted at 04:19 PM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n05/04/2009\nA Special Earth Day on the Bay\nOur Mother Earth: We take her for granted daily, even though she does just about everything for us. \u00a0So on Earth Day many green-minded people made plans to show a little love, and to do our part, Alcatraz Cruises offered a way for people to learn about living on this planet with a softer footprint.\nEarth Day is celebrated every year on April 22nd and is designed to inspire awareness and appreciation for the Earth's environment. \u00a0Appropriately, the Hornblower Hybrid is designed to inspire environmental awareness as well and to teach our guests about the importance of environmental stewardship. \u00a0Therefore Alcatraz Cruises extended the invitation to come onboard the Hornblower Hybrid for a special Earth Day Cruise around the San Francisco Bay.\nTickets were sold for three special Earth Day Cruises with 100% of the proceeds donated to Save the Bay, an organization dedicated to protecting, restoring and celebrating the San Francisco Bay. \u00a0Representatives from Save the Bay were present to educate all Earth Day cruisers about the importance of habitat restoration for a healthy bay.\nThe event was a great success, enjoyed by green enthusiasts, families, students and cruisers who were just looking to enjoy a sunny day on the beautiful San Francisco Bay. \u00a0We look forward to making our Earth Day Cruise onboard the Hornblower Hybrid an annual event, and look forward to seeing you next year!\nPosted at 08:44 AM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n04/21/2009\n"}, {"score": 1179.3163, "uuid": "4519b7ca-1945-5e0a-9e2e-9fda48a93913", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1403wb-86-04621", "target_hostname": "www.therefinishingtouch.com", "target_uri": "http://www.therefinishingtouch.com/blog/labels/Green.html", "page_rank": 1.3039323e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Environmentally</em>-<em>Friendly</em> Furniture Refinishing, Remanufacturing and Re-upholstery", "snippet": "Here at The Refinishing Touch, it <em>is</em> no secret that we&#x27;ve been walking the green road since we were founded in 1977.

Neither are schools with a green curriculum. Schools that use their green design as a key component of a green curriculum, though, are much harder to find.\nThe Valley View Middle School in Snohomish, Washington does just that. The building follows all of the tenets of green design, but uses its architectural and sustainable features to teach students. All of Valley View\u2019s mechanical equipment, ranging from boilers to water systems, is color-coded and visible to students. This allows the students to, for example, watch rain water travel through pipes to be reused in bathrooms.\nThe Da Vinci Arts Middle School in Portland, Oregon uses the same teaching methodologies. In addition to a net-zero music room and a water garden for collecting storm water, Da Vinci Arts allows students to track energy use from the school\u2019s photovoltaic solar panels, donated by the Bonneville Environmental Foundation .\nWith an environmental slant, school buildings themselves can turn into a teaching tool, an able supplement to the lessons learned inside, and teachers can see both students and their buildings at work.\nposted by TRT Blog on Friday, April 9, 2010 at 9:00 AM 0 Comments\nEco-hotels: beautiful buildings, beautiful impact\nOftentimes we like to discuss \u201cSustainability around the world\u201d and look at how different companies and organizations in different countries apply sustainable ideas and ideals to their work. Our favorite posts are, of course, the ones about hotels\u00e2\u0080\u0094we\u2019re always excited to see when a hotel on another continent adopts new energy-saving practices or uses recycled materials in innovative ways, which is why this article on Treehugger around design-savvy eco-hotels caught our eye.\nThe hotels themselves are visually striking: in one case, a geodesic dome blends into its Swiss Alps surroundings, and in another, picture windows frame rooms overlooking an English cliff. But these designs stand out even more because the level of thought extends beyond aesthetic appeal.\nFor example, the ALT Hotel in Quebec, Canada uses a green heating system recovers heat from laundry water and exhaust, helping to save 7 kg of CO2 per room every day. At the 968 Park Hotel in Lake Tahoe, California, denim from blue jeans are used for insulation and an old pool fence was recycled to make furniture for its lobby.\nA number of hotels go the extra mile to stand out design-wise and, increasingly, sustainability-wise.

How schools apply their environmental focuses varies: some high schools teach vocational skills, like how to install solar panels and insulation. Elementary schools take a different approach, teaching students introductory lessons about recycling and habitats.\nEven with a well-designed, scalable curriculum, these schools face the challenge of appealing to a broad range of students. To do so, they tap into local resources, investigating contamination of Brooklyn\u2019s Gowanus Canal or the ecological implications of razing homes. Through the development of practical skills and conceptual frameworks, students are meant to about more than the environment, but that their choices make an impact in the world around them.\nParents and teachers are part of a generation that is learning how to become environmentally conscious.

These Olympics see the realization of more than 12 years of careful planning, and then, only 16 days after they began, they\u2019ll be gone.\nThe city of Vancouver will be left with more than sporting memories though. In these past 12 years, Olympics planners haven\u2019t just been structuring events schedules and sketching logos; they\u2019ve also been determining what kind of legacy they want to leave in British Columbia. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Games (VANOC) took a big step in crafting that legacy by creating the Sustainability Stars program , which recognizes initiatives by sponsors, partners and VANOC itself that promote social, economic and environmental sustainability.\nSustainability Star awardees thus far include Purolator, which created a battery-operated electric delivery vehicle called the Quicksider for Vancouver\u2019s couriers. The Quicksider generates 99 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than traditional courier vehicles. The City of Vancouver\u2019s LiveCity Yaletown project , paved with recycled rubber tires, also earned a star. More sustainable than brick or asphalt, the pavers will be used in other parts of the city after the Games end. Teck and the Royal Canadian Mint\u2019s Metal for Medals program is another star recipient. Teck provided metal from e-waste as part of the winners\u2019 medals, created by the Mint, for both the Vancouver Olympics and Paralympics.\nVancouver and the rest of the world will see its share of memorable performances and world records over the course of the 2010 Winter Olympics, the kind of moments that stay with spectators for a long time. These memories are to be cherished, but the Sustainability Stars program ensures that that Vancouver will see its Olympic legacy throughout the city, in tangible, environmentally-conscious ways.\nLabels: 2010 , Environment , Green , Olympics , Vancouver\nposted by TRT Blog on Friday, February 19, 2010 at 9:00 AM 0 Comments\nKeeping it Green: Interview with Karl Van Orsdol, Sustainability Leader and Energy Risk Manager for the City of Palo Alto\nIn December, we wrote about the City of Palo Alto, California and their web conference with AltaTerra Research called Carbon Footprint Reduction for the Long Haul . One of the key voices behind the conference was that of Karl Van Orsdol, Sustainability Leader and Energy Risk Manager for the City of Palo Alto. Karl was kind enough to take some time to talk to TRT and share his thoughts on sustainability as the first to take part in our series of \u201cKeeping it Green\u201d interviews.\nWhat inspired you to get involved in sustainability?\nI have always been inspired and awed by the natural environment. Starting out as a tropical biologist, I realized that forest use by timber companies, water use by power companies, and industry were major threats to the natural environment. So I focused my career on the interface between business and the environment. Sustainability is a natural outcome of that evolution. Sustainability is business and people acting to preserve nature and natural resources for future generations.\nWhat does your job involve?\nI work to help the City of Palo Alto develop and manage renewable power. At this point, about 70% of the City\u2019s electricity comes from renewable, non-fossil sources. I also manage the City\u2019s Greenhouse gas emissions work, where we are working to cut emissions by 15% by 2012 from their 2005 levels. This involves setting up an enterprise-wide system for monitoring electricity, natural gas, water, gasoline, diesel and compressed natural gas use in our fleet of 130 facilities and 600 vehicles. We are also looking at reducing our CO2 by ensure all products that are recyclable are not discarded.\nWhat\u2019s the best example of sustainability you\u2019ve come across?\nThis is a tough question. Certainly some European cities, especially in Scandanavia, have developed renewable energy, public transportation, and 100% recycling programs that are clear leaders and which we in government in the US are trying to model. The key is to maximize sustainability while maintaining and improving living conditions.\nWhat\u2019s the most difficult element of your job? Do you find it challenging to motivate others to be sustainable?\nThe most difficult part of the job involves motivating myself and others to be sustainable. People want to be sustainable and want to make the right choices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or at least if they knew the impact of some decisions and had lower cost options available, they would choose those options. Motivating myself and others to continually look at what they do, what choices they make, and to see if there are better options is challenging sometimes. You can\u2019t aim to achieve perfection, but if you can do the 80:20 rule, we would be so much closer to a sustainable future than we are now.\nIf you could enforce everyone to follow one sustainable initiative, law, or regulation, what would it be?\nI don\u2019t think enforcement works. I much prefer providing options that take into account the true environmental costs of actions, and letting people choose. Ultimately, if we fully account for the hidden costs of environmental degradation in products and services, people would make the lower cost, environmentally sustainable, choice. What we need to do is ensure that those costs are fully incorporated into products and services.\nWho is your green icon?\nThe rural people of sub-Saharan Africa. In my years of working with them they show a resourcefulness in recycling, a lack of conspicuous consumption and an ability to live within the natural environment that is amazing.\nWhat do you do in your everyday life to be more sustainable?\nIn California we have a looming water issue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so we reuse our dish and shower water to water houseplants and the lawn. We keep what lawn grass we have long to reduce water demands. We minimize our driving whenever possible and when we do drive, we use a hybrid. We manage our energy use very closely. We try to buy less, and when we do buy, we buy locally. Despite our efforts, our personal GHG emissions are still non-sustainable in the long run.\nHow can people make an everyday difference with regards to sustainability? Do you have an simple tip that can easily help people live more sustainably?\nThe two biggest factors in greenhouse gas emissions are electricity use and transportation. Keep your home heated or cooled at a reasonable level; put on a sweater if it\u2019s cold. Try to walk, bike, or take public transport to work at least once a week.\nposted by TRT Blog on Tuesday, January 26, 2010 at 9:00 AM 0 Comments\nFollow the green-brick road\nFor many organizations and hotels, the uncertainty of 2009 means that 2010 needs to start with a definite direction. But where to head?\nIn 1900 L. Frank Baum published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, also known as the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Great American fairytale\u2019. The story resonated with readers across the globe, with engaging characters, narcoleptic fields of poppies, winged monkeys and the notion that \u00e2\u0080\u0098there\u2019s no place like home\u2019. When a tornado lands her in Oz (on the Wicked Witch of the East) Dorothy finds herself wondering where to head after being told to see the wizard in Emerald City for help in getting back home. She\u2019s in an unknown land and doesn\u2019t know quite what to do.\nMany hotels, recovering from the tornado of the 2009 economy, find themselves in a similar bewildered state. They\u2019re in an unknown land \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one full of low occupancy rates, harsh business conditions, increased competition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with no given directions. Where do they head now?\nThere may not be a yellow brick road to follow, but a greener path continues to present itself for industry leaders to follow as a means to achieve more sustainable business practices in whatever way possible.\nRefurnishing and refinishing are two ways that businesses can help themselves as they continue on their way in 2010. From hotels in need of updating accommodations to provide modern and pleasing d\u00e9cor for guests at reduced costs, to colleges that need to update dorm rooms with slashed budgets, reviewing alternatives to \u00e2\u0080\u0098rip and replace\u2019 are not only environmentally-friendly, they\u2019re green \u00e2\u0080\u0093 good for the planet, the business, and its reputation.\nBusinesses are more prepared now than ever for the challenges that might present themselves along the way. Similar to America\u2019s beloved fairytale, the business challenge of 2010 will demand a brain, a heart and courage to push us along. In terms of direction, we know that the green-brick road is a solid start and look forward to the adventures we are bound to meet along the way.\nposted by TRT Blog on Tuesday, January 5, 2010 at 9:00 AM 0 Comments\nFarewell 2009 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hello innovation, recovery, and 2010\nWell, it\u2019s our final post of 2009. It\u2019s been a bumpy year for the economy, and by relation, many businesses and organizations. Though on a brighter note, the beat of the \u201cgreen drum\u201d has increased throughout the year as global eyes, ears and tongues turned to sustainability. In 2010 this beat will continue.\nA recurring theme that we\u2019ve written and talked about in 2009 has been the application of innovation and technology to support and drive sustainability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just our own innovations, but others across an array of goods and services that impact businesses and consumers. So, we thought we\u2019d finish 2009 with the Cleantech Group \u2019s 2010 green technology predictions.\nAs reported by Reuters , the group\u2019s predictions for 2010 include:\n- Clean economies become the new space race. There will be changes in which countries and cities are driving global momentum, but greater protectionism surrounding the industry will be a drawback.\n- Electric cars take the back seat to smart mobility. The trend will influence city designs, shipping ports and governments\u2019 tax incentives and budgets.\n- Resource constraints beyond carbon rise to the fore. As the global economy picks up, there could be price spikes that impact clean technology sectors, pushing companies to use resources more efficiently in order to maintain or boost their profitability.\n- Commodity trade-off debates intensify, in particular in the areas of water and energy; land and energy; land and water and carbon and water. The group predicts that more environmentalists will object to wind and solar projects because of how they use up swaths of land and other reasons, slowing down projects\u2019 progress.\n- Energy efficiency eclipses solar. Information and communication technology, along with more policy support, will help create a boom in energy efficiency. The sector could outshine solar, so far a clean tech darling of investors.\n- Marketing suddenly matters. The group predicts that companies will have to distinguish themselves and employ branding as clean technology goes mainstream. Marketing campaigns are likely to target more consumers instead of just businesses.\n- Buffett leads the super rich into cleantech. The group points out how U.S. billionaire investor Warren Buffett has made plays in clean tech-related companies, including GE, Goldman Sachs and Chinese electric car battery maker BYD Co Ltd. The group argues that energy efficiency factors partly influenced Buffett\u2019s acquisition of the nation\u2019s largest rail company Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp .\n- Acquisitions and consolidations accelerate. The group predicts that many Chinese wind and solar companies will be gone by the end of 2010. That will happen, the group argues, even as China\u2019s market for renewable energy grows and despite the government\u2019s investments in high profile companies like solarpanel makers Suntech and Yingli.\n- The rise of waste-to-energy, geothermal and aquaculture, as part of a shift to more sustainable agriculture and food production.\nWhen it comes to sustainability and green practices, we can each play our part. As the drive for more sustainable practices continues to build momentum, we\u2019ve seen innovators in core industries set themselves apart with their commitments and capabilities.\nWe\u2019ll raise our glasses to the innovators that set the bar for sustainable practices and show the world the direction to the green-bricked road. We simply can\u2019t wait to see all that 2010 promises to be and more. We have a number of interesting announcements we\u2019ll be making ourselves to benefit our customers and the communities we serve - it\u2019s going to be an exciting year.\nHappy New Year from all of here at The Refinishing Touch!\nposted by TRT Blog on Thursday, December 31, 2009 at 12:17 PM 0 Comments\nG8 leaders agree\nTRT has been taking great interest in the G8 summit , which is the first attended by President Obama.\nAs ever, green is on the menu, led by climate change. There are negotiations, ideas and debates and as expected, final decisions are hard to come by. A deal for G8 nations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 plus\nIndia\nand\nChina\n- to reach a unanimous 2050 decision on carbon gas emissions was quickly dispatched after the developing nations ruled for a stronger commitment by 2020 from the developed nations, including the\nUS\n, on emissions.\nHowever, all is not lost. This summit has been hailed as 'historic' due to all the G8 nations and 17 developing nations accepting a two-degree goal to limit the rate at which the world is warming. Michael Froman, President Obama's top negotiator on international economic issues, said the declaration 'represents a significant step forward in terms of adding political momentum.' Other topics being discussed are the fragile state of the global economy, and farming initiatives in the developing world.\nWatching the G8 announcements, as an individual, family or a business, it's easy to feel that not enough is being achieved on issues such as climate change. But keep in mind the scale of the changes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the population of the countries involved, the global impact of even the smallest decisions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is a glimmer of hope, and incremental successes will lead to larger ones. We all live in hope, and that's not a bad thing.\nposted by TRT Blog on Friday, July 10, 2009 at 9:43 AM 0 Comments\nFlorida puts green jobs first\nFollowing our recent post about the top green cities in the\nUS\n, and in the spirit of that theme we were interested to see\nFlorida\nAccording to business owners and a director from PEW Center on the States ,\nFlorida\ngreen business owners are creating new jobs, although consistent funding and policy support is needed.\nFlorida\nhas also been noted by PEW Charitable Trusts for having its clean energy economy grow by 7.9% between 1998 and 2007 and is now within the top ten for green jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is brilliant news for the state.\nLori Grange, Interim Deputy Director of\nPEW\non the states, feels that\nFlorida\nis only behind other states because of public policy questions. In this she noted\nFlorida\n's failure to succeed with Governor Charlie Crist's proposed renewable energy portfolio standard . For\nFlorida\nto have embraced this, a proportion of the state's energy would have to be produced from renewable sources. And while this isn't happening in\nFlorida\n, it's already happening in 29 other states.\nFlorida\nalso hasn't become involved in regional carbon and climate change initiatives, but Grange pointed out that is it developing its own carbon cap and trade program.\nFlorida\nwas among one of the top 10 states for jobs in clean energy in 2007, and half of its $116,980,000 of venture capital funds over the last three years has gone toward supporting clean energy generation.\nIn the whole of the\nUS\n, jobs in clean energy grew by 9.1%, while total jobs grew by only 3.7% - a fantastic comparison \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at The Refinishing Touch we applaud all initiatives that boost green employment, create awareness and, of course, encourage sustainability.\nposted by TRT Blog on Tuesday, July 7, 2009 at 2:53 PM 0 Comments\nWho's the greenest of them all? Ranking of US cities at MNN\nHere at TRT we like to keep an eye on who's doing what in the world of sustainability. We think this list of top green cities in the US from one of our favorite green communities - Mother Nature Network \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is a fascinating insight into how communities are transforming themselves to embrace sustainability and reduce their carbon footprint.\nCities were judged on air and water quality, efficient recycling and management of waste, percentage of LEED certified buildings, acres of land devoted to greenspace, use of renewable energy sources, and easy access to products and services that make a green life style choice easy.\nAustin, Texas comes in at number ten.\nAustin\naims to be carbon neutral by 2020 and with Austin Energy being the nation's largest provider of renewable energy this goal looks set to be achieved. At number nine is Chicago , with its historical focus on sustainability since 1909, when a pioneering planner named Daniel Hudson Burnham created a long term plan and a permanent green belt around the city.\nSeattle comes in at number eight with 20 LEED-certified public buildings and incentives to encourage residents to install solar panels. Berkeley, California ranks seventh as a recognized leader in the incubation of clean technology for power including wind, solar, bio-fuels and hydro.\nAt number six is Cambridge, Massachusetts , which implemented a climate protection plan in 2002. Today almost all city vehicles are fuelled by biodiesel or electricity, and all new constructions must meet LEED standards. Number five, Eugene, Oregon , lives up to its image of natural green beauty by offering 30 miles of off street bike paths and 29 bike routes.\nOakland, California is at number four with the nation's cleanest tap water, hydrogen powered public transit and plans to have zero waste and oil-independence by 2020.\nMassachusetts\nscores again with Boston at number three with a green deadline set for 2015 complete with hybrid taxi cabs, solar panel and electric motorbikes.\nThe second greenest city is San Francisco ; it boasts an impressive recycling program, which has an artist present to inspire individuals. It was also the first\nUS\ncity to ban plastic grocery bags which aims to reduce 75% of landfill waste by 2010.\nBut at number one is Portland ,\nOregon\n, which was voted the top green city for many reasons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including its claim as the most bike-able city in the\nUS\nwith more than 200 miles of bike lanes, and a focus on sustainable living with residents encouraged to take DIY classes in gardening, cheese making, beekeeping and chicken keeping.\nAlthough it's not an exhaustive list, this is a great snapshot of how communities across\nAmerica\nare working to protect the environment. Promoting good practices in this way is a great way to inspire individuals and community leaders.\nposted by TRT Blog on Tuesday, June 30, 2009 at 11:47 AM 0 Comments\nYeehaw!

Since the time of steam power, engines have evolved to serve different purposes. Fleets have upgraded accordingly, and companies have stood by engines that work best for them.\nToday, businesses that operate fleets are beginning to experiment with new types of engines considered to be more fuel-efficient. City buses in Chicago, for example, are gradually moving toward hybrid and electric alternatives. However, the standard for most fleets of vehicles still comes down to the choice of diesel vs. gas trucks.\nBelow, we have explained some of the key differences between diesel and gasoline engines.\nPhysical Difference\n\u201cDiesel\u201d simply refers to a type of internal combustion engine. To commence ignition, this system relies on the heat from compression to burn fuel that is injected into the engine\u2019s combustion chamber. Diesel engines were among the first developed and were originally designed to replace steam engines.\nBy comparison, a gasoline engine uses a spark-ignition system to run solely on gasoline. The difference is how it mixes the fuel, air and a spark to trigger the combustion process. For gasoline engines, the fuel and air are mixed prior to combustion in the carburetor or via an electronic fuel injection system. Gasoline engines operate more quickly than diesel engines because of lighter components.\nWhen to Choose a Diesel Engine Vehicle\nAs a rule of thumb, if your fleet is traveling shorter distances, gasoline is your better option, as diesel engines are better suited for long-distance travel. However, if your vehicle must haul heavy equipment or a trailer, even if the distance is short, a diesel truck engine could be preferable.\nEconomics\nDiesel fuel is generally more expensive than gasoline, but not by much. In October 2011, the national average showed a difference of about 30 cents per gallon. The difference is all but wiped out when you consider the efficiency of the fuel you are using. Diesel engines, especially when used for long distances, are considerably more efficient, and diesel fuel could actually end up costing less. By contrast, a gasoline engine could be cheaper for fleets that make shorter trips.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nThere is a growing concern regarding the environmental implications of today\u2019s transportation options. Governments worldwide are inclined to reward businesses that opt for newer technology, such as hybrid engines and electric vehicles. However, the debate between diesel and gasoline engines as the more environmentally friendly option is unsettled.\nNaturally, the vapors released by diesel engines have been the cause of much of the debate. While it\u2019s true that modern diesel engines have significantly reduced the vapors they emit, the levels are still higher than with gasoline engines. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that gasoline engines release more carbon dioxide, which has been said to contribute to global climate change.\nAnother argument in favor of diesel engines says that because the engines are more efficient for longer trips, they are the environmentally friendly option for certain transportation fleets.\nWhen making your decision, consider the purpose of your fleet and weigh the pros and cons of each.\nAt Track Your Truck, we are committed to helping you improve your fleet.

The design of the XR3 Hybrid is based on existing technologies and a vehicle \"personality\" that makes conserving energy a fun driving experience. It showcases the design ideas explored in Robert Q. Riley's book, Alternative Cars in the 21st Century.\nAt just 1480 pounds, this high-performance design combines fast acceleration, a maximum speed of 80 mph, and fuel economy of 125- to over 200-mpg.\nIts clam-shell canopy and three-wheel platform boldly differentiates the XR3 from conventional passenger cars. The vehicle's hybrid power system, diesel engine, and low curb weight are the main ingredients of its super-high fuel economy and excellent performance. Acceleration equal to that of a conventional car and a maximum speed of 80 mph make the XR3 Hybrid equally at home on freeways and surface streets.\nPlans enable people with common building skills to build a duplicate of the XR3 Hybrid prototype.\u00a0 Or using the technical information in the construction manual, readers will understand the factors that influence fuel economy, and learn how to make any car achieve greater fuel economy. The XR3 Hybrid gives enthusiasts and experimenters the opportunity to significantly reduce their transportation expenses and have fun doing it. On a broader level, the vehicle is a highly visible example of the kinds of vehicles that could help reduce personal mobility energy.\nThe Technology of Fuel Economy\nThe vehicle's performance and fuel economy comes from a combination of two fundamental design factors. First, it is essential to keep the vehicle as light as possible in order to reduce the amount of mechanical \"work\" that has to be done. The method of getting rid of unwanted mass while still keeping the car's mechanical benefits demands good design and modern materials. Once the amount of \"work\" has been minimized, then the other part of the equation is to do the remaining \"work\" as efficiently as possible. And that's where the hybrid power system comes in. So the fundamental approach is very simple.\nPlug-In Hybrid Architecture\nThe XR3 is a \"plug-in hybrid.\" This makes it possible to drive on battery power alone on trips of about 40 miles. And when both the diesel and the battery-electric systems are used in series, fuel economy increases to over 200-mpg. Fuel economy is about 125-mpg on diesel power alone.\nToday's hybrids are called \"mild hybrids\" or \"charge-maintaining hybrids\". They use the electric system to help with acceleration. You can drive on battery power alone, but only for a short distance; around the block, for example. The battery pack is small and contains only enough energy for brief periods of acceleration. The combustion engine then recharges the battery between acceleration cycles. But fuel economy suffers while the battery is being recharged due to the extra drag placed on the combustion engine. That's why today's hybrids provide only a limited improvement in fuel economy.\nIn order to get the full benefits of a hybrid power system, designers must switch to the plug-in hybrid architecture. Plug-ins will be the next generation of hybrid vehicles. A plug-in hybrid simply means that part or all of the vehicle's energy is taken from the grid system where it is cleaner and less costly to produce. Most of the world's automakers are now working on plug-in hybrids.\nVirtually Unlimited Options for the Builder\nThe plug-in architecture also allows much greater flexibility in power system choices. With a mild hybrid, like the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius (also called \"charge-maintaining hybrids\"), proper control of the power system depends on having known operating characteristics of the subsystems - the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric systems. Subsystems are selected in advance and controlled by a computer. The computer, however, can properly manage integration of subsystems only when the output characteristics of the two systems are predefined and fixed. Any modification in either of the power systems (electric or ICE) can cause the control system to operate incorrectly.\nWith the XR3, the two front wheels are powered by the combustion engine, and the single rear wheel is electric powered. These two power systems are not connected within the vehicle and they are not integrated by a computer. The connection between the conventional and electric power systems is provided by the ground. Proper phase-in between the two power systems is handled by a simple throttle mechanism and dash-mounted switches that let the driver select between ICE power, electric power, and dual (hybrid) power modes. In the hybrid operating mode, the XR3 has lots of burst power for quick acceleration. If you were to use this acceleration potential to its fullest, fuel economy will be reduced. Fuel economy will also vary according the particular components chosen for the power system. Performance figures quoted here are for a conservatively-driven vehicle having a system configured just like the prototype. Plans provide the information necessary for selecting different components in order to modify the vehicle's performance characteristics.\nRemovable Front Clip & Canopy\nThe canopy and the entire front of the body are removable. Removing the front body section (normally called the \"front clip\") provides complete access to engine and suspension components for major servicing.\nThis removable front clip can be restyled and extended to provide additional forward space for a more powerful engine. With a larger engine you can have big-engine performance and still retain the ability to run on battery power alone. The existing 65-pound (29.5 kg) transmission will handle up to 300 horsepower (223 kW).\nThe removable canopy provides another level of freedom. A different windshield can be installed to create an open-air roadster effect.\nSafety Features\nThe front portion of the front clip is foam-filled to absorb low-speed frontal impacts. It also serves as an easily replaceable sacrificial element in the event of a frontal collision. The sides of the vehicle are filled with foam to provide side intrusion protection. This foam-filled region, varying in thickness from 5 inches to more than 10 inches, extends from the front wheel wells to the rear bulkhead of the passenger zone, and vertically from the canopy parting line to the bottom of the passenger zone. The design is significantly more resistant to side intrusion than the doors of conventional cars.\nA composite roll bar is built into the perimeter of the panel that defines the rear of the passenger zone. In addition, the canopy is equipped with a tubular steel perimeter frame which is reinforced by steel \"A\" pillar members. This provides excellent rollover protection.\nAn open interior having no conventional instrument panel or steering column provides forward excursion space for occupant deceleration during a frontal collision. Controlled deceleration is provided by conventional seat belts.\nThere is no conventional steering column. The steering wheel is supported from the side. The supporting structure is designed to break away in a frontal collision. It is not designed to resist/carry the loads that would typically be imposed by the forward excursion of the driver.\n(During a frontal collision, air bags prevent occupants from impacting the interior of the vehicle. Air bags are unnecessary in the absence of nearby interior structures that may be impacted by forward excursion of occupants.)\nConstruction Costs\nConstruction costs are highly variable because of the many choices available due to the XR3's design. It's a modular design that lets builders make choices according to their budget and performance goals. More than half the cost of parts for the XR3 prototype went to the electric propulsion system. Electric propulsion components alone cost more than the cost to build the entire remainder of the vehicle, including the diesel power train.\nAt the upper limit, a duplicate of our Li-Ion-powered prototype will top $25,000. If you switch to lead-acid batteries, you can save the difference in cost between the two types of battery systems. Li-Ion batteries in the prototype cost about $7,500 ($9,000 delivered with a battery management module) and a lead-acid battery pack will cost between $1,500 and $2,000.\nAt the bottom end of the scale, a diesel-only vehicle capable of achieving 125-mpg can be built for less than $10,000. And the modularity of the design allows you to begin with a diesel-only vehicle then add the electric power train components later on. It's simply a matter of leaving off the unwanted components. With a diesel-only version, you can enlarge the 3-gallon fuel tank to 9 gallons and end up with a range of over 1,000 miles on a single fill-up.\nSimilar options are available with a battery-only vehicle. One can simply leave off the combustion power system, install more batteries in the extra space up front, and end up with a BEV capable of driving 100 miles on a charge. Li-ion batteries can be recharged in about two-hours.\u00a0 A full recharge of lead-acid batteries normally takes 6 to 8 hours.\nThese cost-related choices also affect the performance of the vehicle. For example, leaving off the electric propulsion system reduces vehicle weight from nearly 1500 pounds to about 950 pounds. This improves diesel-only fuel economy and acceleration.\nPlans\nPlans are available in three variations, Standard, Deluxe, and Plans-on-Disc.\u00a0 The Standard Plans Package is $170.

The design of the XR3 Hybrid is based on existing technologies and a vehicle \"personality\" that makes conserving energy a fun driving experience. It showcases the design ideas explored in Robert Q. Riley's book, Alternative Cars in the 21st Century.\nAt just 1480 pounds, this high-performance design combines fast acceleration, a maximum speed of 80 mph, and fuel economy of 125- to over 200-mpg.\nIts clam-shell canopy and three-wheel platform boldly differentiates the XR3 from conventional passenger cars. The vehicle's hybrid power system, diesel engine, and low curb weight are the main ingredients of its super-high fuel economy and excellent performance. Acceleration equal to that of a conventional car and a maximum speed of 80 mph make the XR3 Hybrid equally at home on freeways and surface streets.\nPlans enable people with common building skills to build a duplicate of the XR3 Hybrid prototype.\u00a0 Or using the technical information in the construction manual, readers will understand the factors that influence fuel economy, and learn how to make any car achieve greater fuel economy. The XR3 Hybrid gives enthusiasts and experimenters the opportunity to significantly reduce their transportation expenses and have fun doing it. On a broader level, the vehicle is a highly visible example of the kinds of vehicles that could help reduce personal mobility energy.\nThe Technology of Fuel Economy\nThe vehicle's performance and fuel economy comes from a combination of two fundamental design factors. First, it is essential to keep the vehicle as light as possible in order to reduce the amount of mechanical \"work\" that has to be done. The method of getting rid of unwanted mass while still keeping the car's mechanical benefits demands good design and modern materials. Once the amount of \"work\" has been minimized, then the other part of the equation is to do the remaining \"work\" as efficiently as possible. And that's where the hybrid power system comes in. So the fundamental approach is very simple.\nPlug-In Hybrid Architecture\nThe XR3 is a \"plug-in hybrid.\" This makes it possible to drive on battery power alone on trips of about 40 miles. And when both the diesel and the battery-electric systems are used in series, fuel economy increases to over 200-mpg. Fuel economy is about 125-mpg on diesel power alone.\nToday's hybrids are called \"mild hybrids\" or \"charge-maintaining hybrids\". They use the electric system to help with acceleration. You can drive on battery power alone, but only for a short distance; around the block, for example. The battery pack is small and contains only enough energy for brief periods of acceleration. The combustion engine then recharges the battery between acceleration cycles. But fuel economy suffers while the battery is being recharged due to the extra drag placed on the combustion engine. That's why today's hybrids provide only a limited improvement in fuel economy.\nIn order to get the full benefits of a hybrid power system, designers must switch to the plug-in hybrid architecture. Plug-ins will be the next generation of hybrid vehicles. A plug-in hybrid simply means that part or all of the vehicle's energy is taken from the grid system where it is cleaner and less costly to produce. Most of the world's automakers are now working on plug-in hybrids.\nVirtually Unlimited Options for the Builder\nThe plug-in architecture also allows much greater flexibility in power system choices. With a mild hybrid, like the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius (also called \"charge-maintaining hybrids\"), proper control of the power system depends on having known operating characteristics of the subsystems - the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric systems. Subsystems are selected in advance and controlled by a computer. The computer, however, can properly manage integration of subsystems only when the output characteristics of the two systems are predefined and fixed. Any modification in either of the power systems (electric or ICE) can cause the control system to operate incorrectly.\nWith the XR3, the two front wheels are powered by the combustion engine, and the single rear wheel is electric powered. These two power systems are not connected within the vehicle and they are not integrated by a computer. The connection between the conventional and electric power systems is provided by the ground. Proper phase-in between the two power systems is handled by a simple throttle mechanism and dash-mounted switches that let the driver select between ICE power, electric power, and dual (hybrid) power modes. In the hybrid operating mode, the XR3 has lots of burst power for quick acceleration. If you were to use this acceleration potential to its fullest, fuel economy will be reduced. Fuel economy will also vary according the particular components chosen for the power system. Performance figures quoted here are for a conservatively-driven vehicle having a system configured just like the prototype. Plans provide the information necessary for selecting different components in order to modify the vehicle's performance characteristics.\nRemovable Front Clip & Canopy\nThe canopy and the entire front of the body are removable. Removing the front body section (normally called the \"front clip\") provides complete access to engine and suspension components for major servicing.\nThis removable front clip can be restyled and extended to provide additional forward space for a more powerful engine. With a larger engine you can have big-engine performance and still retain the ability to run on battery power alone. The existing 65-pound (29.5 kg) transmission will handle up to 300 horsepower (223 kW).\nThe removable canopy provides another level of freedom. A different windshield can be installed to create an open-air roadster effect.\nSafety Features\nThe front portion of the front clip is foam-filled to absorb low-speed frontal impacts. It also serves as an easily replaceable sacrificial element in the event of a frontal collision. The sides of the vehicle are filled with foam to provide side intrusion protection. This foam-filled region, varying in thickness from 5 inches to more than 10 inches, extends from the front wheel wells to the rear bulkhead of the passenger zone, and vertically from the canopy parting line to the bottom of the passenger zone. The design is significantly more resistant to side intrusion than the doors of conventional cars.\nA composite roll bar is built into the perimeter of the panel that defines the rear of the passenger zone. In addition, the canopy is equipped with a tubular steel perimeter frame which is reinforced by steel \"A\" pillar members. This provides excellent rollover protection.\nAn open interior having no conventional instrument panel or steering column provides forward excursion space for occupant deceleration during a frontal collision. Controlled deceleration is provided by conventional seat belts.\nThere is no conventional steering column. The steering wheel is supported from the side. The supporting structure is designed to break away in a frontal collision. It is not designed to resist/carry the loads that would typically be imposed by the forward excursion of the driver.\n(During a frontal collision, air bags prevent occupants from impacting the interior of the vehicle. Air bags are unnecessary in the absence of nearby interior structures that may be impacted by forward excursion of occupants.)\nConstruction Costs\nConstruction costs are highly variable because of the many choices available due to the XR3's design. It's a modular design that lets builders make choices according to their budget and performance goals. More than half the cost of parts for the XR3 prototype went to the electric propulsion system. Electric propulsion components alone cost more than the cost to build the entire remainder of the vehicle, including the diesel power train.\nAt the upper limit, a duplicate of our Li-Ion-powered prototype will top $25,000. If you switch to lead-acid batteries, you can save the difference in cost between the two types of battery systems. Li-Ion batteries in the prototype cost about $7,500 ($9,000 delivered with a battery management module) and a lead-acid battery pack will cost between $1,500 and $2,000.\nAt the bottom end of the scale, a diesel-only vehicle capable of achieving 125-mpg can be built for less than $10,000. And the modularity of the design allows you to begin with a diesel-only vehicle then add the electric power train components later on. It's simply a matter of leaving off the unwanted components. With a diesel-only version, you can enlarge the 3-gallon fuel tank to 9 gallons and end up with a range of over 1,000 miles on a single fill-up.\nSimilar options are available with a battery-only vehicle. One can simply leave off the combustion power system, install more batteries in the extra space up front, and end up with a BEV capable of driving 100 miles on a charge. Li-ion batteries can be recharged in about two-hours.\u00a0 A full recharge of lead-acid batteries normally takes 6 to 8 hours.\nThese cost-related choices also affect the performance of the vehicle. For example, leaving off the electric propulsion system reduces vehicle weight from nearly 1500 pounds to about 950 pounds. This improves diesel-only fuel economy and acceleration.\nPlans\nPlans are available in three variations, Standard, Deluxe, and Plans-on-Disc.\u00a0 The Standard Plans Package is $170.

This enables them to deliver improved fuel economy and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Most can run in electric-only mode, which means zero-emissions. This is particularly beneficial in cities and during stop-start driving at low-speeds.\nHow do they work?\nHybrid cars use both a petrol engine and electric motors, and the energy used by the electric motors is stored in rechargeable batteries. The car has a computer system which decides which energy source to use at different times, based on maximizing efficiency.\nHowever, a Channel 4 study of hybrid vehicles explains there are different hybrid systems, which use different combinations of energy sources.\nThe study says, 'The Honda Insight, for example, will use the petrol engine only when moving off from rest and at low speeds, but when accelerating, its computer asks the electric motor to chip in with extra help. As cruising speeds are reached, the electric motor is turned off, leaving petrol power only. As the driver starts to slow down \u2013 and this is the clever bit \u2013 the electric motor becomes a generator and transfers the kinetic energy of the car into the battery as electric power.\n'This is called 'regenerative braking'. Whenever the car comes to a stop, the computer turns off the engine to save fuel and CO2 emissions.'\nHow green is your car?\nElectric and hybrid cars are in the Department for Transport\u2019s A or B rating bands \u2013 the tops bands \u2013 for being the most environmentally friendly of today\u2019s cars. This means their CO2 emissions are below 100g/km (Band A) or between 101 and 120g/km (Band B). The rating guide runs from A through to G.\nDisadvantages\nSome of the disadvantages of using a hybrid car include the following:\nThey can be expensive to buy compared with conventional cars\nHybrids are not as cost-efficient for people doing mainly motorway mileage\nDriving in cities can sap the batteries, which means the petrol engine has to take over\nBoot space can be limited as space is taken by the electric power-train and batteries\nBattery toxicity is a concern, though today's hybrids use recyclable NiMH batteries, not NiCad\nCounting the cost\nHybrid cars are popular, and are therefore holding their resale values at present. But, the Channel 4 study says, 'Overall, given the high purchase costs compared to a mainstream car, a comparable diesel-engine model is often cheaper to run \u2013 and emits less carbon dioxide.'\nWhen it comes to maintenance, a hybrid doesn't tend to cost any more than a conventional car, but dealer service centres can charge a little more for servicing hybrid cars. That said, experts say that it may cost less to maintain a hybrid car, compared with petrol or diesel, due to decreased wear and tear on the engine and braking system.\nIn addition, hybrid battery packs are designed to last for the lifetime of the vehicle, which is somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 miles. This can help to reduce running costs over the life of the car. They can also attract lower tax bandings than petrol counterparts, and are usually exempt from schemes such as London's congestion charge.\nThe future\nHydrogen fuel cell technology is on the horizon and could eventually offer a greener alternative to today\u2019s hybrid car. However, most experts agree that cars powered by hydrogen will not arrive for another 10 to 20 years. Plus, the first hydrogen-powered cars are likely to use more than one energy source, so they\u2019ll be considered hybrid cars too.\nWhatever type of car you chose, Privilege can help you find the right car insurance .\nSources\n"}, {"score": 1134.1101, "uuid": "a3cd3f77-ea97-5b6e-bd49-4b85f6cde79b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-28-23512", "target_hostname": "www.delmarva.com", "target_uri": "http://www.delmarva.com/energy/environment/hybrid/", "page_rank": 1.2498529e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Hybrid</em> Fleet - Delmarva Power", "snippet": "Existing <em>hybrids</em> use both an electric motor and <em>a</em> standard gasoline <em>or</em> <em>diesel</em> engine.

It is an incarnation of a modern and different upmarket range from Peugeot, both in its dimensions and its visual identity, through the choice of a unique hybrid high-tech diesel engine and electric motor with a single, lavishly-appointed trim level.\nIts visual signature is enhanced by its individual front end character, flared wings, daytime running lights signature and a new exclusive body colour.\nThe same special care has played an integral role in the direction taken with the distinctive design of the 508 RXH interior, harmonising specific colours and natural materials.\nWith its wider track, its 18\u2019\u2019 wheels and raised attitude the 508 RXH has a natural stance that is inspired by its all-road capability. Furthermore, due to its HYbrid4 drive train, it offers a responsible and intelligent alternative vision.\nThe diesel-electric hybrid; a new level of driving pleasure\nIllustrating the cross-platform, modular versatility of HYbrid4 technology, the 508 RXH is, after the HYbrid4 3008, the second of the marque\u2019s models to receive the diesel-electric hybrid power plant.\nWith a combined output of 200 bhp from its 2.0 HDi FAP diesel engine and electric motor on the rear axle, the 508 RXH is able to provide for the desires for a new driving experience with a choice of four HYbrid4 modes (Automatic, \u201cZero Emissions Vehicle\u201d, Sport or 4WD) and exceptional fuel economy (4.0 l/100 km (70.6 mpg) in the Combined Drive Cycle, and CO2 of 109 g/km).\nPeugeot is exhibiting a Limited Edition 508 RXH at Frankfurt: the run of 300, individually-numbered examples in Calern Brown with Alcantara leather upholstery can be pre-reserved online from the opening of the Motor Show.\nHX1: MULTI-PURPOSE CONCEPT CAR\nThe HX1, making its worldwide d\u00e9but in Frankfurt, is a concept for gauging interest which has a specification to seat up to six people in a vehicle with unconventional styling: robust, sporty, integrating the new brand identity, unparalleled aerodynamics, and providing a unique interior space and driving experience.\nRising to this challenge, the designers have placed adaptability at the heart of their creation: the HX1 can metamorphose to suit its environment, the driving conditions and the expectations of its occupants.\nSo, due to its many mobile aerodynamic parts that were designed with speed in mind, the HX1\u2019s unusual MPV architecture, very low for a length of 4.93 m, results in an exceptional Cd of 0.28.\nIts four reverse-opening doors provide access to the interior of HX1, the marque\u2019s vision of a high-end passenger compartment, which combines elegance and modernity, natural materials and ultra-high technological specification. It offers its occupants an exceptional level of interior space, an innovative modular design with its original \u201c4+2\u201d configuration, and provides the driver with a driving position that can be adapted to suit driving conditions.\nWith a combined power output of 299 bhp from the 2.2 litre HDi engine driving the front wheels and the electric motor integrated into the rear axle, its diesel-electric hybrid drive train provides the functionality of HYbrid4 technology such as four-wheel drive and the \u2018all electric\u2019 mode with an increased potential range of 30 km (18.6 miles) due to the \u201cplug in\u201d function.\nThe HX1 thus obtains an astonishingly low combined fuel consumption of 3.2 l/100 km (88.2 mpg) with impressive CO2 emissions of 83 g/km.\nPEUGEOT: THE UPMARKET TREND\nAt its stand in Frankfurt, Peugeot is putting its Premium models under the spotlight, a definitive illustration of the marque\u2019s upmarket shift.\n- After a successful launch in Europe in the first half of 2011 (with 57,000 sales by the end of June), then its release onto the Chinese market in August, the 508 is reaffirming the Marque\u2019s ambitions regarding one of its historical territories, the large car.\nThrough its appealing styling, the impressive environmental credentials of its extensive range of engines and cutting-edge technology, along with its pleasant onboard surroundings and the driving experience it provides, the 508 (Saloon or SW) offers a modern range at one with the aspirations of its dynamic, responsible and discerning customers.\n- Since its highly-anticipated launch in spring 2010, the RCZ sports coup\u00e9 has exceeded expectations, and has taken pole position among sports coup\u00e9s in its class in Europe.\nIn Frankfurt, the dynamism of the RCZ is revealed with:\n\u2022 a limited-edition \u201cAsphalt\u201d version which is distinguished from the standard 200 hp version by its Telluric matt grey bodywork, its two-tone 19\u201d wheels and many distinctive \u201cAsphalt\u201d features;\n\u2022 and a 200 bhp 2.0 l HDi version, which was victorious at the 2011 \u201c24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring\u201d in the diesel category, and is the current diesel category leader in the German VLN Endurance Championship.\n- Demand for the 3008 Crossover continues to impress with sales up in the first half of 2011 (74,000) which are once again on the increase with a demand mainly for the range-topping versions.\nEven before the arrival of the 3008 HYbrid4 on the market, the 3008, and the effective way in which the 5008 compact MPV complements it, is enabling Peugeot to stake its claim as a key player in the highly-competitive \u201cmidsize\u201d market.\nPEUGEOT: ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP\nIn Frankfurt, the 508 RXH, the HX1 concept and the 908 Hybrid4 which Peugeot Sport is currently developing, are all demonstrations of Peugeot\u2019s pioneering and determined approach to diesel-electric hybridization.\nYet Peugeot\u2019s environmental commitment is being reflected in practice in 2011, through the major advances that the marque is exhibiting in Frankfurt.\n- Peugeot actively seeks to reduce the CO2 emissions of its vehicle range: the average emissions of the marque\u2019s models were measured in the first half of 2011 at 129.8 g/km CO2 compared to 131.3 in 2010, therefore dropping below the 130 g/km limit set for 2015 by the European Commission.\n- 3008 HYbrid4 - the first Diesel Hybrid in the world\nBy launching the world\u2019s first diesel hybrid vehicle in the second half of 2011, Peugeot is offering an exclusive range in terms of environmentally-friendly functionality and driving pleasure.\nOn the 3008 Crossover, the hybridization of a 2.0 HDi FAP diesel engine developing 163 bhp driving the front wheels and an electric motor developing 37 bhp on the rear axle, can reconcile a new driving experience, through four-wheel drive, a maximum output of 200 bhp, a \u201cZero Emissions Vehicle\u201d mode, and an average fuel consumption of 3.8 l/100 km (74.3 mpg) with 99 g/km CO2), down 35% on an internal combustion engine with a similar power output.\n- e-HDi, micro-hybrid technology\nIn the first half of 2011 the 508 and the new 308 launched the e-HDi innovative technology, the new generation STOP & START System, which reduces fuel consumption by nearly 15% in Urban Drive Cycle, prior to its deployment in the second half of the year on the 3008, the 5008 and PARTNER (Van and Tepee).\ne-HDi combines the 1.6 l HDi Euro 5 engine and a reversible-alternator which provides the STOP & START System function, supplemented by a braking energy recovery system and hybrid battery that delivers additional power at start-up.\n- Electric: 2- or 4-wheel drive\u2026\n\u2022 iOn is a latest-generation all-electric city car, designed for business customers and private individuals. The lithium-ion batteries powering the 64 hp electric motor permit a top speed of 130 km/h (80 mph) and a range of 150 km (93 miles). The distinguished recipient of several awards in Europe, iOn has received over 2,000 orders at the end of June 2011.\n\u2022 At the Peugeot stand in Frankfurt, the e-Vivacity scooter is another illustration of the Marque\u2019s response to new expectations in terms of \u201czero emissions\u201d urban mobility. All-electric, practical and modern, intuitive and nippy; the e-Vivacity offers a range of 60 km (37 miles) and an average energy cost of \u20ac0.4/100 km, thanks to its next generation compact lithium-ion batteries.\n\u2022 But for Peugeot, \u201celectricity\u201d can also mean \u201cintensity\u201d.

It is an incarnation of a modern and different upmarket range from Peugeot, both in its dimensions and its visual identity, through the choice of a unique hybrid high-tech diesel engine and electric motor with a single, lavishly-appointed trim level.\nIts visual signature is enhanced by its individual front end character, flared wings, daytime running lights signature and a new exclusive body colour.\nThe same special care has played an integral role in the direction taken with the distinctive design of the 508 RXH interior, harmonising specific colours and natural materials.\nWith its wider track, its 18\u2019\u2019 wheels and raised attitude the 508 RXH has a natural stance that is inspired by its all-road capability. Furthermore, due to its HYbrid4 drive train, it offers a responsible and intelligent alternative vision.\nThe diesel-electric hybrid; a new level of driving pleasure\nIllustrating the cross-platform, modular versatility of HYbrid4 technology, the 508 RXH is, after the HYbrid4 3008, the second of the marque\u2019s models to receive the diesel-electric hybrid power plant.\nWith a combined output of 200 bhp from its 2.0 HDi FAP diesel engine and electric motor on the rear axle, the 508 RXH is able to provide for the desires for a new driving experience with a choice of four HYbrid4 modes (Automatic, \u201cZero Emissions Vehicle\u201d, Sport or 4WD) and exceptional fuel economy (4.0 l/100 km (70.6 mpg) in the Combined Drive Cycle, and CO2 of 109 g/km).\nPeugeot is exhibiting a Limited Edition 508 RXH at Frankfurt: the run of 300, individually-numbered examples in Calern Brown with Alcantara leather upholstery can be pre-reserved online from the opening of the Motor Show.\nHX1: MULTI-PURPOSE CONCEPT CAR\nThe HX1, making its worldwide d\u00e9but in Frankfurt, is a concept for gauging interest which has a specification to seat up to six people in a vehicle with unconventional styling: robust, sporty, integrating the new brand identity, unparalleled aerodynamics, and providing a unique interior space and driving experience.\nRising to this challenge, the designers have placed adaptability at the heart of their creation: the HX1 can metamorphose to suit its environment, the driving conditions and the expectations of its occupants.\nSo, due to its many mobile aerodynamic parts that were designed with speed in mind, the HX1\u2019s unusual MPV architecture, very low for a length of 4.93 m, results in an exceptional Cd of 0.28.\nIts four reverse-opening doors provide access to the interior of HX1, the marque\u2019s vision of a high-end passenger compartment, which combines elegance and modernity, natural materials and ultra-high technological specification. It offers its occupants an exceptional level of interior space, an innovative modular design with its original \u201c4+2\u201d configuration, and provides the driver with a driving position that can be adapted to suit driving conditions.\nWith a combined power output of 299 bhp from the 2.2 litre HDi engine driving the front wheels and the electric motor integrated into the rear axle, its diesel-electric hybrid drive train provides the functionality of HYbrid4 technology such as four-wheel drive and the \u2018all electric\u2019 mode with an increased potential range of 30 km (18.6 miles) due to the \u201cplug in\u201d function.\nThe HX1 thus obtains an astonishingly low combined fuel consumption of 3.2 l/100 km (88.2 mpg) with impressive CO2 emissions of 83 g/km.\nPEUGEOT: THE UPMARKET TREND\nAt its stand in Frankfurt, Peugeot is putting its Premium models under the spotlight, a definitive illustration of the marque\u2019s upmarket shift.\n- After a successful launch in Europe in the first half of 2011 (with 57,000 sales by the end of June), then its release onto the Chinese market in August, the 508 is reaffirming the Marque\u2019s ambitions regarding one of its historical territories, the large car.\nThrough its appealing styling, the impressive environmental credentials of its extensive range of engines and cutting-edge technology, along with its pleasant onboard surroundings and the driving experience it provides, the 508 (Saloon or SW) offers a modern range at one with the aspirations of its dynamic, responsible and discerning customers.\n- Since its highly-anticipated launch in spring 2010, the RCZ sports coup\u00e9 has exceeded expectations, and has taken pole position among sports coup\u00e9s in its class in Europe.\nIn Frankfurt, the dynamism of the RCZ is revealed with:\n\u2022 a limited-edition \u201cAsphalt\u201d version which is distinguished from the standard 200 hp version by its Telluric matt grey bodywork, its two-tone 19\u201d wheels and many distinctive \u201cAsphalt\u201d features;\n\u2022 and a 200 bhp 2.0 l HDi version, which was victorious at the 2011 \u201c24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring\u201d in the diesel category, and is the current diesel category leader in the German VLN Endurance Championship.\n- Demand for the 3008 Crossover continues to impress with sales up in the first half of 2011 (74,000) which are once again on the increase with a demand mainly for the range-topping versions.\nEven before the arrival of the 3008 HYbrid4 on the market, the 3008, and the effective way in which the 5008 compact MPV complements it, is enabling Peugeot to stake its claim as a key player in the highly-competitive \u201cmidsize\u201d market.\nPEUGEOT: ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP\nIn Frankfurt, the 508 RXH, the HX1 concept and the 908 Hybrid4 which Peugeot Sport is currently developing, are all demonstrations of Peugeot\u2019s pioneering and determined approach to diesel-electric hybridization.\nYet Peugeot\u2019s environmental commitment is being reflected in practice in 2011, through the major advances that the marque is exhibiting in Frankfurt.\n- Peugeot actively seeks to reduce the CO2 emissions of its vehicle range: the average emissions of the marque\u2019s models were measured in the first half of 2011 at 129.8 g/km CO2 compared to 131.3 in 2010, therefore dropping below the 130 g/km limit set for 2015 by the European Commission.\n- 3008 HYbrid4 - the first Diesel Hybrid in the world\nBy launching the world\u2019s first diesel hybrid vehicle in the second half of 2011, Peugeot is offering an exclusive range in terms of environmentally-friendly functionality and driving pleasure.\nOn the 3008 Crossover, the hybridization of a 2.0 HDi FAP diesel engine developing 163 bhp driving the front wheels and an electric motor developing 37 bhp on the rear axle, can reconcile a new driving experience, through four-wheel drive, a maximum output of 200 bhp, a \u201cZero Emissions Vehicle\u201d mode, and an average fuel consumption of 3.8 l/100 km (74.3 mpg) with 99 g/km CO2), down 35% on an internal combustion engine with a similar power output.\n- e-HDi, micro-hybrid technology\nIn the first half of 2011 the 508 and the new 308 launched the e-HDi innovative technology, the new generation STOP & START System, which reduces fuel consumption by nearly 15% in Urban Drive Cycle, prior to its deployment in the second half of the year on the 3008, the 5008 and PARTNER (Van and Tepee).\ne-HDi combines the 1.6 l HDi Euro 5 engine and a reversible-alternator which provides the STOP & START System function, supplemented by a braking energy recovery system and hybrid battery that delivers additional power at start-up.\n- Electric: 2- or 4-wheel drive\u2026\n\u2022 iOn is a latest-generation all-electric city car, designed for business customers and private individuals. The lithium-ion batteries powering the 64 hp electric motor permit a top speed of 130 km/h (80 mph) and a range of 150 km (93 miles). The distinguished recipient of several awards in Europe, iOn has received over 2,000 orders at the end of June 2011.\n\u2022 At the Peugeot stand in Frankfurt, the e-Vivacity scooter is another illustration of the Marque\u2019s response to new expectations in terms of \u201czero emissions\u201d urban mobility. All-electric, practical and modern, intuitive and nippy; the e-Vivacity offers a range of 60 km (37 miles) and an average energy cost of \u20ac0.4/100 km, thanks to its next generation compact lithium-ion batteries.\n\u2022 But for Peugeot, \u201celectricity\u201d can also mean \u201cintensity\u201d.

Having an understanding of hybrid technoogy basics can make the transition to hybrid vehicle ownership an easier process. Just as the label suggests, hybrid cars are a cross between a conventional vehicle and their all-electric cousins. Depending on the particular hybrid, the engine and motor can be configured in one of a variety of ways to meet the desired objective which is often to maximize fuel efficiency while on your daily commute but can also be targeted toward other purposes, such as a desire for greener living.\nMany are propelled primarily by an internal combustion engine, but because of the boost available through the electric motor, that engine can be smaller, more environmentally friendly and more efficient. The electric motor helps to capture wasted energy and convert it into electric energy that can be stored in a battery till used by the electric motor. Some hybrids share more in common with their all-electric counterparts\u2014right down to being plugged in \u2014while others don\u2019t require an external source of electricity, drawing all the energy the electric motor needs through the workings of the conventional gasoline engine and technologies like regenerative braking. Hybrid vehicle technologies continue to advance at a steady pace. Even so, there remain some basic features you can identify in most hybrid vehicles available today.\nRegenerative Braking\nPerhaps no other technology has defined the hybrid vehicle like regenerative braking . The hybrid\u2019s electric motor provides resistance to the vehicle\u2019s drive train, resulting in the desired slow down of the wheels. But unlike conventional systems, with regenerative braking the energy from the wheels turns the motor, which acts like a generator and changes energy into electricity that would normally be wasted during the braking process. The energy is stored in the vehicle\u2019s battery until it is needed by the electric motor.\nElectric Motor Drive and Assist\nThe role of the electric motor can vary greatly from one hybrid to another. On one end of the spectrum, there are hybrid vehicles where the electric motor\u2019s primary role is to provide an assist to the gas combustion engine when it is working harder, during acceleration or while climbing a hill, for example. On the other end, you have the near all-electric vehicles where the goal is to rely on the electric motor as much as possible. Some will even argue that GM\u2019s Chevy Volt fits into the far end of the hybrid spectrum because it has a gas engine, but GM engineers are likely to argue\u2014and perhaps rightfully so\u2014that the Volt is actually a special extended range electric vehicle because the car\u2014lacking a clutch\u2014is never able to tap directly into that gas engine\u2019s power.\nAutomatic Shutoff\nA third technology contributing to commonality among hybrids is the automatic shutoff of the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop as well as the restart when it\u2019s on the go again. Just as regenerative braking is meant to avoid the waste of energy that occurs during the braking process, the automatic shutoff and start feature is meant to avoid energy usually wasted when a vehicle is idling. Since hybrid cars have both engine and motor, some hybrids automatically shut off the gas-powered engine when the car is idle, switching to electric power.\nBeyond these basic technologies, most hybrid cars come equipped with a number of other features designed to make them both economically efficient and green, such as lightweight materials to reduce overall weight, state-of-the-art aerodynamics and minimal-drag tires.\nMore Reading on Hybrid Technology\n"}, {"score": 1122.8217, "uuid": "427a9b97-8a92-53fd-af4f-b3504f24f29d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-01-25868", "target_hostname": "www.motortopia.com", "target_uri": "http://www.motortopia.com/dieselworld/tag/vw-tdi/", "page_rank": 1.4152628e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "VW TDI | <em>Diesel</em> World", "snippet": "And while <em>hybrid</em> and electric cars may be all the rage among the Hollywood elite and the tree-huggers, it <em>is</em> very easy to see that these cars are not the <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em> solution that many people believe they are\u2014since it will take <em>more</em> pollution-spewing powerplants to charge the things.", "explanation": null, "document": "The 2010 TDI Cup edition\u2014perhaps the sportiest TDI to roll off the VW assembly line.\nWhich Ones to Consider and Why\nWith no end in sight to the high price of fuel, many people are rethinking their daily drivers.

Kenworth\u2019s dedication to the green fleet includes the aerodynamic Kenworth T660 and Kenworth T700; T440 and W900S liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) models; T800 LNG trucks; and Kenworth T270 and T370 diesel-electric hybrids.\n\u201cThe business is changing as the trend moves toward greener trucks,\u201d said Andy Douglas, Kenworth national sales manager for specialty markets, who has been at the forefront of Kenworth\u2019s green charge for the past several years. \u201cThe reality is that high diesel prices and evolving environmental rules are leading truck operators to seek practical solutions when it comes to their truck purchases in 2011 and beyond.\u201d\nAccording to recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average cost of diesel in the\u00a0United States\u00a0reached nearly $4 in March. That is up about $1, or 33 percent from the same period a year ago.\n\u201cAs a result, there\u2019s significant interest in our natural gas trucks and that interest is expanding into an increasing number of markets in the United States and Canada,\u201d said Douglas, who noted that natural gas may typically cost at least $1 to $1.50 less than the equivalent diesel fuel and is a cleaner burning fuel domestically produced in North America. \u201cDrayage fleets with port operations were among early purchasers of our T800 LNG truck. More recently, companies as diverse as UPS, natural gas provider Alagasco in\u00a0Alabama, and solid waste collector and recycler Enviro Express in\u00a0Connecticut, to name a few, have purchased Kenworth natural gas vehicles.\n\u201cWhen diesel fuel prices go up, the aerodynamic T660 and T700 \u2013 which both hold EPA SmartWay(SM) program certification \u2013 also receive an even closer look. The T700 has the lowest aerodynamic drag of any truck in the company\u2019s history. Both fuel-efficient vehicles offer\u00a0low operating cost, advanced technology, outstanding driver comfort, and high resale value. Those are the types of tangible benefits that attract over-the-road customers,\u201d said\u00a0Douglas.\n\u201cOur T270 and T370 diesel-electric hybrids can help enhance\u00a0fuel economy by up to an estimated 30 percent in pickup and delivery applications and up to 50 percent in utility operations. That makes them especially attractive today to fleets running\u00a0local routes with a significant number of starts and stops, and to municipalities seeking to save on fuel and reduce their carbon footprint.\u201d\nAccording to Douglas, there are also a number of federal, state and provincial, county, and municipal grant programs and financial incentives available to help truck operators purchase natural gas vehicles and diesel-electric hybrids. \u201cKenworth and Kenworth dealers are here to assist truck operators interested in pursuing such funding.\u201d\nAnd don\u2019t forget about engines. The very low emission 12.9-liter PACCAR MX engine achieves U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board (CARB) certification, and meets the stringent emission standards of 0.2 grams per brake horsepower hour of NOx and 0.01 grams per brake horsepower hour of particulate matter. For medium duty trucks, Kenworth offers the low emission PACCAR PX-6 and PACCAR PX-8 engines as standard on its medium duty products.\n\u201cThe trucking industry has made great strides with regard to engine emission reduction,\u201d noted\u00a0Douglas. \u201cFor example, with everything else being equal, one Class 8 truck with a 2010 EPA clean diesel engine produces six times fewer emissions than a Class 8 truck with a 2007 EPA engine. That\u2019s a positive trend that will grow as more truck operators move into the low emission engines.\u201d\nKenworth Truck Company is the manufacturer of The World\u2019s Best(R) heavy and medium duty trucks.

(Toyota installed a hydrogen refueling station in Torrance, CA, three years ago, and while the company\u2019s hybrid activities have tremendous commercial exposure, with the Prius being arguably the poster child of hybrid vehicles, there is corporate-level research underway on fuel cell development. Apparently there are some practical synergies in this work as while the fuel cell developers are mainly working on the fuel cell stacks, they borrow components, such as the Prius battery, in order to build running cars.) The hybrid powertrain, which Toyota is going to continue to roll out in a number of vehicles, from economy cars like the Prius to the uber-lux Lexus LS 460, is one, Miller admits, that has some additional consumer benefit, in that it helps the customer \u201cmake a statement\u201d as regards her or his feelings as regards air quality, global warming, and even national security (i.e., reduced oil purchases).\nDave Hermance, executive engineer, Advanced Technology Vehicles, Toyota Engineering and Manufacturing-North America, defines a \u201chybrid vehicle\u201d as something that has \u201ctwo or more energy storage systems, both of which must provide propulsion power.\u201d Note that this definition doesn\u2019t say anything about fuel efficiency. One of the knocks that Toyota has been receiving is that the Lexus RX 400h is a hybrid crossover SUV that isn\u2019t returning the sort of impressive miles per gallon that one might expect because the vehicle is setup for performance (as is the Lexus GS 450h, which is the fastest Lexus vehicle out there). The \u201chybrid\u201d definition doesn\u2019t say anything about it being the Official Powertrain of Thrift. After all, if it was all about being parsimonious as regards fuel, can you imagine using a 292-hp engine and a rear-wheel-drive configuration as is the case with the GS 450h? However, on a comparative basis, Hermance points out that a hybrid does mean reduced fuel consumption (e.g., if you consider other cars that can do a 0 to 60 mph of ~5.2 seconds as the GS 450h can, then he says that the Lexus will save 160 gallons of fuel per year, which means a reduction in CO2, as well as 10 fewer trips to the gas station).\nAccording to Hermance, those critics of the ostensible non-thriftiness of the Lexus hybrids are missing a point. With the point being that while there is undoubtedly a tipping point at some point vis-\u00e0-vis gasoline prices, so far U.S. consumers value performance more than fuel efficiency (according to the Toyota information, fuel economy is in the bottom third of issues of concern for car buyers and performance is in the top third). What\u2019s more, they\u2019ll buy a vehicle that would get a thumb\u2019s up from Al Gore if and only if it is equal to or better than one that is not as environmentally friendly (which could explain, in large part, why the Prius is a technological tour-de-force: what other car in any class offered Smart Key keyless entry (i.e., keep the fob in your pocket and as you approach the car, the driver\u2019s door is released) as it did when the current generation of the vehicle appeared in the fall of \u201903?). Perhaps it isn\u2019t an entirely bad thing that there are those persons who are holding out on getting their hybrids: Since making the Prius available in the U.S. in \u201901, the company has sold more than 250,000 of them, and even though they have upped their capacity year after year, demand outpaces supply. (There is a five- to six-day supply of the Prius; just imagine how many vehicle manufacturers would like to have that problem\u2014probably more than five or six of them.)\nBut there is another knock against hybrids, which is that the \u201creal world\u201d fuel efficiency numbers don\u2019t relate very well to those found on the EPA stickers affixed to the window that indicate miles per gallon (MPGs). Hermance acknowledges that high-efficiency vehicles\u2014including hybrids\u2014do, indeed, show a larger fall in MPGs than less-efficient vehicles, but he argues that \u201cthe measuring stick is bent and provides misleading information.\u201d As he puts it: \u201cFuel used, not fuel economy, is key.\u201d According to Hermance, if fuel usage is used as the metric, then current claims will stand.\nThen there is the concern of cost. This is one area that Toyota undoubtedly has a leg-up on other vehicle manufacturers. Consider, for example, that in addition to having produced three generations of Prius vehicles (with the first, in \u201997 to 2000, being Japan-market only), they\u2019re producing the Highlander HV (since May \u201905), the Camry Hybrid (May \u201906), the RX 400h (April \u201905), the GS 450h (April \u201906), and have announced the Lexus LS 460h for \u201907. In other words, they have (1) experience and (2) scale (Toyota has sold more than 275,000 hybrid vehicles in the U.S., and more than 560,000 units globally). (For the Camry, they\u2019re going to be producing 4,000 hybrids per month in the Georgetown, KY, plant, so the numbers should rise fairly rapidly.) In addition to which, Toyota Motor Corp. president Katsuaki Watanabe has stated that he wants 50% of the cost of a hybrid system out by early next decade. (The battery is the single most expensive part of a hybrid system, with the power electronics coming in second. Those are the two areas where the biggest leap gains can be made as there is said to be continuous improvement being made in motors and control systems.)\nChannel Partners:\nThe event for tool & moldmaking, additive manufacturing\nBe there.

That\u2019s because Chrysler\u2019s Dodge Durango and Chrysler Aspen Hybrids will pair up a hybrid gas-electric system\u2014the symbol of automotive virtue\u2014with a powerful Hemi engine, which is best known for winning car races. Blending such different technologies may turn out to be either a great idea, a source of confusion, or a cause for outrage\u2014or all of these things at the same time.\nChrysler\u2019s 5.7-liter V8 Hemi hybrids are very likely to offend the die-hard hybrid drivers, a group easily riled by any corruption of hybrid ideals. From the Prius point-of-view, DaimlerChrysler is flaunting its disregard for the environment by marrying sacred hybrid technology with an obscene amount of horsepower\u2014not official yet, but probably somewhere around 350\u2014with burly SUVs rated at 13 miles per gallon in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. Even after hybridization, these vehicles will barely break the 20-mpg mark\u2014a fraction of what the average Prius driver achieves.\nIt\u2019s All Relative\nBut before hybrid fans go apoplectic, they should consider the real benefits of applying hybrid technology across the full range of vehicles. \u201cA jump from 14 to 16 mpg saves as much oil as going from 35 to 51 mpg\u201d said Jim Kliesch, research associate at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Kliesch explained that miles-per-gallon is a non-linear form of measurement and therefore counter-intuitive when comparing the relative fuel consumption of smaller cars to big trucks. Fuel consumed per mile is a much better yardstick. Kliesch doesn\u2019t believe that the road to sustainable transportation is lined with a caravan of Durango and Aspen hybrids, but he conceded, \u201cWhat seems like a paltry amount of oil can actually make a big dent.\u201d\nFrom the beginning, DaimlerChrylser and General Motors, who are collaborating on the development of gas-electric technology, have set their hybrid sights on big and powerful vehicles. The two companies have dubbed their hybrid system as \u201ctwo-mode,\u201d to signify the use of a second set of gears configured specifically for moving heavy-weight vehicles more efficiently at highway speeds. The Durango and Aspen will also use cylinder deactivation, which shuts down four of the engine\u2019s eight cylinders under certain conditions such as highway cruising.\nTechno Triage\nThe rationale from improving the fuel economy of big SUVs may make sense, and the technology to achieve this goal is impressive. But it won\u2019t add up to much if the vehicles don\u2019t sell.\nHybrid drivers, a highly motivated bunch, don\u2019t appreciate the benefits of a jump from 16 to 20 mpg. SUV buyers will probably be less inclined to buy their first hybrid\u2014at a premium\u2014based on a 4 mpg jump. In fact, they may view the hybrid badge on their powerful hauling and towing machines as a wimpification of their trucks.\nIt\u2019s clear that DaimlerChrysler and other purveyors of large SUVs need to do something to lift the fuel economy of these vehicles out of the mid-teens. Releasing two Hemi hybrids is a form of technological triage\u2014another example of today\u2019s ultra-light form of green consumerism which asks for no compromise from the buyer. Thanks to technology, more is still more\u2014for now.\nBack in March 2005, Deiter Zetsche, CEO of DaimlerChrysler, was fending off criticism about his company\u2019s sluggish plans for producing a hybrid gas-electric vehicle. He quipped, \"As my wife often says, if you know you're going to arrive a bit late to the dinner party, be sure you bring the best wine.\" With its Hemi hybrid SUVs , Chrysler arrives to the hybrid party with a quality blend. It remains to be seen if it's a vintage that people want to drink.\n"}], [{"score": 1106.3292, "uuid": "30537dac-10da-5296-aa6d-a8143f6a6f7f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-67-16727", "target_hostname": "www.peugeot.com.mt", "target_uri": "http://www.peugeot.com.mt/about-peugeot/news/jul10-sep10/peugeot-3008HYbrid4.html", "page_rank": 1.1788159e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4: The world&#x27;s first <em>diesel</em> <em>hybrid</em> crossover combining", "snippet": "With the 3008 HYbrid4 crossover, the <em>environmentally</em>-<em>friendly</em> combination of <em>diesel</em> and electric power also paves the way for: The customer benefits are immediate with <em>a</em> high level specification and <em>a</em> reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, <em>a</em> real breakthrough for <em>a</em> car of this size and performance.", "explanation": null, "document": "PEUGEOT 3008 HYbrid4: The world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental protection and driving enjoyment\nPEUGEOT 3008 HYbrid4\nThe world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental protection and driving enjoyment\nBy launching the world\u2019s first full diesel Hybrid vehicle, the 3008 HYbrid4, Peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use and driving enjoyment.\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY\nThe name HYbrid4 designates the hybridization of a diesel engine (2.0 litre HDi FAP 120 kW / 163 bhp) with an electric motor offering a maximum power output of 27 kW (37 bhp). Since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.\nWith the 3008 HYbrid4 crossover, the environmentally-friendly combination of diesel and electric power also paves the way for:\n- 4 wheel drive,\n- a maximum power of 200 bhp,\n- ZEV mode (Zero Emission Vehicle),\n- 3.8 litres/100 km, with 99 g/km of CO2.\nThe customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this size and performance.\nDRIVING PLEASURE\nContrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels:\n- high performance combined with excellent driveability,\n- freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four different operating modes: ZEV, 4WD, Sport, Auto,\n- silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode,\n- peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive,\n- environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of CO2.\nA TECHNOLOGICAL AND REWARDING CROSSOVER\nThe 3008 HYbrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile customers in search of a rewarding and original car. Its benefits reside in its ability to fuse together different genres:\n- through its external architecture, with a body which carries the genes of the SUV, MPV and saloon,\n- through its specific stylistic codes in relation to the 3008 range overall, combining power and protection, strength and elegance, leisure and status,\n- through its surprising and technological interior, combining the ambience of an exclusive hi-tech coup\u00e9 with practical and efficient modularity,\n- through its dynamic specification since thanks to Peugeot\u2019s expertise and the technologies employed, this \u201ctall single compartment\u201d vehicle offers a level of driveability that is the envy of many a saloon.\nThe 3008 HYbrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of CO2 emissions.\nPeugeot\u2019s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.\nThe 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in France (in Sochaux and Mulhouse) and marketed in the spring of 2011 in Europe.\nThe Peugeot 3008, with HYbrid4 technology, is the first diesel \u201cFull Hybrid\u201d production car to be marketed in the world. This car is the culmination of a project which required every ounce of expertise on the part of Peugeot\u2019s engineers, to obtain a result on a par with the Marque\u2019s environmental demands while at the same time providing high levels of driving enjoyment. It is also an original and virtuous association of diesel and electric power.\n3008 + HYbrid4 (DIESEL + ELECTRIC) = VIRTUOUS ASSOCIATION\nAn obvious association\nAdapting HYbrid4 technology to the 3008 crossover makes obvious sense. This successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring concepts: SUV, saloon, compact MPV, coup\u00e9\u2026 Added to this are the benefits of HYbrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer expectations: \u201cecological\u201d four wheel drive, controlled power, a high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all within an environmentally responsible approach.\nDriving enjoyment for the next generation\nFor Peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its eco-efficiency. It must also provide new driving sensations, improved driveability and improved driving enjoyment.\nThese new sensations find expression in a number of ways:\n- silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode,\n- peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive,\n- high performance combined with high levels of driveability,\n- unique freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four operating modes: ZEV, 4WD, Sport, Auto.\nIn terms of performance, the 3008 HYbrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (\u201cboost\u201d function). The maximum combined power output can then reach 147 kW (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kW (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre HDi FAP diesel engine and the temporary peak of the electric motor (27 kW, or 37 bhp).\nA maximum torque of 500 Nm is available, split 300 Nm at the front from the HDi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 Nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.\nThis level of performance gives the 3008 HYbrid4 record-breaking credentials in terms of the CO2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.\nThe end result is a crossover with a length of 4.36 m, four wheel drive, a maximum power output of 200 bhp, fuel consumption in the combined cycle of only 3.8 litres/100 km and emissions of 99 g/km!\nOn higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of CO2 in the combined cycle.\nIn terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities. The rear module of the HYbrid4 system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee of excellent road holding.\nSimplicity of use\nFrom a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes:\n- \u201cAuto\u201d mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the HDi diesel engine and the electric motor. This allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability,\n- \u201cZEV\u201d mode (Zero Emission Vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode. In this case, activation of the HDi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration. This requires the high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged. The vehicle then becomes a \u201ccity run-around\u201d par excellence thanks to the total absence of noise and emissions. The driver can apply this mode to drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in electric mode, etc,\n- Four-wheel drive mode (4WD) instructs both power trains to operate together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric motor and the front wheels by the HDi diesel engine. Offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle\u2019s dynamic character. Indeed HYbrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an SUV: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort;\n- \u201cSport\u201d mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode. In this mode, the notion of \u201ccontrolled power\u201d comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.\nWith a 3008 benefiting from HYbrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.\nIndeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.\nTHE HYbrid4 STRATEGY\nCAPITALISING ON THE BEST KNOW-HOW\nHYbrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies developed by Peugeot\u2019s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor, second-generation STOP & START and an electronically-controlled sequential manual gearbox.\nAN ORIGINAL HYBRID POWER TRAIN\nThe \u201chybrid\u201d power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.\nInitially, Peugeot has relied logically on the recognised expertise of the PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn Group in the field of diesel engines with HDi FAP technology. With their exceptional efficiency, HDi FAP diesel engines - thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal combustion engine choice.\nIn the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for HYbrid4 type hybridization.\nFor the electric component, Peugeot has a historical expertise in the field of electric vehicles. To date, the 106 Electric, marketed between 1995 and 2003, remains the world\u2019s highest selling zero emissions car (in total the PSA Group produced nearly 10,000 vehicles, making it a genuine industrial pioneer in this field). At the end of 2010, Peugeot will continue in this vein by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in Europe, the Peugeot I0n.\nPursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing components and expertise, it was only natural to use the electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (MCP), not only for its engine management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption. In the same perspective, a second-generation STOP & START system is used.\nTHE CHOICE OF A PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE\nThe choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.\nHybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously:\n- the HDi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys. A diesel engine still remains the most efficient and versatile choice to power any vehicle,\n- the electric motor takes over from the HDi diesel engine in phases of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed and decelerating (energy recovery). These are precisely the features that characterise urban driving. Changeover from the HDi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to a STOP & START system which places the HDi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, etc),\n- the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (\u201cboost\u201d effect during strong acceleration, when overtaking another vehicle, for example). The performance of the HYbrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single HDi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).\nAN ORIGINAL AND INTELLIGENT LAYOUT\nThe electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle. This results in a number of advantages not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the project\u2019s economic and industrial model.\nFour wheel drive\nThis original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the HDi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.\nSince everything is controlled electronically (\u201cBy wire\u201d) with no mechanical link between the front and the rear, this system has many advantages over a \u201ctraditional\u201d integral mechanical transmission system (with a prop shafts):\n- no architectural constraints affecting layout and style within the passenger compartment (interior capacity preserved);\n- 4x4 and environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms.\nA viable technical and economic solution\nThe rear installation of the vehicle\u2019s \u201celectric components\u201d provides a new technical and economic solution.\nFirstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the engine compartment, while also allowing a better weight distribution. It also leaves intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.\nSecondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and also the rear drive train and suspension.\nThe costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the technical possibility of deploying HYbrid4 technology in different segments, on different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.\nA real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, etc, the HYbrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any compromises. Furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the system are based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.\nThe 3008 crossover has been chosen as the first application of this innovative technology.\nTECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE 3008 HYbrid4\nAT THE FRONT\nThe 2.0 litre HDi FAP 120 kW (163 bhp) diesel engine\nWith a capacity of 1997 cm\u00b3, this Euro 5 engine develops a maximum power of 120 kW at 3750 rpm and a maximum torque of 300 Nm at 1580 rpm. To obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation ECCS (Extreme Conventional Combustion System) combustion chamber design, a variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid injectors with eight apertures.\nNaturally this is combined with the latest generation \u201coctosquare\u201d Eolys additive-enhanced particulate emission filter (FAP) system.\nElectronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (BMP6)\nThe HDi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox:\n- its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox,\n- it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.\nOperation of the BMP6 is even more enjoyable with HYbrid4 technology insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes. This results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.\nLatest-generation STOP & START system\nThis system places the HDi diesel engine in standby when the vehicle is at a standstill (at traffic lights, a stop sign or in a traffic jam, etc) and when the vehicle is being driven in electric mode.\nThis brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions. It also enables the HDi diesel engine to be restarted instantly, \u201ctransparently\u201d for the driver, when necessary.\nThis \u201chigh voltage\u201d STOP & START system with a generous output of 8 kW can also generate the electricity needed for operation of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive mode).\nAT THE REAR\nRear suspension\nTo ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the Marque\u2019s road holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range MPVs, top of the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.\nThe design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the Marque\u2019s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent driveability, road holding and comfort.\nIn terms of \u201cvehicle dynamics\u201d, the ESP of the 3008 HYbrid4 incorporates an \u201cimproved traction control system\u201d (ASR) able to exploit the car\u2019s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces. The performance of this equipment is further enhanced by the fitment of optional 16\u2019\u2019 \u201cMud & Snow\u201d tyres.\nElectric motor\nThe synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located cleverly at the rear of the vehicle.\nIt provides a constant 20 kW (27 bhp), and has a peak output of 27 kW (37 bhp). It generates a constant torque of 100 Nm, or a peak of 200 Nm.\nPTMU (Power Train Management Unit)\nThe PTMU is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.\nAn inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power. The inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.\nThis operates in a voltage range of between 150 and 270 volts. The converter converts the 200 volts from the high-voltage battery pack into 12 volts to supply the vehicle\u2019s onboard systems.\nOn the 3008 HYbrid4, these components have been made as small as possible to optimise the installation in the vehicle.\nHigh-voltage battery pack\nThe Ni-MH (Nickel Metal Hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor. This high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12V battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.\nIn the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.\nEnergy recovery\nAn energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the Ni-MH batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking). This recovery system enables the driver to use \u201cfree\u201d energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.\nMan-machine interface\nA 7\u2019\u2019 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according to the car\u2019s specification, informs the driver in real time of the operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.\nThe left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration. Three different scales indicate the battery status: Charge, Eco (optimal operating range), Power.\nSuppliers\nTo develop its HYbrid4 technology, the PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn Group has teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.\nBased on the manufacturer\u2019s technical specifications, BOSCH has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (STT) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (ABS and ESP).\nSimilarly, SANYO has provided its extensive knowledge in the field of Ni-MH high-voltage batteries\n.\nA DISTINCTIVE STYLE\nAPPEAL AND PROTECTIVE POWER\nThe new Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its specific styling.\nPeugeot designs always bear the stamp of a strong, dynamic and recognisable personality, whatever the range concerned. It is nonetheless constantly evolving. New developments may be more or less marked according to the generation and above all the category of the vehicle.\nHere, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle\u2019s high innovative content. It also allows the 3008 HYbrid4 to be recognised by the integration of familiar features.\nAt the front, Peugeot\u2019s stylistic codes have been adapted to the car\u2019s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before. The headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of LEDs providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car\u2019s visual appeal. The 3008 HYbrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the Marque\u2019s new badge on its bonnet.\nThe large front grille helps to define the vehicle\u2019s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the SUV. The lower front panel further reinforces these off road aspirations, thanks in particular to the black quarter bumpers aligned with the headlamps.\nFrom the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper section. This accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17\u2019\u2019 Oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.\nAt the rear, the curved wings blend seamlessly with the hi-tech lights. The rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate the 3008 HYbrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.\nThe originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the vehicle. Here too, the presence of a \u201chobby\u201d lower tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, illustrate the \u201coutdoor\u201d feel of this crossover.\nFinally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil strength, contained power, controlled dynamism\u2026\nCOMFORT: DRIVING AND SHARING\nINTERIOR AMBIENCE: A BOLD STATEMENT\nIn keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car\u2019s passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.\nInside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks of a top-of-the-range coup\u00e9, or even an aircraft cockpit. An expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand\u2019s reach and an ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.\nCombined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.\nThese sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.\nDistinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover feel and explore new avenues of expression. This is true in particular of the new and specific Gu\u00e9rande & Tramontane two-tone leather finish which subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with a black finish on the sides of the seats.\nThe gear lever with its modern and elegant design is emblematic of HYbrid4 technology. It enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7\u2019\u2019 colour display which provides information on the energy flows. The ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature \u201cHYbrid4\u201d HY for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.\nMULTIFLEX INTERIOR: VERSATILITY PRESERVED\nWhile the driver is invited to enjoy renewed driving pleasure, the 3008 HYbrid4 has a wealth of surprises in store for its other occupants, preserving all the qualities of modularity and comfort of the original 3008.\nThey can enjoy the passenger compartment and its original ambience, bathed in the light diffused by the immense panoramic glass roof. They also benefit from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous centre console at the front.\nAnother feature retained for the front passenger: the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.\nThanks to its intelligent Multiflex interior and clever integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 HYbrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 VDA), with 66 litres (29 dm3 VDA) consisting of storage under the boot floor. This ingenious compartment also allows storage of the load space cover.\nThe hobby type lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor equipped with longitudinal securing rings that inspire quality and strength. From the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.\nCombined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 HYbrid4 offers a perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel. This frees up a gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.\nInside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected possibilities.\nDRIVING AIDS: HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT FOR SAFETY AND DRIVING ENJOYMENT\nComfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.\nFor example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the instrument panel visor. This Head- Up Display system can be adjusted by means of Toggle Switches.\nThese switches, located above the centre console, add a further touch of style to the in-car ambience.\nSimilarly, the electric parking brake (FSE) coupled with the Hill Assist function, facilitates the driver\u2019s manoeuvres and optimises space in place of the manual hand brake.\nLastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide users on their travels.\nWIPCom 3D includes all the benefits of the Marque\u2019s existing satellite navigation systems.\nThese include the Jukebox function, linked to the presence of a hard disc, the GSM function, a USB connector, a DVD player, the Bluetooth\u00ae system and also a graphic interface which shows city buildings in \u201cfull 3D\u201d.\nPeugeot Connect services offered with WIPCom 3D will also be accessible.\nIn the final analysis, the 3008 HYbrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving pleasure and CO2 emissions of a very low level. Peugeot\u2019s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.\nThe hybrid rear section of the 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in Sochaux and in Mulhouse. It is expected to go on sale in Europe in the spring of 2011.\n"}, {"score": 1105.7557, "uuid": "4f0bfcd4-ab74-5dd4-88d3-47d78bae7cdc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600wb-71-33894", "target_hostname": "www.peugeot.com.mt", "target_uri": "http://www.peugeot.com.mt/peugeot.com.mt/about-peugeot/news/jul10-sep10/peugeot-3008HYbrid4.html", "page_rank": 1.1788156e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4: The world&#x27;s first <em>diesel</em> <em>hybrid</em> crossover combining", "snippet": "With the 3008 HYbrid4 crossover, the <em>environmentally</em>-<em>friendly</em> combination of <em>diesel</em> and electric power also paves the way for: The customer benefits are immediate with <em>a</em> high level specification and <em>a</em> reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, <em>a</em> real breakthrough for <em>a</em> car of this size and performance.", "explanation": null, "document": "PEUGEOT 3008 HYbrid4: The world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental protection and driving enjoyment\nPEUGEOT 3008 HYbrid4\nThe world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental protection and driving enjoyment\nBy launching the world\u2019s first full diesel Hybrid vehicle, the 3008 HYbrid4, Peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use and driving enjoyment.\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY\nThe name HYbrid4 designates the hybridization of a diesel engine (2.0 litre HDi FAP 120 kW / 163 bhp) with an electric motor offering a maximum power output of 27 kW (37 bhp). Since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.\nWith the 3008 HYbrid4 crossover, the environmentally-friendly combination of diesel and electric power also paves the way for:\n- 4 wheel drive,\n- a maximum power of 200 bhp,\n- ZEV mode (Zero Emission Vehicle),\n- 3.8 litres/100 km, with 99 g/km of CO2.\nThe customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this size and performance.\nDRIVING PLEASURE\nContrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels:\n- high performance combined with excellent driveability,\n- freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four different operating modes: ZEV, 4WD, Sport, Auto,\n- silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode,\n- peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive,\n- environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of CO2.\nA TECHNOLOGICAL AND REWARDING CROSSOVER\nThe 3008 HYbrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile customers in search of a rewarding and original car. Its benefits reside in its ability to fuse together different genres:\n- through its external architecture, with a body which carries the genes of the SUV, MPV and saloon,\n- through its specific stylistic codes in relation to the 3008 range overall, combining power and protection, strength and elegance, leisure and status,\n- through its surprising and technological interior, combining the ambience of an exclusive hi-tech coup\u00e9 with practical and efficient modularity,\n- through its dynamic specification since thanks to Peugeot\u2019s expertise and the technologies employed, this \u201ctall single compartment\u201d vehicle offers a level of driveability that is the envy of many a saloon.\nThe 3008 HYbrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of CO2 emissions.\nPeugeot\u2019s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.\nThe 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in France (in Sochaux and Mulhouse) and marketed in the spring of 2011 in Europe.\nThe Peugeot 3008, with HYbrid4 technology, is the first diesel \u201cFull Hybrid\u201d production car to be marketed in the world. This car is the culmination of a project which required every ounce of expertise on the part of Peugeot\u2019s engineers, to obtain a result on a par with the Marque\u2019s environmental demands while at the same time providing high levels of driving enjoyment. It is also an original and virtuous association of diesel and electric power.\n3008 + HYbrid4 (DIESEL + ELECTRIC) = VIRTUOUS ASSOCIATION\nAn obvious association\nAdapting HYbrid4 technology to the 3008 crossover makes obvious sense. This successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring concepts: SUV, saloon, compact MPV, coup\u00e9\u2026 Added to this are the benefits of HYbrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer expectations: \u201cecological\u201d four wheel drive, controlled power, a high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all within an environmentally responsible approach.\nDriving enjoyment for the next generation\nFor Peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its eco-efficiency. It must also provide new driving sensations, improved driveability and improved driving enjoyment.\nThese new sensations find expression in a number of ways:\n- silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode,\n- peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive,\n- high performance combined with high levels of driveability,\n- unique freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four operating modes: ZEV, 4WD, Sport, Auto.\nIn terms of performance, the 3008 HYbrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (\u201cboost\u201d function). The maximum combined power output can then reach 147 kW (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kW (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre HDi FAP diesel engine and the temporary peak of the electric motor (27 kW, or 37 bhp).\nA maximum torque of 500 Nm is available, split 300 Nm at the front from the HDi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 Nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.\nThis level of performance gives the 3008 HYbrid4 record-breaking credentials in terms of the CO2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.\nThe end result is a crossover with a length of 4.36 m, four wheel drive, a maximum power output of 200 bhp, fuel consumption in the combined cycle of only 3.8 litres/100 km and emissions of 99 g/km!\nOn higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of CO2 in the combined cycle.\nIn terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities. The rear module of the HYbrid4 system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee of excellent road holding.\nSimplicity of use\nFrom a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes:\n- \u201cAuto\u201d mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the HDi diesel engine and the electric motor. This allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability,\n- \u201cZEV\u201d mode (Zero Emission Vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode. In this case, activation of the HDi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration. This requires the high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged. The vehicle then becomes a \u201ccity run-around\u201d par excellence thanks to the total absence of noise and emissions. The driver can apply this mode to drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in electric mode, etc,\n- Four-wheel drive mode (4WD) instructs both power trains to operate together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric motor and the front wheels by the HDi diesel engine. Offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle\u2019s dynamic character. Indeed HYbrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an SUV: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort;\n- \u201cSport\u201d mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode. In this mode, the notion of \u201ccontrolled power\u201d comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.\nWith a 3008 benefiting from HYbrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.\nIndeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.\nTHE HYbrid4 STRATEGY\nCAPITALISING ON THE BEST KNOW-HOW\nHYbrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies developed by Peugeot\u2019s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor, second-generation STOP & START and an electronically-controlled sequential manual gearbox.\nAN ORIGINAL HYBRID POWER TRAIN\nThe \u201chybrid\u201d power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.\nInitially, Peugeot has relied logically on the recognised expertise of the PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn Group in the field of diesel engines with HDi FAP technology. With their exceptional efficiency, HDi FAP diesel engines - thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal combustion engine choice.\nIn the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for HYbrid4 type hybridization.\nFor the electric component, Peugeot has a historical expertise in the field of electric vehicles. To date, the 106 Electric, marketed between 1995 and 2003, remains the world\u2019s highest selling zero emissions car (in total the PSA Group produced nearly 10,000 vehicles, making it a genuine industrial pioneer in this field). At the end of 2010, Peugeot will continue in this vein by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in Europe, the Peugeot I0n.\nPursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing components and expertise, it was only natural to use the electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (MCP), not only for its engine management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption. In the same perspective, a second-generation STOP & START system is used.\nTHE CHOICE OF A PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE\nThe choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.\nHybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously:\n- the HDi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys. A diesel engine still remains the most efficient and versatile choice to power any vehicle,\n- the electric motor takes over from the HDi diesel engine in phases of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed and decelerating (energy recovery). These are precisely the features that characterise urban driving. Changeover from the HDi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to a STOP & START system which places the HDi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, etc),\n- the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (\u201cboost\u201d effect during strong acceleration, when overtaking another vehicle, for example). The performance of the HYbrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single HDi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).\nAN ORIGINAL AND INTELLIGENT LAYOUT\nThe electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle. This results in a number of advantages not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the project\u2019s economic and industrial model.\nFour wheel drive\nThis original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the HDi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.\nSince everything is controlled electronically (\u201cBy wire\u201d) with no mechanical link between the front and the rear, this system has many advantages over a \u201ctraditional\u201d integral mechanical transmission system (with a prop shafts):\n- no architectural constraints affecting layout and style within the passenger compartment (interior capacity preserved);\n- 4x4 and environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms.\nA viable technical and economic solution\nThe rear installation of the vehicle\u2019s \u201celectric components\u201d provides a new technical and economic solution.\nFirstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the engine compartment, while also allowing a better weight distribution. It also leaves intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.\nSecondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and also the rear drive train and suspension.\nThe costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the technical possibility of deploying HYbrid4 technology in different segments, on different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.\nA real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, etc, the HYbrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any compromises. Furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the system are based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.\nThe 3008 crossover has been chosen as the first application of this innovative technology.\nTECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE 3008 HYbrid4\nAT THE FRONT\nThe 2.0 litre HDi FAP 120 kW (163 bhp) diesel engine\nWith a capacity of 1997 cm\u00b3, this Euro 5 engine develops a maximum power of 120 kW at 3750 rpm and a maximum torque of 300 Nm at 1580 rpm. To obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation ECCS (Extreme Conventional Combustion System) combustion chamber design, a variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid injectors with eight apertures.\nNaturally this is combined with the latest generation \u201coctosquare\u201d Eolys additive-enhanced particulate emission filter (FAP) system.\nElectronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (BMP6)\nThe HDi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox:\n- its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox,\n- it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.\nOperation of the BMP6 is even more enjoyable with HYbrid4 technology insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes. This results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.\nLatest-generation STOP & START system\nThis system places the HDi diesel engine in standby when the vehicle is at a standstill (at traffic lights, a stop sign or in a traffic jam, etc) and when the vehicle is being driven in electric mode.\nThis brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions. It also enables the HDi diesel engine to be restarted instantly, \u201ctransparently\u201d for the driver, when necessary.\nThis \u201chigh voltage\u201d STOP & START system with a generous output of 8 kW can also generate the electricity needed for operation of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive mode).\nAT THE REAR\nRear suspension\nTo ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the Marque\u2019s road holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range MPVs, top of the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.\nThe design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the Marque\u2019s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent driveability, road holding and comfort.\nIn terms of \u201cvehicle dynamics\u201d, the ESP of the 3008 HYbrid4 incorporates an \u201cimproved traction control system\u201d (ASR) able to exploit the car\u2019s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces. The performance of this equipment is further enhanced by the fitment of optional 16\u2019\u2019 \u201cMud & Snow\u201d tyres.\nElectric motor\nThe synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located cleverly at the rear of the vehicle.\nIt provides a constant 20 kW (27 bhp), and has a peak output of 27 kW (37 bhp). It generates a constant torque of 100 Nm, or a peak of 200 Nm.\nPTMU (Power Train Management Unit)\nThe PTMU is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the HDi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.\nAn inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power. The inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.\nThis operates in a voltage range of between 150 and 270 volts. The converter converts the 200 volts from the high-voltage battery pack into 12 volts to supply the vehicle\u2019s onboard systems.\nOn the 3008 HYbrid4, these components have been made as small as possible to optimise the installation in the vehicle.\nHigh-voltage battery pack\nThe Ni-MH (Nickel Metal Hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor. This high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12V battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.\nIn the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.\nEnergy recovery\nAn energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the Ni-MH batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking). This recovery system enables the driver to use \u201cfree\u201d energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.\nMan-machine interface\nA 7\u2019\u2019 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according to the car\u2019s specification, informs the driver in real time of the operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.\nThe left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration. Three different scales indicate the battery status: Charge, Eco (optimal operating range), Power.\nSuppliers\nTo develop its HYbrid4 technology, the PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn Group has teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.\nBased on the manufacturer\u2019s technical specifications, BOSCH has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (STT) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (ABS and ESP).\nSimilarly, SANYO has provided its extensive knowledge in the field of Ni-MH high-voltage batteries\n.\nA DISTINCTIVE STYLE\nAPPEAL AND PROTECTIVE POWER\nThe new Peugeot 3008 HYbrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its specific styling.\nPeugeot designs always bear the stamp of a strong, dynamic and recognisable personality, whatever the range concerned. It is nonetheless constantly evolving. New developments may be more or less marked according to the generation and above all the category of the vehicle.\nHere, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle\u2019s high innovative content. It also allows the 3008 HYbrid4 to be recognised by the integration of familiar features.\nAt the front, Peugeot\u2019s stylistic codes have been adapted to the car\u2019s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before. The headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of LEDs providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car\u2019s visual appeal. The 3008 HYbrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the Marque\u2019s new badge on its bonnet.\nThe large front grille helps to define the vehicle\u2019s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the SUV. The lower front panel further reinforces these off road aspirations, thanks in particular to the black quarter bumpers aligned with the headlamps.\nFrom the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper section. This accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17\u2019\u2019 Oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.\nAt the rear, the curved wings blend seamlessly with the hi-tech lights. The rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate the 3008 HYbrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.\nThe originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the vehicle. Here too, the presence of a \u201chobby\u201d lower tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, illustrate the \u201coutdoor\u201d feel of this crossover.\nFinally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil strength, contained power, controlled dynamism\u2026\nCOMFORT: DRIVING AND SHARING\nINTERIOR AMBIENCE: A BOLD STATEMENT\nIn keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car\u2019s passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.\nInside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks of a top-of-the-range coup\u00e9, or even an aircraft cockpit. An expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand\u2019s reach and an ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.\nCombined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.\nThese sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.\nDistinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover feel and explore new avenues of expression. This is true in particular of the new and specific Gu\u00e9rande & Tramontane two-tone leather finish which subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with a black finish on the sides of the seats.\nThe gear lever with its modern and elegant design is emblematic of HYbrid4 technology. It enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7\u2019\u2019 colour display which provides information on the energy flows. The ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature \u201cHYbrid4\u201d HY for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.\nMULTIFLEX INTERIOR: VERSATILITY PRESERVED\nWhile the driver is invited to enjoy renewed driving pleasure, the 3008 HYbrid4 has a wealth of surprises in store for its other occupants, preserving all the qualities of modularity and comfort of the original 3008.\nThey can enjoy the passenger compartment and its original ambience, bathed in the light diffused by the immense panoramic glass roof. They also benefit from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous centre console at the front.\nAnother feature retained for the front passenger: the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.\nThanks to its intelligent Multiflex interior and clever integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 HYbrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 VDA), with 66 litres (29 dm3 VDA) consisting of storage under the boot floor. This ingenious compartment also allows storage of the load space cover.\nThe hobby type lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor equipped with longitudinal securing rings that inspire quality and strength. From the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.\nCombined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 HYbrid4 offers a perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel. This frees up a gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.\nInside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected possibilities.\nDRIVING AIDS: HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT FOR SAFETY AND DRIVING ENJOYMENT\nComfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.\nFor example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the instrument panel visor. This Head- Up Display system can be adjusted by means of Toggle Switches.\nThese switches, located above the centre console, add a further touch of style to the in-car ambience.\nSimilarly, the electric parking brake (FSE) coupled with the Hill Assist function, facilitates the driver\u2019s manoeuvres and optimises space in place of the manual hand brake.\nLastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide users on their travels.\nWIPCom 3D includes all the benefits of the Marque\u2019s existing satellite navigation systems.\nThese include the Jukebox function, linked to the presence of a hard disc, the GSM function, a USB connector, a DVD player, the Bluetooth\u00ae system and also a graphic interface which shows city buildings in \u201cfull 3D\u201d.\nPeugeot Connect services offered with WIPCom 3D will also be accessible.\nIn the final analysis, the 3008 HYbrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving pleasure and CO2 emissions of a very low level. Peugeot\u2019s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.\nThe hybrid rear section of the 3008 HYbrid4 will be produced in Sochaux and in Mulhouse. It is expected to go on sale in Europe in the spring of 2011.\n"}, {"score": 1097.8358, "uuid": "50d1d5f3-bb3b-5863-9da9-cb6d1efa56fe", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0108wb-63-15296", "target_hostname": "www.detroitdiesel.com", "target_uri": "http://www.detroitdiesel.com/about/press/pressreleases/detail.aspx?id=821", "page_rank": 1.1759961e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Detroit <em>Diesel</em> - Press Releases", "snippet": "They listen to what we think <em>is</em> important, and they deliver every time,&quot; said Duley. &quot;We believe the BlueTec emissions technology <em>is</em> <em>a</em> very good alternative for meeting new regulations in an <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em> way.&quot; For <em>more</em> information, go to www.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u2026or your vest, or your mug or your hat.

Speakers from the West Coast Green conference at Fort Mason were invited to cruise on the San Francisco Bay, mingle with other green industry professionals, and learn about the Hornblower Hybrid technologies.\u00a0 The crowd was lively and very enthused to know they were on the first hybrid boat in the United States. When we gave our speech about the Hornblower Hybrid and announced to our guests that they were on the first hybrid ferry in the United States, cheers rang out and the excitement carried on into the night.\u00a0 Notable guests included Bonnie Nixon, Director of Environmental Sustainability for HP and Heather Gadonniex, owner of Green It Group and author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Greening Your Business.\nWest Coast Green, a three-day conference in San Francisco, offered over 300 exhibitors displaying the latest best practices and key players in green building, business and design.\u00a0 The conference also hosted over 100 speakers from the green community to educate guests on the future of green building, clean tech, social finance and other environmental topics. Other notable speakers include Matt Golden of Sustainable Spaces and Adam Werbach of Saatchi & Saatchi .\nRespect Our Planet, a Hornblower organization promoting sustainable practices, displayed information about the hybrid boat at our booth. Our team generated an enormous amount of interest about the boat and its technology. We are looking forward to next year's event and to hosting more \"green\" revelers on the Hornblower Hybrid in the future!\nPosted at 05:27 PM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n09/29/2009\nThe Future of Plug-In Hybrid Cars\nWe have all seen them on the road, the Toyota Prius touting the message \"This Plug-In gets 100+ MPG.\" Popularity of these vehicles has been increasing as the conversion of hybrid vehicles into plug-in hybrids has become a profitable niche industry. Although only a few companies specialize in this conversion, the impact of the new mini-industry has greatly influenced consumer and industry opinions.\nOver the next five years, more plug-in vehicles - particularly the Prius and Ford Escape - are scheduled for delivery to consumers by companies such as CalCars .\u00a0 But to have a bigger impact on climate change this new industry must convert bigger emitters and gas wasters such as trucks and SUVs, and more specifically, delivery vehicles. When used in delivery routes that are often under 40 miles per day, delivery trucks spend much of their time, starting, stopping, and idling, which wastes huge amounts of fuel. Converting delivery vehicles to a plug-in hybrid will reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\u00a0 The US Postal Service is looking to convert its fleet of more than 140,000 delivery vehicles.\u00a0 This comes on the heels of USPS energy efficiency upgrades in select distribution centers.\nSo if converting your SUV to a plug-in hybrid can save you more gas than trading in for a new Toyota Prius, then why haven't more consumers converted? The answer lies in the cost. The battery alone can cost upwards of $20,000 which makes for a slow payback period if gas stays at $3 per gallon. The hope is that economics will approve over time as the technology evolves.\nIt is also difficult to convince consumers, and even car companies, to make the switch.\u00a0 While American car companies like Ford, GM or Chrysler are well-suited for plug-in conversions, the mass rethinking of the company would be an even bigger shift than becoming manufacturers of plug-in hybrids. Convincing fleet operators will likely be easier than consumers and the auto industry, which makes it the logical next step.\n(photo courtesy of alternativeenergy.com)\nPosted at 09:38 AM | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)\n09/22/2009\nThe Hornblower Hybrid Makes a Splash at the Kite Festival\nSince September 7th the Hornblower Hybrid has stopped the Island Hop service to Alcatraz and Angel Island. \u00a0In an effort to keep the Hornblower Hybrid busy, the Respect Our Planet team and the Hybrid made a special guest appearance this weekend at the Family Day Kite Festival . Running four cruises on both Saturday and Sunday, this was a fantastic opportunity for kids and their families to explore the educational aspects of the vessel and learn how they too can Respect Our Planet.\nLocated aboard the Hornblower Hybrid is an exercise bike that is hooked up to a small Programable Logic Controller (PLC). It is the same type of control system that we use to monitor and control all vital the functions on the Hybrid. Kids can peddle the bike and actually generate power. \u00a0The bike is an educational tool designed to teach kids how much energy it takes to generate power. \u00a0Using the PLC to control the bike also give guests insight to how we manage and operate the Hornblower Hybrid. At San Francisco Kite Day, families also had the opportunity to bring their kids up to meet the captain, and a few special kids even got to help steer the boat!\nFor guests that visited the Respect Our Planet booth they were greeted by our team providing information about our Educational Bay Cruises , the Respect Our Planet program and the Hornblower Hybrid! \u00a0Guests had the opportunity to win a ride on the Hybrid by entering a \"green idea.\"\nOne of the most important aspects of Hornblower's organization Respect Our Planet, is education to teach kids about science, engineering and the environment. \u00a0By participating in the Family Day Kite Festival, we were able to reach thousands of children and educate them about the importance of being stewards of the environment.\n"}, {"score": 1087.0071, "uuid": "207b0af1-d2f9-576e-a78a-d50cb5ff1a99", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1503wb-36-18243", "target_hostname": "www.businessfleet.com", "target_uri": "http://www.businessfleet.com/Article/Story/2012/03/Which-Hybrids-Have-the-Lowest-Cost-of-Ownership.aspx", "page_rank": 1.3382829e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Which</em> <em>Hybrids</em> Have the Lowest Cost of Ownership?", "snippet": "Subscribe to one <em>or</em> all of them...they&#x27;re FREE. 2012-MY alternative fuels biodiesel BMW Cargo Vans closed-end leases <em>diesel</em> distracted driving Dodge driver behavior driver safety electric vehicle emissions <em>environmentally</em> <em>friendly</em> Fleet Car of the Year fleet leasing fleet management Fleet Truck of the", "explanation": null, "document": "March 2012, Business Fleet - Feature\nWhich Hybrids Have the Lowest Cost of Ownership?\nAfter five years and 15,000 miles of driving per year, are there any hybrids that actually have a lower cost of ownership than their gas-engine counterparts?

Last November, Vincentric analyzed 27 models from 2011 and 2012 model years using data from its October 2011 database update.\nThe Vincentric data measures eight cost elements for more than 2,000 vehicle configurations, including depreciation, financing, fees and taxes, fuel, insurance, maintenance, opportunity cost and repairs. Each month Vincentric re-compiles its database to take into account current market conditions.\nFor the hybrid analysis, Vincentric assumed 15,000 annual miles driven over five years. The hybrid report uses U.S. averages, although states can be selected for a more specific analysis. Fuel prices are based on a weighted average over the previous five months.\nThe Changing Equation\nThe hybrid/internal combustion engine (ICE) cost differential is an ever-changing equation. Wild swings in fuel prices are a major factor, as are available tax credits and rebates, which expired for all hybrid models on Jan. 1, 2011. New government incentives concentrate on plug-in hybrids and electric cars.\nIn looking at Business Fleet Magazine\u2019s hybrid analyses using Vincentric data over the years, starting in the 2006 model year, hybrids have not closed the pricing gap with their traditional ICE-powered counterparts. In this latest analysis of 27 hybrid models, Vincentric\u2019s data shows the average price premium for a hybrid is $8,494. Mitigated by an average fuel cost savings of $3,505 and taking into account other costs, the average cost of ownership for hybrids is $4,643 more than the straight gas models.\nNonetheless, four hybrids have total costs of ownership that are lower than their ICE cousins ( see the \u201cHybrid Total Cost Differentials\u201d chart ).\n"}], [{"score": 1085.9001, "uuid": "93f41331-b5d5-5277-8d63-45487c7b19fb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1601wb-59-04888", "target_hostname": "www.simplyhybrid.com", "target_uri": "http://www.simplyhybrid.com/en/vehicles/hybrids.html?pid=&order=i.name&dir=asc", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>Hybrids</em>", "snippet": "The 2011 Ford Escape <em>Hybrid</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> gas and electric mid size SUV rental at an affordable daily rate.

The Flight TerraPass comes in <em>a</em> variety of flavors, <em>which</em> you can match to your own level of emissions.", "explanation": null, "document": "Fly the environmentally friendly skies with TerraPass\nAdam Stein | July 11, 2006\nYou asked, we delivered: you can now buy a Flight TerraPass to offset the carbon emissions from your air travel.\nThe Flight TerraPass comes in a variety of flavors , which you can match to your own level of emissions. For only $9.95 you can offset a cross-country flight or several short-haul flights. For $139.95 even modern-day Gullivers can fly guilt-free.\nEvery Flight TerraPass comes with a gift. For example, you can offset an entire lifetime of flying and receive a deluxe folding bicycle to take with you on your travels. More typically, you get a spiffy TerraPass luggage tag with your purchase. And if you don\u2019t need the gift, you have the option of trading it for additional carbon reductions (and extra environmental mojo).\nHere\u2019s a mini-FAQ about the new product:\nWhy should I offset flight emissions?\nBecause air travel has a really big impact on the environment. On a per mile and per passenger basis, flying is about as bad as driving. Large jets burn a gallon of fuel every second. A cross-country flight burns about 100 gallons of fuel per passenger. And because the emissions are spewed high in the atmosphere, they have a more severe impact on global warming.\nAs society becomes more mobile, flying makes up an increasing proportion of our overall carbon footprint. Air travel already accounts for at least 4% of US carbon dioxide emissions, and is expected to grow to 10% over the next few years.\nHow can I figure out which Flight TerraPass is right for me?\nGlad you asked that. Check out our handy flight emissions calculator , which allows you to quickly tally the emissions from a set of flights between any two points on the globe. Enter all your flights for the past year in a matter of seconds and see what your impact was. Then offset it.\nHow do you calculate the emissions from air travel?\nThe full details are here . Briefly, the TerraPass supercomputer figures out the distance between your origin and destination. Depending on the length of the flight, it then comes up with a per-mile carbon index. By multiplying the length of the flight by the carbon index, it is able to estimate your share of the flight\u2019s emissions.\nThe carbon index is based on protocols developed by the World Resource Institute. It is only meant to provide an estimate. Actual per passenger carbon emissions depends on the type of plane, the distance flown, the plane\u2019s occupancy rate, flying conditions, other factors.\n"}], [{"score": 1083.8461, "uuid": "f8cbf63c-383b-5054-9ac8-0e68a660aecd", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1601wb-14-13149", "target_hostname": "www.simplyhybrid.com", "target_uri": "http://www.simplyhybrid.com/en/vehicles/hybrids.html?pid=&order=producer&dir=desc", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Hybrids</em>", "snippet": "The Honda Insight <em>Hybrid</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> fuel efficient mid size gas and electric car rental at an affordable daily rate.

Alternative transportation companies such as electric car developer and distributor ZAP (OTCBB: ZAAP) with current electric models on the market today, and ethanol producer Green Plains Renewable Energy (NASDAQ: GPRE), work to capitalize on consumer demands for cleaner vehicles and fuels. With the shift towards green cars taking hold, automakers such as Honda, General Motors, Toyota and others are stepping up efforts for further research and development in this area.\nAs the auto industry faces recent slipping sales, clean energy vehicles are catching the attention of consumers looking for efficiency and environmentally friendly alternatives, giving manufacturers a new direction for growth. The momentum behind green cars is a reaction to a variety of factors such as fuel prices despite current declines, environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and global national energy security concerns.\nThis week many new clean energy vehicles are being introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show, a platform for the unveiling of current and future alternative vehicles. Creating a buzz were displays of plug-in hybrids, which use electric motors with a gasoline engine as a backup, and electric vehicles that run entirely on electricity. Also in the mix were natural gas, ethanol and biodiesel vehicles. Another event, the AltCars Expo this weekend in Santa Monica, is shaping up to be the one of the premiere events for alternative fuel vehicles, and many of the new models and concepts will be present.\nRecently, major automakers Toyota, Honda, General Motors and Nissan revealed a future that includes the production of various clean energy models. General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner has announced GM\u0092s plans to develop a plug-in hybrid for its Saturn Vue Green Line SUV, but with no specific date for production revealed. General Motors has also unveiled the concept behind the Hummer \u0093O2\u0094 which converts carbon dioxide to oxygen using algae-filled body panels.\nGeneral Motors is also focusing on cars that run on ethanol (E85) as part of their overall corporate environmental strategy moving forward. With ethanol becoming more widely available, as more producers such as Green Plains Renewable Energy (NASDAQ: GPRE) bring plant production online, these flex-fuel vehicles offer automakers viable near term opportunities while they continue to develop their next generation of green cars.\nHyundai is committing research efforts to hydrogen-powered fuel cells and vehicles that run on clean diesel as well as gas-electric hybrids. Honda is also looking at fuel cells with plans for hydrogen-powered sedans for 2008. Toyota Motor Corp, the largest seller of traditional hybrids, is another major automaker talking about developing plug-in models.\nWhile many companies pursue the plug-in hybrid models, full electric vehicles are rapidly grabbing industry attention. While there are very few publicly owned companies currently offering mass-produced electric cars, one private firm Tesla Motors is showcasing its new Roadster prototype, planned for limited production as early as 2007, but with a price tag of $100,000USD. Nissan has plans for a 125-mile range all-electric car, but plans for production are targeted for 2010.\nElectric car manufacturer and distributor ZAP (OTCBB: ZAAP) has a jump on the market with the only mass-produced and affordable electric car available for sale today. ZAP\u0092s XEBRA city-car and truck is currently on sale through dealerships in Los Angeles for approximately $10,000USD. With most automakers looking several years down the road for market entry of most plug-in hybrids and electric models, ZAP appears well positioned to fill today\u0092s consumer demands.\nAs a sign of things to come Yahoo! has created a special feature within Yahoo! Autos dedicated to green cars including ratings, technological overviews as well as community information and news pointing towards further validation of the potential behind the green car market.\nTo read more on ZAP (OTCBB: ZAAP) visit: http://www.renewableenergystocks.com/CO/ZAAP/Default.asp or the Company\u0092s website at www.zapworld.com\nTo read more on Green Plains Renewable Energy (NASDAQ: GPRE) visit: http://www.renewableenergystocks.com/co/gpre/ or the Company\u0092s website at: www.gpreethanol.com\nZAP and Green Plains Renewable Energy are featured companies on www.RenewableEnergyStocks.com\u0099, an investor and industry portal within the InvestorIdeas.com\u0099 content umbrella.

Alternative transportation companies such as electric car developer and distributor ZAP (OTCBB: ZAAP) with current electric models on the market today, and ethanol producer Green Plains Renewable Energy (NASDAQ: GPRE), work to capitalize on consumer demands for cleaner vehicles and fuels. With the shift towards green cars taking hold, automakers such as Honda, General Motors, Toyota and others are stepping up efforts for further research and development in this area.\nAs the auto industry faces recent slipping sales, clean energy vehicles are catching the attention of consumers looking for efficiency and environmentally friendly alternatives, giving manufacturers a new direction for growth. The momentum behind green cars is a reaction to a variety of factors such as fuel prices despite current declines, environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and global national energy security concerns.\nThis week many new clean energy vehicles are being introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show, a platform for the unveiling of current and future alternative vehicles. Creating a buzz were displays of plug-in hybrids, which use electric motors with a gasoline engine as a backup, and electric vehicles that run entirely on electricity. Also in the mix were natural gas, ethanol and biodiesel vehicles. Another event, the AltCars Expo this weekend in Santa Monica, is shaping up to be the one of the premiere events for alternative fuel vehicles, and many of the new models and concepts will be present.\nRecently, major automakers Toyota, Honda, General Motors and Nissan revealed a future that includes the production of various clean energy models. General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner has announced GM\u0092s plans to develop a plug-in hybrid for its Saturn Vue Green Line SUV, but with no specific date for production revealed. General Motors has also unveiled the concept behind the Hummer \u0093O2\u0094 which converts carbon dioxide to oxygen using algae-filled body panels.\nGeneral Motors is also focusing on cars that run on ethanol (E85) as part of their overall corporate environmental strategy moving forward. With ethanol becoming more widely available, as more producers such as Green Plains Renewable Energy (NASDAQ: GPRE) bring plant production online, these flex-fuel vehicles offer automakers viable near term opportunities while they continue to develop their next generation of green cars.\nHyundai is committing research efforts to hydrogen-powered fuel cells and vehicles that run on clean diesel as well as gas-electric hybrids. Honda is also looking at fuel cells with plans for hydrogen-powered sedans for 2008. Toyota Motor Corp, the largest seller of traditional hybrids, is another major automaker talking about developing plug-in models.\nWhile many companies pursue the plug-in hybrid models, full electric vehicles are rapidly grabbing industry attention. While there are very few publicly owned companies currently offering mass-produced electric cars, one private firm Tesla Motors is showcasing its new Roadster prototype, planned for limited production as early as 2007, but with a price tag of $100,000USD. Nissan has plans for a 125-mile range all-electric car, but plans for production are targeted for 2010.\nElectric car manufacturer and distributor ZAP (OTCBB: ZAAP) has a jump on the market with the only mass-produced and affordable electric car available for sale today. ZAP\u0092s XEBRA city-car and truck is currently on sale through dealerships in Los Angeles for approximately $10,000USD.

On top of saving energy, another long term goal was to ignite a trend towards hybrid retrofits in the water transportation industry.\nIn the meantime, hybrid retrofits have become a budding trend in the land transportation industry, with Fed Ex increasing its North American hybrid truck fleet by 50 percent after last week's announcement of 92 additional retrofitted delivery trucks. Fed Ex claims to have the largest hybrid package delivery fleet in the U.S. with a total of 264 hybrid trucks.

The high fuel economies and low tailpipe emissions of the most popular hybrid models have made the technology synonymous with eco-friendly engineering. While that\u2019s not always the case it is true that today\u2019s most popular hybrids are among the most environmentally friendly vehicles now on the road.\nEfficient hybrids, such as the Toyota Prius, have earned their right as environmental darlings of the passenger car market. So if you\u2019re planning a vacation, should you hop in your hybrid and hit the road? What about other modes of travel? How do efficient hybrids compare to, say, planes, trains, or buses? And do other factors matter, such as how many people are going or how far you\u2019re traveling? This issue of the Watchdog gets to the bottom of those questions by parsing out some of the results from the recent UCS report, Getting There Greener: The Guide to Your Lower-Carbon Vacation. As you\u2019ll see, the answers may not always be what you might expect.\nTale of the Tape\nSo, how do efficient hybrids stack up against the competition on a 500-mile or longer trip? In short, if an efficient hybrid car is used to move a family of four, it\u2019s the most eco-friendly travel option around. For trips with only two travelers, hybrids are still a pretty good option, coming in second only to buses. But, for solo trips efficient hybrids fall down to the middle of the pack\u2014especially on longer-distance trips where lower-carbon options exist such as the bus or train. And, perhaps surprisingly, a direct coach flight is a better travel option than driving solo in a hybrid if the trip is longer than 500 miles. The charts below, from Getting There Greener, show graphically how efficient hybrids compare to the other modes analyzed in the report.\nCars\nTo figure out where all this data came from, let\u2019s first look at a typical car: a 23 mpg gasoline-powered sedan. Including \u201cupstream\u201d emissions (the emissions associated with the extraction, refining, and transporting of the fuel from the well head to the gas tank), the production and consumption of a gallon of fuel produces approximately 25 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. For a 500-mile trip, that amounts to 540 pounds of CO2 pollution. An efficient hybrid, such as the 46-mpg Gen. 2 Prius, would be half of that at 270 pounds.\nWhen it comes to cars, however, that\u2019s only part of the story, because the fuller a vehicle, the more environmentally friendly it is. On a per-passenger basis, a car with four seats occupied is roughly four times more environmentally friendly than it is when the driver travels alone. Accounting to the slightly lower fuel economy you get with a full vehicle, the per-person emissions for a family of four in the hybrid example above are a mere 75 pounds per passenger. Compared with other modes of travel, family trips in efficient cars offer considerable eco-opportunity.\nSpeaking of other modes, as Getting There Greener explains in detail, the lowest-carbon mode of travel actually does depend how far you\u2019re traveling and how many people are going with you. While we\u2019re only going to touch on some of the key findings in this Watchdog, detailed information about plane, train, automobile, and bus emissions is available in Getting There Greener, free online\u00a0at the Union of Concerned Scientists web site .\nAirplanes\nThe amount of carbon dioxide emissions from an airplane trip depends on numerous factors, including the type of plane(s) flown, how many layovers are taken (since takeoff and landing activities have their own sets of emissions), and how many miles are ultimately logged in getting to your final destination (which is affected by how far out of the way any layover stops might be). Another important factor that affects the eco-impact of plane trips is what class you\u2019re traveling, since first class seats take up more room onboard and are therefore responsible for a greater share of the flight\u2019s total emissions.\nA 500-mile plane trip (non-stop, coach) emits slightly more than 300 pounds of emissions per passenger. However, additional family members don\u2019t get the added emissions benefit that they do in personal vehicles, so a family of four making that trip amounts to roughly 1,200 pounds of CO2 emissions.\nBuses and Trains\nWhile they are often overlooked when it comes to vacation travel, buses and trains can also make great sense from a carbon perspective, as they are among your lowest-emission options, especially on shorter (less than 500-mile) trips. Per-passenger emissions from a 500-mile trip in a bus or train amounts to 84 and 215 pounds of CO2, respectively. Moreover, unlike planes\u2014which have much higher occupancy rates\u2014motor coaches and trains are often underused and may offer what amounts to a carbon \u201cfree ride.\u201d\nDaily Driving\nOf course, even if it makes sense to leave your hybrid home when heading out on vacation, that\u2019s no reason to stick with a gas guzzler over a hybrid for your daily driving needs. If you need a car, purchasing an efficient hybrid is a good choice.

A bright spot for the Escalade Hybrid is that in 2011 Cadillac is charging a modest $3,170 for the hybrid system, which is significantly less than those in many other hybrid SUVs. Despite its poor smog-forming emissions performance (which significantly lowered its Environmental Improvement Score), the 29 percent reduction in global warming emissions puts the Escalade Hybrid 4 Wheel Drive (4WD) in the \u201cVery Good\u201d range for Hybrid Value, the only SUV to achieve that ranking.

Employing the two-mode system developed in partnership with BMW and GM, the vehicle has a 275-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 gasoline engine and two electric motors. Mercedes is using a battery pack almost half over as large GM\u2019s various Two-Mode hybrids. The all-wheel drive ML450 Hybrid is powered by a 3.5L V6 engine and two electric motors, giving it a total system output of 335 hp and 354 lb-ft of torque. It is built at Mercedes-Benz's Tuscaloosa, Alabama plant solely for North American consumption.\u00a0 \u00a0 Information on vehicle availability can be found at the official Mercedes website .\n2010 Mercedes-Benz S400 Hybrid (5 seat luxury sedan)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-5.2; Hybrid Value-Superior; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0 21\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 9\nThe S400 Hybrid gains a 14 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional S550 . The low smog-forming emissions of the S400 Hybrid results in an EPA air pollution score of 9 out of 10. One might expect a greater reduction in global warming emissions given that Mercedes-Benz downsized to a V6 engine, resulting in a vehicle that has about 30 percent less horsepower than the V8 engine in the S550. Yet, the Infiniti M Hybrid achieves a 28 percent reduction in global warming emissions without engine downsizing.\n2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid (5 seat midsize car)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-7.8; Hybrid Value-Very Good; Forced Features-$$$ more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG: 39\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a09\nThe 2011 Fusion shows marked improvements to the Ford hybrid drivetrain, with the ability to reach 47 mph in pure electric mode, and a more seamless shift from using electric to gasoline engine power.

Honda has retooled the Model Year 2012 Insight to improve its efficiency and reduce emissions. Debuting at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show, Honda claims it has reduced CO2 emissions from the previous model's 108 g/km to a claimed 96, a 12.5 percent improvement.\u00a0 This would put it under the 99 g/km threshold to qualify for European tax exemptions.\u00a0 Undoubtedly the same model will also come to the US market.\n2010 Toyota Prius (5 seat midsize car)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-9.2; Hybrid Value-Very Good; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG: 50\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 8\nEquipped with new features, the 2010 Prius achieves the highest fuel economy of any car currently on the U.S. market.\u00a0 The new model is bigger, more powerful and more fuel-efficient than its predecessor.\n2010 Lexus RX 450h (5 seat midsize SUV)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-9.2; Hybrid Value-Good; Forced Features-$ more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG: 29-30\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 8\nLexus introduced the RX 450h in model year 2010, replacing its first hybrid SUV, the RX 400h. The front-wheel-drive (FWD) version of this midsize SUV seats five people and gets a combined EPA estimated fuel economy of 30 miles per gallon (mpg), the first midsize SUV to reach that mark. The RX 450h FWD utilizes a more efficient Atkinson combustion cycle in its gasoline engine, which, combined with a hybrid drivetrain, gives it significant global warming emissions reductions.\n2010 Lexus HS 250h (5 seat luxury sedan)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-7.0; Hybrid Value-Very Good; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0 35\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 8\nThe HS 250h was a pioneer in choosing to downsize the gasoline engine to provide an efficiency and emissions-focused hybrid option in the luxury class. With a 31 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the IS 250, the HS 250h is in the top tier of hybrids for emissions performance The use of a more efficient gasoline engine with the hybrid system provides comparable acceleration performance to the IS 250 (rather than boost acceleration, as is the case with some hybrids) and allows Lexus to achieve a strong environmental performance with the HS 250h.\n2011 BMW ActiveHybrid X6 (5 seat SUV)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-3.2; Hybrid Value-Very Poor; Forced Features-$$$$$ more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0 18\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 6\nCompared with the X6 50i, the 2011 ActiveHybrid X6 achieves just an 11 percent reduction in global warming emissions. This pales in comparison to the Lexus RX 450h AWD, which achieves a 31 percent reduction in carbon\u00a0 emissions and an EPA estimated 29 mpg. The ActiveHybrid X6 Hybrid earns an EPA air pollution score of just 6 for smog-forming emissions, whereas the Lexus 450h AWD hybrid merits an impressive 9. These factors combined give the ActiveHybrid X6 an Environmental Improvement Score of 3.2, ahead of only the Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid at the bottom of this category. BMW decided to discontinue production of the ActiveHybrid X6 in 2011.\n2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (5-seat luxury sedan)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-9.5; Hybrid Value-Superior; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0\u00a039\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0\u00a09\nFor those looking for a luxury sedan, it is hard to ignore the MKZ Hybrid\u2019s 46 percent reduction in global warming emissions over the conventional MKZ. Indeed, many consumers have already noticed this as sales of the MKZ Hybrid have to date exceeded Ford\u2019s own projections. The Lexus HS 250h and Infiniti M Hybrid are next best in the luxury hybrid field, with 31 and 28 percent reductions, respectively.\nDodge Ram Hybrid (Full-size pickup)\nEst. release date:\u00a0Cancelled\nWhat we know: The Dodge Ram Hybrid was supposed to enter the market in 2010 with the same two-mode technology as the Durango and Aspen hybrids. Using a 5.7-liter Hemi V8, the two-mode system will increase overall fuel economy by approximately 25 percent.\u00a0 But citing slow sales of Silverado Hybrids, Chrysler executives decided to pull the plug on production in March 2010. Chrysler will still use the Two Mode hybrid transmission to develop a test group of plug-in hybrid electric Rams as part of a $48 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n2011\n2011 Chevrolet Volt (4 seat midsize)\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG: Electric Only-93mpg equiv. -- Gasoline Only-36\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0\u00a06\nIndicating an entirely new direction for GM, the Chevrolet Volt\u00a0introduced the first plug-in hybrid vehicle\u00a0on the U.S. market. GM\u00a0says Volt can run on electric power alone for 40 miles, though in reality the range seems more in the 25-30 mile range on average. When the battery has less than 30 percent of its charge remaining, the engine will turn on to charge the battery and extend the range of the Volt up to 640 miles. To charge, the Volt can be plugged into a 240-volt outlet for a full charge in less than three hours.\n2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid (5 seat midsize)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-6.8; Hybrid Value-Good; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0\u00a037\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0\u00a09\nThe Sonata Hybrid\u2019s 37 mpg translates to a 30 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional Sonata. This solid overall performance tops the reductions of the 33 mpg Toyota Camry Hybrid (21 percent) and is within range of the 39 mpg Ford Fusion Hybrid (33 percent). Hyundai\u00a0uses lithium polymer batteries, which Hyundai claims are more durable and space-efficient than both nickel-hydride and lithium-ion batteries. Hyundai\u2019s hybrid system will be used in more of its cars, including a plug-in hybrid that is projected for a 2012 release.

The CR-Z achieves a 22 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the Civic Coupe. This amounts to an 8 mpg bump in overall fuel economy. Among other conventional rivals, the sporty Mini Cooper gets an EPA estimated 32 mpg, and the Smart ForTwo Coupe rates 36 mpg.\u00a0 It goes from 0-60 mph in around 10 seconds.\u00a0 For those looking for a little more power, reports have said that Honda is working on a high-performance CR-Z Type R for 2012 release. Honda is looking to increase the current CR-Z\u2019s 113-horsepower 1.5-liter four-cylinder up to 150 horsepower and replace the 14-horsepower electric motor with a larger 50-horsepower unit for a combined output of 200 horsepower for the Type R.\n2011 Lexus CT 200h (5 seat hatchback)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-8.6; Hybrid Value-Superior; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0 42\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 8\nWith a 43 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the IS 250, the CT 200h is in the top tier of hybrids in this regard, finishing just behind the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid (which achieved a 46 percent reduction over the conventional MKZ) and Toyota Prius.\u00a0 This vehicle marks Lexus' return to hatchbacks, and another dedicated hybrid for the Lexus brand.\n2011 VW Touareg Hybrid (5 seat midsize SUV)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental\u00a0Score-3.0; Hybrid Value-Very Poor; Forced Features-$$$$$ more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG: 21\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 6\nAt 21 mpg, the Touareg Hybrid gets a measly 2 mpg improvement over the conventional model.

For example, the M Hybrid achieves more than double the emissions reduction improvement of the Lexus GS 450h (13 percent), the Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid (10 percent), and the BMW ActiveHybrid X6 (11 percent). Unfortunately, a poorly performing tailpipe emissions-control system severely compromises the smog-forming emissions performance of the Infiniti M Hybrid, earning it an EPA air pollution score of 6. This score, the lowest given to any hybrid, is surprising given the Nissan Altima Hybrid rates a 9.\n2011 Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid (5 seat midsize SUV)\nUCS Hybrid Scorecard Ratings: Environmental Improvement\u00a0Score-3.7; Hybrid Value-Good; Forced Features-None more...\nEPA Estimated Combined MPG:\u00a0 21\nEPA Smog Score (10=best):\u00a0 6\nThe Cayenne S Hybrid achieves only 14 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional Cayenne S, among the lowest reductions of all models on the Scorecard.

Rather, I showed my support for a cleaner environment in a way better suited to a car journalist: I test-drove the new Nissan Altima Hybrid.\nWhile getting a respectable 42 miles per gallon in the city and 36 mpg on the highway, the Altima Hybrid spewed far fewer greenhouse gases -- the ones linked to climate change -- than a comparably powered gas-engine-only sedan would have.\nBesides leaving a smaller carbon footprint, the Altima Hybrid, in the techno-speak of the emissions intelligentsia, is an Advanced Technology -- Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle . That means it releases almost no \"evaporative\" emissions -- the kind you get when gasoline evaporates and releases hydrocarbons, which react with sunlight to form smog.\nRELATED LINKS\nNo-Gas and Low-Gas Cars\nMore models\nOkay, neither the Altima nor any other hybrid is totally guilt free, and maybe I should have ridden my bike to pay homage to planet Earth. The point is, hybrids are more environmentally friendly than any other mass-market alternative. Diesels still are struggling to meet emissions standards in a number of states. Ethanol is still too expensive to produce, and affordable plug-in-battery technology is still a few years away.\nHybrids are far more plentiful now than they were even a year ago. Toyota sold nearly 107,000 Priuses last year and expects to sell 150,000 in 2007, on top of projected sales of about 60,000 Camry hybrids and 60,000 other Toyota and Lexus hybrid models. Honda's Civic Hybrid is also selling well.\nAnd more are on the way from other brands as carmakers sense the need to appease car buyers who want less pain at the pump and less impact on the environment.\nIn one of the first public mea culpas from a top automotive executive, Ford CEO Alan Mulally recently admitted that global warming is real and caused in part by auto emissions. \"Being stewards of our environment,\" he said, \"is the biggest agenda we have at Ford.\" Ford currently sells the Escape and Mercury Mariner hybrid SUVs, and it has plans to introduce a Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrid sedan.\nNissan is the latest carmaker to produce a hybrid. However, the company seems ambivalent about the technology: The Altima Hybrid is sold only in California and the seven states that follow California's emissions standards. Saturn is now churning out its Green Line Aura sedan and Vue SUV. And Chevy plans a Malibu sedan and Tahoe SUV hybrid later in the year. ( SEE OUR SLIDE SHOW of the five hybrids introduced within the past year.)\nHybrid economics\nWhat's held back many potential hybrid buyers is the price premium over comparable gas-engine sedans. Unless gasoline prices go a lot higher than they are now, you're not likely to earn back the premium you'd pay for a hybrid car with savings at the pump. When you compare the cost of a hybrid with its gas-engine doppelg\u00e4nger, hybrids typically cost several thousand dollars more.\nIn 2006 Uncle Sam began offering more-generous tax breaks -- a dollar for dollar credit to your tax bill -- to hybrid buyers. Some states and local governments also offer incentives (including sales-tax breaks and solo driving in HOV lanes). When you add savings on gas to the federal credit and incentives, a couple of hybrid models -- notably the Toyota Prius and Honda Civic Hybrid -- come close to paying back their premium, especially when you look at overall owner costs over five years. The Toyota Camry and Nissan Altima hybrids are the closest runners up.\nBased on fuel economy, the federal tax break ranges from a one-time credit of $250 for the two-wheel-drive Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra -- which improve gas mileage only 10% to 15% -- to $3,000 for the 2wd 2008 Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner hybrids. The Prius used to top the tax credit list, but Congress in its inscrutable wisdom limited the full credit for hybrids to the first 60,000 vehicles sold by a manufacturer.\nIn the phaseout of the break, credits for Toyota and Lexus hybrids have been halved and halved again. If you buy a Prius before October 1, 2007, you'll be eligible for a $787.50 credit. After that, you get nothing.

He answered many questions regarding low-carbon transport from figures from the transport industry who were in attendance as the are still many misconceptions regarding the viability of green motoring and how beneficial it actually is to the environment.\nOne of the key points is that whilst there are over 62m new cars produced every year, it has been estimated by Lux Research that by 2020 there will still only be 7.5m sales of electric or hybrid cars. This puts all the money being put into research and development into doubt. The plain fact is however that while the UK is dedicated to greener motoring many countries aren\u2019t as yet.\nAs far as urban driving is concerned, electric or hybrid vehicles make a lot of sense, it is for longer journeys that people still tend to side with a petrol or diesel car. There is obviously a long way to go before companies replace their fleets with greener vehicles and there is extensive research taking place in this area. You also have to consider that millions of pounds are being invested by people who obviously believe this is the future of motoring.\nLatest figures from the Department of Transport show that there are now 85 new cars in the UK that have a combined cycle economy of less than 20mpg, and many believe there should be a minimum economy limit on all new cars. This is being addressed through the CO2 targets that the European community is placing on cars. This lack of economy is particularly prevalent is such vehicles as Range Rovers.\nThese are large and heavy pieces of engineering and it would be almost impossible to pack this kind of technology into something lightweight and efficient. There are, however, pictures circulating which shows the new Range Rover Evoque, which delivers 50mog parked on top of a mountain. This effectively shows that these vehicles can be more economical without losing any of their power.\nYou would think that a country with the such a technological pedigree as the US would be leading the field in greener motoring. This is actually far from reality and they are trailing way behind the UK. Microsoft guru Bill Gates once said that if GM has kept up the way technology has moved forward in the same way as the computer industry has all Americans would be driving cars that cost $25 and gave 1000mpg.\nIn reality, the best selling car in the US gives an atrocious 14mpg and this only emphasises further the way that the UK is embracing greener motoring and taking it to new levels all the time. The Japanese are pioneers of fuel efficient vehicles, they offered the technology to the American motor industry, they turned it down and went bust. GM have now re-emerged with a car that does 175mpg, so they are finally on the right track.\nRelated posts:\n"}, {"score": 1043.5671, "uuid": "5e698b11-8a01-5b98-9aa2-f74de06cd8ce", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700wb-70-05626", "target_hostname": "www.localactionpa.org", "target_uri": "http://www.localactionpa.org/resources/hybrid-cars-hype-or-hope/", "page_rank": 1.269912e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>Hybrid</em> Cars: Hype <em>or</em> Hope? \u2014 Local Action Network", "snippet": "My own thoughts have turned to the possibilities of an after-market hatchback change-out that would make the back <em>more</em> pet- <em>or</em> suitcase-<em>friendly</em>, either as <em>a</em> permanent <em>or</em> periodic fix, and <em>a</em> Jetson-esque reversible front passenger seat that would allow <em>a</em> parent chauffeur to cart around two kids with", "explanation": null, "document": "You are here: Home \u203a Resources \u203a Hybrid Cars: Hype or Hope?\nInfo\nHybrid Cars: Hype or Hope?\nLAN FAQ on Toyota Prius Hybrid\nWe bought a Prius this year.\u00a0 It replaced our former only car,\u00a0 an aged, tiny import.\u00a0 It\u2019s\u00a0 been enough of a conversation starter since then that I feel compelled to answer some of the FAQs.\nDo we like it?\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019m happy that we got it, but it convinced me that what I really needed was a bike trailer, so I could do many of those around-town trips on kale and beans, instead of fossil fuels, even with the kids in tow.\u00a0 We chose a Burley DeLite, but I would probably have gone with a Chariot Cougar or Cabriolet had it been available.\nDoes it have enough power?\u00a0 Yes, I\u2019m not driving the NASCAR circuit.\u00a0 It has as much power as our last car and more than some others I\u2019ve driven.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an electric car.\u00a0 It\u2019s a gasoline-powered car with a electric generator that allows it conserve its own energy.\u00a0 Does it feel \u201cmuscular\u201d?\u00a0 No, when I want to feel muscular, I do something strenuous with my own body, not a monocoque chassis.\nIs it big enough?\u00a0 Yes, we can fit two kids, with car seats, and even squeeze in an extra passenger if we need to.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t have seating for 7 or space for a large pet.\u00a0 Toyota has had a hybrid minivan on the road in Japan since 2000, but doesn\u2019t seem to be making any moves to bring it to the US market.\u00a0 (If you want to weigh in on that, here\u2019s a link to a poll/petition for a domestic Sienna hybrid: http://www.hybridcars.com/toyota-sienna-minivan-hybrid.html.\u00a0 And the Scion and Mazda 5 both have reasonable-looking mileage for large capacity vehicles, but their emissions are pathetic.)\u00a0 My own thoughts have turned to the possibilities of an after-market hatchback change-out that would make the back more pet- or suitcase-friendly, either as a permanent or periodic fix, and a Jetson-esque reversible front passenger seat that would allow a parent chauffeur to cart around two kids with two friends without insisting that a minivan is essential equipment for living (don\u2019t know yet about whether that would offer any greater crash safety for kids than sitting in the front seat which is now verboten).\nWhat kind of mileage does it get anyway?\u00a0 The EPA ratings are officially 60mpg city and 55mpg highway.\u00a0 Everyone knows that those ratings are notoriously useless.\u00a0 The car does perform at its best under the conditions imposed by the test \u2013 engine hot, long duration driving at about 35 mph for city, with stops and starts, and at about 55 mph for highway.\u00a0 If you drive that way, the mileage is realistic.\u00a0 So, for example, if you live in an outer beltway suburb or LA and spend long periods of time driving between 30 and 40 mph either in freeway traffic or on exurb traffic lighted roadways, you will get very high mileage.\u00a0 Around here, taking 405 from Muncy to Lewisburg was the closest I\u2019ve come to that; I got 58 mpg.\u00a0 And if you were to drive on the highway sticking rigorously to 55mph, 55mpg is perfectly realistic.\u00a0 But local driving conditions tend to be far different.\u00a0 We typically get around 46mpg city and 51 mpg highway.\u00a0 Probably the biggest variable is the cold start.\u00a0 Our \u201ccity\u201d driving is rarely over 2 miles.\u00a0 Sadly, this is the most frequent type of trip we do, even after we got the bike trailer.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course that means our old car was doing even worse, though I tend to think that the relative deficit of the cold start is greater for the hybrid.\u00a0 The absolute mileage remains far better however.\nNot a FAQ, but rather a FSD (frequently stated declaration):\u00a0 We looked at the mileage ratings and decided it didn\u2019t make sense for us; we don\u2019t do much city driving.\u00a0 Typically when I hear this and I look at the vehicle chosen in the end, it\u2019s clear that rational thinking did not prevail.\u00a0 While the Prius is capable of getting higher mileage in the city, its lower highway mileage is still far and away better than almost all the competition.\u00a0\u00a0 There are a few exceptions, either in the form of tiny conventionally fueled cars, often not an option because of needs for more passenger or cargo space or something like a VW Jetta Turbodiesel.\u00a0 The Jetta TDI is championed by many and has great stats (see AutoWeek\u2019s Earth Day driving comparison online), but has an atrocious emissions profile, whether from particulates, sulfur, greenhouse gases or other environmental pollutants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Prius is better on emissions than the Jetta TDI by a factor of 10.\u00a0 Even if you run the Jetta on 20% biodiesel, it\u2019s still environmentally outclassed by a factor of 6.\nThere are some who speak longingly of hybrid clean diesel technologies or pure battery, charged with photovoltaics (rather than high sulfur and mercury-laden coal-generated line current).\u00a0 For myself, I remain a devotee of non-automotive travel.\u00a0 In other words, my other car\u2019s a bike.\u00a0 And since there is not yet full freedom of movement around here for those of us running on personal power, that means I also work actively to improve transportation options locally for all.\u00a0 Both riding and promoting bikes give me a real work out.\n\u00ab April 2012 \u00bb\n"}, {"score": 1043.0603, "uuid": "d26984eb-67be-594d-9e24-ed2c5f4a7bd9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1804wb-89-19284", "target_hostname": "respectourplanet.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://respectourplanet.typepad.com/hybridboat/2009/08/index.html?no_prefetch=1", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "<em>Hybrid</em> Boat: August 2009", "snippet": "The Hornblower <em>Hybrid</em> <em>is</em> <em>a</em> technological advancement many years in the making, harnessing energy from the sun and the wind, combined with <em>diesel</em> engines, to propel the vessel.", "explanation": null, "document": "Coming Soon: Educational Bay Cruises on the Hybrid!\nLooking for an environmental education field trip in the Bay Area?
