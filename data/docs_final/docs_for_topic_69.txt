The invincible cloak of history shelters the past from criticism and exaggerates its importance. Boxing experts are a curious bunch; refusing to believe that the quality of boxing could be better today than yesterday. It is one of the most subjective of sports, of course, because there is no real measuring tool with which to prove the progress.\nUsain Bolt, for example, can prove he is quicker than Jesse Owens in approximately 9.58 seconds. It would take far longer than that, an open mind, and reams of footage to put forward a decent argument that Manny Pacquiao could ever have competed with Sugar Ray Robinson. In a similar way, despite no recordings existing of their first two meetings, the Tony Zale-Rocky Graziano trilogy will always trump the astonishing Arturo Gatti-Micky Ward rivalry in excitement lists.\nThe staunch supporters of the past have always grated with me somewhat. But today I'm in their corner. I am going to tell you that, whatever happens in the future, one boxing event will not be surpassed. We will never again see anything like the fight the entire world was engrossed in 40 years ago today when Muhammad Ali stepped into the ring with Joe Frazier for the first time.\n\u201cIt's a fight that changed boxing in a lot of ways,\u201d legendary trainer and Frazier's amateur buddy Emanuel Steward remembers. \u201cThe way they looked; their wonderful outfits, with Ali in bright red and Frazier in bright green. The way the crowd looked with Frank Sinatra, the celebrities, the characters and the pimps, the drug dealers and the business guys. It took boxing to another level.\u201d\n300 million viewers are thought to have watched the fight around the globe. To put that figure into context, that's how many people use the website Facebook. Imagine that. Millions and millions of status updates about a boxing match. A match that was years in the making.\nAli won an Olympic gold in 1960, stunned the world to win the world heavyweight title in 1964 and appalled parts of it for his decision to not serve his country in the Vietnam War. As a result of his political and religious stand, he was forced out of the ring from 1967-70.\nFrazier, after claiming the top prize at the 1964 games, emerged as the leading big man in Muhammad's absence. Frazier had initially helped Ali in his years away from the sport and supported his right to fight. But things changed when Joe picked up the baton that Ali had dropped and sprinted ferociously past his rivals. Ali was loudly goading him at the finishing line, tormenting Joe's character and disrespectfully challenging his coronation. Betrayed and belittled, a furious Frazier was desperate to do his talking in the ring.\nMuhammad had returned with a cut-induced stoppage victory over Jerry Quarry. Ali had looked okay but understandably rusty; he had also clearly slowed down. The self-righteous voice of American commentator Howard Cosell then spent much of Muhammad's subsequent victory over Oscar Bonavena telling viewers Ali was done.\n\u201cMuhammad went into exile during his formative years and they were important years,\u201d opines Frazier and Ali foe George Chuvalo. \u201cYou can't be the same fighter, you can't lose those precious years and still be the same fighter. He was never the same after that.\u201d\nBut to come back, after so long away, and beat two robust hombres like Quarry and Bonavena was an incredible feat. Compare that pair to Peter McNeeley and Buster Mathis Jnr that Mike Tyson feasted on in 1995 after his forced spell on the sidelines. You could even throw Tyson's third comeback opponent, Frank Bruno, in there and you'd still have a weaker bunch than the mighty Jerry and Oscar. Ali's self-belief and ability remained but he was reliant on a different way of fighting. The Ali of 1967 had indeed gone forever, but the legend of \u201cThe Greatest\u201d was sprouting new layers.\n\u201cSome of his edge was taken off when he came back in 1970,\u201d Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee tells me. \u201cHe was in and out of the gym during his exile but he did nothing other than that, he was not athletic like Ray Leonard who would do all kind of sports \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it was strictly boxing for Muhammad. But we did what we could and there was a time when Jimmy Ellis was training for a fight and Muhammad looked after him. He paid for his hotel, he sparred with Jimmy to help him out. That was the kind of kid Muhammad was.\u201d\nFrazier wasn't convinced by Ali's good nature. The hatred that remains today had planted some iron roots. The public was engrossed in the violent collision of contrasting personalities. Everyone had an opinion on who would win. Joe was in the form of his life and he knew it. Ali was slower than before but was still quicker of hand than his rival and, interestingly, he had stopped Bonavena \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something Frazier couldn't do.\n\u201cHe had all that time off but I thought he would be ready for Joe Frazier, particularly after he beat Bonavena in 1970,\u201d remembers Dundee. \u201cOn the night before the fight, though, Muhammad did a sitting with one of the magazines until midnight. That was no way to prepare but Muhammad did it because he had told the magazine he would. I didn't know about it at the time. I wouldn't have allowed it if I had.\u201d\nSo with the world dribbling with anticipation, Ali, always the showman was working the media circus. But the pandemonium he was so carefully constructing built problems for him on the day of \u201cThe Fight\u201d.\n\u201cWe went to the weigh-in at 12 noon and we never left the building because of the crowds,\u201d Angelo reveals. \u201cWe could not get back to our hotel room so we had to stay there. We had lunch in the sport club and had to walk around inside Madison Square Garden to walk off the food, and then I made him rest on the rub-down table in the dressing room and we were there until the fight. People don't know these things.\u201d\nAs Ali made a makeshift home at Madison Square Garden, the world was drunk on anticipation. The fight was affecting everything, and everyone.\n\u201cI was supposed to be fighting in the finals of the New York Golden Gloves on that same day, in the same place, Madison Square Garden, and they had to move the whole tournament back a week,\u201d then-promising amateur Eddie Mustafa Muhammad recalls passionately. \u201cBut that didn't worry me because it was a great time for boxing, especially in New York. It was the biggest fight the world had ever seen and I couldn't wait. At that point in my life they were all I wanted to become \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they were world champions. Ali and Frazier provided the backdrop for me to do what I wanted to do.\u201d\nDreams were indeed made that night. Ali danced and Frazier followed. Passion swirled inside the hungry stomachs of onlookers. Eyelids retreated to invite colourful overdoses of imagery into feverish minds. Given the weight of expectancy it is a defining testament to both of the warriors involved that the subsequent showdown floated magnificently above it all.\n\u201cIt was a great fight, incredible anticipation, it was incredible action, it was everything,\u201d gushes Eddie. \u201cIt lived up to the hype. It was two guys who could rightfully claim to be the best heavyweight in world at the same time. Ali was undefeated, Joe was undefeated and they couldn't get along, so they got it on.\u201d\nAli had predicted a sixth-round win. But from the opening bell, Ali was just fighting to keep Frazier off him.\n\u201cIt was a tough, great fight,\u201d says Angelo, wistfully. \u201cJoe was a great fighter and they were made for each other. They could have fought 30 times and each would have been special. My guy started well and won most of the early rounds big. But Joe, to his credit, came on strong and won the late rounds and of course, scored that late knockdown to get the decision.\u201d\nIt wasn't that simple, of course. Ali certainly had his moments. Moments of pristine brilliance. But Frazier had more. He was like a man possessed. The maniacal heat of \u201cSmokin'\u201d Joe would not be denied.\n\u201cIn my mind I thought Joe might win because we were amateurs together,\u201d Steward says as the memories evoke a shining smile. \u201cJoe was sensational wasn't he? They both were. I remember Ali laying on the ropes and Joe having a good go at him and then Ali coming back. The fight matched the hype with Ali going down with one of the best left hooks in history. But he got up and won the rest of the round. It was an incredible fight.\u201d\nWith swarming brilliance, Frazier won a decision. He deserved it. And although Ali later claimed the verdict had gone the wrong way, in his quieter moments, and immediately after the fight, he was humble about his setback.\n\u201cMuhammad accepted it,\u201d Angelo divulges. \u201cHe looked at me straight afterwards and he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It's okay Ang, we'll get him next time.' And we did. We won the next two so maybe that loss was for the best. I took him to the hospital after that fight because I didn't like the look of the lump on his jaw - I thought he'd broken it. They wanted to keep him in over night for observation and Muhammad said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not staying in! I've got to go back and speak to the newspaper men!'\u201d\nIn contrast, Frazier didn't need to say a thing. He didn't need to prove anything ever again. For that night, he was the most powerful man in the universe. What a night. What a glorious night.\n\u201cWe need something like that now to bring something special back to the heavyweight division,\u201d sighs Steward. But he knows it just as well as I do. There will never be another like \u201cThe Fight\u201d on March 8 1971.\nThanks for reading.\n"}, {"score": 1552.1569, "uuid": "8c99e4df-6de0-58fe-bbbc-60092efc11b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0801wb-32-23136", "target_hostname": "www.boxingnewsonline.net", "target_uri": "http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/view-Blog.asp?BlogID=637", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "<em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>: <em>A</em> great man, <em>a</em> great fighter | Boxing News Online", "snippet": "I <em>was</em> an amateur when I first met him at <em>a</em> boxing show in Philly.

I knew him personally; it hurt me to think of him in pain. He was another fallen soldier and I hoped he could pull through, I hoped he could get up, but his number came.\nI was an amateur when I first met him at a boxing show in Philly. I was a light-heavyweight at the time and I told him I was going to be a world heavyweight champion. I always used to try and box like Muhammad Ali back then. He looked at my arms and he watched the way I boxed.\n\u201cYou remind me of \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Butterfly',\u201d he said. I'll never forget that.\nA few years later I was training at the Joe Frazier Gym in Philly. Again, I was up on my toes and Joe told me again that I reminded him of \u201cThe Butterfly\u201d. I told him that he had told me this before.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he said like only Joe Frazier could with that slight mumble or stutter. \u201cOkay, well, I'm glad you remember.\u201d\nHe was then demonstrating how to throw a left hook to the body, and I don't know if he knew his own strength, but Joe hit me. The force of the shot went right up into me. When Joe Frazier throws a left hook to your body, it feels like he's going in there and grabbing your heart. I looked at him and I was like, \u201cJoe, please!\u201d\nHe looked at me but he was still holding his fist there because he was trying to show me how to punch like that. He had his right arm around my back and was pushing me onto his left. He was showing me how to shovel into the body. It was an effective exhibition. I remember wondering if he was doing it so hard because I reminded him of \u201cThe Butterfly\u201d. It hurt, man.\nWhen I was fighting I would often look out and see Joe Frazier watching. Imagine that? I could never believe that. There was Joe, one of the greatest fighters of all time, watching me, Shannon Briggs from Brownsville, New York. It was surreal because I spent so much time growing up watching Joe on the television.\nJoe was a natural born wrecking ball. He was such a strong man, even when he was older I had to prepare myself for a broken hand when he came over to shake it. Every time I saw him I'd think, \u201cOh s***, here we go again, I'm going to lose a finger this time.\u201d What a strong guy. But it was always a pleasure to see him, an honour to speak to him.\nI saw him in the last the couple of years. He looked good, he'd lost a bit of weight, but he spoke as well as he'd always spoke and I was happy to see him. I hugged him and he was proud of me after I'd won my title in 2006. He told me I was the only one who brought it back. And to this day, I'm the last American-born heavyweight champion. I told him that I didn't get any credit for winning the title and he looked at me.\n\u201cThey don't give me no credit either,\u201d he said.\nBut I gave him his credit. Joe was one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. He had a hard time growing up and he grew into a wonderful man. He was a father, a humanitarian, a great fighter and a great ambassador for boxing. His gym helped the kids, it got them off the street in one of the worst neighbourhoods in the country. Philadelphia is rough and you better believe that. Be careful who you fight from Philly because, thanks to Joe, even a bum could knock you out with a left hook.\nShannon now works for online marketing company Acquinity Interactive and continues to support his revolutionary asthma medication ZIVAIR\n"}, {"score": 2190.4785, "uuid": "5aca41f3-d5ee-5830-9ebb-4128ce804a55", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0111wb-72-27149", "target_hostname": "www.frankwarren.tv", "target_uri": "http://www.frankwarren.tv/index.php/news/fwtv-news/tim-smith-blog/1523-muhammad-ali.html", "page_rank": 1.3961114e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>MUHAMMAD</em> <em>ALI</em>", "snippet": "Create an account <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> turned 70 years old this week.

All kinds of questions were running through my head, but the main one was: Would Ali grant me an interview?\nI arrived at the autograph show and found Ali. I approached him and identified myself as a reporter with the local newspaper and asked him if I could interview him. The place was a madhouse as there were other athletes and lines of people all over the place waiting to get their memorabilia signed.

I don\u2019t know whether it was because I was meeting one of my heroes, but Ali looked like a giant. He was larger than life in every aspect.\nHe invited me into his suite and asked me to sit down. I had my recorder running and asked him all the questions that I written down and more.

I asked him about his relationship with Frazier and he admitted that it wasn\u2019t good and that he thought that it was the best way to promote the fight.

Welcome to Democracy Now!\nDAVID ZIRIN: Great to be here, Amy.\nAMY GOODMAN: Before we talk about Muhammad Ali, I want to go back to the top story today: Don Imus's comments disparaging the Rutgers basketball team and Maretta Short of NOW talking about this being the thirty-fifth anniversary of Title IX. Can you talk more about this, because this is something you've written extensively about?\nDAVID ZIRIN: Absolutely. When Title IX was first put into play back in the early 1970s, roughly one out of twenty-nine girls in middle school, junior high school, high school, played sports. Today, that number is roughly one out of three. And so, statistics show that young girls who play sports at an early age are actually less likely to end up in abusive relationships, less likely to have eating disorders, less likely to have issues with drugs and alcohol. So you're talking about legislation, a direct result of the women's movement of the late '60s and early '70s, that has benefited the lives of tens of millions of women in this country. And the fact that it's something that both George W. Bush and Chief Justice John Roberts have both said that they opposed, I think is something that we all should be very aware of on this anniversary of this incredible legislation.\nAMY GOODMAN: And your thoughts on Don Imus, whether he should be fired?\nDAVID ZIRIN: Oh, I think he should be canned like a tuna. I mean, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say I'm just so sick and tired of the shock jocks, of the Coulters, of the Imuses, being able to say whatever they want to say and then reaping the publicity from that, and then being able to just apologize and go on with a slight bump in their ratings.\nBut I'll tell you something that's bothersome to me, and this is why, really, I wrote the Muhammad Ali Handbook, is the silence from the world of sports. I mean, with all due respects to Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, I wanted to hear the rise of voices from NBA players, from WNBA players, from NBA Commissioner David Stern, from all the people who were offended by what Imus said. The sports world needs to have its own progressive milieu to respond to things like this.\nI mean, look how political the world of sports is, everything from Pat Tillman to gay athletes to this issue. I mean, it's so infused with politics. Yet, too often, politics is verboten for athletes. I have spoken in the last week to NBA and WNBA players who were repulsed by what Don Imus said. But the idea of speaking out is such a foreign concept that it makes Ali's history all the more relevant for today: the athlete who would not be silenced.\nAMY GOODMAN: Let's talk about Muhammad Ali and what he would say out loud.\nDAVID ZIRIN: What Ali would say out loud would be -- well, he certainly would say, I think, \"I have a quarrel with Don Imus.\" I mean, and he would say -- you know, even say, \"I ain't got no quarrel with the sisters at Rutgers University.\" I mean, that's the thing about Muhammad Ali in the 1960s that's so incredible. I mean, he finished in the bottom 1% of his high school class. He barely graduated from high school. Yet, on all the important social issues of the day, on the edge of the black freedom struggle, on the Vietnam War, while all the best and the brightest were talking about \"all deliberate speed\" for integration and talking about war in Vietnam, Muhammad Ali knew what side he was on, time and again. He knew there was right, and he knew there was wrong. And because he had that direct connection both to a black political tradition that was antiwar, through people like Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, Marcus Garvey, and also because his own family came from the black working class in the South, he knew which side he was on, on a series of these questions, when the leading edge of politics, of the so-called \"experts,\" were so patently wrong.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to play another clip highlighting Muhammad Ali's political beliefs. This, a clip from When We Were Kings, the documentary about Ali's 1974 championship bout with George Foreman in Kinshasa that came to be known as the \"Rumble in the Jungle.\"\n0. MUHAMMAD ALI: Yeah, I'm in Africa. Yeah, Africa is my home. Damn America and what America thinks! Yeah, I live in America, but Africa is the home of the black man, and I was a slave 400 years ago, and I'm going back home to fight among my brothers. Yeah!\n0.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Muhammad Ali speaking in 1974.\nDAVID ZIRIN: Absolutely. And, you know, going back to that Kinshasa fight, I think it's a great example of the redemptive power of Muhammad Ali, because by that time he was somebody who, you know, had returned to the world of boxing, had fought off through the Supreme Court a five-year prison sentence given down to him by the federal courts, an outrageously high sentence for a draft resister at the time, and by the end, after that fight, he was named \"Sportsman of the Year\" by Sports Illustrated. So he makes this amazing journey from being the most vilified, hated athlete in the history of the United States -- and I don't think there's any contention about that -- to becoming a figure of reconciliation, who was invited by Gerald Ford to the White House to shake hands. And that's the thing about Ali, is that he was always bound up in the rhythms of the social movements of the day. So in the '60s he becomes a figure that's beloved by the antiwar movement and the black freedom struggle, hated by the mainstream, yet as the movements died in the '70s, he became a figure of bringing those two worlds back together.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is another clip of Muhammad Ali, again from When We Were Kings, also before the fight with George Foreman.\n0. MUHAMMAD ALI: I'm going to fight for the prestige, not for me, but to uplift my little brothers who are a sleeping on concrete floors today in America, black people who are living on welfare, black people who can't eat, black people who don't know no knowledge of themselves, black people who don't have no future. I want to win my title and walk down the alleys, settle in the garbage can with the wineheads. I want to walk down the street with the dope addicts, talk to the prostitutes so I can help a lot of the people.\n0.\n0. I can show them films. I can take this documentary. I can take movies and help organize my people in Louisville, Kentucky, Indianapolis, Indiana, Cincinnati, Ohio. I can go through [inaudible] and Florida and Mississippi and show the little black Africans in them countries, who didn't know this is their country. You look like people in Mississippi, in Alabama and Georgia. They're your brother, but they never knew you was over here, and you don't know much about them. God has blessed me [inaudible] through boxing to help get to all these people and to show them films that I haven't seen. I know they haven't seen them. I'm well, and I haven't seen them. Now I can go get all these films. You governments can let me take pictures. You can let me do things, and I can take all this back to America. But it's good to be a winner. All I go to do is whoop George Foreman.\n0.\nAMY GOODMAN: That's right, that was Muhammad Ali, right before the fight with George Foreman in 1974.\nDAVID ZIRIN: Yeah, and what I can't help think about, hearing this, is about how distanced a lot of the star athletes are today from that kind of mindset, of saying, \"I'm fighting for the people in the -- for the winos, for the dopeheads, for the people who live in the gutter, for the people who are told that they can never amount to anything. You know, LeBron James, who's the most famous player in the National Basketball Association, still only twenty-two years old, was asked in an interview about his career aspirations, and he said at the same time that he wanted to be a global icon like Muhammad Ali and that he wanted to be the first athlete billionaire. Now, if you actually know the history, those two ideas are so in conflict with one another, yet because all LeBron James knows is that Muhammad Ali is famous for being famous, that's what LeBron James knows. And because few people have had their political teeth extracted like Muhammad Ali -- I mean, he's been the victim of a political root canal -- so the hope for this book is to try to restore the teeth to what Muhammad Ali actually stood for in the '60s.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about Gary Tyler. We did a broadcast with the New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, talking about his case. Explain how you're organizing with athletes.\nDAVID ZIRIN: Yes. I mean, first of all --\nAMY GOODMAN: And explain his case quickly.\nDAVID ZIRIN: Absolutely. Gary Tyler, he's been in Angola prison, a former slave plantation, for thirty-two years. The case against him is spotty, to put it mildly. I believe he's innocent, looking at the evidence in the case. Bob Herbert believes he's innocent, looking at the evidence of the case. And I read Bob Herbert's three columns published over the course of a month in the New York Times, and I heard him on your show, Amy, and when I heard this, I tried to ask myself, \"Well, what can I do to help?\" I mean, it was so stark and so upsetting, Gary Tyler's story.\nSo, you know, my little corner of the world is the intersection of athletes and politics. So I put out a call. I wrote a letter, calling it \"Jocks for Justice,\" sent it out to some athletes, and I wanted to see who would be willing to sign on and if we could get some publicity by doing a public statement. And I've got to tell you, one of the things that was really shocking about it is, usually getting in touch with former athletes, with famous athletes, it's like trying to get in touch with Don Corleone, like you have to talk to the guy who knows the guy who knows the guy just to talk to somebody. And it was so striking to me how people just got back to me so quickly, the older athletes, people like Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, Tommy Smith and John Carlos, former Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton and Red Sox all-star Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee. They remembered Gary's case from the early '70s, and immediately they got back to me: \"Sign me on.\"\nSome of the younger athletes, people like Etan Thomas for the Washington Wizards, or Toni Smith, the woman basketball player who made her stand protesting the war at Manhattanville College. They, like me, needed to be educated on the case, because it has been so forgotten over the last thirty years. But when they heard about it, I mean, it was just like -- it has that feel of a movement right now, and they were on board.\nAMY GOODMAN: And just again, for those who didn't hear our broadcast of the case of Gary Tyler, Gary Tyler is the man who's been in prison now since he was sixteen years old, his case being called one of the great miscarriages of justice in modern history in the United States. He's the African American jailed in 1974 for a murder many believe he didn't commit, an all-white jury convicting him based entirely on the statement of four witnesses who have later recanted their testimony.\nI want to thank you very much, Dave Zirin, for joining us. The new book is called Muhammad Ali Handbook. Howard Zinn has called Dave Zirin a \"talented sportswriter with a social conscience.\"\nMuhammad Ali - the living flame\nby Thomas Hauser\nObserver Sport Monthly, November 2, 2003\nhttp://observer.guardian.co.uk/\nPeople today understand that Muhammad Ali defied the US government and alienated mainstream America because he stood up for his principles. But they often don't know what those principles were. Generally, they are aware that, after beating Sonny Liston to capture the world heavyweight championship in 1964, Clay announced that he had accepted the teachings of a religion known as the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. Thereafter, he became a lightning rod for dissent throughout America and refused induction into the US Army during the height of the war in Vietnam.\nBut to younger generations the Ali of today is famous primarily for being famous. There has been a deliberate distortion of what he once believed, said, and stood for. History is being rewritten to serve political, social and economic ends. Thus, it's important to revisit the Ali who, in the words of author Dave Kindred, was 'as near to living flame as a man can get'.\nIn the early 1960s, when Ali first entered the public consciousness, sport was considered one of the few areas where black Americans could compete on equal footing with whites. But, in reality, sport reflected the old order. Black athletes could become stars, but only within guidelines dictated by the establishment. And away from the playing fields, as Ali himself once noted, 'many coloured people thought it was better to be white'. Black Americans were scorned, demeaned and denied even self-love.\nIn 1961, Cassius Clay met a man called Sam Saxon. Saxon was one of a small group of adherents (known to the media as 'Black Muslims') who attended Nation of Islam meetings at a Miami temple and followed the black separatist teachings of a self-proclaimed 'messenger' called Elijah Muhammad. Clay accepted Saxon's invitation to attend a Nation of Islam service and thereafter was indoctrinated with the tenets of the religion.\nThe Nation of Islam taught that white people were devils who had been genetically created by an evil scientist with a large head named Mr Yacub. It maintained there was a wheel-shaped, half-mile wide 'Mother of Planes' manned by black men in the sky and that, on Allah's chosen day of retribution, 1,500 planes from this Mother of Planes would drop deadly explosives destroying all but the righteous on earth. Neither of these views is part of traditional Islamic thought or finds justification in the Koran. Moreover, while the concepts of Heaven and Hell are central to traditional Islamic doctrine, the Nation of Islam rejected both.\nFrom 1964 through his conversion to orthodox Islam in 1975, Muhammad Ali was the Nation of Islam's most visible and vocal spokesman in America. Nation of Islam teachings were at the core of who he was at that time in his life. Among the positions Ali preached were:\nOn integration: 'We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don't want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don't want to live with the white man; that's all.'\nOn intermarriage: 'No intelligent black man or black woman in his or her right black mind wants white boys and white girls coming to their homes to marry their black sons and daughters.'\nOn the need for a separate black homeland: 'Why don't we get out and build our own nation? White people just don't want their slaves to be free. That's the whole thing. Why not let us go and build ourselves a nation? We want a country. We're 40 million people, but we'll never be free until we own our own land.'\nOn brotherhood: 'We're not all brothers. You can say we're brothers, but we're not.'\nAli was black and proud of it at a time when many black Americans were running from their colour. 'He lived a lot of lives for a lot of people,' said social activist Dick Gregory. 'And he was able to tell white folks, for us, to \"Go to hell.\"'\nThe establishment media - and sportswriters in particular - came down hard on Ali. Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times labelled him the 'white man's burden'. Jimmy Cannon of the New York Journal-American called Ali's ties to the Nation of Islam 'the dirtiest in American sports since the Nazis were shouting for Max Schmeling as representative of their vile theories of blood'.\nA lot of white liberals and black Americans also took issue with Ali. 'I never went along with the pronouncements of Elijah Muhammad that the white man was the devil and that blacks should be striving for separate development; a sort of American apartheid,' said Arthur Ashe. 'That never made sense to me. It was a racist ideology and I didn't like it.'\nJoe Louis added his voice to those opposing Ali and opined: 'I've always believed that every man is my brother. Clay will earn the public's hatred because of his connections with the Black Muslims.'\nFormer heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson concurred with Louis, declaring: 'I've been told that Clay has every right to follow any religion he chooses and I agree. But, by the same token, I have every right to call the Black Muslims a menace to the United States and a menace to the Negro race. I do not believe God put us here to hate one another. Cassius Clay is disgracing himself and the Negro race.'\nStill, whether or not one liked what Ali represented, it was clear his demand for full entitlement for all black people was on the cutting edge of an era. 'I'm no leader; I'm a little humble follower,' Ali said. But to many he was the ultimate symbol of black pride and resistance to an unjust social order.\nAli broke the mould. When he appeared on the scene, it was popular among those in the vanguard of the civil rights movement to take the 'safe' path. That path wasn't safe for those who participated in the struggle. Martin Luther King Jr, Medgar Evers, Viola Liuzzo and other courageous men and women were subjected to violence and sometimes death when they carried the struggle 'too far'. But the road they travelled was designed to be as non-threatening as possible. White Americans were told: 'All that black people want is what you want for yourselves. We're appealing to your conscience.'\nThen along came Ali, preaching something very different from mainstream values. Outside the ring, he was never violent. His threat to the status quo was one of ideas, which is ironic because he himself was never a 'thinker'.\nThe civil rights movement and Ali as a fighter both peaked in the mid-1960s. Then the war in Vietnam intervened. In 1964, Ali had been classified 1-Y (not qualified for military service) as a result of scoring poorly on a Selective Service mental aptitude examination. Then, in early 1966, with the war expanding and manpower needs growing, the test score required for induction into the armed forces was lowered, leaving him eligible for the draft. Ali requested a deferment but, on 17 February 1966, his request was denied and he was reclassified 1-A (available for the draft). Several hours later, a frustrated Ali blurted out to reporters: 'I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong.' The following day, his outburst was front-page news across the country and the sporting press raged against him.\nAli wasn't a political thinker. His initial concern over being drafted wasn't religious or political. It was that of a 24-year-old who thought he had put the draft behind him and then learned he was in danger of having his life turned upside down.\nLater, however, on 28 April 1967, citing his religious beliefs, Ali refused induction into the United States Army. 'Clay seems to have gone past the borders of faith,' Milton Gross wrote in the New York Post. 'He has reached the boundaries of fanaticism.'\nLess than eight weeks later, on 20 June, Ali was convicted of refusing induction into the armed forces and sentenced to five years in prison. He was stripped of his title and precluded by state athletic commissions throughout the country from fighting. His 'exile' from boxing lasted for more than three years.\nVietnam deflected attention from Ali's racial views and put him in a context where many whites and white opinion-makers could identify with him. There had been an ugly mood around Ali, starting with the assassination of Malcolm X in February 1965. Thereafter, Ali seemed to take on a bit of the persona, not just the ideology, of the Nation of Islam. But when the spotlight turned from Ali's acceptance of an ideology that sanctioned hate to his refusal to accept induction into the US Army, he began to bond with the white liberal community, which at the time was quite strong.\nThus it was that Ali was martyred and lived to talk about it. Ultimately, he returned to boxing. After wins against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena, he lost a historic 15-round decision to Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden. Then his conviction for refusing induction into the army was reversed by the US Supreme Court on a procedural technicality. After that, Ali reeled off 10 more victories but suffered a broken jaw in a 12-round loss to Ken Norton. That made him an 'underdog' in the eyes of America. People who had once bristled at his words and conduct began to feel sorry for him.\nAli earned a measure of revenge against Frazier and Norton with victories in hard-fought rematches. Then, on 30 October 1974, he dethroned George Foreman to recapture the heavyweight championship of the world. But, more importantly, America had by that time turned against the war in Vietnam. It was clear that Ali had made enormous sacrifices for his beliefs. And, whether or not people liked the racial component of Ali's views, there was respect for the fact that he had stood by them.\nToday Ali is a living embodiment of Martin Luther King Jr's message that all people are deserving of love. As Jerry Izenberg, one of America's foremost sports journalists, observed: 'Ironically, after all he went through, the affection for Ali is largely colour-blind. Late in his career, he developed a quality that only a few people have. He reached a point where, when people looked at him, they didn't see black or white. They saw Ali. For a long time, that mystified him. He expected black people to love him and crowd around him, but then he realised white people loved him too; and that made him very happy.'\nAli's love affair with America and the world reached its zenith in 1996. Fifteen years earlier, his public profile had dropped after his retirement from boxing. Thereafter, if Ali appeared at an event, those in attendance were excited but he wasn't on the national radar screen. Then Ali was chosen to light the Olympic flame in Atlanta. It was a glorious moment. Three billion people around the world watched on television and were united by love and caring for one man.\nBut some think that the 1996 Olympics carried negatives as well, because it was in Atlanta that corporate America 'rediscovered' Ali. And since then there has been a determined effort to rewrite history. In order to take advantage of Ali's economic potential, it has been deemed desirable to 'sanitise' him. And, as a result, all the 'rough edges' are being filed away from Ali's life story.\nNo event crystallised the commercialisation of Ali more clearly than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on 31 December 1999. That was an important day. By most reckonings, it marked the end of a millennium. The Ali who won hearts in the 1960s could have been expected to celebrate the occasion at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged. Many hoped to see Ali spend 31 December 1999 in a spiritual setting. Instead, the man who decades earlier was a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the globe and who refused to become a symbol for the US Army became a symbol for the New York Stock Exchange.\nAs the clock struck midnight, Ali was in Washington DC, dining on beluga caviar, lobster, and foie gras. That saddened a lot of people. Ali makes his own decisions, but those decisions are based on how information is presented to him. One can be forgiven for thinking that, had the options been explained differently to him, he would have chosen to serve as a different symbol that day. Thirty months later, that theme repeated itself when Ali was asked about al-Qaeda by David Frost during a televised interview. 'I dodge those questions,' Ali answered. 'I've opened up businesses across the country, selling products and I don't want to say nothing and, not knowing what I'm doing, not being qualified, say the wrong thing and hurt my business.' It's hard to imagine Muhammad Ali in the 1960s withholding comment on the war in Vietnam for fear of jeopardising his business interests.\n'One of the many paradoxes about Ali,' says historian Randy Roberts, 'is that he embraced an ideology that disparaged white people; yet he was never cruel to white people, only blacks. Except for occasional humorous barbs, Ali's white opponents were treated with dignity and respect. But things got ugly with Floyd Patterson, Ernie Terrell and Joe Frazier. And sure, Patterson and Terrell might have asked for it because of things they said. But Joe was innocent. And to deny the cruelty of what Ali did to Joe Frazier is to continue to be cruel to Joe.'\nIn truth, it takes a certain amount of cruelty to be a great fighter. Let's not forget that Ali beat people up and inflicted brain damage on them as his livelihood and way of life for years. And the time when he was at his peak as a fighter coincided with the time when he was most openly angry at the circumstances he found.\nJeffrey Sammons, a professor of history at New York University and author of Beyond The Ring: the Role of Boxing in American Society, says: 'What's happening to Ali now is typical of what has happened to so many black figures. It's a commodification and a trivialisation. Maybe the idea is that, by embracing Ali as a society, we can feel good about having become more tolerant.'\nAli's legacy today is in danger of being protected in the same manner as the estate of Elvis Presley is protecting Elvis's image. New generations are born; and to them Ali is more legend than reality, part of America's distant past.\nAli in the 1960s stood for the proposition that principles matter; that equality among people is just and proper; that the war in Vietnam was wrong. Every time he looked in the mirror and preened: 'I'm so pretty,' he was saying: 'Black is beautiful,' before it became fashionable to do so. Ali's role in spreading that pride has been testified to by others. 'This man helped give an entire people a belief in themselves and the will to make themselves better,' said Arthur Ashe.\nIn sum, the experience of being black changed for millions of men and women because of Ali. But one of the reasons Ali had the impact he did was because there was an ugly edge to what he said. And by focusing on Ali's ring exploits and his refusal to serve in Vietnam, while at the same time covering up the true nature of Nation of Islam doctrine, the current keepers of Ali's legacy are losing sight of why he so enthralled and enraged segments of American society.\nAli stood up for his convictions and sacrificed a great deal for them. So why hide the true nature of what his principles were?\nGreat men are considered great, not only because of what they achieve, but also because of the road they travel to reach their final destination. Sanitising Muhammad Ali and rounding off the rough edges of his journey are a disservice both to history and to Ali himself. Rather than cultivate historical amnesia, we should cherish the memory of Ali as a warrior and as a gleaming symbol of defiance against an unjust social order when he was young.\nHeroes\n"}, {"score": 2123.2483, "uuid": "236231f2-3cee-545f-b7cb-c25b8861991c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1016wb-94-24778", "target_hostname": "www.theclassical.org", "target_uri": "http://www.theclassical.org/articles/joe-frazier-is-what-he-was", "page_rank": 1.2214958e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> is What He <em>Was</em> | The Classical", "snippet": "<em>Frazier</em> and Ken Norton were my grandmother\u2019s favorite <em>boxers</em> (she thought Norton <em>was</em> handsome).

He transitioned from this life as \u201cOne of God\u2019s Men,\u201d on the eve of November 7, 2011 at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We thank you for your prayers for our Father and vast outpouring of love and support.\nRespectfully, we request time to grieve privately as a family. Our father\u2019s home going celebration will be announced as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe statement above, from Joe Frazier\u2019s family, announced his death on Monday.\nThese two short paragraphs also make a decent metaphor for Frazier\u2019s life and legacy. Note the list of his achievements placed before even his name. Note the straining at formality in phrases like \u201cwe the family\u201d and \u201ceve of November 7, 2011.\u201d\nIn the public consciousness, Frazier was always straining at the right words\u2014any words. Not because he was an especially quiet or ineloquent man, but because he wasn\u2019t Ali, for whom speech was performance. Watch the pre-fight interviews before their first bout at Madison Square Garden and you\u2019ll see the difference: Ali with his face right up in the camera lens, Frazier on his toes, throwing punches and generally acting like a reporter isn\u2019t standing next to him. For Frazier, the cameras were just part of the job and speaking was simply a way of communicating.\nMy paternal grandfather owned a bike shop in Hollywood in the 1970s. One time, Muhammad Ali walked in with his entourage. My grandfather greeted Ali enthusiastically. \u201cJoe Louis, what an honor to have you in my store!\u201d\nWhat really makes this funny is that my grandfather, a Holocaust survivor who came to the United States after the war and still spoke with an accent, actually loved boxing. He knew the difference between Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali. He just got excited and mixed them up. By the time Ali came into the bike shop, Louis was greeting vacationers at Caesar\u2019s Palace.\nWhen my dad was growing up in Hollywood in the \u201850s and \u201860s, my grandparents\u2014my grandmother is a survivor too, and back then she was arguably the bigger fight fan\u2014sometimes had friends over to their apartment to watch the Friday Night fights. They were a bunch of recent immigrants, mostly Jews from Poland, working blue-collar jobs. My grandfather was a machinist then, my grandmother a seamstress. Their friends were carpenters, plumbers, and the like.\nBy the time of my childhood, boxing was no longer a premier weekly event. Still, when there were big fights on pay-per-view, we would have everybody over: grandparents, uncles, family friends. The adults would talk about older, better fighters. I heard about Louis and Rocky Marciano. I heard about the great fights between Frazier and Ali.\nI\u2019m no great fight fan, but I\u2019ve always held a special esteem for Joe Frazier. Frazier and Ken Norton were my grandmother\u2019s favorite boxers (she thought Norton was handsome). My dad loved Frazier as well. When I was a kid and into reading sports biographies, he came home with a copy of Smokin\u2019 Joe: The Autobiography of a Heavyweight.\nI read it over and over again. First because I loved reading, second because I loved boxing, and third because Smokin\u2019 Joe challenged the way I thought about sports, heroes, and even American history. I haven\u2019t picked the book up for years, but I can still tell you exactly where it\u2019s sitting on the bookshelf in my childhood bedroom a thousand miles away. The book suffered a great deal of abuse at my hands and most of the pages have come apart from their bindings.\nFrazier\u2019s voice in Smokin\u2019 Joe is tired and bitter\u2014completely different from the voice in my other favorite sports autobiography, Mickey Mantle\u2019s My Favorite Summer 1956. Mantle wrote about sharing sandwiches with Elston Howard on the team bus outside segregated restaurants. Frazier wrote about boarding a bus to New York City at fifteen years old after a conflict with his racist farm boss in South Carolina. I might not have known poverty, or what it was like to be a sharecropper, but I had heard enough stories about my own family history to know whose depiction of the South I believed. The beloved white ballplayer taking pity on his black teammate didn\u2019t carry as much weight as the poor black teenage farmer watching his friend get beat up by the boss.\nWhen Frazier wrote about what it felt like to be called an Uncle Tom and a gorilla by Ali, he forced me to confront racism in a way far more complex than the Whig history taught in school. Frazier\u2019s writing about what it felt like to be called those things by a man he thought was his friend introduced me to the fact that athletes, even the greatest athletes, can be vulnerable.\nFrazier was writing the stuff that fight fans already know: how he petitioned Richard Nixon to let Ali back in the ring after he was banned from boxing; how he boycotted the tournament held to crown a new champion after Ali\u2019s WBA belt was stripped; how he felt robbed by the judges after the second fight with Ali. Damn right he was bitter.\nFrazier was a new kind of sports hero to me, a man who had dominated his field and was respected across the sporting universe but was plainly unhappy. Here was a man who talked openly about how unjust the world could be, about how painful words could be, about how despite everything he had achieved in boxing, he would never be fully content with his legacy.\nThe book also forced me to confront at a pretty early age that there were at least two sides to every person, every rivalry, every story. Until I read Smokin\u2019 Joe, I knew Ali as infallible. By the 1990s, the harsh edges of his radicalism had given way to a sort of benign, statesmanlike nobility\u2014in part because he could no longer speak. He was the man who lit Olympic flame in such a way that even his illness was awe-inspiring. He was the hero. He was the triumph of America and the human spirit. The Greatest. But could The Greatest also be a bully? Could he also betray his friend?\nWhen I asked my dad about Frazier yesterday, he talked about watching those great fights with his parents: not just the Ali fights, but the Jerry Quarry fights ( the first one is as explosive as any heavyweight bout I\u2019ve ever seen), the George Foreman fights and more.\n\u201cI liked Frazier because he always seemed like an underdog,\u201d my dad said. \u201cBecause he came out and whooped ass.\u201d\nHe also liked Frazier because he believed that Frazier was wronged by Ali; because you don\u2019t do that to somebody who stands behind you. This isn\u2019t to say that my dad didn\u2019t appreciate Ali\u2019s greatness in the ring, his stand against the Vietnam War, or his evolution as a person\u2014it\u2019s just that for him, for me, and for my grandparents, Frazier made more sense.\nMaybe Frazier made more sense to my grandparents because he seemed more occupied by the hardships of daily life than by the travails of fame. Maybe it\u2019s easier for an immigrant to identify with a person whose toughness is a defining feature. Maybe they liked Frazier because he spoke merely to get the point across as opposed to Ali who wielded English as a weapon.\nBut affinity, unlike boxing, is not a zero-sum game. There is no either/or dichotomy at play. In fact, employing that dichotomy does Frazier (and Ali, for that matter) the ultimate disservice. It reduces Frazier\u2019s entire life to the description that leads so many of his obituaries, \u201cAli\u2019s Greatest Rival.\u201d No person should be remembered solely in the context of someone else. Notice that nowhere in the statement from Frazier\u2019s family does the name Muhammad Ali appear.\nOne of the tragedies of Joe Frazier is that for more than thirty years he did everything he could to uncouple himself from Ali. But the harder he tried, the closer he and Ali became intertwined. Frazier was unable to see that the acrid words he wrote about Ali, the unkind interviews he gave, the cruel jokes at the expense of Ali\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s did nothing to distance him\u2014in fact, they had the opposite effect. They only further cemented his orbit of Ali.\nFrazier feared that people didn\u2019t see him for the man he believed he was. He died fighting to remedy that situation\u2014straining against Ali\u2019s saintly legacy, straining against his own inability to match Ali verb for verb, straining against the circumstances that landed him in poverty.\nThe world does not owe it to Joe Frazier to remember him as a righteous victim. The right thing would be to see him as he saw himself in his more honest moments\u2014\u201cI am what I am,\u201d he told a New York Timesreporter in 2006\u2014and to call him what his family does: the 1964 Olympic Boxing Heavyweight Gold Medalist, Former Heavyweight Boxing Champion and International Boxing Hall of Fame Member Smokin\u2019 Joe Frazier.\nEric Nusbaum is a staffer at The Classical.

Ali's flicker jab was one of the best in boxing history. Because Ali could throw his jab whilst moving, he did not have to plant his feet, thus making it harder for his opponents to shorten the distance.\nTyson could have neutralised Ali's jab with his defense. Tyson was very tough to hit clean during at his peak. His head movement was superb, resembling a pendulum swinging from side to side. Whilst advancing, Tyson liked to dip to the right or left, slip a punch, create an angle and come back with a hook from either hand.\nTyson was able to combine offense and defense simultaneously. Ali would be throwing his left jab and moving to his left. Punching at a downward angle, across his own body, the shorter Tyson dipping to his left or right, would have created the perfect angle for a counter hook from either side.\nLike Joe Frazier, Tyson was\u00a0 a very dangerous left hooker. Because his right hand was never brought back to a defensive position, Ali was vulnerable for a left hook throughout his career. If not for a bit of quick thinking from Angelo Dundee, Henry Cooper's left hook may have stopped Ali in their fight.\u00a0 Frazier's left hook on the other hand, landed often during their fights, almost decapitating Ali in '71.\nAs with Joe Frazier, Ali would be having to punch a constantly moving target. Take a look at the\u00a0Ali versus Frazier from '71. Joe made Ali miss more in that fight than in any other fight during Ali's career. Why? Because of Joe's size, footwork and tremendous head movement.\nDuring his prime, Tyson's head movement was arguably even better than Joe's.\nMuhammad Ali's toughest opponent from a stylistic standpoint along with Joe Frazier was undoubtedly ken Norton. By parrying Ali's jab, utilising his own jab and also employing side to side head movement, Norton was able to take away Ali's own jab and disrupt his rhythm.\nRing any bells?\nTake a look at prime Tyson, some of his most underrated assets were the use of his own jab and his ability to pick off his opponents' punches using his gloves.\nIn terms of overall speed, it's difficult to say who was faster. Ali and Tyson would be bringing more speed to the table than either fighter will have ever encountered during their careers.\nAli used his footspeed more for creating distance defending, while Tyson used his footspeed more for closing the distance and attacking. Ali's handspeed was blinding, but most of his punches were straight, STINGING punches, whereas Tyson would put together five or six POWER shots in a row. As opposed to Ali, and his straight less harmful shots, Tyson's combinations were made up of hooks and uppercuts.\nThe most problematic scenario for Ali against in a fight with Mike Tyson would be an inside fight against the ropes.\nSure, Ali's movement at his best was sublime. Fighters like Sonny Liston, Zora Folley and an aging Archie Moore could barely touch him. But against fighters who came close to matching his footspeed, Ali was often found having to defend with his back to the ropes.\nAt his apex in the mid sixties, Ali was an in and out fighter. Ali would be out of range, jabbing, then come in with a combination, then get back out. He was in and out.\nFighters that knew how to isolate Ali's footwork with their own footwork [Jones, Frazier, Norton, Young] could have success against him. Tyson would be capable of matching Ali's negative footspeed with his positive footspeed.\nA boxer moving backwards against a pressure fighter that can match his footwork and footspeed will always end up against the ropes, unless they have an inside game. Mike Tyson was the last fighter anyone would want in front of them when their backs were on the ropes.\nIn a fight between boxing's biggest icons, there are endless tangibles to take into account. We have merely scratched the surface.\nHowever, based on styles,\u00a0it is this writer's opinion that prime Mike Tyson defeats prime Muhammad Ali. Barely.\nAli would have success. Ali would not be knocked out. His chin wouldn't allow it.\u00a0 Ali would likely frustrate Tyson at times, using\u00a0 his height and reach.\nHowever, Tyson's relentless pressure at his best made an inside fight unavoidable. James Tillis managed to avoid it for a while, but by being negative, he lost nearly every round.\nIn a similar looking fight to like Julio Cesar Chavez versus Hector Camacho, Tyson would be able to feint his way inside and shorten the distance. Tyson's footwork, head movement and footspeed would trump Ali's height and length.\u00a0 It's hard to envision Ali being able to keep Tyson under control. Ali was deceptively strong in close, but Tyson was very explosive. Frazier liked to camp on the inside. Tyson used to invade it.\nBased on what was evident during the fights between Ali versus Doug Jones, Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, and Tyson versus Buster Douglas and Evander Holyfield, evidence points to Tyson being more problematic for Ali as opposed to the other way around. Ali would NOT be able to back Tyson up by fighting on the back foot, flicking the jab. Tyson would be able to impose himself on Ali.\nThere are those who will disagree and bring up Tyson's psychological problems, stamina or his heart. There are those that will point to Ali's height, reach and will to win.\nAgreed, Ali did always seem to find a way to win, and who knows, maybe his heart and desire would have found away to neutralise\u00a0 Tyson's threat. Ali is not considered the greatest heavyweight of all time for nothing.\nIn reality, Ali versus Tyson is a mythical matchup. Pure fantasy. There is no way of knowing for certain, who would be victorious.\nBut, everybody loves a debate.\nAnd just one more thing....Who would you pick?\n"}, {"score": 1776.3389, "uuid": "205ca8b4-27ca-59e7-8d06-5280e07e190a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0604wb-92-26112", "target_hostname": "www.lasvegassun.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/feb/14/reporter-recalls-following-muhammad-ali-boxer-foun/", "page_rank": 1.9320503e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Reporter recalls following <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> as <em>boxer</em> found &#x27;more to life&#x27; -", "snippet": "In this Oct. 1, 1975, file photo, heavyweight <em>boxer</em> <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> grimaces after <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>, left, landed <em>a</em> blow to Frazier&#x27;s head during their boxing bout in Manila, the Philippines. <em>Ali</em> won the fight after Frazier&#x27;s manager stopped the fight in the 14th round.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u2018Power of Love\u2019 Muhammad Ali celebration to be broadcast on ABC, ESPN2\nMoments before the start of the Dec. 29, 1980, Nevada Athletic Commission hearing to revoke Muhammad Ali\u2019s boxing license, the legendary fighter told me: \u201cAin\u2019t this something \u2014 one bad day on the job and they want to fire me.\u201d\nFor Ali, then 38, it indeed had been a bad day \u2014 make that night. On Oct. 2, 1980, then-world heavyweight champion Larry Holmes pummeled Ali and ended Ali\u2019s dream of winning a record fourth world title. Ali was so overmatched that regulators believed for his own health he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to fight again.\nI interviewed Ali about a half-dozen times between 1980 and 2000. Away from the TV cameras, Ali was a soft-spoken gentleman who could be downright philosophical \u2014 nothing like the loudmouth showman the public saw during his long and illustrious career.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Ali truly did think he was pretty \u2014 and he was, from his handsome face and his sleek physique (in his prime) to his surprisingly delicate hands.\nAnd what an ego. I really believe he got a thrill shifting into Ali mode, trash-talking rivals and performing outrageously every time a microphone was stuck in his face or a camera was rolling.\nBut Ali proved time and again he could back up the taunts and raves, including his rhyming predictions of the rounds when he would defeat his foes.\nBut on the day the Athletic Commission \u201cfired\u201d Ali, boxing\u2019s best salesman was subdued and accepting of his fate. After hours of damning testimony, Ali and his lawyers cut a deal.\nAli would give up his Nevada license, and the Nevada Athletic Commission would not oppose Ali getting a license to fight elsewhere. The deal paved the way for Ali to fight the late Trevor Berbick on Dec. 11, 1981, in the Bahamas. Ali lost that fight, too.\nBut Ali got to go out on his own terms. It meant vindication for Ali, which was important to the sport\u2019s only three-time world heavyweight champion.\nStriving for vindication was a thread that ran through Ali\u2019s life, whether he was battling racial prejudice or those who damned him for being a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War.\nOn Saturday, Ali will be honored not only for his athletic exploits but his commitment to principles when he returns to Las Vegas for the Keep Memory Alive Power of Love Gala , a celebration of his 70th birthday. The event also will serve as a fundraiser for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the Muhammad Ali Center , a cultural and education complex in Ali\u2019s hometown of Louisville, Ky.\nAP Photo/File\nIn this Oct. 1, 1975, file photo, heavyweight boxer Joe Frazier grimaces after Muhammad Ali, left, landed a blow to Frazier's head during their boxing bout in Manila, the Philippines. Ali won the fight after Frazier's manager stopped the fight in the 14th round. Frazier, the former heavyweight champion who handed Ali his first defeat yet had to live forever in his shadow, has died after a brief final fight with liver cancer. He was 67. The family issued a release confirming the boxer's death on Monday night, Nov. 7, 2011.\nIn 1980, I was the 23-year-old, wet-behind-the-ears sports editor of The Valley Times in North Las Vegas. Ali had retired \u2014 or so he claimed \u2014 from boxing nearly two years earlier after beating Leon Spinks in a rematch. It seemed unlikely that our paths would cross.\nEarlier that year, my limited body of work as a boxing writer had been deemed good enough for me to be invited to join the Boxing Writers Association of America \u2014 one of the youngest reporters ever to get that honor.\nIn those days, a Las Vegas boxing writer could get a lot of experience really fast. There were weekly club boxing cards at the Silver Slipper; monthly cards at the Sahara, Showboat and Hacienda; and at least two major world championship cards each month at such venues as Caesars Palace, the Dunes and the Hilton.\nBut despite satisfying my appetite to cover as many boxing matches as I could, I longed to interview the greatest name in that sport, or, for that matter, any sport \u2014 Muhammad Ali.\nThen rumors of an Ali comeback started circulating. I was among those columnists fueling the speculation, hoping to get an opportunity to cover an Ali fight just like my idols in boxing journalism \u2014 Nat Fleischer, Ed Schuyler, the Sun\u2019s Mike Marley and others \u2014 had.\nIn the late summer of 1980, as promoter Don King was putting together the deal to pit the undefeated champ Holmes against Ali, the Nevada Athletic Commission, led by its new chairman, Sig Rogich, demanded that Ali pass an extensive physical in Las Vegas.\nDespite statements from former Ali ring physician Ferdie Pacheco that Ali had kidney damage and from a London doctor that Ali had brain damage, Rogich, a longtime ad executive and political mover and shaker, said he believed Ali could pass a physical.\n\u201cI\u2019m of the opinion he is in good physical shape,\u201d Rogich told me in a 1980 interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t be an athlete like that all your life and not maintain some physical adeptness. I think he\u2019ll have it.\u201d\nBut in the next breath, Rogich noted that because Ali had not fought in 22 months he should be checked out thoroughly. In short, if Ali was seriously injured or killed in the Holmes fight, the commission was going to be covered.\nAli did not completely trust the Nevada Athletic Commission. He still had a bitter taste in his mouth over losing a close 15-round decision in the first Spinks fight in Las Vegas, on Feb. 15, 1978, at the hands of Nevada commission-appointed judges.\nSo it was arranged for Ali to go to Rochester, Minn., to the Mayo Clinic to undergo tests to prove he was healthy.\nOne of Ali\u2019s handlers, Gene Kilroy, a longtime Las Vegas casino executive, gave reports on Ali\u2019s progress. After results from the final tests came in, Gene said, \u201cWould you like to talk to Muhammad and get it straight from him?\u201d\n\u201cSure, that would be nice,\u201d I said calmly. Inside my head, however, I was saying, \u201cYahoo! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Twenty-two months earlier, I was cutting cold cuts for sandwiches in my parents\u2019 New Hampshire sub shop, and now I was about to report the historic words of a 20th century icon.\nKilroy handed the phone to Ali, who was relaxing in his suite at the Kahler Grand Hotel in Rochester, reading reports from his many tests, among them a brain scan and urine and blood samples.\n\u201cA staff of seven of the world\u2019s best doctors gave me the green light today, and that proved all the liars wrong,\u201d Ali told me, noting that he had been suspicious that the findings of Las Vegas doctors might be more political than medical.\nAli told me that he had trimmed down to 233 pounds and planned to lose even more weight so that on Oct. 2, the world would see not the old man Ali, but the Ali of old, dancing for 15 rounds and earning a forth reign as champion.\nIt turned out to be my first-ever banner story.\nOn July 31, the commission accepted the Mayo\u2019s findings and the fight was on.\nLas Vegas News Bureau\nControversial and whimsical, flamboyant and powerful, few legends encapsulate Old Vegas like headliners Siegfried and Roy. Here, during a photo-op in October 1980, the pair throw faux punches at boxing icon Muhammad Ali; all of whom have been represented by Bernie Yuman. The Greatest and magicians of a past era, joking around like kids. Now this is Old Vegas.\nMuhammad Ali stepped off a flight at McCarran International Airport at 10:23 a.m. on Sept. 9, 1980. He had dropped to 229 pounds and looked healthy.\nAli checked into Caesars Palace just before noon and by 1 p.m. was in his familiar white trunks with the black stripe, dancing in the ring before several hundred spectators who had paid $3 apiece to watch him work out.\nSurprisingly, only a handful of reporters were on hand for Ali\u2019s first Las Vegas training session. Out-of-town press was not scheduled to arrive until the weekend. I knew this would be my opportunity to talk to Ali alone.\nMidway through an uncharacteristically quiet workout, Ali warned doubting spectators not to waste their money betting on Holmes because Ali was going to shock the world again and win the fight.\n\u201cHolmes will run out of gas, and I\u2019ll kick his ass! Get your tickets now!\u201d he said.\nI truly believed that Ali truly believed he was going to win \u2014 though I doubted anyone could beat Holmes at that point. Then again, in 1964, few people thought Ali \u2014 then known as Cassius Clay \u2014 could beat the seemingly unstoppable Sonny Liston . But Ali knocked out Liston in seven rounds on Feb. 25 in Miami to win his first world title at age 22.\nAfter the workout, Ali invited me to his locker room, where we both watched Holmes work out. Ali gave me my second one-on-one interview with him.\n\u201cHe (Holmes) is too old to do this \u2014 I\u2019m older than he is, but he\u2019s the one who is too old, not me,\u201d Ali said as Holmes sparred, concentrating on delivering hard body punches.\nCourtesy\nMuhammad Ali ringside circa 1970s.\nReferring to his interactions with the spectators during his workout, Ali said, \u201cI didn\u2019t plan on talking to them at all \u2014 I needed my wind. But I had to get used to it. I\u2019m going to talk to Larry Holmes throughout the whole fight. But I won\u2019t psyche him out. I\u2019ll knock him out \u2014 maybe in eight rounds, maybe in nine, but no more than that.\u201d\nAsked if the Holmes fight would be his last, Ali said, \u201cYou never know what I\u2019m going to do next. I might retire, then come back in a year or two and fight again.\u201d\nAli tipped the scales at 217 1/2 pounds at the official weigh-in. Several of us in the press corps shook our heads over what would turn out to be a serious blunder by Ali.\nIn his efforts to look like the Ali of his prime, he had lost too much weight and, in effect, was dried out. (The night of the fight, Ali couldn\u2019t break a sweat, and thus he could not cool down as the fight wore on.)\nAli\u2019s vanity \u2014 his tremendous ego \u2014 had gotten the better of him. He was more determined to look trim to impress his legion of fans rather than to be in better fighting shape at 224 pounds with a little fat to burn during the bout.\nMeanwhile, Holmes, who played second fiddle to the entertainer Ali for months leading up to the bout, let out his pent-up aggression. Ali was so badly beaten he could not come out for the 11th round. (I had predicted in my column that morning a Holmes victory in the 10th round by technical knockout.)\nDays after the fight, Ali said he was \u201cphysically unfit\u201d to fight Holmes because he had accidentally taken an overdose of thyroid medicine that made him too weak.\nAn after-fight urine test showed opiates in Ali\u2019s system. His physician, Dr. Charles Bennett, said he gave Ali a painkiller and sedative after the fight and before the commission doctors could get a urine sample from Ali.\nThe positive drug test and the poor performance led to the commission\u2019s hearing, which was intended to put Ali out to pasture.\nOn Sept. 21, 1981, Ali\u2019s longtime confidant and handler Bernie Yuman invited me to lunch with him and Ali at Caesars Caf\u00e9 Roma. It was less than two months before Ali\u2019s final boxing match.\nAfter the meal, Ali turned philosophical. He stuck a finger into a glass of orange juice and let a single drop fall onto his plate.\n\u201cOne of the teachings of Islam is that you go into the ocean and dip your finger in \u2014 the drop on your finger is your life and the whole ocean is what comes after that,\u201d Ali said. \u201cI am going to die someday. But right now I live in a million-dollar house that seven white men owned before me. I drive expensive cars. But I\u2019ve got to look into my future. There has got to be more to life than this.\u201d\nNineteen years would pass before I would interview Ali again, this time at his suite at the Mirage.\nHis once marvelous athletic body had been devastated by Parkinson\u2019s disease . His face was puffy, and he talked in a hushed, mumbled voice that at times was almost impossible to understand. But he was fully cognizant of what was going on around him. Before the interview, in front of Ali, Yuman warned me that Ali suffered from narcolepsy, which caused him to nod off during conversations, and that I might have to get real close to Ali to hear his voice as he faded into slumber.\nWhile answering my first question, Ali started to slowly pass out and I leaned in to hear his answer. All of a sudden, Ali \u201cawoke\u201d and made a roaring sound that startled me and knocked me out of my chair.\nI got up from the floor and looked around to see Yuman; Ali\u2019s photographer, Howard Bingham; and Ali laughing heartily over the prank they had just pulled.\nCourtesy of Ed Koch\nMuhammad Ali talks to reporters after surrendering his Nevada boxing license on Dec. 29, 1980, during a Nevada Athletic Commission hearing in Las Vegas. Ed Koch, former Las Vegas Sun reporter, is standing beside Ali, taking notes.\nAli had pulled the stunt on dozens of reporters, including the late Ed Bradley of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\nAli told me a second biographical film about his life was in the works, starring Will Smith as Ali, which I led with in my front-page story the following day.\nAfter the interview, I showed Ali a scrapbook I had kept of the articles and columns I had written about him over the years. He jokingly asked if he could have it. I told him I could never replace the copies of the stories I had written so long ago.\nAs he handed the scrapbook back to me, Ali asked for my notepad and pen. On a blank page, he wrote, \u201cTo Ed, from Muhammad Ali 2000.\u201d\n\u201cHere, put this in your book,\u201d he said.\nThat was the last time I saw Ali, although I did interview him once more by phone in December of 2001, when the film \u201cAli\u201d was released. He was about to turn 60.\nAli told me the message of the film was, \u201cWork hard and believe and you will be vindicated.\u201d\nI recalled what Ali had told me during our lunch at Caesars Palace two decades earlier. I was happy for him because, at long last, Ali had his vindication. He was at peace because he also had found something \u201cmore to life.\u201d\nEd Koch is a former longtime Sun\u00a0reporter.\n"}, {"score": 1700.7759, "uuid": "43296900-d0cf-57dd-bc56-891ef7a6b13f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0503wb-66-04136", "target_hostname": "www.danielpipes.org", "target_uri": "http://www.danielpipes.org/3153/muhammad-ali-v-george-w-bush", "page_rank": 1.1988048e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> v.

The president praised Ali for his sports accomplishments and called him \"The Greatest of All Time.\"\nFine, but he then proceeded to laud Ali's character: \"The real mystery, I guess, is how he stayed so pretty. It probably had to do with his beautiful soul. He was a fierce fighter and he's a man of peace. \u2026 Across the world, billions of people know Muhammad Ali as a brave, compassionate, and charming man, and the American people are proud to call Muhammad Ali one of our own.\"\nIn this giddy, fawning statement, Mr. Bush did not, the Washington Post astringently noted , \"mention Ali's very public opposition to the Vietnam War, which led the prizefighter to lose his boxing license for three years when he refused to serve in the Army.\" Worse, his refusal to fight was not because he was \"a man of peace\" but rather because his allegiance was to the stridently anti-American, anti-white organization known as the Nation of Islam, headed by the malign Elijah Muhammad .\nForty years ago, Ali explained his draft evasion: \"War is against the teachings of the Holy Koran. I'm not trying to dodge the draft. We are supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger [i.e., Elijah Muhammad]. We don't take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers.\" A draft evader, incidentally, is particularly ill-suited to receive the Medal of Freedom, which was created in 1945 to recognize \"notable service\" in World War II.\nThe president also did not touch on Ali's religious side, but Mark Kram did in his 2001 book, Ghosts of Manila: The Fateful Blood Feud between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier : \"Ali broke every tenet of real Muslim law, from whoring to being truant at Temple service; he was a religious fake who abdicated his personal worth to the Black Muslims for their expediency and draft evasion, [and was] therefore, counterfeit down to his socks.\"\nAs he aged, Ali did become more devout, but in unfortunate directions. He declared himself against \"the entire power structure\" in America, which he declared was run by Zionists who \"are really against the Islam religion.\" He became so radical a Muslim that the notorious Council on American-Islamic Relations , North America's most powerful Islamist group, also honored him with an award in June 2004. As its press release stated: \"Ilyasah Shabazz, the daughter of Malcolm X, presented the first Malcolm X award to Muhammad Ali.\"\n(Ali was spectacularly ill-suited for this award too. Malcolm X had served as his role model until 1964, but when Elijah Muhammad ejected Malcolm X from the Nation of Islam, Ali ignored Malcolm X's entreaties and turned viciously against him. He threw Malcolm X away, in the words of journalist Sunni Khalid, \"like a pork chop.\")\nMr. Bush's praise for Ali's compassion, charm, and beautiful soul are horribly misplaced (as were large donations from General Electric and Ford to the hagiographic \"Ali Center\" that opened days later in Louisville, Ky.). Ali's unvarnished legacy is an exploitative personality, sordid career, vicious politics, and extremist religion.\nMr. Bush himself got an unexpected glimpse of the real Ali during their brief White House encounter. I'll let the Washington Post describe the incident:\nBush, who appeared almost playful, fastened the heavy medal around Muhammad Ali's neck and whispered something in the heavyweight champion's ear. Then, as if to say \"bring it on,\" the president put up his dukes in a mock challenge.\nAli, 63, who has Parkinson's disease and moves slowly, looked the president in the eye\u2014and, finger to head, did the \"crazy\" twirl for a couple of seconds. The room of about 200, including Cabinet secretaries, tittered with laughter. Ali, who was then escorted back to his chair, made the twirl again while sitting down.\nAnd the president looked visibly taken aback, laughing nervously. Was Ali making a political statement?\nAwarding of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Muhammad Ali gratuitously celebrated a man profoundly opposed to Mr. Bush's own, his party's, and the country's principles. It represents, I submit, the nadir of his presidency.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDec. 1, 2005 update: I discuss this subject further at \" Muhammad Ali's \u2018Beautiful Soul' .\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRelated Topics: African-American Muslims , Muslims in the United States , US politics receive the latest by email: subscribe to daniel pipes' free mailing list This text may be reposted or forwarded so long as it is presented as an integral whole with complete information provided about its author, date, place of publication, and original URL.\n"}, {"score": 1538.5231, "uuid": "3f3d705f-25b3-5b42-856f-d6c23b443dc4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0912wb-80-07688", "target_hostname": "www.webfeetguides.com", "target_uri": "http://www.webfeetguides.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/ali_m.htm", "page_rank": 1.1732012e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Gale - Free Resources - Black History - Biographies - <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>", "snippet": "<em>A</em> white Louisville patrolman named <em>Joe</em> Martin, <em>who</em> had an early television show called &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Champions,&quot; started <em>Ali</em> working out in Louisville&#x27;s Columbia Gym, but it <em>was</em> <em>a</em> black trainer named Fred Stoner <em>who</em> taught <em>Ali</em> the science of boxing.", "explanation": null, "document": "Also known as: Cassius Marcellus Clay, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., Cassius Clay\n(1942- )\nProfessional boxer\nPersonal Information\nBorn Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.; name changed to Muhammad Ali, 1963; born January 17, 1942, in Louisville, KY; son of Cassius (a piano player) and Odessa Clay (both deceased); first wife, Belinda; second wife, Aaisha; third wife, Veronica Porche; fourth (and current) wife, Yolanda Williams, married in 1986; children: nine (one with Yolanda).\nReligion: Muslim\nAddresses: Office: c/o The Muhammad Ali Center, One Riverfront Plaza, Suite 1702, Louisville, KY 40202.\nCareer\nFormer world heavyweight boxing champion.

Ali won an Olympic gold medal and later tossed it into a river because he was disgusted by racism in America. As a young man he was recruited by Malcolm X to join the Nation of Islam. He refused to serve in Vietnam \u2014 a professional fighter willing to serve time in jail for his pacifist ideals. He has contributed to countless, diverse charities, and causes. And his later years have found him interested in world politics as he has battled to keep Parkinson's disease at bay.\nMuhammad Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., on January 17, 1942, and was raised in a clapboard house at 3302 Grand Avenue in middle-class Louisville, Kentucky. He began boxing at the age of 12. A white Louisville patrolman named Joe Martin, who had an early television show called \"Tomorrow's Champions,\" started Ali working out in Louisville's Columbia Gym, but it was a black trainer named Fred Stoner who taught Ali the science of boxing. Stoner taught him to move with the grace of a dancer, and impressed upon him the subtle skills necessary to move beyond good and into the realm of great.\nAfter winning an Olympic gold medal at 18, Ali signed the most lucrative contract \u2014 a 50-50 split \u2014 negotiated by a beginning professional in the history of boxing, with a 12-member group of millionaires called the Louisville Sponsoring Group. Later, he worked his way into contention for the coveted heavyweight title shot by boasting and creating media interest at a time when, by his own admission, he was only ranked number nine on the list of contenders. Even from the beginning, it was clear that Ali was his own man--quick, strong-willed, original, and witty. In 1961 he told Sports Illustrated's Gilbert Rogin, \"Boxing is dying because everybody's so quiet.... What boxing needs is more ... Clays.\" Ali knew that his rhymes and press-grabbing claims would infuse more interest and more money into the sport of boxing, and he was his own best public relations man. In February of 1964 he told readers of Sports Illustrated, \"If I were like a lot of ... heavyweight boxers ... you wouldn't be reading this story right now. If you wonder what the difference between them and me is, I'll break the news: you never heard of them. I'm not saying they're not good boxers. Most of them ... can fight almost as good as I can. I'm just saying you never heard of them. And the reason for that is because they cannot throw the jive. Cassius Clay is a boxer who can throw the jive better than anybody.\"\nThe following month Ali \u2014 then still Cassius Clay \u2014 fought Sonny Liston in a match of classic contenders for the heavyweight championship of the world. The Miami fight almost single-handedly restored intelligence and balance to boxing. Cassius Clay had been chanting the war cry \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\" for weeks; he beat Liston in a display of beautiful, controlled boxing. Liston could hit with deadly power, but Ali utilized his skills and courage with forethought and aplomb. He won the fight to become heavyweight champion of the world. At the tender age of 22, Ali knew that he was something above and beyond a great boxer: He had marketing sense, political finesse, and a feeling of noble purpose.\nThroughout his career and life, Ali has always professed to want to help other black Americans--and he has, time and time again. When he returned from Italy, having just won an Olympic gold medal, he was so proud of his trophy that he wore it day and night and showed it to everyone, whether they wanted to see it or not. In the Philadelphia Inquirer Ali's first wife remembered him saying \"I was young, black Cassius Marcellus Clay, who had won a gold medal for his country. I went to downtown Louisville to a five-and-dime store that had a soda fountain. I sat down at the counter to order a burger and soda pop. The waitress looked at me.... 'Sorry, we don't serve coloreds,' she said. I was furious. I went all the way to Italy to represent my country, won a gold medal, and now I come back to America and can't even get served at a five-and-dime store. I went to a bridge, tore the medal off my neck and threw it into the river. That gold medal didn't mean a thing to me if my black brothers and sisters were treated wrong in a country I was supposed to represent.\"\nWhile in Miami, at the age of 21, Ali was inspired by human rights activist Malcolm X to become a member of the Muslim faith. The following year Malcolm X said of Ali, as was quoted by Houston Horn in Sports Illustrated, \"[He] will mean more to his people than any athlete before him. He is more than [first black major-league baseball player] Jackie Robinson was, because Robinson is the white man's hero. But Cassius is the black man's hero. Do you know why? Because the white press wanted him to lose [his heavyweight championship bout] ... because he is a Muslim. You notice nobody cares about the religion of other athletes. But their prejudice against Clay blinded them to his ability.\" Twelve years later, on \"Face the Nation,\" Ali said \"We don't have Black Muslims, that's a press word. We have white brothers, we have brown, red, and yellow, all colors can be Muslims.... I'm looking for peace one day with all people.\" Cassius Clay, Jr., was given the name Muhammad Ali by Muslim patriarch Elijah Muhammad ; it was not just a name, but a title meaning \"beloved of Allah,\" deity of the Muslim faith.\nAli retained his world heavyweight champion title in June of 1965 by again knocking out Sonny Liston, this time with a stunning right-hand punch to the side of the head. The knock-out blow was thrown with the astounding speed that separated Ali from other heavyweights; it had sufficient force to lift Liston's left foot \u2014 upon which most of his weight was resting \u2014 clear off the canvas.\nAs a Muslim and thus, a conscientious objector, Muhammad Ali refused to even consider going to Vietnam in 1966; a tremendous public outcry erupted against him. According to Jack Olsen in Sports Illustrated, \"The governor of Illinois found Clay 'disgusting,' and the governor of Maine said Clay 'should be held in utter contempt by every patriotic American.' An American Legion post in Miami asked people to 'join in condemnation of this unpatriotic, loudmouthed, bombastic individual.' The Chicago Tribune waged a choleric campaign against holding the next Clay fight in Chicago.... The noise became a din, the drumbeats of a holy war. TV and radio commentators, little old ladies ... bookmakers, and parish priests, armchair strategists at the Pentagon and politicians all over the place joined in a crescendo of get-Cassius clamor.\"\nAlthough Ali had not been charged or arrested for violating the Selective Service Act \u2014 much less convicted \u2014 the New York State Athletic Commission and World Boxing Association suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his heavyweight title in May of 1967, minutes after he officially announced that he would not submit to induction. Ali said to Sports Illustrated contributor Edwin Shrake, \"I'm giving up my title, my wealth, maybe my future. Many great men have been tested for their religious beliefs. If I pass this test, I'll come out stronger than ever.\" Eventually Ali was sentenced to five years in prison and released on appeal; his conviction was overturned three years later.\nIn November of 1970 Ali fought Jerry Quarry in Atlanta. His victory was a symbol of release and freedom to the 5,000 people watching the fight; Ali had personally survived his vilification by much of the American public, but more, he had reclaimed his professional reputation and prominence. Four months later Ali had the world as his audience when he went up against Joe Frazier in New York. There he fell from invincibility; suddenly Frazier reigned as heavyweight champ. \"Man, I hit him with punches that'd bring down the walls of a city,\" Frazier said to Mark Kram in Sports Illustrated. Ali responded, \"It was like death. Closest thing to dyin' that I know of.\" Ali regained his title as world heavyweight champion in 1974 after defeating George Foreman in a bout staged in Zaire. Ali fought Frazier twice more, once in 1974 and again in 1975. Ali won both matches and secured his title. Taking time to reflect on the tumult of his fifteen-year boxing career, Ali cowrote his autobiography \u2014 characteristically titled The Greatest: My Own Story \u2014 in 1975.\nIn 1982 Dr. Dennis Cope, director of the Medical Ambulatory Care Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, began treating Ali for Parkinson's syndrome; Cope and colleague Dr. Stanley Fahn later theorized in The Chicago Tribune that Ali was suffering, more precisely, from Pugilistic Parkinsonism, brought on by repetitive trauma to the head \u2014 and that only an autopsy could confirm their suspicions. After losing a 1980 title bout to Larry Holmes, Ali had exhibited sluggishness and was misdiagnosed as having a thyroid condition; he was given a thyroid hormone. When Dr. Cope made the connection between Ali's decreasing motor skills and Parkinson's disease, he prescribed Sinemet (L-dopa). Ali was shortly restored to his previous level of energy and awareness; as long as he took his medication regularly, he was able to keep the disease in check. In 1988 Ali told The New York Times Magazine contributor Peter Tauber: \"I've got Parkinson's syndrome. I'm in no pain.... If I was in perfect health \u2014 if I had won my last two fights \u2014 if I had no problem, people would be afraid of me. Now they feel sorry for me. They thought I was Superman. Now they can say 'He's human, like us. He has problems.'\"\nIn 1984 another of Ali's medical confidantes, Dr. Martin D. Ecker, ventured in the Boston Globe that Ali should have quit boxing long before he finally did \u2014 for the second and final time \u2014 in 1981 after losing to Trevor Berbick. His bout with Berbick was his 61st and final fight. By then Ali had been showing signs of neurological damage for over a year. Ali's former doctor, Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, told the fighter to quit in 1977 when he first saw signs of Ali's reflexes slowing down. Seven years later, Pacheco, a consultant and boxing commentator for NBC-TV, explained to Betsy Lehman in the Boston Globe why he feels Ali didn't quit boxing in 1977: \"The most virulent infection in the human race is the standing ovation. Once you've seen that, you can't get off the stage. Once you feel that recognition ... the roar of 50,000 people, you just don't want to give it up.\" When Ali initially surrendered his title in 1979, he was paid $250,000 to quit, but he eventually returned to his sport, perhaps as Pacheco suggested, because the recognition had become habit-forming.\nToward the end of Ali's boxing career, and afterward, his ambitions took a decided turn toward statesmanship. In 1980 he cast his lot with the Democratic Party, supporting then-Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. In August of that year, while in intense training for the Holmes fight, he found time to work the floor of the Democratic National Convention in New York City. He also functioned as something of a diplomat in February of 1985 when he attempted to secure the release of four kidnapped Americans in Lebanon; unfortunately, he and his three advisers were not successful.\nDuring his career in the ring Ali made more than $50 million, two thirds of which went to managerial expenses and taxes. He said to The New York Times Magazine contributor Tauber in 1988, \"I never talk about boxing. It just served its purpose. I was only about 11 or 12 years old when I said 'I'm gonna get famous so I can help my people.'\" Indicating his continuing desire to help people, in 1990 Ali visited Our Children's Foundation, Inc., on Manhattan's 125th Street. According to Bill Gallo in the New York Daily News, he addressed the children there, saying, \"The sun has a purpose. The moon has a purpose. The snow has a purpose. Cows have a purpose. You were born for a purpose. You have to find your purpose. Go to school. Learn to read and write.... What is your purpose, your occupation? Find your purpose.... What do you have to find?\" \"Purpose!,\" they shouted gleefully in unison. True to form, one of Ali's favored inscriptions when signing autographs is \"Love is the net where hearts are caught like fish.\"\nAlthough Parkinson's syndrome has slowed Ali down, he still remain active \u2014 raising money for the Muhammad Ali Foundation and frequently appearing at sports tributes and fund-raisers. Muhammad's wife Lonnie believes \"Muhammad knows he has this illness for a reason. It's not by chance. Parkinson's disease has made him a more spiritual person. Muhammad believes God gave it to him to bring him to another level, to create another destiny,\" she stated in People.\nDuring the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, 3.5 billion people watched on television as three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali slowly ascended the stadium steps with trembling hands to ignite the Olympic Flame. Everyone was deeply touched, however, no one was more moved than Ali himself. \"He kept turning it [the torch] in his hands and looking at it. He knows now that people won't slight his message because of his impairment.\" said his wife Lonnie in People.\nMuhammad has been blessed to meet with important dignitaries, including with President Clinton, Queen Elizabeth II, Nelson Mandela, and Pope John Paul II. His travels are his main source of income \u2014 charging as much as $200,000 for appearances. He usually travels 275 days out of the year. Although he enjoys his missionary work and public appearances, Ali's greatest pleasure is when he is at home in Berrien Springs, Michigan with his family \u2014 wife Yolanda and his adopted son Asaad Amin.\nIn Berrien Springs, he lives a modest life in a house at the end of the road on an old farm. He has a pool and a pond and a security gate with an intercom. According to Kim Forburger, Ali's assistant, \"He's the only man I know where the kids come to the gate and say 'Can Muhammad come out and play?'\nWhen asked if he has any regrets, Ali responds, \"My children, I never got to raise them because I was always boxing and because of divorce,\" he said in People. When asked whether he is sorry he ever got into the ring, he responded, \"If I wasn't a boxer, I wouldn't be famous. If I wasn't famous, I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now.\"\nEven into the 2000s, Ali's legacy lives on in a number of ways. In 2001, Ali, starring Will Smith, was released and was nominated for two Oscars. In November, 2005, after years of preparation, the Muhammad Ali Center was opened in Louisville, Kentucky. The MAC is both a museum celebrating Ali's life and career and\u2014at Ali's request\u2014a forum for sharing his ideals and beliefs, and for promoting respect, hope, and understanding. Ali has been the subject of numerous books and film tributes over the years, including the 1997 documentary When We Were Kings, but none were more spectacular than the 2003 publication GOAT: A Tribute to Muhammad Ali, a giant (20-inches square, weighing 75 pounds, and costing $3,000) tribute to Ali's entire career; the title GOAT stands for \"Greatest of All Time.\" The work that is closest to Ali's own heart is his memoir The Soul of a Butterfly: Reflection's on Life's Journey, which he wrote with the help of his daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali.\nUpdates\nNovember 3, 2005: Ali was announced as a 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient by President George W.

Because the white press wanted him to lose [his heavyweight championship bout] ... because he is a Muslim. You notice nobody cares about the religion of other athletes. But their prejudice against Clay blinded them to his ability.\" Twelve years later, on \"Face the Nation,\" Ali said \"We don't have Black Muslims, that's a press word. We have white brothers, we have brown, red, and yellow, all colors can be Muslims.... I'm looking for peace one day with all people.\" Cassius Clay, Jr., was given the name Muhammad Ali by Muslim patriarch Elijah Muhammad ; it was not just a name, but a title meaning \"beloved of Allah,\" deity of the Muslim faith.\nAli retained his world heavyweight champion title in June of 1965 by again knocking out Sonny Liston, this time with a stunning right-hand punch to the side of the head. The knock-out blow was thrown with the astounding speed that separated Ali from other heavyweights; it had sufficient force to lift Liston's left foot \u2014 upon which most of his weight was resting \u2014 clear off the canvas.\nAs a Muslim and thus, a conscientious objector, Muhammad Ali refused to even consider going to Vietnam in 1966; a tremendous public outcry erupted against him. According to Jack Olsen in Sports Illustrated, \"The governor of Illinois found Clay 'disgusting,' and the governor of Maine said Clay 'should be held in utter contempt by every patriotic American.' An American Legion post in Miami asked people to 'join in condemnation of this unpatriotic, loudmouthed, bombastic individual.' The Chicago Tribune waged a choleric campaign against holding the next Clay fight in Chicago.... The noise became a din, the drumbeats of a holy war. TV and radio commentators, little old ladies ... bookmakers, and parish priests, armchair strategists at the Pentagon and politicians all over the place joined in a crescendo of get-Cassius clamor.\"\nAlthough Ali had not been charged or arrested for violating the Selective Service Act \u2014 much less convicted \u2014 the New York State Athletic Commission and World Boxing Association suspended his boxing license and stripped him of his heavyweight title in May of 1967, minutes after he officially announced that he would not submit to induction. Ali said to Sports Illustrated contributor Edwin Shrake, \"I'm giving up my title, my wealth, maybe my future. Many great men have been tested for their religious beliefs. If I pass this test, I'll come out stronger than ever.\" Eventually Ali was sentenced to five years in prison and released on appeal; his conviction was overturned three years later.\nIn November of 1970 Ali fought Jerry Quarry in Atlanta. His victory was a symbol of release and freedom to the 5,000 people watching the fight; Ali had personally survived his vilification by much of the American public, but more, he had reclaimed his professional reputation and prominence. Four months later Ali had the world as his audience when he went up against Joe Frazier in New York. There he fell from invincibility; suddenly Frazier reigned as heavyweight champ. \"Man, I hit him with punches that'd bring down the walls of a city,\" Frazier said to Mark Kram in Sports Illustrated. Ali responded, \"It was like death. Closest thing to dyin' that I know of.\" Ali regained his title as world heavyweight champion in 1974 after defeating George Foreman in a bout staged in Zaire. Ali fought Frazier twice more, once in 1974 and again in 1975. Ali won both matches and secured his title. Taking time to reflect on the tumult of his fifteen-year boxing career, Ali cowrote his autobiography \u2014 characteristically titled The Greatest: My Own Story \u2014 in 1975.\nIn 1982 Dr. Dennis Cope, director of the Medical Ambulatory Care Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, began treating Ali for Parkinson's syndrome; Cope and colleague Dr. Stanley Fahn later theorized in The Chicago Tribune that Ali was suffering, more precisely, from Pugilistic Parkinsonism, brought on by repetitive trauma to the head \u2014 and that only an autopsy could confirm their suspicions. After losing a 1980 title bout to Larry Holmes, Ali had exhibited sluggishness and was misdiagnosed as having a thyroid condition; he was given a thyroid hormone. When Dr. Cope made the connection between Ali's decreasing motor skills and Parkinson's disease, he prescribed Sinemet (L-dopa). Ali was shortly restored to his previous level of energy and awareness; as long as he took his medication regularly, he was able to keep the disease in check. In 1988 Ali told The New York Times Magazine contributor Peter Tauber: \"I've got Parkinson's syndrome. I'm in no pain.... If I was in perfect health \u2014 if I had won my last two fights \u2014 if I had no problem, people would be afraid of me. Now they feel sorry for me. They thought I was Superman. Now they can say 'He's human, like us. He has problems.'\"\nIn 1984 another of Ali's medical confidantes, Dr. Martin D. Ecker, ventured in the Boston Globe that Ali should have quit boxing long before he finally did \u2014 for the second and final time \u2014 in 1981 after losing to Trevor Berbick. His bout with Berbick was his 61st and final fight. By then Ali had been showing signs of neurological damage for over a year. Ali's former doctor, Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, told the fighter to quit in 1977 when he first saw signs of Ali's reflexes slowing down. Seven years later, Pacheco, a consultant and boxing commentator for NBC-TV, explained to Betsy Lehman in the Boston Globe why he feels Ali didn't quit boxing in 1977: \"The most virulent infection in the human race is the standing ovation. Once you've seen that, you can't get off the stage. Once you feel that recognition ... the roar of 50,000 people, you just don't want to give it up.\" When Ali initially surrendered his title in 1979, he was paid $250,000 to quit, but he eventually returned to his sport, perhaps as Pacheco suggested, because the recognition had become habit-forming.\nToward the end of Ali's boxing career, and afterward, his ambitions took a decided turn toward statesmanship. In 1980 he cast his lot with the Democratic Party, supporting then-Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. In August of that year, while in intense training for the Holmes fight, he found time to work the floor of the Democratic National Convention in New York City. He also functioned as something of a diplomat in February of 1985 when he attempted to secure the release of four kidnapped Americans in Lebanon; unfortunately, he and his three advisers were not successful.\nDuring his career in the ring Ali made more than $50 million, two thirds of which went to managerial expenses and taxes. He said to The New York Times Magazine contributor Tauber in 1988, \"I never talk about boxing. It just served its purpose. I was only about 11 or 12 years old when I said 'I'm gonna get famous so I can help my people.'\" Indicating his continuing desire to help people, in 1990 Ali visited Our Children's Foundation, Inc., on Manhattan's 125th Street. According to Bill Gallo in the New York Daily News, he addressed the children there, saying, \"The sun has a purpose. The moon has a purpose. The snow has a purpose. Cows have a purpose. You were born for a purpose. You have to find your purpose. Go to school. Learn to read and write.... What is your purpose, your occupation? Find your purpose.... What do you have to find?\" \"Purpose!,\" they shouted gleefully in unison. True to form, one of Ali's favored inscriptions when signing autographs is \"Love is the net where hearts are caught like fish.\"\nAlthough Parkinson's syndrome has slowed Ali down, he still remain active \u2014 raising money for the Muhammad Ali Foundation and frequently appearing at sports tributes and fund-raisers. Muhammad's wife Lonnie believes \"Muhammad knows he has this illness for a reason. It's not by chance. Parkinson's disease has made him a more spiritual person. Muhammad believes God gave it to him to bring him to another level, to create another destiny,\" she stated in People.\nDuring the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, 3.5 billion people watched on television as three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali slowly ascended the stadium steps with trembling hands to ignite the Olympic Flame. Everyone was deeply touched, however, no one was more moved than Ali himself. \"He kept turning it [the torch] in his hands and looking at it. He knows now that people won't slight his message because of his impairment.\" said his wife Lonnie in People.\nMuhammad has been blessed to meet with important dignitaries, including with President Clinton, Queen Elizabeth II, Nelson Mandela, and Pope John Paul II. His travels are his main source of income \u2014 charging as much as $200,000 for appearances. He usually travels 275 days out of the year. Although he enjoys his missionary work and public appearances, Ali's greatest pleasure is when he is at home in Berrien Springs, Michigan with his family \u2014 wife Yolanda and his adopted son Asaad Amin.\nIn Berrien Springs, he lives a modest life in a house at the end of the road on an old farm. He has a pool and a pond and a security gate with an intercom. According to Kim Forburger, Ali's assistant, \"He's the only man I know where the kids come to the gate and say 'Can Muhammad come out and play?'\nWhen asked if he has any regrets, Ali responds, \"My children, I never got to raise them because I was always boxing and because of divorce,\" he said in People. When asked whether he is sorry he ever got into the ring, he responded, \"If I wasn't a boxer, I wouldn't be famous. If I wasn't famous, I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing now.\"\nEven into the 2000s, Ali's legacy lives on in a number of ways. In 2001, Ali, starring Will Smith, was released and was nominated for two Oscars. In November, 2005, after years of preparation, the Muhammad Ali Center was opened in Louisville, Kentucky. The MAC is both a museum celebrating Ali's life and career and\u2014at Ali's request\u2014a forum for sharing his ideals and beliefs, and for promoting respect, hope, and understanding. Ali has been the subject of numerous books and film tributes over the years, including the 1997 documentary When We Were Kings, but none were more spectacular than the 2003 publication GOAT: A Tribute to Muhammad Ali, a giant (20-inches square, weighing 75 pounds, and costing $3,000) tribute to Ali's entire career; the title GOAT stands for \"Greatest of All Time.\" The work that is closest to Ali's own heart is his memoir The Soul of a Butterfly: Reflection's on Life's Journey, which he wrote with the help of his daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali.\nUpdates\nNovember 3, 2005: Ali was announced as a 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient by President George W.

Ali won an Olympic gold medal and later tossed it into a river because he was disgusted by racism in America. As a young man he was recruited by Malcolm X to join the Nation of Islam. He refused to serve in Vietnam \u2014 a professional fighter willing to serve time in jail for his pacifist ideals. He has contributed to countless, diverse charities, and causes. And his later years have found him interested in world politics as he has battled to keep Parkinson's disease at bay.\nMuhammad Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., on January 17, 1942, and was raised in a clapboard house at 3302 Grand Avenue in middle-class Louisville, Kentucky. He began boxing at the age of 12. A white Louisville patrolman named Joe Martin, who had an early television show called \"Tomorrow's Champions,\" started Ali working out in Louisville's Columbia Gym, but it was a black trainer named Fred Stoner who taught Ali the science of boxing. Stoner taught him to move with the grace of a dancer, and impressed upon him the subtle skills necessary to move beyond good and into the realm of great.\nAfter winning an Olympic gold medal at 18, Ali signed the most lucrative contract \u2014 a 50-50 split \u2014 negotiated by a beginning professional in the history of boxing, with a 12-member group of millionaires called the Louisville Sponsoring Group. Later, he worked his way into contention for the coveted heavyweight title shot by boasting and creating media interest at a time when, by his own admission, he was only ranked number nine on the list of contenders. Even from the beginning, it was clear that Ali was his own man--quick, strong-willed, original, and witty. In 1961 he told Sports Illustrated's Gilbert Rogin, \"Boxing is dying because everybody's so quiet.... What boxing needs is more ... Clays.\" Ali knew that his rhymes and press-grabbing claims would infuse more interest and more money into the sport of boxing, and he was his own best public relations man. In February of 1964 he told readers of Sports Illustrated, \"If I were like a lot of ... heavyweight boxers ... you wouldn't be reading this story right now. If you wonder what the difference between them and me is, I'll break the news: you never heard of them. I'm not saying they're not good boxers. Most of them ... can fight almost as good as I can. I'm just saying you never heard of them. And the reason for that is because they cannot throw the jive. Cassius Clay is a boxer who can throw the jive better than anybody.\"\nThe following month Ali \u2014 then still Cassius Clay \u2014 fought Sonny Liston in a match of classic contenders for the heavyweight championship of the world. The Miami fight almost single-handedly restored intelligence and balance to boxing. Cassius Clay had been chanting the war cry \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\" for weeks; he beat Liston in a display of beautiful, controlled boxing. Liston could hit with deadly power, but Ali utilized his skills and courage with forethought and aplomb. He won the fight to become heavyweight champion of the world. At the tender age of 22, Ali knew that he was something above and beyond a great boxer: He had marketing sense, political finesse, and a feeling of noble purpose.\nThroughout his career and life, Ali has always professed to want to help other black Americans--and he has, time and time again. When he returned from Italy, having just won an Olympic gold medal, he was so proud of his trophy that he wore it day and night and showed it to everyone, whether they wanted to see it or not. In the Philadelphia Inquirer Ali's first wife remembered him saying \"I was young, black Cassius Marcellus Clay, who had won a gold medal for his country. I went to downtown Louisville to a five-and-dime store that had a soda fountain. I sat down at the counter to order a burger and soda pop. The waitress looked at me.... 'Sorry, we don't serve coloreds,' she said. I was furious. I went all the way to Italy to represent my country, won a gold medal, and now I come back to America and can't even get served at a five-and-dime store. I went to a bridge, tore the medal off my neck and threw it into the river. That gold medal didn't mean a thing to me if my black brothers and sisters were treated wrong in a country I was supposed to represent.\"\nWhile in Miami, at the age of 21, Ali was inspired by human rights activist Malcolm X to become a member of the Muslim faith. The following year Malcolm X said of Ali, as was quoted by Houston Horn in Sports Illustrated, \"[He] will mean more to his people than any athlete before him. He is more than [first black major-league baseball player] Jackie Robinson was, because Robinson is the white man's hero. But Cassius is the black man's hero. Do you know why? Because the white press wanted him to lose [his heavyweight championship bout] ... because he is a Muslim. You notice nobody cares about the religion of other athletes. But their prejudice against Clay blinded them to his ability.\" Twelve years later, on \"Face the Nation,\" Ali said \"We don't have Black Muslims, that's a press word. We have white brothers, we have brown, red, and yellow, all colors can be Muslims.... I'm looking for peace one day with all people.\" Cassius Clay, Jr., was given the name Muhammad Ali by Muslim patriarch Elijah Muhammad ; it was not just a name, but a title meaning \"beloved of Allah,\" deity of the Muslim faith.\nAli retained his world heavyweight champion title in June of 1965 by again knocking out Sonny Liston, this time with a stunning right-hand punch to the side of the head.

It is about one of the greatest sport events \u2013 perhaps events of any kind \u2013 in contemporary history: The Muhammad Ali vs. George Foreman fight that took place in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in October 1974, known as \u201cThe Rumble in the Jungle.\u201d\u00a0 As everyone else, I\u2019ve taken my share of rights to the jaw in one fashion or another in the course of my life.\u00a0 Whenever it gets to me, I watch this movie.\u00a0 As we end one year and begin the next, especially as we end this particular year and begin 2009 with gut level instincts of fear and hope, dismay and pride, watching this movie could teach an important lesson.\u00a0 It may be the best parable we can turn to right now.\nThe Rumble In The Jungle Is All About How To Overcome Fear \u2013 Legitimate & Totally Justified Fear: Not Unlike The American Public Has Today.\nYou don\u2019t normally associate fear with Muhammad Ali, but fear dominated him as he prepared for the fight with George Foreman.\u00a0 And there was good reason.\u00a0 Despite his friendly and gentle personality today, George Foreman was a ferocious boxer.\u00a0 You couldn\u2019t be rational and not fear him \u2013 and Ali, in addition to being bombastic was also very rational and realistic about what he was to face in the ring \u2013 much like today, when everyone who is rational and realistic fears the prospect of how the economy may deal them a disabling blow.\u00a0 What Ali did against Foreman may be a role model for how Americans can deal with the economy.\u00a0 Read on \u2026.\nAli\u2019s fear was evident far in advance of the fight itself.\u00a0 Norman Mailer described Ali at an early press conference to promote the fight this way:\n\u201cI think Ali was scared.\u00a0 I think he was scared even then [at the press conference].\u00a0 And he knew he was going to be very scared as he\u2019d get closer to the fight.\u00a0 With his ego he could keep telling himself that he would dominate Foreman.\u00a0 That he would beat him; that he would dance; that he would make a fool of him; that he would show him superior boxing; that Foreman would never lay a glove on him.\u00a0 But in fact, in his sleep or wherever his private moment came, he had to know that he did not do nearly as well against two boxers, particularly Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, whom Foreman had demolished.\u00a0 He had an overpowering intensity when he punched.\u00a0 Foreman won his championship by knocking Joe Frazier out and knocked him down something like seven times.\u00a0 Then he destroyed Ken Norton in two rounds.\u00a0 The word \u2018murderous\u2019 does not quite apply.\u00a0 Foreman was awesome.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s what George Plimpton said, describing his visit to the Presidential Palace facility where the boxers trained while in Africa:\n\u201cHe [Foreman] seemed incredible.\u00a0 I\u2019d seen him fight before.\u00a0 I saw him destroy Frazier.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen destruction like that.\u00a0 And the thing that I\u2019ve always remembered was that a beaten fighter, even a man as big and powerful as Frazier \u2013 and he was very much favored to win that fight \u2013 suddenly becomes about the size of a pygmy.\u00a0 They just diminish in size.\u00a0 And Foreman suddenly became this gigantic figure.\u00a0 And he had a trainer, Dick Sadler, tiny by comparison with Foreman; and Saddler would hang onto the heavy bag, and when Foreman would hit this bag, Saddler would literally be picked off his feet.\u201d\nThe \u201cheavy bag\u201d is the name for that training device everyone has seen in boxing movies or at gyms \u2013 it is the big leather bag that hangs from the ceiling, a cylinder that represents a crude and over-simplified form of a human torso.\u00a0 This is the way Mailer described Foreman at the heavy bag \u2013 and how Ali dealt with it:\n\u201cForeman hitting the heavy bag is one of the more prodigious sights I\u2019ve had in my life.\u00a0 It seems to me that of all the people I\u2019ve seen hitting heavy bags, including Sonny Liston, no one hit it the way Foreman did.\u00a0 At the end of 15 minutes of pounding the heavy bag, there\u2019d be a hole in the heavy bag \u2013 not a hole but a huge dent the size of half a small watermelon in that tremendous heavy bag \u2013 and Foreman used the biggest heavy bag around.\u00a0 What would be interesting is that Ali, who would train after Foreman, would often pass by this large hall where training took place, and he never looked at Foreman hitting the heavy bag.\u00a0 He just walked right by as if Foreman did not exist.\u00a0 And it was significant because if you were going to fight the man you didn\u2019t want to see him hitting that heavy bag.\u201d\nThe build-up before the fight actually took much longer than expected because Foreman suffered an injury during training, and the fight had to be postponed.\u00a0 The fighters had already been in Zaire for several weeks, training and promoting the fight, and they decided that rather than cancel the fight, or substitute another boxer for Foreman, they would simply push the date out a few weeks.\u00a0 That gave Ali more time to endear himself to the citizens of Zaire, who already adored him anyhow.\u00a0 Foreman never understood it.\u00a0 He could not fathom how Ali would be loved by so many while he had virtually no fans.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m blacker than he is,\u201d Foreman said, referring to his actual skin color.\u00a0 He just did not understand that Ali was a hero because of his personality and his resistance to being drafted into the US Army in 1967, for which he was suspended from boxing for three-and-a-half years.\u00a0 He was more than a global figure \u2013 he was an absolute hero to many, including those in Zaire.\nSo Ali used the delay before the fight to continue his training and to reach out to the people of Zaire, encouraging them whenever they saw him to yell: \u201cBoomiyay Ali.\u201d\u00a0 The chant meant \u201ckill him.\u201d\u00a0 As Ali ran on the Zaire roads, engaged with the citizens during the day, and whenever he had the opportunity, he would encourage the people to chant \u201cBoomiyay Ali\u201d over and over again.\u00a0 And they always responded with a loud chorus of \u201cBoomiyay Ali\u201d repeated over and over.\u00a0 He had a plan: he would use the chanting of the crowd on fight night to cheer him on and, perhaps, to strike a blow to Foreman\u2019s morale.\u00a0 But he had another plan too \u2013 and it was secret.\u00a0 It was called \u201crope-a-dope.\u201d\nAli told his trainer, the legendary Angelo Dundee, that he had a secret plan, as he also told his fans.\u00a0 But he did not describe it, and virtually everyone dismissed the claim.\u00a0 A few minutes before the fight actually began, in his dressing room, among his most intimate supporters, Ali reiterated his intention of using a secret plan.\u00a0 He saw the looks on the faces of these people who were so close to him, and he saw what was obvious:\u00a0 they were seriously concerned about what Foreman would do to him.\u00a0 He tried to rally his supporters, using bombast \u2013 his unique form of braggadocio; his equivalent of a lion roaring at prey \u2013 to energize them.\u00a0 To erase their fears.\nBut his own fear was clearly visible on his face when he stepped into the ring.\u00a0 There are many iconic pictures of Ali, but the look on his face, as seen in the movie, is powerful.\u00a0 The fear is obvious.\u00a0 It is palpable.\u00a0 It is scary for the viewer to see.\nIn fact, his plan was the exact opposite of what he said he would do.\u00a0 He said he would dance \u2013 he would \u201cdance and dance and dance\u201d he said.\u00a0 He would use his incredible legs to avoid Foreman\u2019s ferocious punches.\u00a0 But that isn\u2019t what he did at all.\nIn the first round, Ali disoriented Foreman by using right hand leads, which is an aberrant tactic.\u00a0 But it didn\u2019t do much damage to Foreman.\u00a0 And that wasn\u2019t his \u201csecret plan\u201d anyhow.\u00a0 That became obvious in the second round when Ali did what nobody, even his corner, expected.\u00a0 He went against the ropes.\u00a0 He let Foreman hit him.\nAli continued to let Foreman hit him round after round, staying against the ropes.\u00a0 He effectively defended himself from getting hurt by the punches.\u00a0 At the same time, he often threw his own body against Foreman\u2019s, making Foreman bear his weight.\u00a0 On some occasions, he\u2019d throw quick shots straight to Foreman\u2019s face.\u00a0 He\u2019d taunt Foreman with phrases like: \u201cIs that the best you can give me George?\u201d\u00a0 All in the massive heat of the open stadium filled with Ali fans who would begin to chant \u201cBoomiyay Ali\u201d whenever Ali gave them the signal.\nAli stayed against the ropes until the eighth round.\u00a0 By that time Foreman, younger than Ali, had punched himself out.\u00a0 And his face was puffed-up by the relatively few, but sharp, shots that were the result of Ali\u2019s singular offensive tactic.\u00a0 And he fell unconscious after Ali landed a left hook that had the effect of lifting Foreman\u2019s head so that it would be in perfect position to be smashed by Ali\u2019s right.\u00a0 The fight was over.\nGet Ready For An Economic Version Of Rope-A-Dope\nI applaud all the efforts, individually, institutionally and by governments (even governments acting cooperatively one with another) to mitigate the damage of the economic crisis.\u00a0 But the reality is that at least for a while that is all that is going to be done: mitigate the damage. There will be damage.\u00a0 And even if not as deep and long-lasting as a worse case scenario, it will be serious.\u00a0 During that period of time, it may be the most realistic approach to emulate Ali\u2019s rope-a-dope strategy.\nWhatever we are going through \u2013 I think that ultimately it will be called something other than a \u201crecession\u201d \u2013 I think that we have to look at it realistically.\u00a0 Just maybe we ought to see it the same way Ali saw Foreman:\u00a0 a formidable opponent that should be feared.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be in the ring for a while.\u00a0 Maybe the best strategy is to put up defenses (Obama\u2019s economic stimulus plan?) and keep the opponent \u2013 in this case, the economy \u2013 from hurting you too hard and too often.\u00a0 But expect to be hurt nevertheless.\u00a0 Every once in a while, take some step to be positioned for when the time comes that victory can be obtained (in the case of the economy, could this be an investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure, education, etc.?).\u00a0 After some period of time, the opponent will punch itself out.\u00a0 New opportunities for victory will arise.\u00a0 The positioning built over time can be fully exploited at that time.\nHow long will this fight with the economy last?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 If it lasts only one round, the strategy can make sense.\u00a0 Sometimes life is rope-a-dope.\u00a0 This may, at least in part, be one of those times.\u00a0 If so, go get \u201cWhen We Were Kings.\u201d\u00a0 And turn the volume up \u2013 the movie has a great soundtrack.\n"}, {"score": 1338.3075, "uuid": "cdb6ae2f-c16c-5e90-9cff-cf2958c54aa4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600wb-31-14874", "target_hostname": "www.islandpacket.com", "target_uri": "http://www.islandpacket.com/2011/11/19/1869087/home-strikes-a-chord-for-lowcountry.html", "page_rank": 1.1716921e-09, "spam_rank": 99, "title": "Home strikes <em>a</em> chord for Lowcountry legend <em>Frazier</em> | islandpacket.com", "snippet": "But even after winning <em>a</em> gold medal and the world heavyweight boxing championship in the Olympics, and beating <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> in the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; in Madison Square Garden, Smokin&#x27; <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> always came home.", "explanation": null, "document": "Home strikes a chord for Lowcountry legend Frazier\nBy DAVID LAUDERDALE\nBy DAVID LAUDERDALE The Island Packet\nPublished Saturday, November 19, 2011\nUpdated Saturday, November 19, 2011\nRead David Lauderdale's musings, see his morning photos and get alerts about his latest columns by following That's Lauderdale on Twitter.\nMy race needs no special defense,\nfor the past history of them in this country\nproves them to be the equal of any people anywhere.\nAll they need is an equal chance in the battle of life.\n-- Robert Smalls of Beaufort, 1895\nJoe Frazier was always coming home.\nHe left Beaufort County as a teenager with a one-way ticket on the 20th century's underground railroad -- the Greyhound bus.\nBut even after winning a gold medal and the world heavyweight boxing championship in the Olympics, and beating Muhammad Ali in the \"Fight of the Century\" in Madison Square Garden, Smokin' Joe Frazier always came home.\nFrazier glided home in a maroon Cadillac limousine after earning $2.5 million for that 1971 bout with Ali. On his mind was a new home for his mother, Dolly Frazier, so she too might escape the Laurel Bay farm where she and the late Rubin Frazier had 12 children, and raised corn, peas, peanuts, watermelon, sweet potatoes, white potatoes, collard greens, turnips, cabbage, horses, mules, cows and hogs.\nFor years, Frazier came home to a plantation he bought near Yemassee, laughing that he owned an acre for every day of the year.\nHe came home to do an exhibition fight at the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort to benefit the local Economic Opportunity Commission.\nHe came home to be squired around in an automobile to visit friends and relations in a place so different from his adopted hometown of Philadelphia.\nFrazier's funeral was held there last Monday. The champ died Nov. 7 of liver cancer at age 67. Thousands paid their last respects, newspapers reported. Ali was there. The Rev. Jesse Jackson led the service, chiding Philadelphia for having a statue for the fictitious boxer \"Rocky,\" rather than Frazier, the real deal.\nAt a memorial service held Wednesday morning at Bethesda Christian Fellowship on St. Helena Island, Dannette Frazier told of one of her uncle's last trips home. He came for her mother's funeral two years ago. He couldn't get anyone to drive him, so he drove himself. He didn't dare tell anyone, because he was legally blind.\nDannette Frazier said he told them: \"All I did was follow the tail light in front of me.\"\nAT HOME\nIf anybody symbolizes what the Gullah people can do on a level playing field, it's Frazier.\nHis life has been dissected this past week by publications worldwide. The Economist wrote: \"To say that Joe Frazier had a left hook was like saying the Tomcat jet fighter is an aeroplane.\" Dave Anderson's New York Times column was headlined: \"A champion who won inside the ring and out.\"\nBut at home, the people who knew him as \"Billy Boy\" still remember wrestling with him as a child.\nThomas C. Barnwell Jr. of Hilton Head Island recalls buying a set of Frazier's golf clubs from one of his sisters. \"I thought it would help the ball go in the hole, but it didn't,\" he said.\nJacob Martin of Bluffton says his sister Mary and her husband, Rivers Riley, who took young Frazier in in Philadelphia. His sister Margaret was married to James Martin of Seabrook, who got Frazier his job in the slaughterhouse where he famously punched carcasses in chasing his audacious dream to be like Joe Louis.\nConnections like that are how Gullah talents spread far from the South Carolina coastline, where that era's Jim Crow laws and societal norms stifled them.\nSPECIAL GIFTS\nAs Beaufort celebrated its native son Wednesday, it was clear that not all the big ones got away.\nBluesman Cool John Ferguson of St. Helena Island sounded like Jimi Hendrix when he played \"The Star Spangled Banner\" on his electric guitar for the memorial service at the Henry C. Chambers Waterfront Park in downtown Beaufort.\nWhen alto Carolyn Hewins of St. Helena Island sang the solo portion of \"In The Midst Of It All\" with Bethesda Christian's Voices of Victory choir, she was every bit as good as Aretha Franklin.\nAnd many say they've never heard a better singing voice than Frazier's brother, the late Rubin \"Deac\" Frazier.\n\"Oh, my God. It would raise the hair on the back of your neck,\" said Anita Singleton-Prather. \"It was a bass like none other.\"\nDeac Frazier sang with Singleton-Prather's Gullah Kinfolk choir. He often sang with his mother, \"Miss Dolly,\" who taught all her children the Bible and singing at Israelite Baptist Church. Her baby even had a band at one time called Smokin' Joe Frazier and the Knockouts.\nBut nobody ever touched Deac Frazier. They say that if a spiritual had five stanzas, he knew seven. And though it wasn't in Madison Square Garden for all the world to see, his tearful performance of \"Nowhere To Lay My Head\" at his mother's funeral touched a chord that explains why the younger brother he adored would always come home.\nFollow columnist David Lauderdale at twitter.com/ThatsLauderdale.\nRelated content:\n"}, {"score": 1332.3395, "uuid": "f07ca68f-1c95-541a-b370-45a86a5181a6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-37-00747", "target_hostname": "www.lasvegassun.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2012/feb/08/power-love-ali-celebration-be-broadcast-abc-espn2/?hpk", "page_rank": 1.1730718e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "&#x27;Power of Love&#x27; <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> celebration to be broadcast on ABC, ESPN2", "snippet": "The three-time heavyweight boxing champion will celebrate <em>a</em> milestone birthday Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2012, when he turns 70. <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> and <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> at the 2002 ESPYs in Los Angeles.", "explanation": null, "document": "Launch slideshow \u00bb\nMuhammad Ali's 70th birthday party set for Feb. 18 at MGM Grand Garden Arena is turning into a celebration for the masses.\n\u201cAli 70th From Las Vegas\u201d will be broadcast on ABC at 2 p.m. on Feb. 25 and again on ESPN2 at 7 p.m. The event honoring Ali is the 16th Annual Keep Memory Alive \u201cPower of Love\u201d gala, expected to draw 1,800 guests to the arena.\nThe night is a benefit for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the Muhammad Ali Center.

I'm the champ! Don't make me wait! I'll whup him in eight!\"\nWhen he tried to run towards the winner's corner, several policemen held him back. Seven months later in Miami Beach he hijacked the weigh-in on the morning of his own first fight with Liston with a performance so hysterical that it convinced his opponent that he was unhinged. Once again he tried to lunge at his opponent, screaming: \"Hey, sucker, you're a chump! You're a chump, a chump, a chump! You too ugly to run loose, you big ugly bear! You so ugly, you have to sneak up on the mirror so it won't run off the wall!\"\nSuch disruptive behaviour became an accepted mode, and until Saturday night its nadir was probably the confrontation between Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson in New York during 2002, at a press conference to publicise their forthcoming fight, when the two men ended up scuffling on the floor beneath an upturned table.\nAli was making his reputation, and also selling tickets, but there was a nasty edge to his taunts. What about his treatment of Patterson, a decent man whom he called a coward and an Uncle Tom, and who was so wounded that he refused for the rest of his life to refer to his conqueror by any name other than Cassius Clay? Years later Ali called Joe Frazier an Uncle Tom, too, and a few more people besides Smokin' Joe found that hard to stomach. Patterson was one of a railway labourer's 11 children. Frazier came from a dirt-poor South Carolina farming family. By comparison, Ali's background was comfortable and stable. At a time when civil rights were still a burning issue, such insults were unjustifiable and unforgiveable.\nAli is a sacred figure now, of course, a sort of secular saint, beyond compare or criticism in many eyes, just like Ayrton Senna, another hero whose beauty and charisma helped him get away with things from which other men might not have been allowed to emerge with their image unstained, even enhanced. It's no coincidence that both men became the subject of award-winning films which highlighted their extraordinary personal magnetism.\nSenna turned Formula One into a contact sport, importing the risk-taking, wheel-rubbing tactics of go-kart racing in order to intimidate his rivals. He could do it because the cars and the circuits had become so much safer and the slightest contact no longer meant certain death. But there was also a spiritual side to his personality. When he discussed his profession in metaphysical terms, speaking of his \"enormous desire to go further, to travel beyond my own limits\", people looked into his liquid brown eyes and swooned.\nIt was the same with Ali once he started saying things like \"No Viet Cong ever called me nigger\" and speaking of his faith: \"There's truth in Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, all religions. The only religion that matters is the real religion \u2013 love.\"\nLike Senna, he was revealing layers of personality that went beyond a talent for punching people or driving fast. In the great upheaval of the 1960s, he was on the right side and his contribution to social change far outweighed a legacy to boxing that did indeed reach something of a nadir when the Munich police went searching for two British fighters in the early hours of Sunday morning.\nBoxing plays by its own rules, although one of them \u2013 and it was a matter of pride for generations of pugilists \u2013 used to be that a professional fighter never used his fists outside the ring. But who now remembers Ezzard Charles, the world heavyweight champ between 1949 and 1951, whose 119-fight career included victories over Joe Louis and Jersey Joe Walcott, and who said he hoped to be remembered as \"a simple, square sort of fellow who believed in playing the game by the rules\"?\nBut maybe Haye and Chisora were just doing their job. Bernd B\u00f6nte and Frank Warren, the managers of Saturday's fighters, should waste no time in getting both Klitschkos into the ring with the two British fighters, on the same bill, on the same night.

She continued her business studies at UCLA and received a MBA degree in 1986 with an emphasis in Marketing.\nUpon marrying Muhammad in November of 1986, she began to assume responsibility for the coordination and eventual management of his business affairs. In September of 1992 she formally incorporated GOAT, Inc. to centralize and license her husband\u2019s intellectual properties for commercial purposes. She served as Vice President of GOAT from 1992 until the sale of the company in April 2006. During her tenure as Vice President, Lonnie managed the daily operations of the company while accompanying her husband on domestic and international business trips. In addition, she often partnered with her husband on humanitarian missions around the globe. After the sale of GOAT, Lonnie was asked to serve on the management board of the newly formed company. (Muhammad Ali Enterprises).\nIn November of 2005 she and her husband opened the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky. The Center\u2019s mission is to preserve the Ali legacy for future generations which includes promoting tolerance and understanding among different people, communities and nations. She currently serves as Vice-Chair on the Board of Directors at the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky.\nToday Lonnie remains actively involved in various charitable and educational causes including being an advocate for children\u2019s rights and Parkinson\u2019s disease research. She recently partnered with a major pharmaceutical company to launch a national campaign in support of Parkinson\u2019s caregivers. She is a frequent guest and speaker at Parkinson\u2019s disease support groups and Parkinson\u2019s research gatherings.\nLonnie is a native of Louisville, Kentucky and currently divides her time between Berrien Springs, Michigan and Paradise Valley, Arizona.\nHe is still one of the most recognizable men on earth. And nearly fifty years after he burst onto the scene as a gold-medal winner at the 1960 Rome Olympics, Muhammad Ali remains a magical figure, known and loved throughout the world.\nDubbed \"Athlete of the Century\" by USA Today and GQ magazine, Muhammad continues to receive accolades for his contribution to sports. He has been named Sports Illustrated's \"Sportsman of the Century,\" the BBC's \"Sports Personality of the Century,\" the World Sports Award's \"World Sportsman of the Century,\" and the State of Kentucky's \"Kentuckian of the Century.\" In November 2005, he received the United States of America's highest civil award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nAs a boxer, Muhammad brought unprecedented speed and grace to his sport, while his charm and wit changed forever what the public expected a champion to be. His accomplishments in the ring are the stuff of legend \u2013 two fights with Sonny Liston, where he proclaimed himself \"The Greatest\" and proved he was; three epic wars with Joe Frazier; the stunning victory over George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle; and dethroning Leon Spinks to become heavyweight champion for an unprecedented third time. But there was always far more to Muhammad than what took place in a boxing ring.\nMuhammad's life and career have been played out as much on the front pages of newspapers as on the inside sports pages. His early embrace of Islam and his insistence on being called Muhammad Ali instead of his \"slave name,\" Cassius Clay, heralded a new era in black pride. His refusal to be inducted into the United States Army anticipated the growing antiwar movement of the 1960's as he became an influential figure in the civil rights movement, inspiring millions of Americans toward political and with his outspoken but ultimately widely-respected statements and actions.His willingness to stage his much-promoted and publicized fights in such far-flung locales as Kinshasa, Manila, and Kuala Lumpur signaled a shift from superpower dominance toward a growing awareness of the developing world.\nDaring to go against political policy to help people in need, Muhammad has made goodwill missions to Afghanistan and North Korea; delivered sorely-needed medical supplies to an embargoed Cuba; traveled to Iraq and secured the release of 15 United States hostages during the first Gulf War; and journeyed to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela upon his release from prison.\nToday, championing the causes of the developing world has become a major focus of Muhammad's life. He has been instrumental in providing over 232 million meals to the world's hungry. Traveling across continents, he has hand-delivered food and medical supplies to children in Cote D'Ivoire, Indonesia, Mexico, and Morocco among other countries.\nIn addition to his international efforts, Muhammad is equally devoted to helping charities at home. He has visited countless numbers of soup kitchens and hospitals, and helped such organizations as the Make-A-Wish-Foundation and the Special Olympics. He annually participates in \"Fight Night,\" which generates funds for the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Research Center at Barrow Neurological Institute, in Phoenix, Arizona. At the State Capitol in Michigan, he advocated new laws for protecting children. He is also the namesake of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, a law that regulates professional boxing to protect boxers from unscrupulous promoters and poor health and bout conditions. In recent years, Muhammad has testified before the United States Congress several times regarding Parkinson's disease research funding and professional boxing reform.\nFor his humanitarian efforts, Muhammad has been the recipient of countless awards. In addition to being honored by Amnesty International with their Lifetime Achievement Award, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan bestowed upon him the citation of United Nations Messenger of Peace. Muhammad has received honorary degrees from numerous colleges and universities including Princeton University, Columbia University and Mt. Ida College. He was also named a \"Living Legend\" by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\nIn Germany, Muhammad was honored with the 2005 Otto Hahn Peace Medal for his involvement in the U.S. civil rights movement and the United Nations. He was also the International Ambassador of Jubilee 2000, a global organization dedicated to relieving debt in developing nations. Other honors include an Essence Award, an XNBA Human Spirit Award and recognition from the National Urban League; 100 Black Men; Givat Haviva; the Oleander Foundation; The National Conference of Christians and Jews; Time magazine; and former President Jimmy Carter, who cited Muhammad as \"Mr. International Friendship.\"\nEver the entertainer, Muhammad has appeared in several motion pictures, including the big-screen adaptation of his first autobiography, The Greatest, playing himself. His life has been the subject of numerous films, including the Academy Award-winning documentary When We Were Kings and Michael Mann's biopic, ALI, starring Will Smith. Muhammad also starred in Freedom Road, and made guest appearances on numerous popular television series ranging from Diff'rent Strokes to Touched by an Angel. He also starred on Broadway in the musical, Big Time Buck White, and recorded a popular album, I Am the Greatest!\nMuhammad published a memoir in 2004 entitled, The Soul of a Butterfly: Reflections on Life's Journey, in which he discusses the meaning of religion, forgiveness, and some of the defining moments in his life and career. He is also the co-author of Healing: A Journal of Tolerance and Understanding and The Greatest: My Own Story.\nIn 2005, Muhammad opened the Muhammad Ali Center in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to displaying a selection of his memorabilia, the Center's interactive exhibits focus on themes of peace, social responsibility, respect and personal growth. In 2006, he partnered with CKX, Inc. to form Muhammad Ali Enterprises LLC, for the licensing of his name, image and likeness and to continue promoting his cultural and philosophical legacy throughout the world.\nMuhammad has nine children: Maryum, Rasheda, Jamillah, Hana, Laila, Khaliah, Miya, Muhammad Junior, and Asaad. He is married to the former Lonnie Williams of Louisville, whom he has known since her family moved across the street from the Clay family when she was 6 years old.\nWhether promoting tolerance and understanding, feeding the hungry, studying his religion, or reaching out to children in need, Muhammad Ali is devoted to making the world a better place for all people. No athlete has ever contributed more to the life of his country, or the world, than Muhammad Ali.\n"}, {"score": 1254.9971, "uuid": "d05a3e51-5a26-5d1e-b017-ad640fa89f39", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200tw-11-16091", "target_hostname": "www.hulu.com", "target_uri": "http://www.hulu.com/watch/322857/joe-frazier-when-the-smoke-clears?c=News-and-Information/Documentary-and-Biography", "page_rank": 1.182537e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Hulu - <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>: When the Smoke Clears - Watch the full movie now.", "snippet": "We hope that the film can help contribute, even in <em>a</em> small way, to <em>a</em> true understanding of <em>who</em> <em>Joe</em> <em>was</em>.

I was unaware at the time but a local hobby photographer got the shot of her wrapping her tiny arms around his neck! He took the drawing from her and Thanked her. Later that day I thought it would be nice if she could get his autograph. We approached his limo but it had the windows up and once again secruity did their job and pushed us aside, as were we walking away I heard the window come down and someone called out to get the little girl! We went back and he gave her his autograph. She beamed.

Ali to me is more than a boxer,he is an icon for millions of people who dont even like this sport. As well as having grace,style,speed,beauty in the ring,he also has all these plus more outside the ropes.

My Dad took me to see Muhammad when I was approximately 7 years old; during the time he was banned from boxing because of his courageous stance on the war. He was speaking at Oswego State College and my Father was huge fan of his and he toook me with him to hear him talk. I was a little to young to remember everything he talked about that day but I do remember how he was so loved by those around him and what a great presence he had with the whole audeince at the time. After the speech was over he was very gracious and let me on stage so my Dad could take a picture of me with him. I still have the picture some 40 years later and will treasure it forever!!! I know he has had a tough time the past few years with his illness and I hope he will be able to live the rest of his life like he always has with dignity and greatness. Thank you for your time and consideration!! Would it be possible to get his address for me to send him a copy of my picture to him.

In August of 1988, I'm attending an FOP Corn Roast with my dad. This is a small town event with many of the local police. St. Joe Lodge 96 (still pretty lily white at the time!!). I see an imposing figure sitting by himself at a picnic table under the shelter. I recognized him instantly, I think I must have been the first. In shock, I said to my dad...\"that's Muhammad Ali, isn't it?\" \"It sure looks like him.\" Brave guy that I am, and I don't remember much, it is him!!! I ask him, \"How's it goin' CHAMP?\" I think there was a little small talk. I'm talkin' to Ali!!! He asked me if I wanted an Autograph. He asked me!! All of today's pompous athletes should take a lesson from this mans humility and humanity. From all the brash bravado, he still deeply cherished his fans and cared and loved all of humanity. The \"Islam for Non-Muslams\" pamphlet he gave me will always be cherished. I read it and I hope it gives me a better understanding of all of the complexities in the world today. A few years later, I was lucky enough to have his picture taken holding my 18 month old son. He's 17 now. I think he finally realizes how impressive this is!! I finally have a place to display my auto'ed gloves and SI's. You are a great human being. People who mistook the TV image for real missed out. Were you arrogant? You had the right to be, you were the greatest and you backed it up. If they ever met you in person, they would see a kind, loving, giving individual who had the time for anyone. There is not an athlete today who will have the influence you had. MJ comes in second. Today's athlete needs to take a lesson from the greatest and realize that without the fans they are nothing.

She then told me that he was a famous boxer. i started to wander. it was the same year that the movie came out. as time passed, i still heard about him and as a kid i always asked myself if he was a muslim just like me. i soon found out that he was and was proud and in 2007 wen i was in year 8 the movie was on tv. i watched the film and was so amazed about why he was so great, i started researching on him and he then lifted me up. i was a shy kid, a tall strong kid who always got teased by the the others because i was abit taller than the others and fat. the life of ali made me have more confidence in myself and better self esteem. Ali then became my role model, i bought the film, put posters of him in my room, made a movie about him for a school project. every day i wake up looking at my hero and thinking that he can do the impossible then i can. he inspires me to be myself and to be a good person and to this day he is still my hero\nNumber Of Responses\nPercentage Of Responses\n(3%)\nWhilst every generation have their heros and role models there has never been anyone who reached so many people like Muhammad Ali.

Growing up in the 1960s and 70s, I'd been following Ali's career since I was a kid, and always had a great admiration for not only his accomplishments in the ring, but also his humanitarian and ambassador work outside the ring. My grandmother, Miriam Robinson, was on the Board of Overseers at the school at that time, after many years there as an English professor. She'd received her annual invitation to the graduation ceremony, as well as an invitation to the post-commencement private reception for the six honorary degree recipients. I had no idea of what she was up to on the day when she initially invited me to be her escort for the day, but upon reading on the invitation that Muhammad Ali would be one of the honorees, I immediately said \"YES!\" At that very moment, I knew exactly what I would do with that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. At the commencement, we were seated near the stage, just to the right of Ali. During his acceptance speech, he said, to tumultuous applause: \"They called me The King; they called me The Greatest; they called me The Champion. Now they can call me 'The Doctor'.\" After the commencement, there was a short break while everyone filed out of the huge tent. I quickly went back to our car parked right outside to get a paper bag I'd stashed under the front seat (unbeknownst to my grandmother) and met her at the door of the Learning Resource Center, where the private reception was being held. The honorees were already inside, with a swarm of people around Ali, as you'd expect. He appeared to have a handful of small brochures that he was handing out. I immediately felt a 'buzz' as I entered the room and made my way in his direction. My grandmother went to sit with old friends nearby. Just then, we heard an announcement that Ali would not be signing autographs, but instead would be handing out brochures which he'd previously signed, entitled \"Women in Islam\". Well, despite the fact that my plan would violate that edict, I reached inside the bag and pulled out a Magic Marker and a cloth boxing glove that was my grandfather's from the 1930s and took another step closer. When my turn came, I shook the Champ's hand and said: \"I know I'm not supposed to ask for this, but this glove was my grandfather's from the 30s and I hoped you'd make an exception\". With my feet coming off the ground, I have no recollection of what he said in return, but he took the glove and marker from me, signed it \"Muhammad Ali 5-28-94\" and handed both back to me as I looked into his eyes and shook his hand again, saying \"Thank you very much\". I turned and made my way through the crowd to where my grandmother was sitting. She started to ask me how it went, but when she saw how much I was visibly shaking, she said: \"Honey you'd better sit down!\" Now, I've met quite a few famous people in my life, but I'd never had such a reaction from the feeling of being in the presence of 'true greatness\u2019, neither before nor since. After collecting the local newspaper accounts the following day, I created a very nice framed display of the glove, pen, invitations and articles, and it remains one of my most prized possessions to this day and a beautiful memento of one of the most incredible days of my life. Thanks again, \"Doctor\"! P.S. I'm know Howard Bingham was right there taking pictures, but I've never been able to contact him about whether or not he took any while my glove was being signed. I'm sure he must have. What I wouldn't give for an 8x10 of that moment! Thank you very much!

It comes in only behind my wedding day 18 years ago and the birth days of my three children. Why? Because on that day, I met Muhammad Ali. Meeting Ali has been a lifetime quest for me and that day was nothing short of remarkable. Many people take stands in their life but seldom have to give up everything because of those principles, especially if it involves forfeiting the greatest title in the world, world heavyweight champion. But Ali risked everything because of his belief that the war in Vietnam was wrong and he was willing to stake that belief against fame and money. During his exile from sports, he continued to work with the poor and less privileged, even though his future was in serious jeopardy. His faith and his principles were truly inspiring, especially for those of us who needed something or someone to believe in. As a boy of 12, I discovered boxing at a local boxing club. I stayed in the sport for three years until a family move forced me to quit. But while boxing, I discovered the story of Muhammad Ali. Like most young men, what initially impressed me was his great fighting ability and the heart he displayed in the ring. But as time passed, what impressed me the most was his love for people and his strong beliefs in right vs. wrong. His confidence in himself and his faith would not let anyone or anything stop him from fulfilling his destiny. At that time in my life, I desperately needed some inspiration and something or someone to believe in. For me, that was always Ali. I was abused by my stepfather to the point that I was too badly bruised to attend school. I was repeatedly told that I would never amount to anything. In my mind, I would imagine that I was just like Ali. No one could stop me from fulfilling my dreams if I believed in myself and always did what was right. That inspiration gave me the strength to put myself through college, working two and sometimes three jobs. I graduated with a 4.0 grade point average. Although I had no family to attend my graduation ceremony I can honestly say I was the proudest graduate on stage that night. Today, I am 46 years old and living a life I could only have dreamed of 25 years ago. But with all my good fortune, I have never forgotten my roots and how I got to this point in my life. And that\u2019s why I wanted to meet Muhammad Ali, so I could thank him personally. So on Dec. 1, my wife Laurie and I arrived at the HueMan Bookstore in New York\u2019s Harlem. While we were waiting outside the bookstore for Ali\u2019s arrival, we noticed a small church in a run-down building across the street. Before we knew it, about 40 kids ran across the street into the bookstore. It became clear that Ali, true to his reputation, would visit with these kids before anyone else. Once the kids were inside, a GMC Yukon pulled up and people started to surround it. Inside was the \"greatest of all time.\" He was slighter in build than I expected, but he was very youthful looking for a man of 62. He arrived with no limo, no fancy entourage. The most famous person in the world had driven up to the bookstore in a truck no different from mine. As famous as he is, he is still a man of the people. We remained in line for approximately 45 minutes, and as the line slowly moved, my anxiety grew. I wondered what I would say to Ali after all of these years of wanting so desperately to meet my childhood hero. It was finally my turn, and I was both afraid and in awe. So my wife began explaining to Ali\u2019s assistant Kim that I had written to him three years ago, and that he had called me in response to my letter. I was not home at the time and how it had bothered me ever since. Almost instantly, Ali stood up and gave Laurie a huge heartfelt hug. He then stepped over and gave me a big hug as well. To say it touched me would not give the moment justice. Ali could see how nervous I was. He seemed to understand what it meant to me to meet him. So he began play box to ease my nervousness and then hugged me again and smiled. Not a word said, but not a word needed. For the next three hours, I watched Ali meet and greet his fans. He took special time with the elderly and especially young children. A little boy handed him a book that he had done in crayon entitled \"The Greatest,\" and you could see by the glint in his eye that Ali was touched by the boy\u2019s effort. He held and kissed every baby and child with no regard for age or race. All through the afternoon, Ali would pause and give that famous fighting glare and shake his fist at different people. I stood quietly and took it all in. Laurie kept saying that Ali kept looking back at me and glaring. He would jokingly shake his fist at me as I stood watching. Whatever the reason, he made me and many others feel special. That is the Ali magic. I heard someone say once that Ali was a credit to his race. I would agree \u2014 the human race. After the crowd subsided, I walked up to Ali and explained to him, the best way I could, what he meant to me. But mostly, I wanted to tell him: \"Thank you.\" Ali nodded, gave me another hug and smiled. His wife then showed up and tried to persuade him that it was time to go. It took a few minutes of urging. It was clear that Ali wanted to spend more time with the people who had had come to see him. It was truly amazing to see the love he showed everyone there. Afterward, I realized that when you look into Ali\u2019s eyes, you are looking into his soul. And in my opinion, there is no other soul more special than Ali. There is a gentleness and kindness to him that is unmistakable. In a complicated world, love is still the only thing anybody really needs. And Muhammad Ali seems to know that better than anyone. ------------ Bill Miller lives in Oconomowoc. Copyright 2004, Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.

I was a student at the University of lagos and the night was electrifying and we were convinced Ali has fulfilled a heroic mission in a continent where he is admired so much. I grew up following how Ali turned Sports into victory for the black race as they struggle for emancipation. I am also grateful to Ali whose legacy for pragmatism, lack of fear and grace has affected the perception of blak people world wide. Ali proved that one individual can change destiny of millions and his humantarian efforsts are recognized as part of his desire to share His blessings and goodwill to all. may Allah bless him wtith long life. May Allah heal him. Ali, we love you we adore you.

For the sake of the Allah (ST) Mercy and Merciful - help me to the coach - disabled!!! Appeal to my brother Muhammad Ali Bismillahirrahmanirrahim!!! Assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh!!! Dear brother Muhammad Ali, if you can - help me for the sake of Allah (ST). I am looking for sponsors around the world for themselves and their activities. To you drawn coach - disabled from Chechnya, which the disease resides in France (year-round needs a warm maritime climate). I am over 30 years of disability (disabled person Soviet army since 1977. In 1985 - 86 years had two operations to survive: deleted part of the left lung, three edges and two thirds of the stomach. So far, after minor physical and nervous disorders susceptible to pulmonary hemoptysis), But despite his disability, I as a Muslim - for the sake of Allah (ST) - more than 30 years of free education of children and young people (regardless of nation or religion), karate, and thus to accustom them to a healthy lifestyle and spiritual - moral purity. Dear brother, I appeal to the many years of Muslim rulers: Saudi Arabia, Brunei, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Malaysia, but my letters to them, do not get - they just throw in their environment in the dustbin - although I'll forgive them for the sake of Allah (ST) to transfer my appeal recipients. I appeal to the press, too, but there are also indifferently silent. Mike, my brother, I lost everything in this life because of two wars in Chechnya: the mother and many relatives and friends whom I could not even last farewell. I and my family not nor home nor health, nor the possibility of a normal life, and for my eldest son became disabled after a head injury in 2009 that his back at work cowardly attacked the French brass knuckles addicts who have failed deal with him face to face and he lay 15 days in a coma, but the will of Allah (ST) survived, but not fully recovered. Him gave a disability but did not give pension( we immigrants and us can do anything ) and we submitted to the tribunal, but the result is still unknown, and when it is also unknown, because we have a social advocate, and to hire a lawyer in our normal no money. I came to France with his family to survive the most (frequent pulmonary hemoptysis threatened my life) and that children could have a future, and we are here to defeat the contrary. My son wanted to become a professional fighter karate, but it did and now disabled until we do not care about anyone. All my attempts to find the world of noble people, who would help me and my family no one was found, not even a single Muslim has responded and now brother You're my last hope and I know brother, that you help me, for you and you can not otherwise - because you're Muhammad Ali and it says it all. Brother, I'm not asking you for money (although it is very difficult and they need), I ask brother introduce me to a journalist who denounced my would appeal to the rulers of the Muslims that I have listed above, so that they would help me in my request, and a Dream , where I live for more than 33 years (dream of all my life - to collect means and to construct sports complex and on its base to open international training - sports, rehabilitation - healthy Center \"Peace and Mercy to children\", where there could study free of charge and restore lost health and broken psychic condition - children, orphans, invalids, kids-victims of wars, ethnic conflicts and natural cataclysms) and the same free of charge raised and trained karate for children and young people, and most recently tried his hand at boxing and coaching in the home of his neighbor boy boxer Suliman Abdurashidova took him 3 months to win the French Cup in 2011, as well as in the semifinal of France - 2011, where he is in equal fight on points lost in the final and joined the French team where the training camp he was seriously injured the right shoulder and the doctors said that I needed surgery, but despite this he had his first fight for the national team and with one hand have won this battle, and then consented to surgery. This fight reminded me of 1975 when I served in the army (he played football) and it was somewhere in September brother you just fight with Joe Frazier. And when the fighting was, many set against you since you were a Muslim, and we all Chechens (12) were rooting for you and at this point the dispute who will win and who I stood up and said that Muhammad Ali would win and then a My colleague, an ethnic Russian (he was a boxer and champion of the Baltic Military District) stood up and said that he was a supporter of Joe Frazier, and that if you win, Joe Frazier, he will fight with me after hanging up. That is what happened to him and we fought without gloves. Boxer and street fighter - football and the fight was bloody and cruel, and no one wanted to give in, I broke my wrist, all my face was covered in blood, but I did not feel pain, but was just some sort of drowsiness, nausea, and heaviness in the head, but In spite of this I continued to fight one with his left hand and yet I the will of Allah (ST) sent him a knockout, and when he came to himself, I told him about the words that Muhammad Ali is my brother and I will tear him any. On the second day of my entire face was bruised (as in my opponent ), body ached, and we with him Tuscany dismantling the magistrate, but I was happy because I knew that I had won the hardest fight of his life, because Iovercame in himself defended his weaknesses and your name in part from ridicule, because if I would have lost this fight, I and my brothers Chechens - the Muslims would lose face and I swear by Allah (ST), it is true. Then I left to serve in Mongolia, and there began for himself karate, playing football in the same way, then began to rebel and then me and secretly and infected with pulmonary tuberculosis and after that I became disabled. After serving two years, I came home, opened the first section of karate in Chechnya, and since then, and began to teach their students free karate and to the extent possible to help children - the disabled and since I was born and in my cherished dream. I then fought many times in my life defending justice, walking on knives, going against the crowd, against the authorities (1983 anti-Soviet hunger strike 35 days) has passed two of the war, went to the bullets and bombs, and choked with his own blood, but never ever Allah (ST ) did not give me a reason to show their weakness and cowardice to show and when I did is bad, I think this fight and as I was then and this is difficult memory takes me back to life. I'm not a little-known pupils, but after the anti-Soviet hunger strike in 1983, they most cowardly betrayed me, but despite this I have the will of Allah (ST) suffered two serious operations, survived and still continue my labor of love of life - though have a very difficult one, because it is difficult to survive was his mother's death in 2005, and I could not take her final journey, and now this injury her son in 2009, which led to his disability, and crippled me and my wife completely, but try to stay as I can and all still hoping to put his main dream in life - a life and I hope very much that it's you and help my brother - Insha Allah. I'm somewhere in 2003 I think from Baku turned to you, but to me then someone from your entourage said that you have difficulties with money, because you build a sports complex and since I am looking for sponsors for their dreams, but I no one helped me and always a refusal, even when it was about saving the lives of children - disabled. I spoke to more than 1,000 firms and companies in the world to help me, but I refused to Wisdom, which is what is still important and could not believe it when I write, that if they refuse me, Allah (ST) - God will punish them because you can not deny coach - disabled in a world that so many years risking his life and brings free karate teaches children and young people and wherever possible helps seriously ill children in preparations for the treatment of the world and always at least the possibility of sharing with them their pensions . Brother, I hope that this time, my appeal will give your hands and you do so, as in this case should go my brother in the faith of Muhammad Ali which I fought and won in his youth as he and Insha Allah. Dear brother, me 56 years old and I do not know how much I have left and I would not want to leave because of life - an obscure and forgotten by giving children and young people 33 years of his life, health and welfare and that after my death my wife and 2 sons eked out a miserable life abroad.

I yelled for my father to stop the car its ALI and before the car could stop, my brothers and I had the doors open and were running towards Ali. His bodyguard seemed alarmed at this young white girl and her three brothers and as he grabbed my arm and my camera, Ali looked at him and said \"Take your hands off of that child.\" He was ultra cool, dressed in all black and was very calm and patient as he asked his bodyguard to take a family picture, with him in the middle! The picture taken many years ago brings back very fond memories, a few family members are now gone, but the fun and excitement of that day lives on.

We hitchhiked from Ill to New York City for the fight - quite an adventure as we were thrown off the tollways twice by state troopers and gained the largest segment of our trip from an AWOL soldier in a stolen vehicle.

I believe Joe would have beat Marciano in his prime (we'll never know). Similar for Muhammad Ali, although he lost to Frazier, Norton, Spinks, Holmes and Berbick - the losses to Frazier and Norton occurred not long after he got out of jail, and the losses to Spinks, Holmes, and Berbick occurred when he was washed up. An Ali in his prime and in training would have eaten them for lunch. Marciano should have a top 10 ranking, if not top 5, as he was unbeaten. Mike Tyson's career was actually pretty short. After Cus D'amato died, he went off the rails as far as his personal life and it affected his training. He had pretty good defensive skills on his way up, but lost them as a champion. You can't fight at that level without defense. So I honestly think longevity should be a requirement.\n\u2014Guest red52\nPrevious 16-30 of 36 Next\nShare Your Opinions\nWhat Do You Think of Our Heavyweight Top 50?\nGuest Name*\n"}, {"score": 973.9822, "uuid": "24e075a6-2626-5e1a-9d5d-0a4b27d345fe", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0403wb-04-17302", "target_hostname": "observer.guardian.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://observer.guardian.co.uk/toptens/story/0,,1078428,00.html", "page_rank": 1.1796328e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Observer Sport Monthly: 10 greatest <em>boxers</em> | Special reports | The Observer", "snippet": "It <em>was</em> <em>Joe</em> <em>who</em> inspired Sugar Ray Robinson to box, the younger man tagging along with him to <em>a</em> Detroit gym before his family moved to New York.

He wasn't bragging; and he is special, still - long after the end of his fighting career. What defines Ali as a man as much as a fighter is his courage. He took on the world and shook it when nobody gave him a hope in hell: against Liston, defying the draft, coming back at 32 to beat George Foreman, going toe to toe with Joe Frazier in that third, horrific collision in Manila, and then taming his Parkinson's Syndrome.\nHis serenity now comes from that almost unbendable fortitude. He lost five times, once at his peak, to Frazier, and later in decline. He probably got the benefit of the doubt against Ken Norton. But at his dancing, lightning peak, cutting down Cleveland Williams, bamboozling Zora Folley, there was nobody like him.\n2. Sugar Ray Robinson\nWelterweight/Middleweight\n(1940-1965)\nEmanuel Steward picks him ahead of Ali, and there are arguments for that case. Chief among them is Robinson's length of service: 202 professional bouts between 1940 and 1965. He was welterweight champion between 1946 and 1951, and held the middleweight title five times in the Fifties. Those who saw his early days, of which there is very little film evidence, say Robinson as a welterweight was untouchable.\nHe hit equally hard with both hands and moved like Nijinsky. He also lived stylishly, enchanting all of Europe with an entourage that included a hairdresser and a midget, before Randolph Turpin caught him on an off-day. Ninety days later, Sugar Ray got his revenge. Nobody beat him twice. Ask Jake LaMotta.\n3. Joe Louis\nHeavyweight\n(1934-1951)\nIt was Joe who inspired Sugar Ray Robinson to box, the younger man tagging along with him to a Detroit gym before his family moved to New York. The Motor City was some fight town, and nobody graced it better than Louis. His mother wanted him to be a violinist but the boxing bug kicked in and opponents fell like axed oaks (like Lee Savold, above, in 1951).\nHis 12-year reign as heavyweight champion was one of total dominance. Eddie Futch, who sparred with him, reckoned his jab and right cross were just about the deadliest combination in boxing. Joe's chin let him down a few times, but he rarely failed to get up and win.\n4. Jimmy Wilde\nFlyweight\n(1910-1923)\nThe leek-thin Welshman was a freak of nature. He barely weighed seven stone and good fighters two stone heavier were reluctant to share a ring with him. Nobody's sure how many times he got through the ropes, as Wilde was brought up around the booths of South Wales, where he would often fight several times a day - and never lose.\nThey called him the Ghost With A Hammer In His Hand, a clumsy nom de guerre that almost certainly would not fit on his little gown but one with which hundreds of victims would hardly argue. Boxing Illustrated once rated him the 10th hardest hitter in the entire history of boxing. He was flyweight champion for seven years when it really mattered, the best little man among several thousands.\n5. Benny Leonard\nLightweight\n(1911-1932)\nFor eight years up until the mid-Twenties, he was the quintessential boxing master. His was the classic American-Jewish boxing background, raised on the tough lower-east side of New York City. By the age of 15 Leonard was boxing as a pro and he was phenomenally popular. The elegant but ruthless lightweight raised boxing to an art form and once said, 'The toughest fighter to fight is a stupid fighter. When you feint him, he doesn't even know you're doing it.'\n6. Archie Moore\nLight-heavyweight\n(1936-1963)\nThe Ol' Mongoose had more moves than a bagful of snakes and showed them off against a huge variety of opponents over 27 years. Moore was one of those fighters so good nobody wanted to touch him. When he did get his title shot, he was light-heavyweight champion from 1952 to 1962. Nobody knocked out more opponents: 141 in 229 fights. But he was not a vicious man, just very good at what he did. One of the true masters of boxing.\n7. Jack Johnson\nHeavyweight\n(1897-1938)\nThe big man from Galveston, Texas, endured all manner of insults and hounding by the white establishment to become the first black heavyweight champion. He was a remarkable man in many ways, a confidante of Rasputin, a lover of fine wine and poetry and the first boxer to leave behind the old centre-of-the-ring milling ways in favour of scientific boxing. (Forget James J Corbett, whose reputation was inflated by the hypsters of the day). Johnson would have been terrific in any era, from bareknuckle to today.\n8. Sugar Ray Leonard\nWelter/Light middle/Middle/Super middle/Light heavyweight\n(1977-1991; one comeback fight in 1997)\nThe second Sugar Ray never doubted how good he was, with justification. A startlingly skilled amateur, he carried his pure boxing style into the professional ranks against the finest collection of fighters between 10 and 11 stone in the history of the game: Roberto Duran, Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns.\nHagler fans (Manny Steward especially) will dispute it, but Leonard was the best of them. 'I want my fights to be seen as plays,' the former choirboy said once. He won world titles at five weights. What more can you say?\n9. Jack Dempsey\nHeavyweight\n(1914-1927)\nFew fighters had a better nickname than the Manassa Mauler. He fought like he lived: with total disregard for niceties. Dempsey might have been eaten live by the big, sophisticated heavyweights of the modern era, but in his day he was a powerhouse nobody could hold at bay.\nTyson cites Dempsey as his favourite fighter, 'an absolutely ferocious gentleman'. He would have beaten Rocky Marciano of the latter-day heavies around his size and might even have inconvienced Joe Frazier, who was about his size. A trailblazer.\n10. Henry Armstrong\nFeather/Light/Welterweight\n(1931-1945)\nHammering Hank, Homicide Hank - whatever you called him, Armstrong buzzed with energy that astounded onlookers and opponents. He remains the only fighter to hold world titles at three weights at the same time, a feat that boxing politics today would make impossible. From featherweight to welterweight, he must have thrown tens of thousands of punches in his 181 bouts, 101 of which finished early.\nJustifying his selection\nThis month's 10 were selected by The Observer's chief sports writer Kevin Mitchell. Here he explains his choices:\nJudging fighters across more than a century of gloved competition, encompassing a variety of styles and circumstances, is enough to bewilder the most cocksure pedant. Dominance of quality rivals is probably the key factor in any assessment. Then there is length of service, power, resilience and the quality that seems so obvious and so hard to define as well: class.\nLongevity, though, will be weighted in favour of the old performers, who, of necessity, boxed on for many years and bouts more than better-paid modern boxers. How, for instance, do you judge the relative merits of Jimmy Wilde, whose total appearances probably numbered well over 500, many of them against good fighters up to two stone heavier than himself, and Naseem Hamed, unbeaten but not even close to 40 fights and who has never fought anyone over nine stone?\nThere is a further complication: the misty-eyed factor. Old-time boxing writers are notorious for declaring their favourite boxers as 'peerless', 'the best I ever did see', and so on. This applies more to the bareknuckle boys, but it is a hard job divining schmaltz from cool judgment when looking at the achievements of the old fighters.\nStyles present an interesting dilemma. While Jack Johnson was probably the father of modern defensive boxing, the first to stand off and catch punches while countering at will, Joe Louis is the only one of the pre-war champions who wouldn't look that out of place in the modern era. His thunderous pecking resembles a slightly stiff Tommy Hearns - but would he have got near the bigger Johnson?\nI've gone for Ali in the top spot because not only did he rule against the finest collection of heavyweights there ever was, but his presence beyond the ropes was the most profound of any athlete in the history of sport. Let the argument begin.\n"}, {"score": 958.326, "uuid": "b06e5a9f-3ce2-58d0-a44a-a63ad527d22a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600wb-05-14566", "target_hostname": "www.mdjonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/16304960/article-%E2%80%98Smokin%E2%80%99-Joe%E2%80%99-facing-his-biggest-fight-yet", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "The Marietta Daily Journal - \u2018Smokin\u2019 <em>Joe</em>\u2019 facing his biggest fight yet", "snippet": "<em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>, right, <em>a</em> boxing icon <em>who</em> will forever be linked with <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> for their trio of legendary matches, has been placed in hospice care as he faces liver cancer.

Leslie Wolff said doctors have not yet told Frazier how long he has to live.\n\u201cWe have medical experts looking into the all the options that are out there,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cThere are very few. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to stop looking.\u201d\nWolff, who has been Frazier\u2019s manager for seven years, said the boxer had been in out and out of the hospital since early October and receiving hospice treatment the last week.\n\u201cWe appreciate every prayer we can get,\u201d Wolff said. \u201cI\u2019ve got everybody praying for him. We\u201cll just keep our fingers crossed and hope for a miracle.\u201d\nFrazier\u2019s illness was first reported by the New York Post, citing an unidentified. source.\nFrazier was the first man to beat Muhammad Ali, knocking him down and taking a decision in the so-called Fight of the Century in 1971. He would go on to lose two more fights to Ali, including the epic \u201cThrilla in Manila\u201d bout.\nFrazier was bitter for many years about the way Ali treated him then. More recently, he said he had forgiven Ali for repeatedly taunting him.\nSmokin\u2019 Joe was a small yet ferocious fighter who smothered his opponents with punches, including a devastating left hook he used to end many of his fights early. It was the left hook that dropped Ali in the 15th round of their \u201cFight of the Century\u201d at Madison Square Garden in 1971 to seal a win in a bout where each fighter earned an unheard of $2.5 million.\nWhile that fight is celebrated in boxing lore, Ali and Frazier put on an even better show in their third fight, held in a sweltering arena in Manila as part of Ali\u2019s world tour of fights in 1975. Nearly blinded by Ali\u2019s punches, Frazier still wanted to go out for the 15th round of the fight but was held back by trainer Eddie Futch in a bout Ali would later say was the closest thing to death he could imagine.\nFrazier won the heavyweight title in 1970 by stopping Jimmy Ellis in the fifth round of their fight at Madison Square Garden. He defended it successfully four times before George Foreman knocked him down six times in the first two rounds to take the title from him in 1973.\nFrazier would never be heavyweight champion again.\nIn recent years, Frazier had been doing regular autograph appearances, including one in Las Vegas the weekend of a Floyd Mayweather Jr. fight in September.\n\u201cI was very sad to hear the news. It\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d leading British promoter Frank Warren said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest fighters of his generation and one of the best heavyweights in history. It\u2019s a sad thing and I know everyone in boxing will be wishing him well.\u201d\n"}, {"score": 947.7227, "uuid": "29e6800f-8f86-5ca3-a2fd-b9bbc177d922", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1310wb-44-11986", "target_hostname": "www.retiredboxers.org", "target_uri": "http://www.retiredboxers.org/about.html", "page_rank": 1.3487325e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Welcome to Retired <em>Boxers</em> Foundation, Inc.", "snippet": "After working as <em>a</em> newspaper reporter and <em>a</em> radio personality in New York, Farley <em>was</em> hired by the ABC Television Network as <em>a</em> writer and spent four years working for ABC Sports, during which time he worked closely with Howard Cosell and many professional <em>boxers</em>, including <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "RBF'S NEWEST MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL ADVISORY BOARD:\nDR.

Shortly before the release of the boxing movie, Play it to the Bone, RBF Executive Director Jacquie Richardson wrote a proposal to Ron asking him to consider a way to link the premiere of Play it to the Bone with an event for the Retired Boxers Foundation. \u00a0 The star studded premiere was at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood.\u00a0 Unbeknownst to Alex, Ron Shelton had made arrangements for Jacquie to bring Alex to the premiere so that he could present a check for $50,000 to the Retired Boxers Foundation.\u00a0 The check would come to represent five years of basic operating costs.\u00a0 While Jacquie new of Ron's plan, Alex Ramos did not.\u00a0 Read the following press release to learn more:\nRetired Boxers Foundation Receives $50,000 Donation\nPress Release\nJanuary 14, 2000\nRetired Boxers Foundation Receives $50,000 Donation \"Play it to the Bone\" Director Ron Shelton, Shanghai\u2019d Films\nSIMI VALLEY, CA] At Hollywood\u2019s El Capitan Theater premier of the new boxing film, Play it to the Bone starring Antonio Banderas, Woody Harrelson, Lolita Davidovich and Lucy Liu, the movie\u2019s Director, Ron Shelton, announced that Shanghai\u2019d Films was donating $50,000 to the Retired Boxers Foundation. Just before the opening of the film, Director Ron Shelton introduced current boxing world champions, Fernando Vargas, Angel Manfredy, Johnny Tapia, Danny Romero and others, as well as past champions, Mando Ramos, Sugar Ray Leonard, Art Aragon - the original \"Golden Boy\", saving 1984 USBA Middleweight Champion, Alex Ramos, for last. \"Unlike normal Hollywood premieres, this one combined the traditional Hollywood opening along with the introduction of the warriors from the sport of boxing, making it a truly unique event,\" said Ron Shelton. \"It is truly gratifying to make this donation to help the Retired Boxers Foundation in their efforts to assist these great athletes, \" he continued. \"Hopefully, our donation will inspire others to help retired professional fighters, in the only sport for which there are no real pensions or retirement plans.\" Shelton is a great fan of the sport of boxing and has directed several sports related movies including Bull Durham, White Men Can\u2019t Jump and Field of Dreams. Shelton\u2019s announcement was a total surprise for Alex Ramos and overwhelmed the fighter, who was visibly stunned by the generosity of Shelton and Shanghai\u2019d films.\nAlex Ramos, known as the \"Bronx Bomber\" in a career that spanned twenty-two years and over 300 amateur and professional bouts, is the founder of the Retired Boxers Foundation, whose mission is to assist fighters in their transition from their professional boxing, to a dignified retirement. Ramos said, \"Unfortunately, too many fighters retire from their glorious days in the ring, to a humiliating retirement suffering from alcoholism, substance abuse, rage disorders, homelessness and even dementia pugilistica (the medical term for punch drunk).\" Ramos knows first hand, how perilous retirement from the sport can be, finding himself on the wrong side of the law and \"in the darkness\" of alcoholism and homelessness. In fact, he believes that God saved him so that he could do something about what many others have said for more than fifty years, including Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis, both of whom died penniless, buried by the State.\nRamos founded the Retired Boxers Foundation in 1995, incorporating as a nonprofit organization in 1995. For the past three years, he has worked seven days a week without a penny of compensation, to get the word out about the condition of many retired professional boxers. His vision is to make the RBF \"The Undisputed Champion for Dignity\" and prides himself on the fact that the RBF is an organization of \"fighters helping fighters.\" In 1998, Ramos met grant writer and fund developer, Jacquie Richardson, who has donated office space and her skills to get the Retired Boxers Foundation up and running. Richardson met Ramos at an opening of a boxing gym for which she had written a grant to get kids off the street and into gyms. \"Over the past year and one-half, I have found no mission more compelling than that of the Retired Boxers Foundation. I donate my time and energy to the RBF and Alex Ramos because it is such an honorable cause for which there is little support.\" Both Ramos and Richardson promote the RBF, seizing every opportunity to educate the public on the condition of retired professional fighters, but also to help them \"one-by one\" as Richardson says. \"We take Dignity Packs to the fighters who are homeless, including the very basics of 'dignity', including sox, underwear, sweat suit, toiletries, shoes or whatever they need,\" Said Ramos. Until this donation, the Retired Boxers Foundation has existed on less than $5,000 a year in donations, with all of the expenses and services provided by what Richardson and Ramos are able to earn and from fans who send $5 and $10 checks. The largest donation received by the RBF was a $1,000 donation from Dr. Van Buren Lemons, a cranial trauma specialist from Sacramento. \"Ron Shelton\u2019s donation will allow us to serve far more fighters, and ultimately, will be the catalyst for setting up a network of supportive services for fighters,\" Said Richardson on behalf of the RBF.\nJAMES CARVILLE\nAuthor and Political Consultant\nWhile most of you know James Carville as an author, host of CNN's Crossfire and of course, as a political consultant to President Bill Clinton, most of you do not know that James is a huge fan of boxing.\u00a0 He believes in our mission and is a huge asset to the RBF.\u00a0 Following is the first Crossfire transcript occuring after James was named to our Honorary Board:\nIn the Crossfire: on King sounds off on boxing\nFriday, December 6, 2002 Posted: 4:21 PM EST (2121 GMT)\nKing: \"If you cast your bread upon the water and you have faith, you'll get back cash. If you don't have faith, you'll get soggy bread.\"\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Boxing promoter Don King has represented boxing legends including Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson.\nKnown for his flamboyant style and showmanship, King stepped into the \"Crossfire\" ring Thursday with hosts James Carville and Tucker Carlson to discuss Tyson, Tonya Harding and the state of boxing today.\nCARLSON: Now tell me, James and I were just talking that we both like boxing.\nFirst of all, every one is down on Mike Tyson, you maybe more than most even. Why? And second, what happened to Mike Tyson who had so much problems?\nKING: Well, first of all, let me correct you. I'm not down on Mike Tyson. I think that Mike Tyson is down on himself. ... He chooses a path that's the wrong path to take.\nBut I think that he's a great fighter and a great human being. I love the guy and I'm sorry to see him go into such a state by listening to others.\nCARLSON: Really. Well, we have this quote from the Daily Record from June 5. Here's what you said about Mike Tyson. Doesn't sound like something you'd say about someone you love.\n\"Mike Tyson could be a poster boy for the Ku Klux Klan. He's the embodiment, he personifies so that he can be [in an] ad for them to say, `See that I told you,' and everyone laughs like it's funny.\"\nThat's pretty rough.\nKING: Well, that's pretty true. You must understand that Mike Tyson embodies what the Klan was trying to [say about African- Americans] -- that we are lazy and lethargic. That we can't rise to the occasion, and we all lie, cheat and steal. This is the stereotyped image that they had of African-Americans throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. And it lingers on today from the scars of slavery.\nAnd when he acts that way -- where he would insult women, bite off ears, do things that they said all along -- then ... it looks like what they're saying has some credibility. He could have been the poster boy for the Ku Klux Klan.\nCARVILLE: You know I'm a fight fan. I'm two things -- I'm a Roman Catholic and I'm a fight fan. And the day we get rid of Cardinal Law and Mike Tyson the better it's going to be for my church and my sport. So...\nKING: Here, here.\nCARVILLE: We're talking about several things. Colonel Bob Sheridan, who is the famous great boxing announcer, told me one of the things that people don't know, that you're a mathematical genius.\nKING: Well, he's very kind. But you know that he worked with Colonel Sheridan. You know I had that distinct honor and privilege. ...\nCARVILLE: But how fast can you calculate numbers? I'm told that you're the best there is. Is that true?\nKING: Well, he's being very kind.\nCARVILLE: Other people have told me that.\nKING: He's being very kind. You know, I try to do the best I can with what I have to work with. ...\nCARVILLE: I serve on the board of the Retired Boxers Association with Alex Ramos and we love boxing. But we know it causes severe damage to people. You know that and I know that. The retired boxers have a tough go.\nWould you be willing to lead [something where] all the boxing promoters take a small percentage of the gross and put it aside to help these retired fighters who have severe neurological problems? A lot of them of them are lovely people but uneducated. Is there something that you and I and other people can do to help these old fighters that have been forgotten by everybody?\nKING: Well, I certainly would be an advocate of that, but I'd like to also say I'd like to be an advocate for helping all of the underprivileged: the poor, the downtrodden and denied. It don't have to be boxers. It's those in this country that are suffering.\nNow in addition to that, let us help the aging. Let us help the homeless. Let us help the jobless. Let us help them all. So those of us who are fortunate enough, let us contribute and work for those who are less fortunate.\nCARLSON: Outstanding. I'm just personally interested. How much do you think you've made over the years promoting fighting?\nKING: Oh, I don't know. You know, if you can count your money, you ain't got none.\nAnd so you don't put it in money. You understand what I mean? You put in terms of what good have you done.\nCARLSON: That's interesting.\nKING: ... and what you've done in America.\nIf you cast your bread upon the water and you have faith, you'll get back cash. If you don't have faith, you'll get soggy bread.\nCARLSON: OK, thank you, reverend. Well, tell me this, you essentially implied that Mike Tyson has become a freak show, biting people's ears and stuff. For a freak show, you really can't beat Tonya Harding as a boxer.\nDo you think that's good for the sport?\nKING: Well, I didn't say those words. Now you have a very sophisticated knack of taking semantics and taking them over the cliff, so to speak.\nCARLSON: Well, I appreciate that.\nKING: Well, you know I applaud you for that. I think Tonya Harding is a wonderful American. I mean, she went astray but wouldn't the Lord Jesus say if one sheep is astray from the flock, would [he] not bring it back into the fold?\nCARLSON: Bring it back into the ring.\nKING: To the flock, you know what I mean.\nCARLSON: Should she be in the ring?\nKING: Listen, ladies are boxing and they're doing very well at it. So you've got a lot of ladies that are really terrific. And you can't discriminate against the ladies. They've got a right -- that's what freedom is. Freedom is choice. And to have the choice to do whatever you want to do and you respect that right.\nCARVILLE: Pound for pound, who is the best fighter in the world today?\nKING: Roy Jones. Roy Jones is what I call a superman. He is so superior to all of his colleagues and in his weight category, that when people begin to think that he was a coward and that he would fight nobody ... he represented us [the United States] in Korea in the Olympics.\nBILL FARLEY\nBill Farley, (Former) Vice President, Marketing Events, Playboy Enterprises, Inc.; Night Writer/Author and Consultant\nBill Farley has been a long time fan of boxing, and the Playboy Mansion\nhas been the site of many a gathering to watch and to televise the fights.\nBO DEREK , another one of the Retired Boxers Foundation Honorary Board Members, remembers her mother dropping her off at the Mansion to watch the boxing matches with the rich and famous.\nBill Farley\u2019s father boxed in the service, and later wrote frequently\nabout the sport for several New York City newspapers.\u00a0 Bill himself\nboxed in college as a part of an athletic career that included football,\ntrack and field and record-setting performances as a competitive swimmer.\nBill Farley grew up in New York and attended schools in New York City and Connecticut before entering Cornell University, from\nwhich he received his bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Economics.\u00a0 After working as a newspaper reporter and a radio personality\nin New York, Farley was hired by the ABC Television Network as a writer and spent four years working for ABC Sports, during which\ntime he worked closely with Howard Cosell and many professional boxers, including Muhammad Ali.\nHe moved to Los Angeles for ABC in the mid-70s, leaving the company to form his own marketing firm.\u00a0 He returned to ABC in 1984\nto serve as Manager of Information for the International Broadcast Center of the Summer Olympic Games.\nIn 1985, Farley was hired as a communications executive by Playboy Enterprises, Inc.

Shortly before the release of the boxing movie, Play it to the Bone, RBF Executive Director Jacquie Richardson wrote a proposal to Ron asking him to consider a way to link the premiere of Play it to the Bone with an event for the Retired Boxers Foundation. \u00a0 The star studded premiere was at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood.\u00a0 Unbeknownst to Alex, Ron Shelton had made arrangements for Jacquie to bring Alex to the premiere so that he could present a check for $50,000 to the Retired Boxers Foundation.\u00a0 The check would come to represent five years of basic operating costs.\u00a0 While Jacquie new of Ron's plan, Alex Ramos did not.\u00a0 Read the following press release to learn more:\nRetired Boxers Foundation Receives $50,000 Donation\nPress Release\nJanuary 14, 2000\nRetired Boxers Foundation Receives $50,000 Donation \"Play it to the Bone\" Director Ron Shelton, Shanghai\u2019d Films\nSIMI VALLEY, CA] At Hollywood\u2019s El Capitan Theater premier of the new boxing film, Play it to the Bone starring Antonio Banderas, Woody Harrelson, Lolita Davidovich and Lucy Liu, the movie\u2019s Director, Ron Shelton, announced that Shanghai\u2019d Films was donating $50,000 to the Retired Boxers Foundation. Just before the opening of the film, Director Ron Shelton introduced current boxing world champions, Fernando Vargas, Angel Manfredy, Johnny Tapia, Danny Romero and others, as well as past champions, Mando Ramos, Sugar Ray Leonard, Art Aragon - the original \"Golden Boy\", saving 1984 USBA Middleweight Champion, Alex Ramos, for last. \"Unlike normal Hollywood premieres, this one combined the traditional Hollywood opening along with the introduction of the warriors from the sport of boxing, making it a truly unique event,\" said Ron Shelton. \"It is truly gratifying to make this donation to help the Retired Boxers Foundation in their efforts to assist these great athletes, \" he continued. \"Hopefully, our donation will inspire others to help retired professional fighters, in the only sport for which there are no real pensions or retirement plans.\" Shelton is a great fan of the sport of boxing and has directed several sports related movies including Bull Durham, White Men Can\u2019t Jump and Field of Dreams. Shelton\u2019s announcement was a total surprise for Alex Ramos and overwhelmed the fighter, who was visibly stunned by the generosity of Shelton and Shanghai\u2019d films.\nAlex Ramos, known as the \"Bronx Bomber\" in a career that spanned twenty-two years and over 300 amateur and professional bouts, is the founder of the Retired Boxers Foundation, whose mission is to assist fighters in their transition from their professional boxing, to a dignified retirement. Ramos said, \"Unfortunately, too many fighters retire from their glorious days in the ring, to a humiliating retirement suffering from alcoholism, substance abuse, rage disorders, homelessness and even dementia pugilistica (the medical term for punch drunk).\" Ramos knows first hand, how perilous retirement from the sport can be, finding himself on the wrong side of the law and \"in the darkness\" of alcoholism and homelessness. In fact, he believes that God saved him so that he could do something about what many others have said for more than fifty years, including Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis, both of whom died penniless, buried by the State.\nRamos founded the Retired Boxers Foundation in 1995, incorporating as a nonprofit organization in 1995. For the past three years, he has worked seven days a week without a penny of compensation, to get the word out about the condition of many retired professional boxers. His vision is to make the RBF \"The Undisputed Champion for Dignity\" and prides himself on the fact that the RBF is an organization of \"fighters helping fighters.\" In 1998, Ramos met grant writer and fund developer, Jacquie Richardson, who has donated office space and her skills to get the Retired Boxers Foundation up and running. Richardson met Ramos at an opening of a boxing gym for which she had written a grant to get kids off the street and into gyms. \"Over the past year and one-half, I have found no mission more compelling than that of the Retired Boxers Foundation. I donate my time and energy to the RBF and Alex Ramos because it is such an honorable cause for which there is little support.\" Both Ramos and Richardson promote the RBF, seizing every opportunity to educate the public on the condition of retired professional fighters, but also to help them \"one-by one\" as Richardson says. \"We take Dignity Packs to the fighters who are homeless, including the very basics of 'dignity', including sox, underwear, sweat suit, toiletries, shoes or whatever they need,\" Said Ramos. Until this donation, the Retired Boxers Foundation has existed on less than $5,000 a year in donations, with all of the expenses and services provided by what Richardson and Ramos are able to earn and from fans who send $5 and $10 checks. The largest donation received by the RBF was a $1,000 donation from Dr. Van Buren Lemons, a cranial trauma specialist from Sacramento. \"Ron Shelton\u2019s donation will allow us to serve far more fighters, and ultimately, will be the catalyst for setting up a network of supportive services for fighters,\" Said Richardson on behalf of the RBF.\nJAMES CARVILLE\nAuthor and Political Consultant\nWhile most of you know James Carville as an author, host of CNN's Crossfire and of course, as a political consultant to President Bill Clinton, most of you do not know that James is a huge fan of boxing.\u00a0 He believes in our mission and is a huge asset to the RBF.\u00a0 Following is the first Crossfire transcript occuring after James was named to our Honorary Board:\nIn the Crossfire: on King sounds off on boxing\nFriday, December 6, 2002 Posted: 4:21 PM EST (2121 GMT)\nKing: \"If you cast your bread upon the water and you have faith, you'll get back cash. If you don't have faith, you'll get soggy bread.\"\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Boxing promoter Don King has represented boxing legends including Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson.\nKnown for his flamboyant style and showmanship, King stepped into the \"Crossfire\" ring Thursday with hosts James Carville and Tucker Carlson to discuss Tyson, Tonya Harding and the state of boxing today.\nCARLSON: Now tell me, James and I were just talking that we both like boxing.\nFirst of all, every one is down on Mike Tyson, you maybe more than most even. Why? And second, what happened to Mike Tyson who had so much problems?\nKING: Well, first of all, let me correct you. I'm not down on Mike Tyson. I think that Mike Tyson is down on himself. ... He chooses a path that's the wrong path to take.\nBut I think that he's a great fighter and a great human being. I love the guy and I'm sorry to see him go into such a state by listening to others.\nCARLSON: Really. Well, we have this quote from the Daily Record from June 5. Here's what you said about Mike Tyson. Doesn't sound like something you'd say about someone you love.\n\"Mike Tyson could be a poster boy for the Ku Klux Klan. He's the embodiment, he personifies so that he can be [in an] ad for them to say, `See that I told you,' and everyone laughs like it's funny.\"\nThat's pretty rough.\nKING: Well, that's pretty true. You must understand that Mike Tyson embodies what the Klan was trying to [say about African- Americans] -- that we are lazy and lethargic. That we can't rise to the occasion, and we all lie, cheat and steal. This is the stereotyped image that they had of African-Americans throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. And it lingers on today from the scars of slavery.\nAnd when he acts that way -- where he would insult women, bite off ears, do things that they said all along -- then ... it looks like what they're saying has some credibility. He could have been the poster boy for the Ku Klux Klan.\nCARVILLE: You know I'm a fight fan. I'm two things -- I'm a Roman Catholic and I'm a fight fan. And the day we get rid of Cardinal Law and Mike Tyson the better it's going to be for my church and my sport. So...\nKING: Here, here.\nCARVILLE: We're talking about several things. Colonel Bob Sheridan, who is the famous great boxing announcer, told me one of the things that people don't know, that you're a mathematical genius.\nKING: Well, he's very kind. But you know that he worked with Colonel Sheridan. You know I had that distinct honor and privilege. ...\nCARVILLE: But how fast can you calculate numbers? I'm told that you're the best there is. Is that true?\nKING: Well, he's being very kind.\nCARVILLE: Other people have told me that.\nKING: He's being very kind. You know, I try to do the best I can with what I have to work with. ...\nCARVILLE: I serve on the board of the Retired Boxers Association with Alex Ramos and we love boxing. But we know it causes severe damage to people. You know that and I know that. The retired boxers have a tough go.\nWould you be willing to lead [something where] all the boxing promoters take a small percentage of the gross and put it aside to help these retired fighters who have severe neurological problems? A lot of them of them are lovely people but uneducated. Is there something that you and I and other people can do to help these old fighters that have been forgotten by everybody?\nKING: Well, I certainly would be an advocate of that, but I'd like to also say I'd like to be an advocate for helping all of the underprivileged: the poor, the downtrodden and denied. It don't have to be boxers. It's those in this country that are suffering.\nNow in addition to that, let us help the aging. Let us help the homeless. Let us help the jobless. Let us help them all. So those of us who are fortunate enough, let us contribute and work for those who are less fortunate.\nCARLSON: Outstanding. I'm just personally interested. How much do you think you've made over the years promoting fighting?\nKING: Oh, I don't know. You know, if you can count your money, you ain't got none.\nAnd so you don't put it in money. You understand what I mean? You put in terms of what good have you done.\nCARLSON: That's interesting.\nKING: ... and what you've done in America.\nIf you cast your bread upon the water and you have faith, you'll get back cash. If you don't have faith, you'll get soggy bread.\nCARLSON: OK, thank you, reverend. Well, tell me this, you essentially implied that Mike Tyson has become a freak show, biting people's ears and stuff. For a freak show, you really can't beat Tonya Harding as a boxer.\nDo you think that's good for the sport?\nKING: Well, I didn't say those words. Now you have a very sophisticated knack of taking semantics and taking them over the cliff, so to speak.\nCARLSON: Well, I appreciate that.\nKING: Well, you know I applaud you for that. I think Tonya Harding is a wonderful American. I mean, she went astray but wouldn't the Lord Jesus say if one sheep is astray from the flock, would [he] not bring it back into the fold?\nCARLSON: Bring it back into the ring.\nKING: To the flock, you know what I mean.\nCARLSON: Should she be in the ring?\nKING: Listen, ladies are boxing and they're doing very well at it. So you've got a lot of ladies that are really terrific. And you can't discriminate against the ladies. They've got a right -- that's what freedom is. Freedom is choice. And to have the choice to do whatever you want to do and you respect that right.\nCARVILLE: Pound for pound, who is the best fighter in the world today?\nKING: Roy Jones. Roy Jones is what I call a superman. He is so superior to all of his colleagues and in his weight category, that when people begin to think that he was a coward and that he would fight nobody ... he represented us [the United States] in Korea in the Olympics.\nBILL FARLEY\nBill Farley, (Former) Vice President, Marketing Events, Playboy Enterprises, Inc.; Night Writer/Author and Consultant\nBill Farley has been a long time fan of boxing, and the Playboy Mansion\nhas been the site of many a gathering to watch and to televise the fights.\nBO DEREK , another one of the Retired Boxers Foundation Honorary Board Members, remembers her mother dropping her off at the Mansion to watch the boxing matches with the rich and famous.\nBill Farley\u2019s father boxed in the service, and later wrote frequently\nabout the sport for several New York City newspapers.\u00a0 Bill himself\nboxed in college as a part of an athletic career that included football,\ntrack and field and record-setting performances as a competitive swimmer.\nBill Farley grew up in New York and attended schools in New York City and Connecticut before entering Cornell University, from\nwhich he received his bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Economics.\u00a0 After working as a newspaper reporter and a radio personality\nin New York, Farley was hired by the ABC Television Network as a writer and spent four years working for ABC Sports, during which\ntime he worked closely with Howard Cosell and many professional boxers, including Muhammad Ali.\nHe moved to Los Angeles for ABC in the mid-70s, leaving the company to form his own marketing firm.\u00a0 He returned to ABC in 1984\nto serve as Manager of Information for the International Broadcast Center of the Summer Olympic Games.\nIn 1985, Farley was hired as a communications executive by Playboy Enterprises, Inc.

Without a doubt it\u2019s subjective and a great case can be made for both. In fact, if we touch on who\u2019s the greatest athlete to ever grace the planet then we\u2019re touching a needle in the middle of a cotton field, we\u2019ll never find the answer. Recognize that there are other all-time great athletes that others will rank as their personal greatest athlete of all time. It just depends on who\u00a0you ask. Some baseball fans will point at Babe Ruth, soccer fans\u00a0will argue\u00a0Pele and Hockey fans have their man in Gretzky. Then you have the other athletes in those respective sports that other fans argue were even better.\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that the question; \u201cWho\u2019s the greatest athlete of all time?\u201d, is extremely subjective. Since it\u2019s subjective, it requires an open mind and ability to accept another person\u2019s opinion. But we can cut it all down to size by putting a different element to it. How about, who\u2019s the most iconic athlete of all time? Who had a bigger impact in the sports world? That breaks it down plenty and leaves us with the two iconic sports figures.\nI do believe an intelligent argument has to be presented by any side. You can go search websites to get rankings and just believe everything you read or you can do your own research, get the facts and present a great case. The reason I picked Ali and Jordan in this debate is\u00a0because these two were not only extremely successful in their respective sport, but because of the main-stream exposure and influence they had on not only their sport but the entire world.\nAli and Jordan did more than just become Champions in their respective sport, they shook the world and it\u2019s entire culture. I don\u2019t believe two athletes have ever meant so much to so many people across the globe. When you ask great athletes of today, more often than not, Ali or Jordan were their inspiration.\u00a0There are many who will place Jordan ahead of Ali.\u00a0\u00a0The Jordan\u00a0case is\u00a0just accepted by some sports fans without question and at times lacks\u00a0original thought. Just because a majority of people are saying something doesn\u2019t make it true. I like to take into account who\u2019s saying it and when they said it.\nRegardless of who you think should claim the number one spot, I believe in an individual developing his own opinion and making his own claim as long as they took a respectful open-minded approach.\nNow I present my case as to why Muhammad Ali is the single greatest Athlete that ever graced the planet. This opinion of mine, contrary to what some may believe, is not because I am a Boxing fan. I understand what the name of the website is and I surely understand Ali, to many, is not even considered the greatest Boxer to ever live.\nPersonally, I rank \u201cSugar\u201d Ray Robinson as the greatest fighter to ever live and while few outside\u00a0of boxing know this, he\u2019s the reason the term \u201cpound-for-pound\u201d was invented. Even at Heavyweight, I have a hard time putting Ali in the number one spot. Personally,\u00a0I think the \u201cBrown Bomber\u201d Joe Louis was a better overall fighter. Ali also lacked a major part of the Boxing game, which was the ability to work the body.\nSo if I feel this way, why don\u2019t I pick any of these other fighters over Ali as the greatest iconic athlete to ever live? Because I acknowledge that subjectivity is better debated when you\u2019re speaking of the same sport. I can better compare Ali to another fighter like Mike Tyson and compare their accomplishments since they\u2019re fighting, for the most part, under the same rules and regulations. While it\u2019s still subjective, it\u2019s thin ice\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0debating the ranking of\u00a0athletes from two different sports.\nDespite any criticism, Ali was good enough to be considered elite and was the greatest in his sport at one point.\u00a0 What he did outside of the ring\u00a0qualifies him to be\u00a0in this argument. Ali was a heavyweight with the speed of a middleweight and his jab\u00a0was and remains\u00a0among the best ever in boxing history, regardless of weight-class. Ali\u2019s footwork and style was revolutionary and many fighters wish they had his physical attributes. He shocked the world when he defeated Sonny Liston to win his first title and did it again when he defeated George Foreman to re-capture the crown a decade later. Like a true champion he came back to avenge his losses against Frazier and Norton. Ali\u00a0fighting an under-dog inspired the movie Rocky, his mouth moved faster than the speed of time and never did he\u00a0fail when a social issue came about. That\u2019s Ali, an entertainer at its finest\u00a0with a natural charisma I don\u2019t believe any other athlete can ever come close to touching.\nIconic: Ali over Liston\nHe also reigned at a time when Heavyweight Boxing had some of the best big-men athletes in the world. The majority of big men you see today in the NFL would have turned to boxing in Ali\u2019s time. That\u2019s right, if Ali was born in the 1980\u2032s, he would probably be on the field with helmet and pads today. There was a major size difference with the heavyweights of Ali\u2019s era as compared to those of the Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano era\u2019s.\u00a0Size aside, you can\u2019t ignore that\u00a0a\u00a0large portion of all-time great heavyweights\u00a0fought during Ali\u2019s era. Of course the Heavyweight division continued to produce great Heavyweights in the 80\u2032s and 90\u2032s, but slowly we could notice a decrease in talent and relevance of the Heavyweight division.\nHonestly, I can\u2019t help but think that the NFL hurt the Boxing Heavyweight scene. Despite the NFL\u2019s amazing success, there is no excuse, still, for the Heavyweights we\u2019re producing in America today.\nDespite Ali\u2019s accomplishments inside the ring, in the era\u00a0in which\u00a0he did it and his physical attributes as an all time great fighter; even I will admit that it\u2019s going to be tough to overcome what Michael Jordan did. One thing Jordan has in common with Ali is that they both participated in a golden-era of their respective sports.\nIconic: \u201cAir\u201d Jordan\nThe accomplishments Jordan had in basketball can\u2019t be ignored. Capturing Six straight Championships in six active years is unbelievable in any sport. Granted, Jordan had set backs early in his career and had a hard time getting to the Championship stage early in his career.\u00a0 However,\u00a0his numbers as an individual athlete during that time were astonishing.\u00a0\u00a0While I do\u00a0believe that he could have won a Championship, perhaps several,\u00a0without Scottie Pippen, I just\u00a0don\u2019t think he would have done it six times in eight years. We can\u2019t ignore\u00a0games where Jordan\u2019s teammates stepped up. But what matters is that\u00a0he did win those Championships as the leader and the two years he was absent from that same team, they failed to win the Championship in back-to-back years.\nIf Ali had a bad night, he lost a fight. If Jordan had a bad night there are six other games in a series. Granted, basketball is a team sport and Jordan needed good players around him just like any other great\u00a0basketball player. The only reason this argument is brought up is because arguments with weak value, like Ali had five losses, will be brought up. If Ali was rusty when he returned from a three year lay-off\u00a0it effected his entire career, Jordan had multiple games to make up for any rust he had in his comeback year. It\u2019s all a matter of perspective.\nIf we go by only their achievements in their respective sports, they both had set-backs, they both bounced back from them, their ego didn\u2019t allow failure to be an option, they both won championships and they both stayed around way past their great years.\nThere is something else they have in common.\nFirst take Ali,\u00a0a three time world Champion. What gets lost in that argument is that he defended the title nine times in his first reign, went three years without\u00a0fighting due to legal problems then returned to regain the title again and defend that\u00a0title\u00a0ten\u00a0times. Put it in perspective, Ali sacrificed his prime years. We honestly didn\u2019t even see the best of Muhammad Ali. In late 1967 he was stripped of his title and re-captured the title in late 1974.\u00a0If he wasn\u2019t stripped, Ali had a shot at breaking Joe Louis\u2019 title defense record.\nNow take Jordan, a six time NBA Champion and multiple MVP titles in the regular season and Finals. He also retired after his third straight Championship. While he wasn\u2019t stripped like Ali, he still left during two prime years of his career.\u00a0 Jordan could have won eight straight NBA titles, and been MVP in every single one of those championship series\u2019. He would have added more to his all-time stats and perhaps, at least one more\u00a0regular season MVP award.\nIt\u2019s amazing to think that both seemed unstoppable, were in their prime and could have accomplished even more.\nEric Anaya\n"}, {"score": 869.1726, "uuid": "e3faac61-b535-5eb4-8718-19c20feb812e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1211wb-92-13507", "target_hostname": "www.worldboxingnews.net", "target_uri": "http://www.worldboxingnews.net/2012/02/derek-frazier-my-family-didnt-let-me.html", "page_rank": 1.3556068e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "WBN - World Boxing News: Derek <em>Frazier</em>: My family didn&#x27;t let me say goodbye", "snippet": "Wolff, <em>who</em> no longer works with the <em>Frazier</em> family as of last month, rued all the infighting. &quot;This <em>was</em> <em>a</em> hell of <em>a</em> gentleman.

Hickey newsworks.org\nDerek with his famous father (Picture courtesy of Derek Frazier)\nFrom the back windows of Derek Dennis Frazier's condo just beyond Cheltenham Avenue, it's easy to see the church where thousands of people turned out to celebrate the life of his fallen father, \"Smokin'\" Joe, who died Nov. 7, 2011.\nDerek, 20, often catches himself looking at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church. Sometimes he thinks his father is looking back.\n\"My father was always there for me, always there when I needed him to be. He surrounded himself with happiness,\" Derek said.\nBut when Derek looks back upon the months last year when liver cancer ate away at the former heavyweight champion of the world, finally taking him away from family, friends and fans across the globe, what he sees is anger.\nHidden away\nThis is because, in a series of recent interviews with NewsWorks, Derek \u2014 a sophomore at Rowan University in South Jersey who attended St. Francis Xavier in Fairmount as a youth \u2014 claimed family members and others hid from him the news that his father had taken ill.\nUnable to find out where Smokin' Joe was for the last two months of his life, he took to YouTube a day before his father's death with a video called \" Looking For My Father (Smokin Joe Frazier) .\"\nHe's angry with relatives for not telling him where Frazier was being treated, particularly since he claims that the boxing legend worried that he'd been poisoned. That's what Derek recalls about a September phone call that led to a doctor's visit at which the physician deemed Joe Frazier to be OK.\nOne of Joe's closest friends said he never heard him speak of poisoning suspicions. Speaking about those ailments in general, Anil Rusgti, Chief of Gastroenterology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said liver-related illnesses can be associated with brain dysfunction.\nDerek said he and his mother still don't know where Joe was while his son searched for him. (When asked Tuesday, Frazier's business manager readily shared the fact that he was at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.)\nWhat tears Frazier's youngest son up today is the fact that he never got to say goodbye.\n\"I love my brothers and sisters ... but as I got older and started listening to their conversations, I felt like I was getting pushed to the side,\" he said. His older brother Marvis, who was also close to his father, did not return an e-mail seeking comment this week.\nOngoing infighting\nThe object of much of Derek's derision is Les Wolff, Frazier's business manager of the past seven years, whom he claimed helped keep a son from seeing his father.\n\"Nothing that comes out of [Derek's] mouth is true,\" Wolff said. \"Joe had been misdiagnosed for months, at least six months. He was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 liver cancer on Oct. 6 and died on Nov. 7, so that tells you all you need to know.\"\nResponded Derek: \"Les is clearly upset that the truth has been exposed. ... He broke my father's heart by not allowing us to be together. Who are you going to believe: an agent or the son who just wants his story out there?\"\nTo be sure, there has been much Frazier family friction in the time since Joe's passing, with litigation surrounding his will, and letters requesting that Derek's mother, Sheri Gibson, return property to the estate. The legal issues are just starting to surface.\nWolff, who no longer works with the Frazier family as of last month, rued all the infighting.\n\"This was a hell of a gentleman. He deserved better,\" said Wolff, who continues to work to honor Frazier's legacy.\nOn that, Derek agreed.\n\"He was my rock, everything that a father should be for a son,\" he said during an interview he granted last week to address the \"lies\" of family togetherness. \"That people got in the way, purposefully, to make sure I couldn't see him in those final days, that's very messed up.\"\n"}, {"score": 813.10504, "uuid": "937ef09b-29ef-5678-bbf1-49b35a8dfaa0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-27-20471", "target_hostname": "www.startribune.com", "target_uri": "http://www.startribune.com/sports/139653463.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "Column: <em>Ali</em> frozen by Parkinson&#x27;s, but tributes in Vegas show he&#x27;s still", "snippet": "They had come to honor The Greatest, though whether <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> remembered <em>who</em> they were <em>or</em> knew what it <em>was</em> all about <em>was</em> <em>a</em> matter of speculation that on this night would go unanswered.", "explanation": null, "document": "+ add a comment\nadd a comment\nLAS VEGAS - They gathered in the bowels of the arena where most of the great fights of the last two decades have taken place, old men now all sharing one shining moment from years gone by. They had come to honor The Greatest, though whether Muhammad Ali remembered who they were or knew what it was all about was a matter of speculation that on this night would go unanswered.\nSome, like Chuck Wepner, couldn't stop talking about the night they won their own personal lottery \u2014 a spot across the ring from Ali. Nothing new there, since the Bayonne Bleeder has been talking about it to anyone else who will listen almost every day since.\nOthers, like Leon Spinks, weren't able to talk much at all.\n\"Leon Spinks is here and he needs help,\" Wepner said. \"There are a lot of fighters who need help.\"\nThis was a night supposed to bring that help, both to fighters like Spinks and those fighting today. Millions would be raised in Ali's name for the Cleveland Clinic's new Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in downtown Las Vegas, where researchers are already busy trying to unlock the puzzles of damage to the human brain.\nA seat for dinner and the show at the MGM Grand hotel started at $1,500. UFC owner Lorenzo Fertitta spent $1.1 million in an auction for the gloves Ali used against Floyd Patterson in 1965 in the first heavyweight title fight in a city that would become synonymous with boxing. President Barack Obama wished Ali well in a video greeting, and Stevie Wonder was among those on hand to sing birthday wishes to the former heavyweight champion, who turned 70 last month.\nAt the center of it all was an elderly man, mute and his face seemingly frozen as he sat at a table with his wife, Lonnie, and several other family members. Whether boxing caused Ali's Parkinson's is the subject of debate, but it was clear on this night the disease he has fought for three decades has taken a terrible toll on him.\nHe was once a magnificent man with a sculptured body and a mouth that wouldn't stay shut. He's still magnificent in the way that his very presence envelopes and engulfs an arena like it did Saturday night, hushing high-rollers and the elite of this gambling town in a way no other man could \u2014 and all without saying a word.\nThey used to trot Joe Louis out like this in his final years, too, a heavyweight great and an American hero reduced to drooling in his wheelchair at ringside. With Ali, though, it seems different in a way if only because you get the feeling that the man who was the ultimate people person still enjoys being around people.\n\"I'm not sad about him, just proud to know him,\" George Foreman said. \"When people ask me if he's the greatest boxer ever, it's an insult. He was the greatest everything, just a great man.\"\nForeman lost the biggest fight of his life to Ali, the stunner in Zaire that cost him the heavyweight title and for a long time derailed his life. He held a grudge for a long time, too, but it's hard to be mad at Muhammad Ali no matter what he did to you in the ring.\nAli was back in a makeshift ring on Sunday in the lobby of the MGM, where hundreds of people crowded around to share birthday cake and sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him. This was a chance for his people \u2014 the common people \u2014 to get close enough to take a photo and the buzz in the crowd grew as Ali arrived in a golf cart and was helped up a few steps into the ring.\nThe expression on his face never changed as his former business manager, Gene Kilroy, called Ali's family and friends up in the ring to be with him. Moon walker Buzz Aldrin and singer Kris Kristofferson were among the notables, while Spinks and Evander Holyfield also joined him. Lonnie took off his sunglasses and gave him a fork, and everyone watched as Ali concentrated as hard on the task at hand \u2014 getting some of the chocolate cake in his mouth \u2014 as he ever had fighting Foreman in Africa.\nA few of his daughters hovered around, and grandbabies were put in his lap. Then, with Holyfield holding him by one arm and his wife by the other, Ali made a slow, trembling, walk around the ring, holding his right arm up waist high to salute the cheers from the crowd.\nDoctors say not many people survive 30 years of Parkinson's, a debilitating brain disease for which there is no cure. That Ali has lasted this long is, perhaps, a tribute to the great athleticism that served him so well in the ring. Still, the death of his trainer, Angelo Dundee, a few weeks ago and Joe Frazier a few months before that is a reminder that even The Greatest has a limited time on Earth.\nThat seemed to be on the mind of many bunched around the ring in the lobby, holding cell phones aloft in hopes of getting a picture they could show the people back home. The excitement of being so close to Ali was tempered by the reality of how he looked and the difficulty he had trying to get even one bite of frosting in his mouth.\nStill they cheered his victory lap around the ring, and then watched as Holyfield and others helped him down the few steps toward the golf cart. Before he got in, though, he spotted a little girl in her mother's arms and made a playful little move toward her like he had done thousands of times over to babies throughout his career.\nAs if we needed a reminder that he is indeed The Greatest.\n____\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

Instead, it is the launching point of an ambitious journey. In his foreword, the author declares his intention: \u201cto recover Muhammad Ali from mythology and Howard Cosell from caricature.\u201d Besides, he adds, \u201cThe real stories are better.\u201d\nKindred has firsthand knowledge of many of those stories through the long relationships he enjoyed (and sometimes suffered) with both men. He met Ali first, in 1966, just three years after graduating from Illinois Wesleyan. As a sports reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal, Ali\u2019s hometown newspaper, Kindred had an enviable number of one-on-ones with the heavyweight champion. Over time, their professional encounters mellowed into friendship. The book describes how the two would sometimes drive around the city with Kindred\u2019s 4-year-old son sitting in Ali\u2019s lap. It\u2019s no surprise that whenever Kindred\u2019s editors heard Ali was in town, it was Kindred they told to \u201cgo find him.\u201d\nOf course, that alone does not explain what Kindred was doing that memorable afternoon in Las Vegas. Then again, \u201cexplaining\u201d Ali\u2019s antics might be a fool\u2019s errand. Better to stick to the facts, as Kindred does in describing the bed-sharing incident, which happened in 1973. The reporter entered Ali\u2019s hotel suite, full of \u201changers-on, sycophants, con artists, sportswriters, and other reprobates.\u201d From the bedroom, the boxer shouted, \u201cMy man. Louisville, come in here.\u201d Lifting a corner of his bed sheet, he told Kindred, \u201cC\u2019mon, get in.\u201d\nIn their time together, Kindred had heard Ali spout his bragging couplets and spellbinding soliloquies \u201cin shower stalls and toilets, in funeral homes, log cabins, mosques ...\u201d So this latest request didn\u2019t seem that unusual. With the sheet pulled over their heads, Kindred got his interview, feeling as he did so \u201cmore like schoolboys on a sleepover hiding their mischief.\u201d Ali, in all his naked glory, ended their conversation with his trademark bravado: \u201cTell the people in Louisville this will be nooo contest because I am the greatest of alllllll times,\u201d and the slightly dazed writer headed out to file his exclusive.\nIn many similarly unguarded moments, Kindred observed Cosell \u2014 who, in the 1960s and \u201970s was TV\u2019s boldest, brashest sports broadcaster. The two men had known each other from 1984 until Cosell\u2019s death in 1995 at the age of 77, with Kindred cast mostly in the role of willing listener. During one encounter described in book, Kindred arrived early for breakfast at Cosell\u2019s Long Island home and caught a glimpse of the sportscaster, sans toupee, \u201cshuffling barefoot from the bedroom, skeletal in a white undershirt and white boxer briefs.\u201d Noticing Kindred, Cosell showed his surprising capacity for self-effacement as he struck a body-building pose and announced, \u201cA killing machine the likes of which few men have seen.\u201d\nIn his new book (above), Dave Kindred tells how the two men were instrumental in each other\u2019s rise to prominence.\n\u201cTwo Powerful Lives, One Fateful Friendship\u201d is the subtitle of Kindred\u2019s book. Though the friendship to which it refers is between Ali and Cosell, the term could apply as aptly to Kindred\u2019s own relationship with the pair \u2026 perhaps more so. True, Ali and Cosell were inextricable \u2014 and not just through their pre- and post-fight broadcast banter enjoyed by millions. As the great-grandson of slaves and the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants, both fought Goliath odds. Both lorded over their domains with unrelenting energy and skill. Pride led both men to episodes of self-destruction, and both felt the Promethean pull of age and illness drag them from their soaring orbits. But could two such unquenchable egomaniacs ever really bond as friends?\nIt\u2019s one of Sound and Fury\u2019s many open questions. Kindred strives for vivid accuracy upon which readers draw their own conclusions. As Oscar-winning screenwriter and boxing doyen Budd Schulberg wrote in his New York Times review, among the book\u2019s virtues is the \u201cdead-on honesty that has characterized Kindred\u2019s career, from The Courier-Journal to The Washington Post to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and his many sports books.\u201d\nHoward Cosell was one who saw \u201cthe beauty and cultural significance of sports,\u201d writes Kindred in Sound and Fury, which was published in February by Free Press. The same can be said of Kindred\u2019s floating, stinging prose, as demonstrated in excerpts from his book that follow. \u2014 Tim Obermiller\nThe young Ali (known in his early boxing days by his birth name, Cassius Clay) was quickly renowned for his cockiness and photogenic features. But it was his brilliant, unorthodox fighting style \u2014 described below by Kindred \u2013 that was his true bread and butter.\nHe was a genius. It wasn\u2019t his hands or his feet. Light-heavyweight champion Jose Torres said, \u201cWatch his brains.\u201d\nThe frustration of chasing him, the inability to touch that unprotected chin, the confusion caused by his snake-lick jab snapping against your face \u2014 it wore a guy out mentally as much as physically. There also was Clay\u2019s conversation during the fight. Is that all you got, sucker? The hell of it was, during all this Clay also would rain fists on you. Sports Illustrated did a photo shoot to capture his hand speed. From sixteen and a half inches away, his jab landed against a balsa board in 0.19 seconds. The magazine reported, \u201cHis fist actually covered the distance in four/one-hundredths of a second, about the period of a blink of the eye.\u201d Editors timed a six-punch combination in 2.15 seconds. Two jabs, a hook, a right to the body, another hook, a finishing right. Imagine. Count one thousand one, one thousand two. You have been hit six times by a two-hundred-pound professional fighter who never misses.\nCosell gave up a lucrative law practice to become a sports broadcaster, telling friends, \u201cI can\u2019t help but go to the top. All the rest are sons of the wild jackass.\u201d Like Ali, Cosell had the talent to back up his bravado. Kindred writes:\nCosell\u2019s voice moved New York quickly. He hammered consonants and followed the harshness with abrupt slides into hushed tones, each movement a signal of his feeling for the subject at hand. He could read a note to the milkman in a way that let listeners know his great and abiding disappointment in being left two quarts rather than three. Cosell\u2019s staccato rhythms were so eccentric as to demand a listener\u2019s attention, but to say the voice succeeded because it cut through the clutter of broadcasting\u2019s neutral sounds was insufficient to define it. The critic Ron Powers would call it \u201cone of television\u2019s most inspired creations \u2014 a voice that was virtually a finished character in and of itself.\u201d If the voice, directed to a few people in a room, was too much \u2014 its melodrama shamefully obvious \u2014 it became, on the air, a perfect answer to the hyperbolic demands of television.\nAs a converted Muslim and conscientious objector, Ali refused to serve in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War and was banned from boxing in America for four years. When the Supreme Court finally ordered a lift on this ban in 1970, his greatest years as an athlete were behind him. Even so, he returned to the ring to reclaim his heavyweight crown in 1971 at Madison Square Garden against an undefeated Joe Frazier. Kindred watched the \u201cFight of the Century\u201d from first-row ringside.\nEarly, Ali moved easily. He shouted to Frazier, \u201cDon\u2019t you know I\u2019m God?\u201d Frazier seemed clumsy, taking jabs and crosses as punishment for his gracelessness. Ali separated his words with punches: \u201cDon\u2019t . . . you . . . know . . . I\u2019m . . . God?\u201d Three rounds, four rounds, five, Ali did what Ali always did \u2014 what Frazier\u2019s strategist, Eddie Futch, knew he would do. Go to the ropes and wait. Ali might con the innocents with his minute dancing and two resting. Even as he leaned back to keep his head out of Frazier\u2019s reach, he looked down into the first press row at ringside, popping open his eyes. He bellowed, \u201cNo contest! NOOOO contest!\u201d\nA fight master long removed from innocence, Eddie Futch considered Ali\u2019s charade an invitation. He told Frazier, \u201cWhen he goes to the ropes, you go to his body with both hands.\u201d Frazier thundered against Ali\u2019s ribs, waistline, hips. Six rounds, eight rounds, Ali playing when he needed to fight, Ali putting a glove against Frazier\u2019s forehead, as if holding off a child, Ali against the ropes and pitty-pattying taps against the aggressor\u2019s noggin, Ali allowing Frazier in. \u201cCome on, man,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that the best you got?\u201d After the eighth, Ali\u2019s trainer Angelo Dundee scolded him: \u201cStop playing. Do you want to blow this fight? Do you want to blow everything?\u201d\nAfter ten rounds, Frazier\u2019s face had become a grotesquerie of hematomas bulging from his jawline, cheekbones, and brow, squeezing his eyes to slits, his swollen lips pulled back from a mouthpiece once white and now red. Ali no longer danced even the minute of earlier rounds; now he moved on the same plane as Frazier. Whatever notes I made were hieroglyphics of anxiety, unreadable. All along I had felt something shameful at being thrilled by these bloody pieces of commercial brutality, but I rationalized it and justified it as part of the human condition. Will Durant\u2019s The Life of Greece reported prizefighting fifteen centuries before Christ on the island of Crete where \u201cheavyweights, coddled with helmets, cheekpieces, and long padded gloves, fight till one falls exhausted to the ground and the other stands above him in the conscious grandeur of victory.\u201d\nThirty-four centuries later, not on vases but five feet from me, Ali stood in with Frazier, the beauty of it terrible.\nThe year they met, 1966, Kindred (left) had his notebook at the ready as Ali warmed up for an exhibition in his hometown, Louisville. (Photo courtesy of C. Thomas Hardin)\nIn the early 1980s, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s syndrome, which was later determined to have been caused by head blows he received in the boxing ring. An overconfident and undertrained Ali had been battered in later fights, such as his loss to Leon Spinks in early 1978. He rededicated himself to his craft and returned to face Spinks later that year, with Cosell and Kindred bearing witness to what was to be the Greatest\u2019s last great fight.\nAli\u2019s victory over Spinks by decision on September 15, 1978, was the product of guile and will. Across fifteen rounds \u2014 Ali\u2019s fifth straight fifteen-round fight in twenty-three months \u2014 the sixty-three thousand witnesses in New Orleans\u2019 Superdome saw Ali use every old fighter\u2019s trick, a heel of his glove in an eye, a forearm scraped across a nose, the bigger man clutching, holding, leaning so heavily on the champion as to double him over. Only occasionally did Ali throw a blurred combination of the kind he once threw in multiples of five.\nYet emotion charged Cosell\u2019s broadcast. At age thirty-six, Ali again had done what seemed unlikely, and for a moment or two in each round he did what only he ever could do. Cosell was sixty years old himself, no longer a phenomenon but still the best in his profession as Ali was the best in his, though fading and glorious. They had come a great distance together to stand in the twilight. Even as the fighters threw punches in the final minute, Cosell did what only he could ever do. His voice tremulous, he paid tribute to Ali by quoting Bob Dylan lyrics:\nMay your hands always be busy,\nMay your feet always be swift,\nMay you have a strong foundation\nWhen the winds of changes shift.\nMay your heart always be joyful,\nMay your song always be sung,\nMay you stay forever young.\nAbout the author...\nA Career Turning Sports into Prose\nBegan at Illinois Wesleyan University\nWriter Dave Kindred in his element. (Photo by Bob Leverone/Sporting News)\nDave Kindred has been a newspaper and magazine columnist for 37 years. He has covered sports for the Washington Post and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and is the author of seven books.\nNow living in central Virginia, Kindred is a native of Atlanta, Ill. He worked his way through Illinois Wesleyan on a journalism scholarship provided by the Bloomington/Normal Daily Pantagraph and also readied for his future career as sports editor for The Argus. But it was his baseball coach, the late Jack Horenberger, who might have given the young writer the best single piece of advice he received during his college years. \u201cI can remember hearing this kind of high-pitched voice from the dugout shouting, \u2018Kindred, move around! You\u2019re killing the grass!\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo I\u2019ve tried to do that all these years.\u201d\nKindred\u2019s first move, upon graduation in 1963, was to join The Pantagraph sports department full-time. He still counts his most demanding journalistic duty being the operation of the sports desk on Tuesday and Friday nights during the Central Illinois high school basketball season.\nKindred received the Red Smith Award for lifetime achievement in sports journalism in 1991. In 1998, he was given Illinois Wesleyan\u2019s Distinguished Alumnus Award, which he regards as \u201cone of the highlights of my life.\u201d He suspects the timing of the award might have had something to do with his Sporting News column about the Titans winning the 1997 Division III National Basketball Championship. \u201cI wrote that IWU is \u2018what Harvard would be if Harvard had cornfields at the edge of town.\u2019\u201d The comment especially pleased the late Minor Myers, who was Illinois Wesleyan\u2019s president at the time. Said Kindred, \u201cI can still hear Minor Myers roaring: \u2018The question is not whether you want a statue, but how big do you want it?\u2019\u201d\nIllinois Wesleyan University 1312 Park Street Bloomington, IL 61701 (309) 556-1000\n"}, {"score": 809.50934, "uuid": "64ca58e2-92f7-5d8f-bdb2-3592fc58d535", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600wb-16-24488", "target_hostname": "www.lasvegassun.com", "target_uri": "http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/feb/13/las-vegas-host-greatest-birthday-party-all-time-gr/", "page_rank": 2.92645e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Vegas gala to celebrate <em>Muhammad</em> Ali&#x27;s 70th birthday, benefit Ruvo Center", "snippet": "\u201cI can\u2019t think of <em>a</em> <em>better</em> birthday present for <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> than giving him <em>a</em> chance to contribute to the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and the other diseases treated at the Lou Ruvo Center, and to help find <em>a</em> cure,\u201d said Las Vegas entertainment guru Bernie Yuman, <em>who</em> has managed <em>Ali</em> and is", "explanation": null, "document": "Launch slideshow \u00bb\nThe world\u2019s eyes will be on Muhammad Ali this Saturday in Las Vegas, as they\u2019ve been so many times in so many places over so many years.\nHe\u2019s Ali, after all.

Saturday\u2019s Power of Love Gala , to be held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena , is a benefit for the clinic and its fundraising organization, Keep Memory Alive , as well as the Muhammad Ali Center , a cultural and education complex in Ali\u2019s hometown of Louisville, Ky.\n\u201cMuhammad Ali deserves a party of parties, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to get,\u201d said Larry Ruvo, chairman of Keep Memory Alive and founder of the clinic that is named for his father.\nTo have Ali and his wife, Lonnie \u2014 with world media in tow \u2014 celebrate his birthday in conjunction with the Power of Love Gala is nothing short of a \u201cgiant stamp of approval\u201d for the brain center, Ruvo said.\nThe link between Ali and the Ruvo Center isn\u2019t direct. Although he has battled Parkinson\u2019s disease for several years, Ali doesn\u2019t receive services from the clinic.\nYet there\u2019s an unmistakably strong connection between the former boxing champ and the clinic.\nKristen Peterson\nLarry Ruvo, left, leads a tour of the nearly complete Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health for architect Frank Gehry, seated, in April 2010.\nThe center is committed to treating illnesses like the one that has virtually silenced Ali and left him with severe physical limitations. It provides care for patients with dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis.\nIn another tie to Ali and the boxing world, the studies being conducted by Ruvo Center researchers include a long-term examination of boxers and mixed martial artists to gauge the effects of fighting on the brain .\nIn addition, researchers are developing a mouthpiece that can gauge the severity of blows to the head and transmit the data electronically, taking the guesswork out of whether an individual has suffered trauma severe enough to cause a concussion.\nHad the center been doing such work during Ali\u2019s career, who knows how his life might have been changed?\nAs is, Ali is helping the center, its patients and their family members \u2014 not to mention individuals who may need its services \u2014 through his participation in the gala.\nThe man who once playfully boasted, \u201cI\u2019m so mean, I make medicine sick,\u201d is once again showing he\u2019s really anything but menacing \u2014 displaying the compassion and courage that have helped make him one of the world\u2019s most beloved figures.\n\u201cOne day when we were together it hit me ... the courage he has showed as an older man,\u201d former President Bill Clinton said in a recent video tribute to Ali. \u201cStruggling with Parkinson\u2019s, he has shown a different kind of, and perhaps a greater, courage than he showed as a young man risking having his body, face and brain battered by the shock of boxing.\u201d\nAli\u2019s presence guarantees a healthy boost in the Ruvo Center\u2019s funding and provides immeasurable publicity value. Tickets for the annual gala, one of Las Vegas\u2019 premier philanthropic events \u2014 start at $1,500, but there is sure to be more money changing hands. Several significant items \u2014 including the gloves Ali used in a title defense against Floyd Patterson in Las Vegas in 1965 \u2014 will be auctioned.\nABC will present a tape-delayed broadcast of the event at 2 p.m. Las Vegas time on Feb. 25. ESPN2 will re-air the broadcast that evening.\nThe guest list includes Stevie Wonder, Samuel L. Jackson, Larry King, Snoop Dogg, Cee Lo Green, Jim Brown, Anthony Hopkins, Lenny Kravitz, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Thomas Hearns, Ken Norton and Roberto Duran.\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a better birthday present for Muhammad Ali than giving him a chance to contribute to the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and the other diseases treated at the Lou Ruvo Center, and to help find a cure,\u201d said Las Vegas entertainment guru Bernie Yuman, who has managed Ali and is a longtime member of his inner circle.\nThe party brings Ali back to a place where he fought seven times, including three defenses of his heavyweight title. Those fights were against Patterson, Jerry Quarry in 1972 and Ron Lyle in 1975.\nIn addition, there were moments outside the ring in Las Vegas that helped create Ali\u2019s legacy. One was his 1970s meeting with Elvis Presley, which led to the King presenting The Greatest a bejeweled robe.\nAnother came when Ali traveled to Las Vegas in the 1960s to mock Sonny Liston, who was training in the city.\nListon was losing at a craps table, and Ali \u2014 then Cassius Clay \u2014 shouted: \u201cLook at the big, ugly bear; he can\u2019t even shoot craps. He can\u2019t do nothing right.\u201d\nBut for all of Ali\u2019s history with Vegas, boxing purists might find the city an unusual place to celebrate his legacy. His greatest fights \u2014 the trilogy against Joe Frazier, his stunning defeat of George Foreman to reclaim the heavyweight title in 1974 and his two early title fights against Liston \u2014 were in other cities. What\u2019s more, two of Ali\u2019s Las Vegas fights were low points near the end of his career \u2014 losses in 1978 to Leon Spinks and 1981 to Larry Holmes \u2014 when his once-legendary agility and skills had deteriorated.\nBut that was then. Today, Ali is waging a different kind of fight, and he\u2019s found a passionate ally in the Ruvo Center. If Larry Ruvo has his way, Ali\u2019s appearance will be the forerunner of even more ambitious fundraising efforts.\n\u201cI want this to be an annual telethon,\u201d Ruvo said. \u201cI want this to be the greatest telethon in the world.\u201d\nOddly enough, one of the challenges Ruvo faces in making the center a household name is raising its stature in its own backyard.\nRuvo Center administrators worry that the clinic, which enjoys a worldwide reputation for excellence, is considered too elite to be accessible to local patients. The center is working with all major health insurance companies to provide access, they say, and 80 percent of its 4,500 patients to date have been from Nevada.\nDr. Stanley B. Prusiner, Nobel Prize-winning neurologist and biochemist, will become chair of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health's Scientific Advisory Board, the clinic announced Friday, Feb. 3, 2012.\n\u201cIf anybody thinks they can\u2019t get in, all they\u2019ve got to do is call,\u201d Ruvo said. \u201cIt\u2019s for people who have a disease. Period. It\u2019s not a private hospital.\u201d\nStill, the clinic is tapping top-shelf medical and scientific experts. Just this month, the clinic announced that Nobel Prize recipient Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner would become chairman of its Scientific Advisory Board . Prusiner is director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases and professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco.\nThis may explain why experts are drawn to the Ruvo Center: It is conducting more Alzheimer\u2019s clinical trials than any other institution in the country. Of the clinic\u2019s 20 trials, 16 are related to Alzheimer\u2019s.\nThe reason for focusing on Alzheimer\u2019s is clear: One in eight people age 65 and older will develop Alzheimer\u2019s, and the ratio increases to nearly one in two over 85. At the current rate, someone in the United States develops the disease every 70 seconds.\nStatistics like those are part of the reason Ruvo spearheaded the center, but another part is personal. His father died of Alzheimer\u2019s in 1994, two years after Ruvo discovered that there were no viable medical options for him in Nevada.\nAfter his difficult experience dealing with his father\u2019s disease, Ruvo began working to create the center . Workers broke ground on the institution\u2019s iconic, Frank Gehry-designed headquarters and medical clinic in 2006, and the center began treating patients in 2009.\nNow, with a world champion serving as headliner for this year\u2019s gala, Ruvo is ready for a world-class celebration.\n\u201cHe is The Greatest of All Time,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is going to be the greatest birthday party of all time.\u201d\n"}, {"score": 791.0912, "uuid": "71a1f103-a574-5a0d-84d9-28dbfcd326ce", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0000wb-54-03244", "target_hostname": "esyhf.org", "target_uri": "http://esyhf.org/pressbox/archive/142.asp", "page_rank": 1.1750036e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "::: Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation ::: <em>Who</em> We Are :: Press Releases", "snippet": ". \u0094 I got <em>a</em> helmet coming with <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> on one side and Bernard Hopkins on the other side.

Tussled with a whale!\" Ali said. \"I murdered a rock! Injured a brick! I'm so mean, I make medicine sick!\"\nApparently medicine made George Foreman sick, too.\nAt least that's the tale Foreman tells in his new book, which he is busily promoting this week as only he can do. This is, after all, someone who resurrected a career with a smile and fat jokes and sold more than 100 million grills with his name on them.\nAnd what better way to sell a book than bring one of the most famous names and one of the most famous fights into it. Makes the whole religion angle a bit easier to promote.\nThe problem is, it's not a new story. Foreman said similar things about a strange bottle of water just after the fight, and repeated them a few years later.\nAnd while Foreman says he's bringing it up again as a cautionary tale of hate and forgiveness, it smacks of sour grapes, directed at a man who helped him become heavyweight champion and is no longer around to defend himself.\n\"Forgiveness is there, but the story must be told,\" Foreman said Tuesday between book signings. \"There's more to it than meets the eye. I was mad later on. I could have been dead over there.\"\nIn the book \"God in My Corner,\" Foreman says that just before the fight, his manager handed him a bottle of water that had a medicinal taste to it. He became tired, he said, part of the reason Ali stopped him in the eighth round in a huge upset.\nI don't doubt Foreman believes something was wrong with his water, but you have to wonder why he's rehashing the story after so many years. If Foreman truly believes in forgiveness -- and no one questions his evangelical credentials after 30 years in the pulpit -- it seems odd that he wants to dredge it up again.\nBut he is, and he repeated the story of the water Dick Sadler gave him just before the fateful fight in the early morning hours in Zaire.\n\"We got the ceremonial water like we had in all our fights but it tasted like medicine to me,\" Foreman said. \"He looked me in the eye and said `Same water as always.' I took another sip and it still tasted bad. He just looked at me and said `Same water as always.' \"\nBoxer and manager split after the fight and Sadler died a few years ago, so his side of the story will never be told. Foreman doesn't say why his own manager would want to slip him a mickey.\nOthers said Foreman blamed Sadler for not getting him out of Zaire when he was cut in training, though President Mobutu was the one who made sure of that. There was too much money invested in the fight, and the people wanted to see Ali win.\n\"You've got to remember in those days he suspected everything,\" said Bill Caplan, who was Foreman's publicist at the time and remains a close friend. \"He thought the bitter tasting water was something someone had slipped in there. Years later he abandoned that, and I\"m a little bit surprised he brought it back.\"\nIf anything, Foreman has taken pains to praise Ali and says the loss ended up being the best thing that ever happened to him.\nHe found God after a near death experience in a 1977 fight with Jimmy Young and left boxing to become a minister, only to return to become the oldest heavyweight champion ever and America's favorite pitchman.\n\"I lost and I'm happy about it,\" Foreman said. \"Ali didn't need any medicine in the water to whip me. If I would have fought him 20 times with organic water he would have beaten me. He had the style to beat me.\"\nForeman was in trouble long before he entered the ring in Zaire. Ali was so popular among the locals that there was fear for Foreman's safety, and Foreman hadn't gone beyond the second round in his last eight fights.\nAli's business manager at the time, Gene Kilroy, said he and Ali watched tapes of Foreman before leaving for Africa and Ali saw him hanging on the top rope after knocking down Joe Frazier for the sixth time in the second round.\nThe rope-a-dope had yet to be invented, but something clicked in Ali's mind.\n\"Ali said, `I got him, he's got no stamina,\"' said Kilroy, now an executive with the Luxor hotel-casino in Las Vegas. \"He said, `Wait until he hears round four, round five, round six. George, you're out of gas and there are no gas stations out there.\"\nAli turned out to be prophetic, but not before Foreman had some moments of his own. If he was drugged, he looked pretty good early as he threw punch after punch at Ali. But he was punching himself out, and Ali turned the fight around late in the fifth round.\nBy the eighth round, Foreman's punches were meaningless and Ali used a flurry to knock him down and end the fight.\nForeman was banged up and bitter, and increasingly suspicious.\n\"I left Africa sore, went to Paris, went to Hawaii and then finally a man who looked after me said, `Now you look a little better,' \" Foreman said. \"Nobody believed me. Everyone laughed at me.\"\nThey weren't laughing when Foreman came back to become champion again. He hopes they're not laughing now.\n\"If you think I need to sell books you're wrong. I need to tell my story,\" Foreman said. \"The story is trust in God and forgive your enemies.\"\nAn even better story might be to forgive and forget.\nDr. Duran Duran\n"}], [{"score": 664.8657, "uuid": "07309634-183b-5829-a59a-3e2c5c41390f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-29-27850", "target_hostname": "www.edgeofsports.com", "target_uri": "http://www.edgeofsports.com/2011-11-10-662/index.html", "page_rank": 1.1810621e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Edge of Sports", "snippet": "<em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>, however <em>was</em> <em>a</em> truly great <em>boxer</em> and his refusal to fight in Vietnam where, &#x27;no Vietnamese ever called him n---,&#x27; <em>was</em> the correct decision to make.", "explanation": null, "document": "\"Smokin'\" Joe Frazier: The Death of the Disrespected\nBy Dave Zirin\nPrint this article\nThe first African American man to address the South Carolina state legislature after the Civil War wasn't Booker T. Washington or W.E.B. DuBois or Dr. Martin Luther King. It was heavyweight boxing champion \"Smokin'\" Joe Frazier who died this week at the age of 67. Frazier had just emerged victorious from his epic 1971 encounter against Muhammad Ali, in a fight that was cast as a culture war between the \"draft dodger\" Ali and the \"establishment hero\" Joe Frazier. If you were against the war in Vietnam, you rooted yourself hoarse for Ali. If you wanted the hippies, freaks and Black Power disciples humbled, you wanted \"Smokin'\" Joe.\nIn the wake of Frazier's death much has been written that he didn't deserve this tag: that he was labelled unfairly as a \"sellout\" by Ali and suffered for it. It is certainly true that Ali and Frazier were friends before their conflicts consumed Frazier with fury. It's also true that when Ali was forced into exile for resisting the draft, it was Joe Frazier who gave Ali money when many others turned their backs on \"The Greatest.\"\nAli said to Frazier, \"You just keep whupping those guys in the ring, and I'll keep fighting Uncle Sam and one day we'll make a lot of money together\"\nBut by 1971, both men were playing their roles. Ali taunted Frazier for being an Uncle Tom. Frazier also, and less remembered, taunted Ali for being against the war. He said that because he loved America, he'd proudly fight in Vietnam. He also repeatedly insulted Ali by calling him by his birthname, \"Clay\"\nAnd then, after he whipped Ali in the \"fight of the century,\" Joe Frazier accepted that invitation to speak at the South Carolina legislature: a conquering hero.\nOne of 13 children born in abject poverty in Beaufort, South Carolina, it's certainly understandable why he would accept the historic invite. But that doesn't make it any less of a full embrace of his role as the \"good one\" in the Ali-Frazier melodrama.\nSpeaking in a room with a confederate flag backdrop in front of a chamber with only three black representatives among its 170 elected officials, Frazier's message was gentle. He told jokes to great laughter about growing up in Beaufort and saying, \"Yes bawse and no bawse\" no matter the question.\nHe also said earnestly, \"We must save our people, and when I say 'our people' I mean white and black. We need to quit thinking about who drives the fanciest car or who is my little daughter going to play with, who is she going to sit next to in school. We don't have time for that.\" Then his own 10 year old daughter, to great cheer stood and said, \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. My daddy is the one who whipped Muhammad Ali.\"\nWhile the chamber and national media swooned, Ali seethed. The beaten champ said Frazier was \"consorting with the enemy.\" He had, in Ali's eyes, become a hero to the very people who as a young man in South Carolina wouldn't have even spit in his direction.\nAs the 1970s labored on, and the movements that thrived at the decade's inception began to wither, Ali's taunts toward Frazier became less political and more indefensible. When their epic 1975 fight in Manila loomed, Ali repeatedly called Frazier \"a gorilla.\" He spoke verses on how \"black and ugly\" Frazier was. For Ali, it was part of the show. For Frazier, it was more scarring than any punch in Ali's arsenal.\nYears later, Ali commented, \"I said a lot of things in the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight\"\nJoe Frazier didn't want to hear apologies. In retirement he would express joy at any role he may have played in Ali's Parkinson's disease. When Ali famously lit the torch at the 1996 Olympics, Frazier expressed grief that he couldn't be there to shove Ali into the fires.\nThe roots of his anger were deeper than just anything uttered by Muhammad Ali. Joe Frazier was the 1964 Olympic Gold Medalist. He never dodged a draft. He never boasted of throwing his medal in the Ohio River. He never said \"God damn America.\" Yet there was Ali lighting the torch while he was stuck at home. The establishment had chosen the anti-hero, and Joe Frazier was cast merely as the foil and the fool.\nIt boggled Frazier's mind when his adopted home of Philadelphia put up a statue of a boxer, and chose the very fictional\u2014and very white\u2014Rocky Balboa as their favorite fighting son. He did things \"the right way\" and Philly gave him the back of their hand like they were just another \"bawse\" in Beaufort.\nThis shouldn't have been Joe Frazier's fate: the convenient hero of everyone who wanted to see Ali punished for his politics. This shouldn't have been Joe Frazier's fate: internalizing and nursing every barb from \"Gaseous Cassius\" instead of letting it roll off his back. This shouldn't have been Joe Frazier's fate: rejected by the same establishment so quick to embrace him when it suited their needs. \"Smokin' Joe\" deserved so much better.\n[Dave Zirin is the author of \u201cThe John Carlos Story\u201d (Haymarket) and just made the new documentary \u201cNot Just a Game.\u201d Receive his column every week by emailing dave@edgeofsports.com .

(AP) - Joe Louis,\n\"the Brown Bomber\" whose 12-year\nreign as world heavyweight champion\nplaced him among history's greatest\nfighters and made him a symbol for gen-\nerations, died Sunday of cardiac arrest.\nHe was 66.\n_ \"He was in a cardiac arrest state when\nhe arrived,\" said nursing supervisor\nShirley Brown at Desert Springs Hospi-\ntal. \"They did everything they could to\nrevive him.\" She said Louis died at 10:05\na.m., PST, less than 12 hours after he\nhad sat at ringside at the Caesar Palace\nSports Pavilion to watch Larry Holmes\nretain his heavyweight crown.\n_ \"He had been ill for quite some time.\nHe had been hospitalized before. He had\nhad a stroke and different things,\" said\nBrown, adding that Louis' wife, Martha,\nand some immediate family members\nwere with him when he died.\n_ He lost only three of 71 fights, the first\nto Max Schmeling of Germany in 1936.\nSchmeling was an unwilling pawn of\nAdolph Hitler, held aloft as a symbol of\nso-called Aryan supremacy. When they\nfought again two years later - Louis\nwas the champion by then - it was more\nthan two men in the ring. It was America\nvs. Germany, Democracy vs. Nazism.\nLouis won on a murderous first-round\nknockout.\n_ On Sunday, when the tributes began\npouring in, one of them came from\nSchmeling, now 75 and living in Ham-\nburg, West Germany.\n_ \"Joe was a boxing genius,\" he said.\n\"In his time he was a symbol for the\nblack American people.\"\n_ Jersey Joe Walcott, who lost two title\nfights to Louis, tearfully called him \"a\ngreat American. He was a great cham-\npion in every walk of life. The man has\nbeen a great inspiration in so many ways\nto so many people.\"\n_ Called the Brown Bomber for his\npunch and string of knockout victories,\nLouis was just 23 when he won the title\nby knocking out 31-year-old James J.\nBraddock in the eighth round at Chicago\nin 1937.\n_ He had a 35-1 record, including 31\nknockouts at the time he first won the\nheavyweight title.\n_ In 17 years as a boxer - almost four\nyears of that time was spent in the army\nduring World War II - he earned nearly\n$5 million. He had little to show for it\nwhen he was through and was in con-\nstant difficulty with the government on\nincome taxes.\n_ When he retired for the first time, on\nMarch 1, 1949, he told reporters: \"I'm\nglad to retire. It takes a load off my\nmind. I could see that I couldn't fight\nany more and rather than lose the title\nin the ring, I decided to quit.\"\n_ But 27 months later he came out of\nretirement with a pressing need for\nmoney, an urge to fight again and confi-\ndence that he could beat reigning cham-\npion Ezzard Charles.\n_ He met Charles on Sept. 27, 1950, and\nwas soundly beaten in a 15-round bout.\n_ \"I'll never fight again,\" he said\nthrough swollen lips.\n_ But just two months later he was back\nin action with a string of victories.\n_ His career in the ring finally came\nto an end when he met Rocky Marciano\nin Oct. 26, 1951, at the age of 37. Mar-\nciano 28, knocked him out in the eighth\nround.\n_ In 71 fights as a professional after he\ngraduated from the Golden Gloves in\nDetroit, the Brown Bomber scored 54\nknockouts in posting a 68-3 record.\n_ Louis confined to a wheelchair since\nheart surgery in 1977, attended the Larry\nHolmes-Trevor Berbick heavyweight\ntitle fight Saturday night at Ceasars Pa-\nlace. On April 6 he had been feted by\nsome 1,500 people at a salute in his honor\nattended by former boxing greats.\n_ Louis defended his title a record 25\ntimes before retiring.\n_ But he was a legend long before then.\nHis deadly punching combinations and\nability to finish off an opponent who was\nin trouble made him one of the great\nfighters.\neven after he left the ring following an\nunseccessful comeback in 1950-51.\nMoney and psychiatric problems failed\nto dim the glory he achieved as a fighter.\nNot even a fling at being a proessional\nwrestler could detract from his accom-\nplishments. He was always the champ,\nand a man of pride.\n_ When asked why he turned to the car-\nnival world of professional wrestling - a\nmove dictated by massive tax indebted-\nness - Louis remarked: \"It's an honest\nliving and it's better than stealing.\"\n_ Louis fought a record 26 championship\nbouts, 25 of them defenses, without a\nloss and many of those fights will be dis-\ncussed as long as people talk about box-\ning, especially his rematch with Max\nSchmeling and his first fight with Billy\nConn.\n_ Louis was born Joseph Louis Barrow\nMay 13, 1914, in Lafayette, Ala. He was\nraised in a Detroit ghetto and became a\nprofessional fighter in 1934. His career\nwas spectacular from the start.\n_ He won his first 28 fights before being\nknocked out by Schmeling, a former\nworld heavyweight champion from Ger-\nmany, in the 12th round June 19, 1936,\nbut he didn't forget the loss to Schmeling.\nAfter knocking out Braddock in Chicago\nin 1937, Louis said: \"I won't be champion\nuntil I get that Schmeling.\"\n_ On June 22, 1938, in Yankee Stadium,\nLouis got him.\n_ \"He tried a right to my head but it\nwent around me,\" Louis said, recalling\nthe fight many years later. \"I left-jabbed\nhim mean and brought his guard low.\nI drove a right to the jaw with all I had.\nI put my body into it. It threw him on\nthe ropes and his knees buckled. I caught\nhim coming off the ropes and ripped\none into his belly. He screamed like a\nstuck pig.\"\n_ Schmeling crashed to the floor three\ntimes before referee Arthur Donovan\nstopped it at 2:04 of the first round. The\nUnited States rejoiced. Adolf Hitler was\nin power at the time.\n_ \"Billy Conn was the best man I ever\nfought,\" Louis once said.\n_ His first fight with the Pittsburgh\nIrishman, the formwer light heavyweight\nchampion, took place in New York's\nPolo Grounds June 18, 1941. It has be-\nJoe Louis dead at 66\ncame almost mythical.\n_ Conn, whose weight was given as 173\npounds but who reportedly weighed only\n169, put on a dazzling display and was\nahead after 12 rounds. Some ringsiders\nfelt Conn would have won by just lasting\nthe 15 rounds, but got cocky and got caught.\n_ Actually, Louis could have won a deci-\nsion by winning the last three rounds.\nBut he made it academic by knocking\nout Conn in the 13th round.\n_ Louis, who knocked out Conn in the\neighth round in 1946 in their much bally-\nhooed but disappointing rematch, came\nto the end of the championship trail in\n1948.\n_ The previous year he was knocked\ndown twice by Jersey Joe Walcott but\nwon a controversial decision. A year\nlater, they met again and Louis knocked\nout Walcott in the 11th round.\n_ Then, at the age of 34, Louis an-\nnounced the first of three retirements.\n_ But a little more than two years later,\nhe challenged Charles and lost.\n_ Then just two months later, Louis was\nback in the ring, and he showed flashes\nof his old form, registering eight straight\nvictories, three by knockouts.\n_ Then came the Marciano fight and the\nend.\n_ The aging ex-champion held off the\npressing Marciano for the first couple of\nrounds. But it was clear to those at ring-\nside that sooner or later Marciano would\ncorner Louis.\n_ In the eighth round, Marciano knocked\ndown Louis with a left hook. Louis got up\nslowly and painfully on unsteady legs at\nthe count of eight. Marciano bulled louis\nagainst the ropes, measured him and\nknocked him on to the ring apron with a\npowerful right. The referee didn't even\nbother to count.\n_ _ \"I feel bad about beating Joe,\" said\nMarciano, later to become champion, re-\ntire undefeated, then die at the age of 41\nin a plane crash in Iowa. \"Joe was my\nidol. I am sure I was very lucky that I\ndidn't get to fight Joe 10 years earlier.\"\n_ Louis went on to fight several exhibi-\ntions, but Louis, the fighter, was dead.\nLouis, the legend, will never die.\n_ In his boxing career, he earned purses\nworth $4,606,721 - and this was in the\ndays before the Fort Knox paydays\nbegun with the first Muhammad Ali-Joe\nFrazier fight in 1971. He wound up owing\nthe tax man more than $1 million.\n_ Louis was an admitted high-liver. He\nenjoyed himself out of the ring. He made\nuncollectable loans to friends and mere\nacquaintances. For years Uncle sam\nhad Louis reeling over his tax problems\nbefore finally letting him off the hook.\n_ Louis had other problems - two di-\nvorces, an annulled marriage, and phy-\nsical and emotional conditions.\n"}, {"score": 645.07166, "uuid": "b424b9cc-82d4-529e-936f-fa1729951daa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0611wb-01-21101", "target_hostname": "www.powermag.com", "target_uri": "http://www.powermag.com/issues/departments/speaking_of_power/Rope-a-dope-politics_1454.html", "page_rank": 1.1742989e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "Rope-<em>a</em>-dope politics :: POWER Magazine :: Page 1 of 2", "snippet": "<em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>, arguably the best <em>boxer</em> <em>who</em> ever stepped into the squared circle, <em>was</em> pitted against then-World Champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, 34 years ago this month.", "explanation": null, "document": "Pages: 1 2\nRepublican presidential candidate John McCain made reference to the word \u201cfight\u201d 25 times during his September 4 nomination acceptance speech. While watching McCain\u2019s histrionics, my mind wandered back to another historic fight\u2014the \u201cRumble in the Jungle.\u201d Muhammad Ali, arguably the best boxer who ever stepped into the squared circle, was pitted against then-World Champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, 34 years ago this month. It occurred to me that there are interesting parallels linking that famous brawl and the daily tussles of the presidential contenders.\nThe consensus among handicappers was that younger and undefeated Foreman packed the harder punch and entered the ring a heavy favorite. Foreman, the 1968 Olympic heavyweight gold medal winner, was the world\u2019s top-ranked boxer after knocking out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in two rounds in his two previous bouts. Ali, an inch taller and four pounds lighter, was unorthodox is his footwork but was thought to be a much better technical fighter, with cat-like reflexes and a two-inch-longer reach.\nDeadly deception\nAli took control of the pace of the fight from the bell starting the second round. Ali either leaned into his opponent, neutralizing Foreman from throwing a big right hand, or was covered up and resting against the ropes. By round five, Foreman was exhausted from throwing ineffective punches and from Ali\u2019s lightning-quick jabs to his head and personal taunts like, \u201cGeorge, is that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Foreman was completely flummoxed by an opponent who was unwilling to stand toe-to-toe and be pounded into submission.\nBy round eight Foreman\u2019s punches had lost much of their effectiveness, and all his hope rested with a lucky knockout blow that never found its target. An outwardly fresh and smiling Ali then left the safety of the ropes and started a vicious counter-attack with jabs and hooks, most landing squarely on Foreman\u2019s head. Sensing victory, Ali hit Foreman with a left hook that teed up his head for a straight right hand that instantly turned out his lights. \u201cThe Greatest\u201d regained the World Championship, and Foreman, frustrated, retired from boxing at age 28 to become a minister, siring five boys all named George, and making millions selling his Lean Green Grilling Machine on TV.\nMost boxing experts consider the Rumble in the Jungle the best example of an older fighter using guile and a superior strategy to literally beat a younger and stronger fighter at his own game. Foreman later called the fight \u201ca sweaty old boxing match which I lost,\u201d but it was the start of much more than that.\n"}, {"score": 599.68176, "uuid": "2f1628d1-e02d-558e-940d-716b636442e6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0610wb-09-02193", "target_hostname": "www.thenassauguardian.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thenassauguardian.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16418:joes-aggressive-style-created-rich-legacy&catid=41:sports&Itemid=50", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "The Nassau Guardian", "snippet": "Johnson <em>was</em> <em>a</em> smaller, slower version of <em>Ali</em> (<em>or</em> <em>a</em> younger Cassius Clay as <em>was</em> his birth name).

When the all-time best boxers are ranked however, he never makes the top 10.\u00a0 There are boxers who pound-for-pound were not better than Smokin\u2019 Joe but they were able to dominate their eras for longer periods and thus they are rated higher.\nThe reality of the situation is that Frazier was a victim of fate. He just happened to have a glowing career that was overlapped by Ali. That was an obstacle that none of the other excellent heavyweights through the years would have been able to overcome.\nYou can name them. If Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano would have had the misfortunate to compete at the height of their careers during the time of Muhammad Ali, they also would have certainly been upstaged.\nTo Frazier\u2019s credit, in my view, he fared better against Ali than any of the other great heavyweights would have. It\u2019s simple.\u00a0 Styles make for great matchups. Frazier with his buzz saw, perpetual motion manner in the ring, proved to be quite difficult for Ali in two of their three contests.\nJohnson was a smaller, slower version of Ali (or a younger Cassius Clay as was his birth name). He would have done no better against Ali than Floyd Patterson did in two humiliating defeats.\nJack Dempsey, who was before Johnson\u2019s time, was even smaller and would have been no match to the self-proclaimed and later widely acknowledged \u201cgreatest of all time.\u201d\nJoe Louis shuffled trying to get in range for his devastating left hook.\u00a0 Ali would have at the very least, frustrated him tremendously. Louis in my view would have done no better than Sonny Liston who was stopped by Clay in 1964 for the first of three title victories.\nMarciano had the heavy punches. Nevertheless, he would not have been a good match for Ali. Marciano was ferocious, but he bled easily. Ali would have had an easy time with Marciano, I feel.\nJoe Frazier was another story.\nThe famous statement made by Ali after the final of their trilogy was: \u201cIt was like death.\nAlthough he was unfortunate to emerge as a fistic force in the same era as Ali, the three fights they had, defined Frazier like nothing else that happened in 37 ring battles (32-4-1). Foreman had a style that Frazier, being much smaller, could not solve.\nWith Ali, it was different.\nPerhaps because of the critical remarks Ali sent Frazier\u2019s way often, the man from Philadelphia was always sky high when they faced each other. He bore up under the jeers from his nemesis better than any other before him. In the ring, he matched Ali over 41 rounds almost blow for blow.\nIn their first bout on March 8, 1971, he captured the so-called \u2018Fight of the Century\u2019 when he knocked Ali down on the way to a 15-round decision. They met again in 1974 over 12 rounds and Ali was the clear winner.\nThen came the \u201cThriller in Manila \u201c of 1975. Arguably, a better battle than the one in 1971 was contested by the two warriors. In the end, after a serious of bruising rounds, trainer Eddie Futch became concerned about the terrific pounding Frazier took in the 13th and particularly 14th round. He didn\u2019t allow his fighter to go out for the 15th.\nAli later paid Frazier an even better compliment than the \u201clike death\u2019 remark.\nHe said, with a sly smile, \u201che\u2019s the greatest fighter of all time, next to me.\u201d\nIf you take Ali out of his life, Frazier would be ranked right up there with Johnson, Dempsey, Louis and Marciano, definitely.\nHere in The Bahamas Frazier always had his share of fans who pulled mightily for him, especially when he and Ali met. There are those like my friends Ira Smith and Bert Perry who actually saw Frazier as the better fighter.\nHe wasn\u2019t better by any stretch of the imagination. However, he was surely one of the true greats.\nI close with this tribute from Paul Bevans.\n\u201cI was fortunate to call him friend. I met this legend in the late 1980s while working with the Bahamas Tourist Office in Philadelphia. He referred to me as \u201cBahamas.\u201d\n\u201cJoe did a lot to rehabilitate the young men in the Philadelphia-South Jersey area. Many of these men came straight out of prison to Joe, seeking shelter at Frazier\u2019s Broad Street Gym. Joe had room and board set up there. He and his son Marvis would teach them the sport of boxing and he would also secure jobs for them.\n\u201cI have very fond memories of this great boxing legend like the weekend, he invited me to Scranton to attend a fight with him and Marvis. It was the debut of one of his young fighters. The following morning, at breakfast, he introduced me to another legend, Jose Torres (former world light heavyweight champion). One Sunday morning he called me: \u2018Bahamas, you had breakfast yet? Come over. \u2018\n\u201cWhen I got there he asked: \u2018How many boiled eggs you want?\u2019 He was a comedian. We had boiled eggs, wheat toast and tea. As I looked at all of his historic photos and memorabilia, I was amazed. Joe Frazier, even though he was a celebrity, was very humble. It was truly a favor (for me) to have access to such a sports legend. After hearing of his passing, I could only reminisce as I looked at the autographed boxing gloves and the personal photographs he had blessed me with, one with him training for the \u201cThriller In Manila.\u201d\n\u201dWhat a man!\u201d\nMay the soul of Smokin\u2019 Joe Frazier forever rest in peace.\n(To respond to this column, kindly contact Fred Sturrup at\nThis e-mail address is being protected from spambots.

When he died in 2006, Carlos and Smith were pallbearers at his funeral. Photograph: AP\nYou're probably not familiar with the name John Carlos. But you almost certainly know his image . It's 1968 at the Mexico City Olympics and the medals are being hung round the necks of Tommie Smith (USA, gold), Peter Norman (Australia, silver) and Carlos (USA, bronze). As the Star-Spangled Banner begins to play, Smith and Carlos, two black Americans wearing black gloves, raise their fists in the black power salute. It is a symbol of resistance and defiance, seared into 20th-century history, that Carlos feels he was put on Earth to perform.\n\"In life, there's the beginning and the end,\" he says. \"The beginning don't matter. The end don't matter. All that matters is what you do in between \u2013 whether you're prepared to do what it takes to make change. There has to be physical and material sacrifice. When all the dust settles and we're getting ready to play down for the ninth inning, the greatest reward is to know that you did your job when you were here on the planet.\"\nCarlos's beginning was, to say the least, eventful. Raised by two involved, working parents, he learned to hustle with his friends in Harlem and fight his way out of and into trouble. As a teenager, he used to chase Malcolm X down the street after his speeches and fire questions at him. Carlos always knew he was good at sports and originally wanted to be an Olympic swimmer, until his father broke it to him that the training facilities he needed were in private clubs for whites and the wealthy. He used to steal food from freight trains with his friends and then run with it into Harlem and hand it out to the poor. When the police gave chase, he was often the only one who never got caught. Running came so naturally, he never thought of it as a skill.\nThat single moment on the podium cost Carlos dear. More than four decades later, you'll find him at his desk in a spacious portable building behind the basketball courts at Palm Springs High School in California, where he works as a counsellor. Among the family photographs on the wall are the vaguest allusions to his moment in history. Pictures of Malcolm X and African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston , the pledge of allegiance, which American schoolkids must say to the flag every day, and a small poster saying Go For Gold Olympics.\nFor all its challenges, Carlos loves his job. \"Being a counsellor, you have to talk to the children as though you're talking to a thousand people,\" he says. \"Sometimes you say, 'I love you' and they say, 'I don't want your love' and you say, 'Well, it's out there, so you're going to have to deal with it.' And I learn a lot from them, too.\"\nJohn Carlos: 'It's what I was born to do,' he says of his salute. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images\nBald, tall, with a grey goatee, Carlos has glided into old age with a distinguished air and convivial manner, and more than a passing resemblance to the late activist and intellectual WEB DuBois .\n\"The first thing I thought was the shackles have been broken,\" Carlos says, casting his mind back to how he felt in that moment. \"And they won't ever be able to put shackles on John Carlos again. Because what had been done couldn't be taken back. Materially, some of us in the incarceration system are still literally in shackles. The greatest problem is we are afraid to offend our oppressors.\n\"I had a moral obligation to step up. Morality was a far greater force than the rules and regulations they had. God told the angels that day, 'Take a\u00a0step back \u2013 I'm gonna have to do this myself.'\"\nThe image certainly captures that sense of momentary rebellion. But what it cannot do is evoke the human sense of emotional turmoil and individual resolve that made it possible, or the collective, global gasp in response to its audacity. In his book, The John Carlos Story , in\u00a0the seconds between mounting the podium and the anthem playing, Carlos writes that his mind raced from the personal to the political and back again. Among other things, he reflected on his father's pained explanation for why he couldn't become an Olympic swimmer, the segregation and consequent impoverishment of Harlem, the exhortations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X to \"be true to yourself even when it hurts\", and his family. The final thought before the band started playing was, \"Damn, when this thing is done, it can't be taken back.\n\"I know that sounds like a lot of thoughts for just a few moments standing on a podium,\" he writes. \"But honestly this was all zigzagging through my brain like lightning bolts.\"\nAnticipating some kind of protest was afoot, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had sent Jesse Owens to talk them out of it. ( Owens's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin themselves held great symbolic significance, given Hitler's belief in Aryan supremacy.) Carlos's mind was made up. When he and Smith struck their pose, Carlos feared the worst. Look at the picture and you'll see that while Smith's arm is raised long and erect, Carlos has his slightly bent at the elbow. \"I wanted to make sure, in case someone rushed us, I could throw down a hammer punch,\" he writes. \"We had just received so many threats leading up to that point, I refused to be defenceless at that moment of truth.\"\nIt was also a moment of silence. \"You could have heard a frog piss on\u00a0cotton. There's something awful about hearing 50,000 people go silent, like being in the eye of a hurricane.\"\nAnd then came the storm. First boos. Then insults and worse. People throwing things and screaming racist abuse. \"Niggers need to go back to Africa!\" and, \"I\u00a0can't believe this is how you niggers treat us after we let you run\u00a0in our games.\"\n\"The fire was all around me,\" Carlos recalls. The IOC president ordered Smith and Carlos to be suspended from the US team and the Olympic village. Time magazine showed the Olympic logo with the words Angrier, Nastier, Uglier, instead of Faster, Higher, Stronger. The LA Times accused them of engaging in a \"Nazi-like salute\".\nBeyond the establishment, the resonance of the image could not be overstated. It was 1968 ; the black power movement had provided a post-civil rights rallying cry and the anti-Vietnam protests were gaining pace. That year, students throughout Europe, east and west, had been in revolt against war, tyranny and capitalism.\nMartin Luther King had been assassinated and the US had been plunged into yet another year of race riots in its urban centres. Just a few months earlier, the Democratic party convention had been disrupted by a huge police riot against Vietnam protesters. A few weeks before the Games, scores of students and activists had been gunned down by authorities in Mexico City itself.\nThe sight of two black athletes in open rebellion on the international stage sent a message to both America and the world. At home, this brazen disdain for the tropes of American patriotism \u2013 flag and anthem \u2013 shifted dissidence from the periphery of American life to primetime television in a single gesture, while revealing what DuBois once termed the \"essential two-ness\" of the black American condition. \"An American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\"\nGlobally, it was understood as an act of solidarity with all those fighting for greater equality, justice and human rights. Margaret Lambert , a Jewish high jumper who was forced, for show, to try out for the 1936 German Olympic team, even though she knew she would never be allowed to compete, said how delighted it made her feel. \"When I\u00a0saw those two guys with their fists up on the victory stand, it made my heart jump. It was beautiful.\"\nAs Carlos explains in his book, their gesture was supposed, among other things, to say: \"Hey, world, the United States is not like you might think it is for blacks and other people of colour. Just because we have USA on our chest does not mean everything is peachy keen and we are living large.\"\nCarlos understood, before he raised his fist that day, that once done, his act could not be taken back. What he could not have anticipated, at the age of 23, was what it would mean for his future. \"I\u00a0had no idea the moment on the medal stand would be frozen for all time. I had no idea what we'd face. I\u00a0didn't know or appreciate, at that precise moment, that the entire trajectory of our young lives had just irrevocably changed.\"\nDuring the Jim Crow era , life for even the most famous black sportsmen past their prime was tough. After his celebrated Olympic victory, Owens ran a dry-cleaning business, was a gas pump attendant, raced horses for money and eventually went bankrupt. \"People say it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse,\" he said. \"But what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.\"\nJoe Louis , a world champion boxer on whose shoulders rested national pride when he fought German Max Schmeling shortly before the second world war, greeted visitors at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and went on quiz shows. And these were sporting figures who tried to keep in with the establishment. Carlos was still in his prime, but that single act of defiance ensured his marginalisation.\nParadoxically, the next year was the best of his career. In 1969, he equalled the 100 yard world record, won the American Athletics Union 220-yard dash and led San Jose State to its first National Collegiate Athletic Association championship.\nThe trouble was, in the years before lucrative sponsorship deals, running didn't pay and few would employ him. In the years immediately following his protest, he worked security at a\u00a0nightclub and as a janitor. At one point he had to chop up his furniture so he could heat his house. The pressure started to bear down on his family. \"When there's a lack of money, it brings contempt into the family,\" he says. Moreover, his wife was facing constant harassment from the press and his children were being told at school that their father was a traitor. The marriage collapsed.\nHe tried American football for a few seasons, starting in Philadelphia, then moving north to Toronto and Montreal. He is keen to emphasise that the one thing that never happened, despite claims to the contrary, is that he had his medal confiscated. It's at his mother's house. And while he does not cherish it as you'd expect an Olympian might, he's adamant that this part of the story is set straight. \"The medal didn't mean shit to me. It doesn't mean anything now\u2026 The medal had no relevance. The one way it had relevance was that I earned it. So they never took my medal away from me. I'd earned it. They can't take it.\"\nAs time passed and the backlash subsided, Carlos was gradually invited back into the fold. He became involved as an outreach co-ordinator in the organising committee for the group bringing the Olympics to Los Angeles in 1984 and worked for the US Olympic Committee.\nDid he worry, as the picture for which he was famous started to adorn T-shirts and posters, that his readmission into the Olympic world meant his radicalism was being co-opted and sanitised? \"The image is still there,\" he says proudly. \"It keeps getting wider. If you look at the images of the last century, there's nothing much like it out there. And 'the man' wasn't the one that kept this thing afloat for 43 years. The man was the same man whupping my arse. And the Olympics are part of my history. I'm not going to run away from that.\"\nCarlos remains politically engaged. Late last year he addressed Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York. \"It's the same fight as it was 43 years ago. We fought unemployment; for housing, education. It's the same thing as people are fighting for today.\"\nHe defends Barack Obama , who he believes has not been given a fair shake. \"Mr Obama didn't get us where we are. He's trying to get us out. Someone fabricates shit to get us into wars, then makes ordinary Americans pay for them. Now someone else is trying to make it right. If George W Bush can have two terms to put this country into this mess, we should give Obama two to get us out of it.\"\nBut, unlike during the 1960s, today Carlos sees little hope of resistance emerging through sport, which is awash with too much money and drugs. \"There wasn't a whole bunch of money out there back then,\" he says, \"so just a few people were ever going to be shakers and bakers. But today, if an athlete doesn't have a view of their history before them, then they have a view of just that big cheque in front of them. It's not the responsibility of the oppressor to educate us. We have to educate ourselves and our own. That's the difference between Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan . Muhammad Ali will never die. He used his skill to say something about the social ills of society. Of course, he was an excellent boxer, but he got up and spoke on the issues. And because he spoke on the issues, he will never die. There will be someone else at some time who can do what Jordan could do. And then his name will just be pushed down in the mud. But they'll still be talking about Ali.\"\nEight years earlier, during a different phase of anti-racist activism in the US, a 17-year-old student, Franklin McCain , had gained his place in the history books when he sat at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, with three friends and refused to move until they were served. Many years later, McCain was philosophical about how that experience had affected him. \"On the day that I sat at that counter, I had the most tremendous feeling of elation and celebration,\" he told me. \"Nothing has ever come close. Not the birth of my first son, nor my marriage. And it was a cruel hoax, because people go through their whole lives and they don't get that to happen to them. And here it was being visited upon me as a\u00a017-year-old. It was wonderful, and it was sad also, because I know that I will never have that again. I'm just sorry it was when I was 17.\"\nCarlos has no such regrets. He's just glad he could be where he was to do what he felt he had to do. \"I\u00a0don't have any misgivings about it being frozen in time. It's a beacon for a lot of people around the world. So many people find inspiration in that portrait. That's what I was born\u00a0for.\"\n"}, {"score": 584.57294, "uuid": "c3b70f66-4ce8-556b-995f-0b7bc710fba0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-16-12310", "target_hostname": "www.guardian.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "The man <em>who</em> raised <em>a</em> black power salute at the 1968 Olympic Games | World", "snippet": "That&#x27;s the difference between <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> and Michael Jordan. <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> will never die.

It's 1968 at the Mexico City Olympics and the medals are being hung round the necks of Tommie Smith (USA, gold), Peter Norman (Australia, silver) and Carlos (USA, bronze). As the Star-Spangled Banner begins to play, Smith and Carlos, two black Americans wearing black gloves, raise their fists in the black power salute. It is a symbol of resistance and defiance, seared into 20th-century history, that Carlos feels he was put on Earth to perform.\n\"In life, there's the beginning and the end,\" he says. \"The beginning don't matter. The end don't matter. All that matters is what you do in between \u2013 whether you're prepared to do what it takes to make change. There has to be physical and material sacrifice. When all the dust settles and we're getting ready to play down for the ninth inning, the greatest reward is to know that you did your job when you were here on the planet.\"\nCarlos's beginning was, to say the least, eventful. Raised by two involved, working parents, he learned to hustle with his friends in Harlem and fight his way out of and into trouble. As a teenager, he used to chase Malcolm X down the street after his speeches and fire questions at him. Carlos always knew he was good at sports and originally wanted to be an Olympic swimmer, until his father broke it to him that the training facilities he needed were in private clubs for whites and the wealthy. He used to steal food from freight trains with his friends and then run with it into Harlem and hand it out to the poor. When the police gave chase, he was often the only one who never got caught. Running came so naturally, he never thought of it as a skill.\nThat single moment on the podium cost Carlos dear. More than four decades later, you'll find him at his desk in a spacious portable building behind the basketball courts at Palm Springs High School in California, where he works as a counsellor. Among the family photographs on the wall are the vaguest allusions to his moment in history. Pictures of Malcolm X and African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston , the pledge of allegiance, which American schoolkids must say to the flag every day, and a small poster saying Go For Gold Olympics.\nFor all its challenges, Carlos loves his job. \"Being a counsellor, you have to talk to the children as though you're talking to a thousand people,\" he says. \"Sometimes you say, 'I love you' and they say, 'I don't want your love' and you say, 'Well, it's out there, so you're going to have to deal with it.' And I learn a lot from them, too.\"\nJohn Carlos: 'It's what I was born to do,' he says of his salute. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images\nBald, tall, with a grey goatee, Carlos has glided into old age with a distinguished air and convivial manner, and more than a passing resemblance to the late activist and intellectual WEB DuBois .\n\"The first thing I thought was the shackles have been broken,\" Carlos says, casting his mind back to how he felt in that moment. \"And they won't ever be able to put shackles on John Carlos again. Because what had been done couldn't be taken back. Materially, some of us in the incarceration system are still literally in shackles. The greatest problem is we are afraid to offend our oppressors.\n\"I had a moral obligation to step up. Morality was a far greater force than the rules and regulations they had. God told the angels that day, 'Take a\u00a0step back \u2013 I'm gonna have to do this myself.'\"\nThe image certainly captures that sense of momentary rebellion. But what it cannot do is evoke the human sense of emotional turmoil and individual resolve that made it possible, or the collective, global gasp in response to its audacity. In his book, The John Carlos Story , in\u00a0the seconds between mounting the podium and the anthem playing, Carlos writes that his mind raced from the personal to the political and back again. Among other things, he reflected on his father's pained explanation for why he couldn't become an Olympic swimmer, the segregation and consequent impoverishment of Harlem, the exhortations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X to \"be true to yourself even when it hurts\", and his family. The final thought before the band started playing was, \"Damn, when this thing is done, it can't be taken back.\n\"I know that sounds like a lot of thoughts for just a few moments standing on a podium,\" he writes. \"But honestly this was all zigzagging through my brain like lightning bolts.\"\nAnticipating some kind of protest was afoot, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had sent Jesse Owens to talk them out of it.

People throwing things and screaming racist abuse. \"Niggers need to go back to Africa!\" and, \"I\u00a0can't believe this is how you niggers treat us after we let you run\u00a0in our games.\"\n\"The fire was all around me,\" Carlos recalls. The IOC president ordered Smith and Carlos to be suspended from the US team and the Olympic village. Time magazine showed the Olympic logo with the words Angrier, Nastier, Uglier, instead of Faster, Higher, Stronger. The LA Times accused them of engaging in a \"Nazi-like salute\".\nBeyond the establishment, the resonance of the image could not be overstated. It was 1968 ; the black power movement had provided a post-civil rights rallying cry and the anti-Vietnam protests were gaining pace. That year, students throughout Europe, east and west, had been in revolt against war, tyranny and capitalism.\nMartin Luther King had been assassinated and the US had been plunged into yet another year of race riots in its urban centres. Just a few months earlier, the Democratic party convention had been disrupted by a huge police riot against Vietnam protesters. A few weeks before the Games, scores of students and activists had been gunned down by authorities in Mexico City itself.\nThe sight of two black athletes in open rebellion on the international stage sent a message to both America and the world. At home, this brazen disdain for the tropes of American patriotism \u2013 flag and anthem \u2013 shifted dissidence from the periphery of American life to primetime television in a single gesture, while revealing what DuBois once termed the \"essential two-ness\" of the black American condition. \"An American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\"\nGlobally, it was understood as an act of solidarity with all those fighting for greater equality, justice and human rights. Margaret Lambert , a Jewish high jumper who was forced, for show, to try out for the 1936 German Olympic team, even though she knew she would never be allowed to compete, said how delighted it made her feel. \"When I\u00a0saw those two guys with their fists up on the victory stand, it made my heart jump. It was beautiful.\"\nAs Carlos explains in his book, their gesture was supposed, among other things, to say: \"Hey, world, the United States is not like you might think it is for blacks and other people of colour. Just because we have USA on our chest does not mean everything is peachy keen and we are living large.\"\nCarlos understood, before he raised his fist that day, that once done, his act could not be taken back. What he could not have anticipated, at the age of 23, was what it would mean for his future. \"I\u00a0had no idea the moment on the medal stand would be frozen for all time. I had no idea what we'd face. I\u00a0didn't know or appreciate, at that precise moment, that the entire trajectory of our young lives had just irrevocably changed.\"\nDuring the Jim Crow era , life for even the most famous black sportsmen past their prime was tough. After his celebrated Olympic victory, Owens ran a dry-cleaning business, was a gas pump attendant, raced horses for money and eventually went bankrupt. \"People say it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse,\" he said. \"But what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.\"\nJoe Louis , a world champion boxer on whose shoulders rested national pride when he fought German Max Schmeling shortly before the second world war, greeted visitors at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and went on quiz shows. And these were sporting figures who tried to keep in with the establishment. Carlos was still in his prime, but that single act of defiance ensured his marginalisation.\nParadoxically, the next year was the best of his career. In 1969, he equalled the 100 yard world record, won the American Athletics Union 220-yard dash and led San Jose State to its first National Collegiate Athletic Association championship.\nThe trouble was, in the years before lucrative sponsorship deals, running didn't pay and few would employ him. In the years immediately following his protest, he worked security at a\u00a0nightclub and as a janitor. At one point he had to chop up his furniture so he could heat his house. The pressure started to bear down on his family. \"When there's a lack of money, it brings contempt into the family,\" he says. Moreover, his wife was facing constant harassment from the press and his children were being told at school that their father was a traitor. The marriage collapsed.\nHe tried American football for a few seasons, starting in Philadelphia, then moving north to Toronto and Montreal. He is keen to emphasise that the one thing that never happened, despite claims to the contrary, is that he had his medal confiscated. It's at his mother's house. And while he does not cherish it as you'd expect an Olympian might, he's adamant that this part of the story is set straight. \"The medal didn't mean shit to me. It doesn't mean anything now\u2026 The medal had no relevance. The one way it had relevance was that I earned it. So they never took my medal away from me. I'd earned it. They can't take it.\"\nAs time passed and the backlash subsided, Carlos was gradually invited back into the fold. He became involved as an outreach co-ordinator in the organising committee for the group bringing the Olympics to Los Angeles in 1984 and worked for the US Olympic Committee.\nDid he worry, as the picture for which he was famous started to adorn T-shirts and posters, that his readmission into the Olympic world meant his radicalism was being co-opted and sanitised? \"The image is still there,\" he says proudly. \"It keeps getting wider. If you look at the images of the last century, there's nothing much like it out there. And 'the man' wasn't the one that kept this thing afloat for 43 years. The man was the same man whupping my arse. And the Olympics are part of my history. I'm not going to run away from that.\"\nCarlos remains politically engaged. Late last year he addressed Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York. \"It's the same fight as it was 43 years ago. We fought unemployment; for housing, education. It's the same thing as people are fighting for today.\"\nHe defends Barack Obama , who he believes has not been given a fair shake. \"Mr Obama didn't get us where we are. He's trying to get us out. Someone fabricates shit to get us into wars, then makes ordinary Americans pay for them. Now someone else is trying to make it right. If George W Bush can have two terms to put this country into this mess, we should give Obama two to get us out of it.\"\nBut, unlike during the 1960s, today Carlos sees little hope of resistance emerging through sport, which is awash with too much money and drugs. \"There wasn't a whole bunch of money out there back then,\" he says, \"so just a few people were ever going to be shakers and bakers. But today, if an athlete doesn't have a view of their history before them, then they have a view of just that big cheque in front of them. It's not the responsibility of the oppressor to educate us. We have to educate ourselves and our own. That's the difference between Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan . Muhammad Ali will never die. He used his skill to say something about the social ills of society. Of course, he was an excellent boxer, but he got up and spoke on the issues. And because he spoke on the issues, he will never die. There will be someone else at some time who can do what Jordan could do. And then his name will just be pushed down in the mud. But they'll still be talking about Ali.\"\nEight years earlier, during a different phase of anti-racist activism in the US, a 17-year-old student, Franklin McCain , had gained his place in the history books when he sat at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, with three friends and refused to move until they were served. Many years later, McCain was philosophical about how that experience had affected him. \"On the day that I sat at that counter, I had the most tremendous feeling of elation and celebration,\" he told me. \"Nothing has ever come close. Not the birth of my first son, nor my marriage. And it was a cruel hoax, because people go through their whole lives and they don't get that to happen to them. And here it was being visited upon me as a\u00a017-year-old. It was wonderful, and it was sad also, because I know that I will never have that again. I'm just sorry it was when I was 17.\"\nCarlos has no such regrets. He's just glad he could be where he was to do what he felt he had to do. \"I\u00a0don't have any misgivings about it being frozen in time. It's a beacon for a lot of people around the world. So many people find inspiration in that portrait. That's what I was born\u00a0for.\"\n"}, {"score": 584.23425, "uuid": "75d8eef5-32e8-5e27-a52b-2b2242135cdc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-25-11297", "target_hostname": "www.guardian.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics?newsfeed=true", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "The man <em>who</em> raised <em>a</em> black power salute at the 1968 Olympic Games | World", "snippet": "That&#x27;s the difference between <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> and Michael Jordan. <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> will never die.

It's 1968 at the Mexico City Olympics and the medals are being hung round the necks of Tommie Smith (USA, gold), Peter Norman (Australia, silver) and Carlos (USA, bronze). As the Star-Spangled Banner begins to play, Smith and Carlos, two black Americans wearing black gloves, raise their fists in the black power salute. It is a symbol of resistance and defiance, seared into 20th-century history, that Carlos feels he was put on Earth to perform.\n\"In life, there's the beginning and the end,\" he says. \"The beginning don't matter. The end don't matter. All that matters is what you do in between \u2013 whether you're prepared to do what it takes to make change. There has to be physical and material sacrifice. When all the dust settles and we're getting ready to play down for the ninth inning, the greatest reward is to know that you did your job when you were here on the planet.\"\nCarlos's beginning was, to say the least, eventful. Raised by two involved, working parents, he learned to hustle with his friends in Harlem and fight his way out of and into trouble. As a teenager, he used to chase Malcolm X down the street after his speeches and fire questions at him. Carlos always knew he was good at sports and originally wanted to be an Olympic swimmer, until his father broke it to him that the training facilities he needed were in private clubs for whites and the wealthy. He used to steal food from freight trains with his friends and then run with it into Harlem and hand it out to the poor. When the police gave chase, he was often the only one who never got caught. Running came so naturally, he never thought of it as a skill.\nThat single moment on the podium cost Carlos dear. More than four decades later, you'll find him at his desk in a spacious portable building behind the basketball courts at Palm Springs High School in California, where he works as a counsellor. Among the family photographs on the wall are the vaguest allusions to his moment in history. Pictures of Malcolm X and African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston , the pledge of allegiance, which American schoolkids must say to the flag every day, and a small poster saying Go For Gold Olympics.\nFor all its challenges, Carlos loves his job. \"Being a counsellor, you have to talk to the children as though you're talking to a thousand people,\" he says. \"Sometimes you say, 'I love you' and they say, 'I don't want your love' and you say, 'Well, it's out there, so you're going to have to deal with it.' And I learn a lot from them, too.\"\nJohn Carlos: 'It's what I was born to do,' he says of his salute. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images\nBald, tall, with a grey goatee, Carlos has glided into old age with a distinguished air and convivial manner, and more than a passing resemblance to the late activist and intellectual WEB DuBois .\n\"The first thing I thought was the shackles have been broken,\" Carlos says, casting his mind back to how he felt in that moment. \"And they won't ever be able to put shackles on John Carlos again. Because what had been done couldn't be taken back. Materially, some of us in the incarceration system are still literally in shackles. The greatest problem is we are afraid to offend our oppressors.\n\"I had a moral obligation to step up. Morality was a far greater force than the rules and regulations they had. God told the angels that day, 'Take a\u00a0step back \u2013 I'm gonna have to do this myself.'\"\nThe image certainly captures that sense of momentary rebellion. But what it cannot do is evoke the human sense of emotional turmoil and individual resolve that made it possible, or the collective, global gasp in response to its audacity. In his book, The John Carlos Story , in\u00a0the seconds between mounting the podium and the anthem playing, Carlos writes that his mind raced from the personal to the political and back again. Among other things, he reflected on his father's pained explanation for why he couldn't become an Olympic swimmer, the segregation and consequent impoverishment of Harlem, the exhortations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X to \"be true to yourself even when it hurts\", and his family. The final thought before the band started playing was, \"Damn, when this thing is done, it can't be taken back.\n\"I know that sounds like a lot of thoughts for just a few moments standing on a podium,\" he writes. \"But honestly this was all zigzagging through my brain like lightning bolts.\"\nAnticipating some kind of protest was afoot, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had sent Jesse Owens to talk them out of it.

People throwing things and screaming racist abuse. \"Niggers need to go back to Africa!\" and, \"I\u00a0can't believe this is how you niggers treat us after we let you run\u00a0in our games.\"\n\"The fire was all around me,\" Carlos recalls. The IOC president ordered Smith and Carlos to be suspended from the US team and the Olympic village. Time magazine showed the Olympic logo with the words Angrier, Nastier, Uglier, instead of Faster, Higher, Stronger. The LA Times accused them of engaging in a \"Nazi-like salute\".\nBeyond the establishment, the resonance of the image could not be overstated. It was 1968 ; the black power movement had provided a post-civil rights rallying cry and the anti-Vietnam protests were gaining pace. That year, students throughout Europe, east and west, had been in revolt against war, tyranny and capitalism.\nMartin Luther King had been assassinated and the US had been plunged into yet another year of race riots in its urban centres. Just a few months earlier, the Democratic party convention had been disrupted by a huge police riot against Vietnam protesters. A few weeks before the Games, scores of students and activists had been gunned down by authorities in Mexico City itself.\nThe sight of two black athletes in open rebellion on the international stage sent a message to both America and the world. At home, this brazen disdain for the tropes of American patriotism \u2013 flag and anthem \u2013 shifted dissidence from the periphery of American life to primetime television in a single gesture, while revealing what DuBois once termed the \"essential two-ness\" of the black American condition. \"An American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\"\nGlobally, it was understood as an act of solidarity with all those fighting for greater equality, justice and human rights. Margaret Lambert , a Jewish high jumper who was forced, for show, to try out for the 1936 German Olympic team, even though she knew she would never be allowed to compete, said how delighted it made her feel. \"When I\u00a0saw those two guys with their fists up on the victory stand, it made my heart jump. It was beautiful.\"\nAs Carlos explains in his book, their gesture was supposed, among other things, to say: \"Hey, world, the United States is not like you might think it is for blacks and other people of colour. Just because we have USA on our chest does not mean everything is peachy keen and we are living large.\"\nCarlos understood, before he raised his fist that day, that once done, his act could not be taken back. What he could not have anticipated, at the age of 23, was what it would mean for his future. \"I\u00a0had no idea the moment on the medal stand would be frozen for all time. I had no idea what we'd face. I\u00a0didn't know or appreciate, at that precise moment, that the entire trajectory of our young lives had just irrevocably changed.\"\nDuring the Jim Crow era , life for even the most famous black sportsmen past their prime was tough. After his celebrated Olympic victory, Owens ran a dry-cleaning business, was a gas pump attendant, raced horses for money and eventually went bankrupt. \"People say it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse,\" he said. \"But what was I supposed to do? I had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.\"\nJoe Louis , a world champion boxer on whose shoulders rested national pride when he fought German Max Schmeling shortly before the second world war, greeted visitors at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and went on quiz shows. And these were sporting figures who tried to keep in with the establishment. Carlos was still in his prime, but that single act of defiance ensured his marginalisation.\nParadoxically, the next year was the best of his career. In 1969, he equalled the 100 yard world record, won the American Athletics Union 220-yard dash and led San Jose State to its first National Collegiate Athletic Association championship.\nThe trouble was, in the years before lucrative sponsorship deals, running didn't pay and few would employ him. In the years immediately following his protest, he worked security at a\u00a0nightclub and as a janitor. At one point he had to chop up his furniture so he could heat his house. The pressure started to bear down on his family. \"When there's a lack of money, it brings contempt into the family,\" he says. Moreover, his wife was facing constant harassment from the press and his children were being told at school that their father was a traitor. The marriage collapsed.\nHe tried American football for a few seasons, starting in Philadelphia, then moving north to Toronto and Montreal. He is keen to emphasise that the one thing that never happened, despite claims to the contrary, is that he had his medal confiscated. It's at his mother's house. And while he does not cherish it as you'd expect an Olympian might, he's adamant that this part of the story is set straight. \"The medal didn't mean shit to me. It doesn't mean anything now\u2026 The medal had no relevance. The one way it had relevance was that I earned it. So they never took my medal away from me. I'd earned it. They can't take it.\"\nAs time passed and the backlash subsided, Carlos was gradually invited back into the fold. He became involved as an outreach co-ordinator in the organising committee for the group bringing the Olympics to Los Angeles in 1984 and worked for the US Olympic Committee.\nDid he worry, as the picture for which he was famous started to adorn T-shirts and posters, that his readmission into the Olympic world meant his radicalism was being co-opted and sanitised? \"The image is still there,\" he says proudly. \"It keeps getting wider. If you look at the images of the last century, there's nothing much like it out there. And 'the man' wasn't the one that kept this thing afloat for 43 years. The man was the same man whupping my arse. And the Olympics are part of my history. I'm not going to run away from that.\"\nCarlos remains politically engaged. Late last year he addressed Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York. \"It's the same fight as it was 43 years ago. We fought unemployment; for housing, education. It's the same thing as people are fighting for today.\"\nHe defends Barack Obama , who he believes has not been given a fair shake. \"Mr Obama didn't get us where we are. He's trying to get us out. Someone fabricates shit to get us into wars, then makes ordinary Americans pay for them. Now someone else is trying to make it right. If George W Bush can have two terms to put this country into this mess, we should give Obama two to get us out of it.\"\nBut, unlike during the 1960s, today Carlos sees little hope of resistance emerging through sport, which is awash with too much money and drugs. \"There wasn't a whole bunch of money out there back then,\" he says, \"so just a few people were ever going to be shakers and bakers. But today, if an athlete doesn't have a view of their history before them, then they have a view of just that big cheque in front of them. It's not the responsibility of the oppressor to educate us. We have to educate ourselves and our own. That's the difference between Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan . Muhammad Ali will never die. He used his skill to say something about the social ills of society. Of course, he was an excellent boxer, but he got up and spoke on the issues. And because he spoke on the issues, he will never die. There will be someone else at some time who can do what Jordan could do. And then his name will just be pushed down in the mud. But they'll still be talking about Ali.\"\nEight years earlier, during a different phase of anti-racist activism in the US, a 17-year-old student, Franklin McCain , had gained his place in the history books when he sat at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, with three friends and refused to move until they were served. Many years later, McCain was philosophical about how that experience had affected him. \"On the day that I sat at that counter, I had the most tremendous feeling of elation and celebration,\" he told me. \"Nothing has ever come close. Not the birth of my first son, nor my marriage. And it was a cruel hoax, because people go through their whole lives and they don't get that to happen to them. And here it was being visited upon me as a\u00a017-year-old. It was wonderful, and it was sad also, because I know that I will never have that again. I'm just sorry it was when I was 17.\"\nCarlos has no such regrets. He's just glad he could be where he was to do what he felt he had to do. \"I\u00a0don't have any misgivings about it being frozen in time. It's a beacon for a lot of people around the world. So many people find inspiration in that portrait. That's what I was born\u00a0for.\"\n"}, {"score": 548.96857, "uuid": "d15eaecd-c9e2-5d28-9f8e-8fe64e00d258", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0814wb-65-06784", "target_hostname": "incharacter.org", "target_uri": "http://incharacter.org/observation/boxing-with-humility/", "page_rank": 1.188859e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Boxing with Humility <em>\u00e2</em>\u0080\u0094 Observation Archives <em>\u00e2</em>\u0080\u0094 In Character, <em>A</em> Journal", "snippet": "<em>A</em> few years later, after I knocked out <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> and won the heavyweight title, I forgot that lesson in humility and again, I had to pay the price by getting beaten and embarrassed by <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> in Zaire.\u201d", "explanation": null, "document": "3c6f\nBoxing with Humility \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Observation  Archives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In Character, A Journal of Everyday Virtues by the John Templeton Foundation\nhome > Observation > Boxing with Humility\nBoxing with Humility\nGordon Marino | Posted on 03/15/10\nGeorge Foreman is also a preacher with a boxing outreach program for youngsters. I once pressed him on how he could be a Christian and at the same time teach young kids how to hurt people. Foreman responded, \u201cBecause the discipline of boxing gives you practice with your emotions.\"\nI grew up in a home in which there were main events a couple of nights a week. Often on Wednesday and Friday my father would come home late. There was the clink of ice for drinks, a few jabs, and then the rumble between my parents would start. The fray would run far into the night. During the day, there were belts and backhands for me to duck. There was plenty of love as well, at least of the paternal and maternal sort, but my suburban boyhood home was a cave of screams and swats. That sort of start to life can make a person very focused on the question of who can do what to whom. That is to some extent the parent question of pugilism. And it is not surprising that with this sentimental education for a background, I would have a natural interest in boxing.\nThere were no boxing gyms on the New Jersey coast where I was raised, but my grandfather, a onetime boxing instructor in the Army, offered some tips and encouragement. I rigged up a heavy bag in the basement, corresponded with that most humble of champions, Floyd Patterson, and did whatever I could to learn about the bruising art. Apart from fights at school, of which I had my fair share, there was not much fistic action in my neighborhood. During my college years I finally got my chance to study the sweet science. After a brief Division I football career, I was fortunate enough to be able to transfer to Columbia University in New York, where great boxing gyms were only a subway ride away. I leapt at the chance to begin rigorous study of the so-called manly art.\nTwo years into boxing, I had had a few bouts and was progressing well. One fetid summer afternoon I stopped by a well-known gym. After a conversation with the man who ran this school for modern gladiators, I found myself in the ring mixing it up with a finalist from the New York City Golden Gloves. The sparring went very well and the trainer offered me a professional contract on the spot. I let my ego get the best of me and signed right up. Things got pretty serious quickly. I was sparring every day and at night, going back up to Columbia with black eyes. Naturally, I wore my cuts and bruises like badges of honor and felt safer in the world for being a certified tough guy \u2014 a licensed professional boxer.\nAbout two weeks into my new career, I got into the gym and my trainer told me to get ready to work with a young upcoming heavyweight. He was a tall, powerfully built kid of twenty, already a pro with eight wins under his belt. As I gloved up and put on my headgear, he stood in the middle of the ring lazily swinging his arms around. Somewhat intimidated, I was trying to rev up my aggression engine, telling myself, \u201cThis kid may be big but I\u2019m going to get inside his long reach and rip him apart.\u201d The bell rang. I tested a few angles and stepped in on the attack. Wham \u2014 he clocked me with a stiff jab. It was as though a giant flash bulb went off behind my eyes. I can remember appreciating the power of the punch as something akin to beautiful, like a force of nature. I can also recall recoiling in fear, lest he hit me with his much more powerful right hand. I survived two stanzas with this young fighter who would go on to become, albeit briefly, a bona fide heavyweight contender. But in a matter of moments, I went from feeling like an Ivy League version of Smokin\u2019 Joe Frazier to thinking as though I had a lot to learn and that maybe at twenty-two it was too late for me to become a serious professional boxer.\nIn A Small Treatise on the Great Virtues, Andre Comte-Sponville quotes Spinoza as saying: \u201cHumility is a sadness born of the fact that man considers his own lack of power or weakness.\u201d Though I did not feel humiliated by my ring encounter, there was a sadness that came with my updated self-understanding of my powers.\nI am not sure why, but for men, at least, a good punch in the snout can make you take a quick look around yourself. Boxing offers a limitless supply of such reminders. Teddy Atlas, trainer of world champions, including Mike Tyson, recently told me: \u201cI know it is a clich\u00e9 but boxing really is the best metaphor for life. Everything that happens in life happens in the ring but at warp speed. There are times when you can coast, sudden crises, pauses, rests, winners, and losers. But one thing is for certain: like nothing else, it can force you to take a very quick inventory of yourself. There you are. You think you\u2019re a tough guy. You get in the ring and bam \u2014 you are hit and hurt and the guy in front of you wants nothing more than to deliver more hurt. You are suddenly faced with this person who is very strong and trying to take you apart.\u201d\nThe boxing guru continued: \u201cIn a flash in boxing you feel your mortality, you feel how vulnerable you are. And the feeling of vulnerability is the lesson in humility that boxing offers like no other sport.\u201d\nSpinoza expounds upon this conception of humility. He writes: \u201cIf we suppose that the man conceives his lack of power because he understands something more powerful than himself, by the knowledge of which he determines his power of acting, then we conceive nothing but that the man understands himself distinctly or that his power of acting is aided.\u201d My training in boxing and the martial arts promoted the illusion that as long as I did my roadwork and sit-ups and kept my hands up, nothing could hurt me. But that punch to my inbox quickly popped my superman delusions and, \u00e0 la Teddy Atlas, brought a fresh self-understanding that would be a more faithful guide in my future pugilistic encounters and in my behavior outside the squared circle.\nOne of Teddy Atlas\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was heavyweight champion Michael Moorer. In November 1994, Moorer was coasting to a victory over forty-five-year-old George Foreman. But just as Atlas noted, boxing, like life, is full of surprises. And Foreman had a little surprise for Moorer. Big George had a big trick: he would begin by throwing his punches at three-quarter speed and so lull his foe into thinking that all his shots were going to come at the same manageable pace. Then, out of the blue, he would throw his fastball. And with one powerful right-hand swipe, Foreman laid Moorer low. Just five years short of half a century and after thirteen years out of the ring Foreman became the oldest man to ever win the heavyweight title. I think it was one of the most remarkable athletic feats of the twentieth century, but I digress.\nGeorge Foreman is also a preacher with a boxing outreach program for youngsters. I once pressed him on how he could be a Christian and at the same time teach young kids how to hurt people. Foreman responded, \u201cBecause the discipline of boxing gives you practice with your emotions, emotions like fear and anger. In time, the kids learn to control rather than to be controlled by those powerful feelings. People who have control over their emotions are less violent.\u201d Foreman also had something to say about the power of the fist in teaching humility.\nBorn into abject poverty and without a stable family, Foreman was a very troubled and troubling young man. When he was seventeen he went into the Job Corps, where he was lured into boxing. He recalls: \u201cAfter practicing for a few weeks, the day was set when I was going to have my first sparring session. I told everybody to come and watch me. They did. And I got whupped very badly. It was so embarrassing that I never wanted to box again. When my coach came up to me a few days later and asked me if I was coming to the gym, I\u2019d make up some excuse, like I don\u2019t have my shoes or something. Eventually, I came back, of course, but that beating taught me humility in this sense. It taught me never to think that I was better than anyone else. It taught me that on any given day, you can be beaten. This always helped push me to prepare for my bouts. A few years later, after I knocked out Joe Frazier and won the heavyweight title, I forgot that lesson in humility and again, I had to pay the price by getting beaten and embarrassed by Muhammad Ali in Zaire.\u201d\n"}], [{"score": 501.90668, "uuid": "e52d6012-3022-580d-9c05-3887b2225ba6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0100tw-55-09660", "target_hostname": "www.independent.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/steve-bunce-on-boxing-chisora-the-latest-in-a-long-line-of-british-underdogs-6891591.html", "page_rank": 1.5962212e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Steve Bunce on Boxing: Chisora the latest in <em>a</em> long line of British underdogs", "snippet": "Bugner remains the best British heavyweight never to win <em>a</em> world title, and it <em>was</em> his misfortune that he shared primes with the holy triumvirate of <em>Ali</em>, George Foreman and <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>.

Klitschko is one of the better fighters our plucky challengers have met, and Chisora starts as one of the biggest British underdogs in a heavyweight title fight. It has to be said the competition is fierce for the title of \"biggest British underdog\".\nIn 1955 Don Cockell, a former British light-heavyweight champion with a glandular problem, travelled by boat to San Francisco to take a fearsome beating from Rocky Marciano. The fight officially ended in round nine, but that is only a statistic because poor Don's cause was lost before he joined the ship.\nIn the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies, Brian London and Richard Dunn were equally exposed in painful nights against Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali. Henry Cooper was also ruined in his championship fight with Ali in 1966; there is a strong case that Cooper should have fought either Patterson or Sonny Liston for the title a few years earlier. Dunn, London and Cooper were all exceptional outsiders and, even with the passage of time, growing nostalgia and a funeral, it is hard to escape the depth of their missions. I would argue that Dunn against Ali in Munich in 1976 was just marginally less of a fight than London against Ali in 1966. It's close, because both were bloody bits of business.\nIt is possible that Joe Bugner had no chance when he met Ali over 15 rounds in Kuala Lumpur in 1975 but I would disagree. Bugner was brave, bold and young, and Ali could have bad nights, but in the end Bugner failed to grasp the opportunity and lost on points. Bugner remains the best British heavyweight never to win a world title, and it was his misfortune that he shared primes with the holy triumvirate of Ali, George Foreman and Joe Frazier.\nIt gets messy once the Eighties start. The sport has seen the reign of the multiple champions under the useful tag of Lost Generation, then Mike Tyson's years, some glory with Lennox Lewis and for a decade a run of Eastern bloc fighters. Ali's heyday is now as remote as silent movies.\nThe Brits, well, they just kept coming. Frank Bruno tried and tried and tried before winning at his fourth attempt. An unknown fighter from London, who was raised in Nigeria, called Henry Akinwande, won a version, which he defended against a hardman from Brighton called Scott Welch. Herbie Hide won and lost a couple of times for the WBO belt, a behemoth from Bedford called Matt Skelton lost against somebody called Ruslan Chagaev, Danny Williams was dropped about seven times and stopped by Vitali. Skelton and Williams were really up against it.\nIn 2009 David Haye gave away 12 inches in height, six stone in weight to beat Nikolai Valuev. He beat another British boxer, Audley Harrison, in a defence that divided opinion. Haye against Harrison was big and clinical and calculating and not a fight to celebrate. Haye lost next time out over 12 repetitive rounds against Vitali's kid brother, Wladimir, but not before a war of words made the fight a big deal.\n\"I will not let him [Wladimir] get comfortable \u2013 why would I let him relax and jab me stupid? What, am I mad?\" said David Haye last year, a month before he let Wladimir get very comfortable, relax and jab him stupid. Haye, like so many fighters after losing to a Klitschko, has still not solved the riddle.\nAnd that leaves Del Boy, British challenger No 15 and a genuine maverick. Saturday's fight, which will be live on BoxNation, looks like a classic example of the plucky Brit in way over his head. \"I never do what I'm supposed to do and I'm not going to start now,\" Chisora said yesterday. A win would be the biggest shock in British boxing history and for some crazy reason I can't write Chisora off.\n"}, {"score": 497.5832, "uuid": "7b04f2f5-3aed-54cb-922b-ae4969551292", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0404wb-57-01932", "target_hostname": "www.boxing-monthly.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.boxing-monthly.co.uk/content/9903/two.htm", "page_rank": 1.229167e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "BOXING MONTHLY - Article Two - March 1999", "snippet": "<em>Frazier</em> took punishment, his face lumpy and swollen, but his constant pressure and two-handed battering proved too much for <em>Ali</em>, <em>who</em> <em>was</em> having only his third fight after <em>a</em> three-and-<em>a</em>-half-year layoff. <em>Ali</em> fought mostly in spurts, which were often dazzling, but <em>Frazier</em> <em>was</em> insistent.", "explanation": null, "document": "Got your free t-shirt yet?\narticles from the magazine\u00a0...\nMarch 1999\nEach month we bring you a selection of articles from the current and past issues of BOXING MONTHLY.

Here is a list of previous heavyweight unification title fights that involved rival champions or one of the contestants having had a claim (sometimes tenuous) to the title.\nWHAT'S MY NAME? Ali gave WBA champ Terrell a vicious beating at Houston in 1967 - Get\u00a0Big\u00a0Pic\n25 January 1894:\nGentleman Jim Corbett KO3 Charley Mitchell at Jacksonville, Florida:\nMitchell had fought John L. Sullivan to a 39-round draw in 1888 in a bare-knuckle fight, and as British champion disputed Corbett's claim to be champion of the world. Corbett weighed 184lbs (13st 2lbs) while Mitchell was barely a middleweight at 158lbs (11st 4lbs).\n4 July 1910:\nJack Johnson KO15 James J. Jeffries at Reno, Nevada:\nJohnson had won the title by outclassing Tommy Burns in 14 rounds at Sydney, Australia in 1908 but there were many who refused to regard him as champion until he had overcome the 34-year-old Jeffries, who had retired as undefeated champion in 1905. Johnson severely punished Jeffries in a one-sided fight that was notable for its racial connotations, with Jeffries being encouraged to come out of retirement to reclaim the title for the white race. But the old ex-champ stood no chance with Johnson. Promoter Tex Rickard, who refereed the fight, told the press afterwards: \"Jack Johnson is the most wonderful fighter that ever pulled on a glove. He won as he pleased from Jeffries and was never in danger.\" Johnson said: \"I won from Jeffries because I outclassed him in every department of the fighting game.\" But he acknowledged the old champ's bravery, saying: \"He came back at me with the heart of a true fighter. No man can say he did not do his best.\" Jeffries ruefully attributed his performance to age and inactivity. \"I did not have the snap of youth I used to have\", he said. \"I guess its all my own fault. I was getting along nicely and peacefully on my alfalfa farm, but when they started calling for me, and mentioning me as the white man's hope, I guess my pride got the better of my good judgement.\"\n27 September 1950:\nEzzard Charles W15 Joe Louis at Yankee Stadium, New York:\nCharles had won the National Boxing Association title after Louis had retired in 1948. But Charles struggled for acceptance as champion. The British Boxing Board of Control recognised Lee Savold after the American boxer had stopped Bruce Woodcock - due to a shocking cut over the British champion's eye - in June 1950. But when Louis came out of retirement, aged 36, it gave Charles the chance to gain more or less universal recognition. Louis was the favourite at about 8-5 on, but the 29-year-old Charles clearly outboxed the slower, older man to take a unanimous decision. Charles's left eye was swollen and partly closed by the finish, but Louis's left eye was shut, his nose bloodied, and in the 14th round the former champion was hurt by a right and severely hammered until the bell came to his rescue.\n6 February 1967:\nMuhammad Ali W15 Ernie Terrell at Houston, Texas:\nThe 6ft 6ins Terrell was recognised as champion by the World Boxing Association although Ali was generally regarded as champion and had angered Ali by calling him by the undefeated champion's \"slave name\" of Cassius Clay. And Ali, a 4-1 on betting favourite, promised to punish the 27-year-old from Chicago, saying that Terrell would get a \"Floyd Patterson humiliation beating\", in reference to Ali's 1965 whipping of the former champ, who had similarly angered him by pre-fight comments. Patterson had had to endure taunts as well as a painful defeat, finally being rescued by the referee in the 12th round in 1965. And for Terrell it was, indeed, the same sort of ordeal. But, game but outclassed, Terrell at least managed to last the distance. This was the \"What's my name?\" fight, with the 6ft 3ins Ali talking to Terrell in between hitting him with combinations of punches that ripped through the hands-high guard of the taller man.\n16 February 1970:\nJoe Frazier TKO end of 4 Jimmy Ellis at Madison Square Garden, New York:\nThe undefeated Olympic gold medallist Frazier was recognised as champion in New York and Europe while Ellis had won the World Boxing Association's elimination tournament after Muhammad Ali's enforced exile for refusing to be inducted in the American armed forces. Ellis, a competent boxer who had been Ali's chief sparmate for a number of years, was overwhelmed by Frazier's power and went down twice in the fourth round, the second time when Smokin' Joe's vaunted left hook dumped him on his back with the round almost over. In his autobiography, Smokin' Joe, Frazier described the left hook in this way: \"The impact was like when you hit a baseball flush, and it soars off your bat like a rocket.\" Ellis barely beat the count, getting up at nine after the bell had sounded to end the fourth. But he was through for the evening. The bell sounded for the start of the fifth, but Ellis's manager, Angelo Dundee, waved to the referee that his man was finished. In American record books it is recorded as TKO5 for Frazier.\n8 March 1971:\nJoe Frazier W15 Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden, New York:\nFrazier was champion in the eyes of the boxing commissions but Ali called himself the \"People's Champion\". It was perhaps the most widely anticipated fight in history, two undefeated heavyweight champions, each with his own socio-political following. Frazier took punishment, his face lumpy and swollen, but his constant pressure and two-handed battering proved too much for Ali, who was having only his third fight after a three-and-a-half-year layoff. Ali fought mostly in spurts, which were often dazzling, but Frazier was insistent. Ali was rocked badly in the 11th, then floored by a left hook in the final round. Ali gamely picked himself up, but the knockdown had cemented Frazier's unanimous decision win. Hugh McIlvanney wrote of that left hook in The Observer: \"Any possible ambiguity about the result was removed by that punch, but so were the unjustified doubts about Ali's heart.\"\n1 August 1987:\nMike Tyson W12 Tony Tucker at the Hilton Hotel, Las Vegas:\nTyson came into the ring as World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association champion, while Tucker had won the International Boxing Federation belt by stopping Buster Douglas in the 10th round on 30 May that year. Tyson was staggered by a left uppercut in the opening round but came back to dominate the fight as Tucker went into safety-first mode. The judges had Tyson winning widely; Tucker said later that he had hurt his right hand in the second round. Pat Putnam wrote in Sports Illustrated: \"Neither man really hurt the other. There are those who were disappointed that the fight went the full distance. Still others thought that Tucker, who lost for the first time in 36 fights, made the champ look bad... Tyson still has a lot to learn, and there may be a professor of the sweet science out there who could teach him to be a better fighter. Yet no matter who yells advice from his corner, Tyson will never be a classy boxer; an opponent with good lateral movement and a crisp jab will give him fits.\"\n27 June 1988:\nMike Tyson KO1 Michael Spinks at the Convention Center, Atlantic City:\nTyson was champ of the major organisations but Spinks called himself the \"People's Champion\" (shades of Muhammad Ali) because he had taken the title from Larry Holmes, considered the world's premier heavyweight at the time of their fight. But Spinks had forfeited the IBF title for failing to accept a purse offer to defend against Tony Tucker, his mandatory challenger who subsequently won the title, then lost it to Tyson. Spinks, an Olympic gold medallist and former light-heavy champ, had won 31 consecutive bouts and chopped down the towering Gerry Cooney in five rounds. But Tyson was the 4-1 on favourite. Tyson's mentor and former co-manager, Jim Jacobs, had died three months earlier. Tyson was in the process of shedding manager Bill Cayton to be promoted and advised by Don King. But nothing interfered with Tyson's concentration on Spinks. He blew out his opponent in 91 seconds, and Colin Hart wrote in The Sun: \"Spinks was intimidated by Tyson's frightening aggression and his mind was numbed by Mike's menace.\"\nThe last fight for the undisputed heavyweight title came on 13 November 1992, when Riddick Bowe won a unanimous 12-round decision over Evander Holyfield at the Thomas & Mack Center, Las Vegas, with Holyfield defending the WBC, WBA and IBF titles. On 14 December 1992, the WBC withdrew recognition from Bowe for failing to negotiate terms for a title defence against Lennox Lewis, the mandatory challenger. The title has been divided since then.\nAlso available to read from\nissue:\n"}, {"score": 472.61545, "uuid": "f1dcdcf0-ab61-5128-a896-6182f538e521", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1811wb-96-22816", "target_hostname": "www.whatmyworldslike.com", "target_uri": "http://www.whatmyworldslike.com/blog/category/the-visual/", "page_rank": 2.9776557e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "The Visual : What My World's Like", "snippet": "It\u2019s <em>a</em> good chance that the only person <em>who</em> thought <em>Ali</em> could beat Foreman <em>was</em> <em>Ali</em> himself.

I do. It\u2019s easy to see why his opponents wouldn\u2019t like him since he talked so much trash\u2026but he backed it up. Part of his process to prepare himself mentally was to talk about his strengths and his opponents weaknesses. I noticed this while watching When We Were Kings. He kept saying that George Foreman was scared and slow, that he was the greatest, and rejoiced in hearing and chanting \u201cAli, bomaye!\u201d meaning \u201cAli, kill him!\u201d\nThe background story to this fight is pretty interesting: In 1964, Ali beats Sonny Liston to become the heavyweight boxing champion at 22. In 1967, after refusing to be drafted in the Vietnam war, Ali is stripped of his title. After three and a half years, he is reinstated and at 29 must fight Joe Frazier in order to regain his title. Ali loses to Frazier in 1971 after 15 rounds. In 1972, relative unknown, Kenny Norton, breaks Ali\u2019s jaw and defeats him after 15 rounds. Ali is considered to be finished. Frazier loses his title to George Foreman in 1973. Then, in order to become the champ again, Ali must contend with Foreman, who is undefeated and ten years younger. At the time, Ali\u2019s record was 44-2 and Foreman was 40-0 with 37 KOs. Talk about a formidable opponent. It\u2019s a good chance that the only person who thought Ali could beat Foreman was Ali himself. Really, that was all that mattered.\nWhen We Were Kings documents the six weeks the fighters spent in Kinshasa. (Don\u2019t waste your time looking for Zaire on the map because that name was abandoned for a return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.) It\u2019s lots of fun to watch and makes you wish for a time travel machine. A must-see documentary that won an Academy Award in 1997.\nForeman falls\u2026\nWatch it!

Each week we\u2019ll explore a doctrine or important element of the Christian faith, including the areas of discussion (and possibly debate) that come with it. Enjoy!\nBoxing great Joe Frazier is considered one of the ten greatest boxers of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization, finishing his career at 32-4-1 and a two-time heavyweight champion. His epic battles in the ring with the heavy-handed George Foreman or the flamboyant Muhammad Ali are the stuff of legend, especially for those who follow the sport. Sadly, on November 7, 2011, \u201cSmokin\u2019 Joe\u201d lost the toughest fight of his life \u2014 a bout with liver cancer.\nAs legendary as his fights with Ali may have been, it was their ongoing tussle outside the ring that provokes me to consider the issue for this post: reconciliation.\nIt\u2019s well known that Frazier and Ali hated each other, at least in the public eye. They often and repeatedly exchanged insults that were, as one writer put it, \u201cinterspersed with brief reconciliations.\u201d We\u2019ll never know if full reconciliation was ever realized, although late-in-life diseases seemed to soften them toward each other. There\u2019s hope that things got fixed in the end.\nDefining the Issue\nBy definition, reconciliation is the restoration of a broken or strained relationship. It can also mean, \u201cto make consistent or congruous.\u201d\nReconciliation is one of the primary themes in the gospel of Jesus Christ\u2014the restoration of a broken relationship between us and God. On account of sin (and death), humanity is alienated from God and desperately needs something, or Someone, to put things back into order and harmony.\nIn 2 Corinthians 5:17-20, Paul\u2019s theology of reconciliation is front and center. He said:\nTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things have come. Everything is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed the message of reconciliation to us. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, certain that God is appealing through us. We plead on Christ\u2019s behalf, \u201cBe reconciled to God\u201d (HCSB).\nReconciliation is God\u2019s idea, and He initiates it. He\u2019s reconciling us and the world to Himself through the person and work of Jesus Christ. And this has been in God\u2019s mind and mission from the beginning (Gen 3:15; Acts 2:23; Eph 1:9-10).\nWhen we are reconciled to God through Christ, we become new creations \u2014 the old is gone and the new has been inaugurated. That means what is true of Christ is true of us (Rom 6:3-11), and now we are called to embody a new identity, a new character, and a new purpose as we are conformed into Jesus\u2019 image (Rom 8:28-29).\nGoing Deeper\nBut there\u2019s more. Once our relationship with God is restored, our relationships with others must also reflect the values of God\u2019s kingdom. That\u2019s why the great commandment lifted up by Jesus is to love God with our entire being and also to love our neighbors as ourselves (Matt 22:37-39).\nThe reality of our reconciliation with God brings with it the responsibility of reconciliation with others. Paul insists that God has entrusted to us the message and ministry of reconciliation. Think about it: how much better to display this message than allow the gospel to work itself out in our broken or strained relationships?\nAli and Frazier had a long-standing beef with each other that was \u201cinterspersed with brief reconciliations.\u201d What about you? Are there relationships like this in your life that are broken or strained, needing reconciliation?\nMaybe you\u2019re about to feel the strain of those relationships as family and friends gather for the holidays. Maybe those tensions and histories are about to rise to the surface once again. If so, let the gospel breathe its life-giving power and healing into those relationships.\nBut perhaps the main issue is where you stand with God. Maybe this post has unearthed the fact that you need to be reconciled to Him. There\u2019s no more poignant time to receive such a gift than the season of Christmas. The birth of Christ reminds us that God loves us (John 3:16) and that he desires to bring us into His family (Gal 4:4-5).\nSo, like Paul, \u201cwe plead on Christ\u2019s behalf, \u2018Be reconciled to God.\u2019\u201d\nMicah Carter is the Editorial Project Leader for Threads by LifeWay \u2014 a job that requires the added title \u201cMinister of Reconciliation.\u201d\nThere has been 1 reply so far\nReconciliation, the humility of surrendering to dependence at the expense of breaking down independence. A great need in the Church today.\nFriday, December 2, 2011, at 9:20am\nComments are closed.

No longer doe boxers grab public imagination that past greats such as Ali, Joe Frazier, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns, Nigel Benn, Henry Cooper and many others.\nWhatever you view boxing as a sport or not, it is difficult to resist the charms of these enigmatic past gladiators of the ring.\nFast forward to 2012 and the antics of two contemporary gladiators, if we can call them that.\u00a0One can only conclude that their actions quite simply smacked of cheap desperation.\u00a0Both Derek Chisora and David Haye brought the sport to an all time low. They dragged the efforts of our great champions through the gutter. There was the smashing of a bottle, a brawl resembling last summer\u2019s riot and verbal threats on a scale that defied the belief that either perpetrator possessed an ounce of brain matter.\nHow long before the appropriate authority realises that boxing is bereft of an iota of credibility. \u00a0The fractured structure of the boxing governing bodies (WBA, WBC, WBO \u00a0and other ridiculous acronyms) established to squeeze every last dollar out of the once noble sport doesn\u2019t help.\nSome think their actions were simply a PR stunt that backfired. I believe that. However, no one can deny that boxing now looks like a sport that time has left behind. Its athletes are in need of a credibility fix and some serious tutoring in gamesmanship, in and out of the ring.\nThese are grown men!\n"}, {"score": 394.38113, "uuid": "81b5047d-2c52-59f2-895f-6bfd59edcf8b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-76-02287", "target_hostname": "www.piolog.com", "target_uri": "http://www.piolog.com/sports/2012/2/8/pacquiao-and-mayweather-good-but-never-great.html", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Pacquiao and Mayweather good, but never great - Sports - The Pioneer", "snippet": "During Ali\u2019s heyday, <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> and <em>Ali</em> were at the top of the box- ing world.

Pac- quiao (54-3-2, 38 KO) is acknowl- edged for his hand and foot speed, large repertoire of punches and ex- perience in the ring.\nFor the past few years, promot- ers and fans have begged for the two boxers to fight and settle the argument\u2014who is better?\nEverything seemed to align perfectly for this to happen; they were dominating the sport and it seemed as if their paths would in- evitably cross.\nThe idea of this mega-fight for the welterweight belt began a flurry of excitement from fans, promot- ers and the boxing world. Rumors were afloat that if they united in a Pay-Per-View mega-fight, Pac-\nquiao and Mayweather would take home 40 million dollars each.\nBut the excitement has quickly run dry, as both camps hold a num- ber of excuses for why the fight is not happening: blood testing, per- formance enhancing drugs, money, legal issues, fighting weight, etc.\nBoth sides argue that the ex- cuses are purposely being left un- addressed because that opponent is scared. At this pace, the two fight- ers are going to duck each other into retirement\u2014and for this, their reputations should be forever tar- nished.\nThe truth is, there is one thing keeping this fight from happen- ing\u2014and that\u2019s heart. They both have the talent, the work ethic, the intelligence, all of the intangi- bles necessary to dominate in this sport\u2014but they are both missing the heart to help them get into talks of greatness.\nI\u2019m talking Michael Jordan scor- ing 38 points while battling the flu heart. I\u2019m talking Cal Ripken Jr. playing 2,632 straight games heart. And I\u2019m really talking Muhammad Ali heart.\nAli represents everything that\nMayweather and Pacquiao aren\u2019t. During Ali\u2019s heyday, Joe Frazier and Ali were at the top of the box- ing world. Prior to their first fight, both boxers were undefeated.\nAli was banned from boxing for over three years because of his re- fusal to go into the military when he was drafted.\nIn their first fight, Ali got dropped with a strong left hook, but got up immediately as his jaw began to swell. He finished the round and the fight\u2014but he lost. Did he stop there? No. Ali and Frazier fought two more times; Ali winning both. He finished his ca- reer (56-5, 37 KO) as arguably the greatest fighter to ever live.\nThe boxing legend recently celebrated his 70th birthday in his hometown, Louisville, Kent. Box- ing promoter Bob Arum urged Pacquiao to attend the party, not- ing that Pacquiao, a singing hobby- ist, might even get to sing for \u201cThe Greatest.\u201d\nLet\u2019s just hope Pacquiao ac- cepted the offer, and invited May- weather as his plus one. It\u2019s the closest the two boxers will ever come to greatness.\n"}, {"score": 392.4753, "uuid": "e800335f-4be6-5bdb-817f-d1cd6fa75abb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0109wb-68-32051", "target_hostname": "www.herald.co.zw", "target_uri": "http://www.herald.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=31353%3Adube-brings-a-ray-of-light&catid=63%3Arobson-sharuko&Itemid=159", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Dube brings <em>a</em> ray of light", "snippet": "Even for <em>a</em> football-mad columnist like me, you can&#x27;t help but join the pending celebrations on Tuesday as the world takes <em>a</em> bow to the greatest <em>boxer</em> to ever grace our planet -

in their judgment - done more in two years than what others failed to do, in a combined 10 years of service, in the seat of the Zifa chairmanship.\nTo those people Dube is an oasis of hope, in a desert of hopelessness, and an island of light, in an ocean of darkness, who provides the flicker of belief that tomorrow could bring a better day.\nIn a domestic football world that has always delivered a morass of mediocrity, for a fiercely loyal fan base that has somehow remained hopeful, Dube has come about as a man with a special gift who is providing the ray of light.\nHis electoral victory as Zifa boss was as emphatic as they will ever come, a 31-4 landslide that buttressed the football constituency's belief in his capacity to deliver, and his supporters believe he has fulfilled most of their wishes.\nHe charmed the Zifa councilors with the promise that the problems facing their association needed a man with a proven record of lifting such sinking organisations and his message won universal appeal among the members of the assembly.\nAfter all Dube is a very successful business executive, whose brilliant management skills helped turnaround the fortunes of the giant Premier Services Medical Aid Society, into the thriving business that it is today.\nLike every human being, Dube has his own failings, but his supporters believe that the good things he does in a selfless service to the national game far outweigh the isolated shortcomings that emerge, now and again, in his management of our football.\nOne of those people who fiercely support Dube as the best candidate to lead Zifa right now is the Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association president, Eddie \"Mboma\" Nyatanga.\nThis week Nyatanga hailed Dube as a distinguished leader, following his appointment into one of the top Fifa committees, saying this has come as a huge vote of confidence by the world governing football body in the Zifa boss' character.\nNyatanga said if Dube could be suitable, in Fifa's eyes, to be part of the committee that organises the Confederations Cup, then he surely was suitable to be Zifa president, not only for one term, but for two terms.\nIt hasn't been all smooth sailing for Dube but you can't fault his commitment to make things move and, if he is not using his financial resources to bail out the national team, then he is using his personal funds to pay the salaries of the Zifa employees.\nWhen you have someone pumping in more than US$550 000 from his private funds, just to ensure that some financial obligations at Zifa are taken care of in the past two years, then you can't certainly question his commitment to the project he is leading.\nDube is bullish these days and when he says that if it wasn't for his financial packages, which have been channeled into the Zifa coffers at regular intervals to oil the system at the association, the organisation would have collapsed, there are a lot of people who believe him.\nIt's hard to argue otherwise.\nWhen Dube wasn't in Harare last week, as he wound the clock on his Christmas and New Year holiday programme, we all saw the chaos that engulfed what was supposed to be a straight-forward trip by the Warriors to Botswana for a friendly international match.\nWithout the guidance and helping hand of their boss, Zifa turned into a theatre of confusion as the officials bungled one key aspect of the travel arrangements after the other and, twice, the trip was postponed until Mimosa Mining Company came with a US$10 000 donation to foot the expenses.\nThere were times, during the mayhem, when it became increasingly clear that there were better odds on the cancellation of the trip than on the Warriors making the journey and Botswana, who had requested the friendly to fine-tune their 2012 Nations Cup preparations, could only helplessly watch from a distance.\nIn contrast when Dube was around, and the team didn't have the money to fly to Mali for a 2012 Nations Cup qualifier, the Zifa boss tendered the title deeds of his house to the bank as a guarantee to secure a loan that was needed to underwrite the trip.\nIn contrast Botswana, which is just across the border, turned into a nightmare for Zifa - with their boss not available - while arranging for the Warriors to travel to Mali, stuck on the other side of West Africa, proved an easier task for the association, with their boss calling the shots.\nBut not everyone believes in Dube and those who have chosen the other side are very severe in their criticism of what is happening at 53 Livingstone Avenue.\nOne of them is Chris Sambo, the former PSL chief executive, who this week sent the following piece to this blog.\nZifa And Its Mistakes - Chris Sambo\nWhen I was doing Form Two at Harare Secondary School, my then English teacher, Fay Chung, who later became the Minister of Education, once severely reprimanded me for not learning from my mistakes.\nI somehow repeatedly got the spelling of the word rendezvous wrong in tests and, even up to this day, I sometimes get it wrong.\nIf we look at our football today, can we honestly say the current Zifa board has learnt from the mistakes of the past?\nThe answer is NO.\nWhile I have respect on the capabilities of certain individual board members, collectively the current Zifa board is in danger of becoming one of the worst to manage the national game.\nThe board lacks unity of purpose and some of their decisions appear to be motivated by geo-ethnic considerations.\nWith the coming in of Cuthbert Dube to the helm of our football, most of us were made to believe that the problems that were continually bedeviling our national game football were now a thing of the past.\nDespite assurances of turning around the financial fortunes of the organisation, it's a brutal fact that Zifa is now worse off, in terms of its finances, than when the current leadership came into office.\nAfter inheriting a deficit of US$610 000, the association is now over US$2 million in the red.\nThe current leadership promised us that the corporate world would arrive on the scene in a very big way once they got into office and that became a key factor in the electorate settling for them.\nBut that has certainly not happened and, in just over a month from now, Dube and his team will be in office for two years and they can't even point to one sponsor.\nDube is now supporting the association through his own finances.\nWhile appreciating his sacrifice, which comes at a huge cost, the practice cannot be sustained in the long-run and there is also a risk of this running into conflict with Fifa statutes.\nPlanning of international friendlies and international matches is still being carried out in a haphazard manner, just as was the case with the old leadership that was replaced.\nWe have instead watched countries such as Botswana, with no player resources to talk about, qualifying for the 2012 Nations Cup finals while we destroyed our campaign by putting selfish interests ahead of national ones.\nSince 2006, we have not qualified for any meaningful competition, we have even lost confidence in ourselves to the extent that we are now importing referees from other countries.\nCaf have even turned their back on our referees and, while we could send a referee to the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan/South Korea 10 years ago, we can't even send one to the 2012 Nations Cup finals.\nZifa made a lot of noises about Asiagate and attracted a lot of unwarranted international attention.\nBecause of the manner this exercise was carried out, it is very unlikely that they will secure prosecution of any player or official.\nI feel sorry for those board members who have been suspended. For how long should they be made to wait before they know their fate?\nJustice delayed is justice denied.\nRecent allegations of corruption and bribery against the Zifa president by one of his board members were damaging and, hopefully, when this drama ends, this will be proved to have been unfounded because it has the capacity to seriously damage our game.\nAnd if such allegations are not investigated, it would appear as if the system targets piranhas while the sharks swim freely.\nAs for our campaign for 2014 World Cup finals, it would appear we are heading for another disaster.\nBy now we should have secured a corporate partner who will sponsor our campaign.\nContractual agreements between Norman Mapeza and his assistants should be finalised and we all need to get the assurance that he and his team will be the one leading our campaign.\nAnd so do the players who also need stability in the technical camp.\nBy the time we start the 2013 Nations Cup campaign next month all financial resources and strategic plans should be in place.\nIn June 1996, the then Minister of Sport Education and Culture set up a Commission chaired by High Court Judge Paddington Garwe.\nAt the end of the exercise the Commission came up with 36 recommendations.\nOne of the most contentious issues raised in the Garwe Report was the bribing of councilors during Zifa elections, an issue which is still being raised 16 years later.\nIf Zifa could only implement 50% of those recommendations our football will never be the same again. With 12 minutes remaining at the Emirates on Tuesday night,\nMy Humble Contribution To The Debate\nFor all the challenges that have plagued Cuthbert Dube's first two years in charge of Zifa, for all the mud that has been thrown in his direction, for all the occasions that he has seemingly appeared to be coming short, I still believe he has done a pretty good job of it all.\nThe good things that he has done, in my humble analysis, far outweigh the occasions when he has come short.\nHe appeals to me as a very honest man who always gives his best shot and, even on the occasions that everything doesn't ultimately work out, you get the impression that he probably could not have done anything better.\nHonesty is a virtue and, in a domestic football family that has had its fair share of dark characters, Dube brings that refreshing comfort that he is not doing it for the money but he is doing it from the heart, even spending his money, just to try and make things tick.\nIt's easy to ignore, overnight, the crumbing organisation that he inherited and only those with an agenda to get him out, at whatever cost, will find refugee in the nonsense that cleaning the Zifa House needed just a year and therefore Dube has failed.\nIt's easy to ignore right now the fact that this Zifa board has spent two years staggering as a divided unit, with one powerful bloc pulling one side, and what happened when it came to the appointment of the national coach, with that Tom Saintfiet/Mapeza saga, clearly illustrated the deep divisions.\nMending those divisions and getting the board to speak with one voice and move in the same direction, was a huge task and, to his credit, Dube has apparently sorted out that challenge and you get the impression Zifa are united right now.\nAt least, we have moved from that chaotic situation where Dube would say one thing in the newspapers today and others, camouflaged in the disguise of sources, would say something completely different the next day.\nRather than criticise Dube for using his financial resources, as and when the situation has demanded, I believe that we should salute him for being there for his nation when challenges stalked the national game and threatened to drag it into its grave.\nYes, Dube came into power with a promise that he would get sponsors for Zifa but we have to give him the benefit of doubt that when he was making such promises he didn't know that the profile of the national game was about to be battered by the controversy that followed Asiagate.\nHe made the promises, assuming everything was normal, and you have to give him the benefit of doubt that, in a very normal environment where the landscape had not been poisoned by all the controversies that followed, which have nothing to do with Dube, chances are that his sponsors would have come on board now.\nYes, some will rightly argue that the Botswana FA handled their Asiagate challenge better than Zifa and were rewarded with the sponsors remaining on board and the Zebras qualifying for their maiden Nations Cup at the 2012 showcase in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.\nThe issue of vote-buying, in my humble analysis, is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury but ultimately signifying nothing.\nUnless someone or some people are there to provide credible evidence that they were bought to vote in this and that manner, I believe we should forget about this nonsense and move on.\nAny election generates a response and winners and losers always have a lot to say but it doesn't mean that anything that is said is credible and, after all, proving that someone was bought, when that person is saying he wasn't, is a wild goose chase.\nIf Fifa, who demonstrated a zero tolerance towards vote-buying by outlawing their vice-president Mohamed Bin Hammam from the game, have the guts to appoint Dube onto the organising committee of the 2013 Confederations Cup, then their message to those pushing the vote-buying agenda here is loud and clear - YOU HAVE NO CASE!\nIt's one thing your name being dragged into a scandal, the way we did to Brazilian legend Ronaldo in the Asiagate report, and it's another thing Fifa, or a disciplinary committee, confirming that you, indeed, are guilty of whether allegations that were piled against you.\nSo when Fifa endorses Ronaldo's appointment as the Brazilian head of his country's hosting of the 2014 World Cup, despite all the innuendoes carried in the Asiagate report that he received corrupt payments from Asian betting syndicates during the '98 World Cup finals, there is a strong message that we should read from the world football governing body. And, when Fifa appoints Dube to the organising committee of the 2013 Confederations Cup, despite all the innuendoes that have been raised by those who claim he was guilty of bribery in the countdown to the Zifa elections, there is a strong message that we should read from the world football governing body.\nDube is just halfway into a four-year term and, if you read the Zifa constitution well, you will realise that a vote of no confidence cannot be passed in his chairmanship.\nSo, I guess, rather than wasting all our time fighting and painting him as a monster, when he certainly is far away from that, why don't we give him the space to do what he promised he would do because, as far as I'm concerned, the Warriors' qualification battle for the 2013 Nations Cup finals is far more important than how Dube won the Zifa presidency.\nTwelve Is The Number Thierry\nThiery Henry scored his 12th goal against Leeds United in 12 appearances, wearing the number 12 shirt in the year 2012, scoring from exactly 12 yards, exactly 12 days after he first announced he was coming back to Arsenal and spotting a beard that has not been shaved in 12 months.\nIncredibly, 12 years and six months have passed from the time Henry joined the Gunners in August 1999 to the moment he scored that goal against Leeds in his comeback match for Arsenal. And, in case you were just thinking this is not all linked to fate, just count the number of letters in the name THIERRY HENRY and you will see that they add up to 12. Count the number of letters in the name of the coach who brought him to Arsenal, ARSENE WENGER, and they add up to 12.\nThe Greatest Turns 70\nEven for a football-mad columnist like me, you can't help but join the pending celebrations on Tuesday as the world takes a bow to the greatest boxer to ever grace our planet - Muhammad Ali.\nThe Greatest turns 70 and, for a man who dominated heavyweight boxing with a style that might never be seen again and who has bravely battled against Parkinson's in his later life, please take a bow.\nYes, Ali floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee and special sportsmen like him come once in a generation. From the Rumble In The Jungle against George Foreman in Kinshasa in '74 to the Thrilla in Manila against Joe Frazier in the Philippines, Ali charmed our hearts and minds.\nAlex Ferguson turned 70 on December 31, just two weeks ago, and as Ali turns 70 on Tuesday, you begin to wonder whether in the two weeks as 1941 gave way to 1942, the Almighty decided to create a group of very special people.\nTo God Be The Glory!\nCome on United!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"}, {"score": 385.30655, "uuid": "82736b31-321d-5a09-a95b-745893ad54e8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0913wb-80-22249", "target_hostname": "www.fscclub.com", "target_uri": "http://www.fscclub.com/history/box-hist-e.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1744709e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "New History of Women Boxing / (Female Single Combat Club)", "snippet": "Her most significant fight -- and the sports most significant fight since Martin-Gogarty -- comes June 8, 2001, when 8,000 fans and hundreds of media trek to upstate New York, for <em>Ali</em>-<em>Frazier</em> IV, <em>a</em> showdown with Jacqui <em>Frazier</em>, daughter of longtime <em>Ali</em> archrival <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "\u00d0\u00f3\u00f1\u00f1\u00ea\u00e0\u00ff \u00e2\u00e5\u00f0\u00f1\u00e8\u00ff\nWomen's boxing can trace it beginnings to London in the 1720's. During the following one and a half centuries women sporadically came out to the ring for exhibition and competitive fights as well as for prize bouts. In the second half of the 19th century women's boxing got publicity in the States and outside of it \u0096 thanks to Richard Fox and his \"Police Gazette\".\nThe real history of women's boxing began in the second part of the 20th century when women started literally storming athletic associations, authorities and boxing rings. In 1950's several female fighters staged professional fights - most notably Barbara Buttrick, JoAnn Hagen (Verhaegen), and Phyllis Kugler. The sport rekindled again in the 1970s thanks to the reckless efforts of several important trailblazers.\nThe 1970's were highlighted by many women\u0092s boxing \"firsts\" including many states lifting bans for women to box; issuing \"first time\" boxing licenses, sanctioning boxing matches; and the various commissions approving more than four rounds for women\u0092s bouts.\nTimelines:\n1904\nBoxing was introduced at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis.

Dooley and asked to be granted permission to judge pro fights. A week later, he wrote back and said that he would give her a hearing. SHAIN entered the hearing room on Jan. 6, 1975, and found out the next day that she had an unanimous vote to be a judge. Her first professional fight that she judged on was on the eve of Thanksgiving in 1975. Two years later, Sept. 29, 1977, she was at ringside in Madison Square Garden judging her first World championship bout with Muhammad Ali vs. Earnie Shavers. SHAIN WAS THE FIRST FEMALE JUDGE TO WORK A WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE BOUT. It was also the first time a woman judge Worked a professional fight at New York\u0092s Madison Square Garden. SHAIN earned a place in the Guinness Book of Sports Records and eventually became the subject of a Trivial Pursuit question. Eva Shain lost her battle with cancer in August of 1999.\n1975 -1978\nIn 1975, Caroline Svendsen receives the first documented boxing license in the United States in the state of Nevada, and has a sanctioned boxing match in a scheduled four-rounder in Virginia City, Nevada. In 1976, boxer Pat Pineda is the first woman to be licensed in the California; and in 1978, after an on-going lawsuit in the state of New York, three high-profile women boxers, Cathy \"Cat\" Davis, Jackie Tonawanda, and Marian \"Lady Tyger\" Trimiar receive their boxing licenses. There are many women who had received first-time licenses during this period, but these particular historical licensing events initiate a flurry of publicity that in turn encouraged other women to join the sport. (WBAN has spoken to past boxers from the 1950's who claim that they had received boxing licenses, but at this present time there has been no documentation to substantiate that information).\n1977\nBoxing ban lifted after almost 100 years since a professional boxing match had been held in Fayetteville, NC Boxing had been illegal in Cumberland County from 1880 until early in 1977 when the ban on the sport was lifted.

Tucker was backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, and ultimately was able to force the California Commission to change their regulations which at the time forbade female fighters from fighting more than four rounds.\nFebruary 1982\nJill Lafler, a 19-year-old Lansing Community College student, who wanted to be Michigan\u0092s first female Golden Gloves contestant and had filed a lawsuit to win that chance, dropped her lawsuit. Lafler had lost an early round of her lawsuit when the U.S. District Judge Wendell Miles ruled against her. Even though LAFLER dropped her lawsuit, it was noted that it had opened up a lot of eyes, and they realized that the (state) agency needed some type of need for governing body regulations on women\u0092s boxing.\nApril 1987\nFormer World Women's Lightweight Marian \"Lady Tyger\" Trimiar stages a well-publicized month long hunger strike, losing nearly 30 lbs., for the rights of women's boxing and to advocate better money and conditions for professional female boxers---even though she is protesting for others and not herself. Trimiar and others direct their picketing to the promoters at the time who are putting on televised cards. Trimiar tells the media, \"Unless women get more recognition, we will be fighting just as a novelty for the rest of our lives. There will be no future.\"\nApril 1992\nAfter eight-years in court in Massachusetts, Gail Grandchamp of North Adams, Massachusetts wins her battle to fight as in a ruling by a state Superior Court judge who rules it was illegal to deny someone a chance to box based on gender. During her battle to win the right to box as an amateur, she passes the age of 36, the maximum age for amateur fighters. Even though she knew it would not help her as an amateur, Grandchamp continues her successful efforts, and eventually did box professionally for a time.\nMarch 1993\nDallas Malloy, at 16 years old, became the first female to challenge USA Boxing's bylaw that did not allow women to compete, and sues them in federal court for gender discrimination. Malloy wins her case, which generates both national and international publicity. Malloy and Heather Poyner become the first to fight in the state of Washington in a sanctioned amateur bout. Even though Malloy was determined to pursue boxing, she stopped boxing in the next year, declaring that it was \"boring.\" (It should be noted that this event has been portrayed in the news media as a \"history first\" for women boxing in amateurs, but WBAN has actually dated sanctioned amateur boxing for women boxers in Minnesota, in 1978).\nJune 1993\nJO-ANNE NEWMAN of Aiken County was recognized as the FIRST WOMAN TO REFEREE AN AMATEUR BOXING MATCH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL JUNIOR OLYMPICS. Newman was the first and only woman referee in South Carolina to hold multiple state offices, including the South Carolina Junior Olympic Chairman, a position that she had been elected to since 1991.\nOctober 1993\nUSA Boxing adopts rules and regulations implementing women\u0092s amateur boxing into its amateur boxing program.\n1995\nIn 1995, the New York Daily News Golden Gloves yearly amateur tournament includes women in their event for the first time. An amateur female boxer, Dee Hamaguchi, is credited for breaking this barrier, allowing this event to become a breeding ground for future professional world champions. In 1994, Dee had applied to fight in this tournament without revealing that she was a female, mailing in her entry form using the initial \"D\", without giving away her gender. Unfortunately Dee did not get her schedule for the physical exam and did not participate.\n1996\nThe four-day amateur tournament in Augusta is a result of USA Boxing reaction to the increase in the number of women boxers. The spurt occurred after a Seattle-area woman\u0092s successful suit against the organization in 1991 for the right to compete. In 1993, women were recognized as members by USA Boxing, and today, membership has grown to 763 registered participants, compared with 340 in late 1996.\nMarch 1996\nChristy Martin vs. Deirdre Gogarty: Considered by many to be the birth of modern professional women\u0092s boxing, the two staged a bloody six-round slugfest clearly impressing those ringside and a world wide pay-per-view audience, upstaging Mike Tyson\u0092s easy win over Frank Bruno. A flood of worldwide coverage follows, including weeks later a Sports Illustrated cover story on Martin. Sadly, while Martin could have easily carried the torch for the sport, she makes it perfectly clear through many public comments she is not an advocate for women\u0092s boxing in general, but instead is only in the sport for one person - herself.\nNovember 1996\nAmateur Boxing Association of England voted in favor of lifting the 116-year ban against women boxing. Not everyone is in agreement with allowing girls as young as ten to spar in gyms and to take part in competition.\nJuly 1997\nUSA Boxing\u0092s first ever Women\u0092s National Championships.\nFebruary 1998\nLandmark lawsuit: Britain Jane \"The Fleetwood Assassin\" Couch takes the British Boxing Board of Control to task for sex discrimination over their refusal to grant her a license to fight in the UK.

Couch wins the right to \"fight\" and in Streatham, UK, on November 25, 1998, stops German Simona Lukic in the second round.\nOctober 1999\nWhat was billed as the \"first\" sanctioned bout between a man and a woman takes place in Seattle, Washington. Margaret McGregor faces male boxer Loi Chow in a fight scheduled for four two-minute rounds. This event took on international presence, and brought to the surface many troubling issues in the world of women's boxing. After all of the hoopla was over, it was determined that the fight would be considered an \"exhibition\" and therefore was far from being the \"first\" of mixed matches that have taken place off and on throughout the history of women's boxing.\nMuhammad Ali's Daughter, Laila \"She-Bee Stingin\" Ali, 21, makes her pro debut at the Turning Stone Casino, in Verona, New York. The news coverage leading up to this bout, and the media attention since she has gotten into the sport has surpassed any of the coverage of any one boxer on the scene in the past, and/or in the present. Her most significant fight -- and the sports most significant fight since Martin-Gogarty -- comes June 8, 2001, when 8,000 fans and hundreds of media trek to upstate New York, for Ali-Frazier IV, a showdown with Jacqui Frazier, daughter of longtime Ali archrival Joe Frazier. The two silence many critics with their spirited and entertaining eight-round bout, won by Ali. The fight draws more than 100,000 pay-per-view buys, again surprising the experts.\nAugust 2003\nTwo the most famous female boxers, Christy Martin and Leila Ali engaged in the persistent bout. Ali, who was much younger and much bigger but less technical than Martin managed to knock out her unbeatable opponent in the fourth round.\n"}, {"score": 384.9425, "uuid": "bb327f81-afba-522d-97fd-a0ce872613b7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1615wb-11-22710", "target_hostname": "washingtoninformer.com", "target_uri": "http://washingtoninformer.com/index.php/us/item/5761-the-washington-informer-celebrates-bhm", "page_rank": 1.1871686e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "The Washington Informer Celebrates BHM", "snippet": "Feb. 11 - today in 1996, Penn&#x27;s Baccalaureate Speaker <em>was</em> the Right Reverend Barbara Clementine Harris, <em>a</em> Philadelphian <em>who</em> <em>was</em> the first woman ever to become <em>a</em> bishop in the Anglican Communion. 12 - Birthday of William Felton Russell, <em>better</em> known as &quot;Bill&quot; Russel, he <em>was</em> player-coach of the Boston", "explanation": null, "document": "5\n(1 Vote)\nBlack History Month actually began as Black History Week in 1925, the brainchild of Carter G.

But nobody could dispute that the recently retired heavyweight was one of Britain\u0092s best ever. GRAHAM HOUSTON reviews a colourful career\nTOP DOG: Bugner was the most successful British heavyweight of the 1970s, and he managed to prolong his career for two decades more - Get\u00a0Big\u00a0Pic\nThe long, winding road that was Joe Bugner\u0092s boxing career came to an end on 13 June in his adopted homeland of Australia, when his American opponent, Levi Billups, was disqualified for low blows in the ninth round.\n\"Aussie Joe\", as he lately has been known, says there will be no more comebacks (he has made two already). This time I am inclined to believe him. He is 49, has been boxing professionally for 32 years (although in 11 of those years he was inactive) and his second wife, Marlene, says she has long wanted him to retire. Enough is enough, and Bugner is intelligent enough to know it.\nHe says that George Foreman\u0092s unlikely comeback success spurred him to give the game one, last try, in 1995, and he did pick up the Australian championship and a couple of trifling titles. But it was a far cry from the days when he was British, European and Commonwealth heavyweight champion in the 1970s.\nI was at ringside for most of his fights in the 1960s and \u009270s. I even covered Bugner in the London amateur championships in 1967, when he was outpointed by the vastly experienced south Londoner, Billy Wells, a cagey campaigner whose bald head made him look older than he was, in the heavyweight semi-finals.\nAlthough Bugner lost clearly, he fought with spirit, a mere 17-year-old and not much more than a promising novice up against a smaller man but a veteran who had won the Amateur Boxing Association title (British amateur title, for American readers).\nBugner\u0092s trainer and mentor, Andy Smith, decided he would have more control over the matching of Bugner were the big, blond teenager to turn professional.\nI would like to say I was there at the start. But when Bugner, from rural St. Ives in the county of Huntingdonshire, made his professional debut in December, 1967 - five days before Christmas in fact - I was elsewhere.\nBugner\u0092s debut took place at the London Hilton on a show staged by the Anglo-American Sporting Club. In the main event, the welterweight Ralph Charles was meeting an ordinary Frenchman, while Bugner\u0092s opponent was one Paul Brown, a trial horse from Birmingham by way of Jamaica. I had a press pass for the show, but someone I was seeing wanted me to accompany her to a staff Christmas party.\nOh, well, I thought, I won\u0092t be missing much: Ralph Charles will handle the Frenchman easily and Bugner\u0092s got a guaranteed win.\nRight on the first count, as Charles won in five rounds, but wrong on the second: Bugner got hit on the chin, by a big right, and was knocked out in the third round.\nI thought, after such a shocking setback, that Bugner was never going to amount to anything as a boxer - just a big, well-built young man (he was a former schools discus champ) who could not take a punch.\nBut Bugner became one of the most successful British heavyweights ever, making a record six defences of the European title in two reigns as champion.\nAnd anyone who was there for his debut could never have imagined that Bugner would within six years be sharing the ring with heavyweight legends Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in major (though losing) fights.\nAt 6ft 3ins, Bugner was big enough, jabbed well and boxed capably. When he let his punches go, he could hurt an opponent. And, despite the first-fight KO, he was to prove durable, too.\nStill, the general reaction of veteran boxing observers who look back on Bugner\u0092s career is likely to be one of disappointment. He looked the part physically but failed to deliver, they will tell you. Some say that Bugner was never a natural aggressor, that his heart simply was not in boxing - especially after an early opponent, a Trinidadian journeyman named Ulric Regis, died from a brain injury days after being outpointed by Bugner.\nOthers might blame the training methods of Andy Smith, the trainer-manager, for instilling in Bugner an excessively defensive style.\nBut Bugner stopped 12 of his next 13 opponents after being knocked out by Paul Brown. This included four one-round wins.\nAt this stage of his career, Bugner was certainly letting his punches fly, as he did the night at the Royal Albert Hall in February 1969, when Bugner met a slugging Scot named Terry Feeley. Feeley had a reputation as a heavy hitter, and his record included a two-round win over Bugner\u0092s old rival, Paul Brown. But Bugner overpowered and outclassed Feeley in the opening round. I remember him throwing a left hook that did not land squarely, and, with his glove hooked around Feeley\u0092s head, simply tossing his opponent to the floor.\nThere were people in the arena that night who were saying that, finally, Britain had a genuine, exciting, heavyweight prospect.\nBut in his next fight, Bugner was unimpressive in outpointing Ulric Regis at the old Shoreditch Town Hall in east London. The fight was booed, as was the verdict when Bugner\u0092s hand was raised after eight rather desultory rounds, although my impression was that Bugner dominated.\nHe had not seemed to punish Regis all that heavily, but then came the news that the boxer from Trinidad had been taken to hospital and undergone a brain operation.\nRegis died, and perhaps something went out of Bugner after that. Or maybe, despite his run of quick wins, he had never really been the aggressor that those victories made him out to be.\nBugner developed poise and boxing acumen over the years that followed but displays of two-fisted fighting were rare.\nHe had some dull fights and a few positively dismal appearances, the most famous being his non-challenge against heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in 1975.\nBut on the way up, matchmaker, Mickey Duff generally did a superb job of making fights for Bugner against the right sort of opponents at the right time, often against well-known veterans whose decline had not yet become glaringly obvious.\nBugner did his part, winning consistently. He had a big following. Yet, generally speaking, the fans never really embraced Bugner in a consistent way. Some thought it was because he was born in Hungary, or because he received an unpopular points victory over the folk hero Henry Cooper in 1971 - or both.\nRather, I believe, the problem was that the fans truly wanted Bugner to do well only for him to fall short of expectations.\nThere were jeers, to be sure, but there were also nights when Bugner heard the cheers. For instance, he had a Royal Albert Hall crowd roaring when he won a narrow points victory over the hulking Irish-American Jack O\u0092Halloran, who was 6ft 5ins, not only taller but considerably heftier than Bugner.\nO\u0092Halloran was not especially talented but he had the height, the reach and the weight, and in the first few rounds he scored points with a surprisingly quick left jab. Bugner looked tense and apprehensive early - a bit overawed, in fact. But by the middle of the fight Bugner was coming on, starting to open up. The last few rounds were all Bugner as he backed up the much bigger man and even had the massive O\u0092Halloran looking shaky.\nAfter this there were a series of technically efficient showings from Bugner - and some dreary ones. He was outsmarted by a veteran American southpaw named Dick Hall and could only get a draw with a Scots-born Canadian named Bill Drover. But he ended the career of ex-British champ Brian London in five rounds and easily outpointed well-respected British opponents Johnny Prescott and Carl Gizzi as well as defeating American Ray Patterson (Floyd\u0092s younger brother) and Manuel Ramos, a Mexican who had faced Frazier in a title fight.\nBugner was the underdog against Henry Cooper, but after 15 rounds referee Harry Gibbs had it in Bugner\u0092s favour by the narrowest margin of a quarter-point under the old fractional method used in Britain at the time. There was much booing from the packed, 10,000 crowd at Wembley and almost all the writers had Cooper winning.\nStill, the 21-year-old Bugner was now British, Commonwealth and European champ. Had he instantly produced a couple of dramatic performances I am sure that the fuss over the Cooper verdict would have been overcome. But instead Bugner seemed to be regressing in his first two fights after the win over Cooper. First, Bugner barely defeated the willing but ordinary German, Jurgen Blin, in a European title defence, and then he was soundly outpointed over 15 rounds by the earnest if inelegant southpaw, Jack Bodell, to lose the three titles.\nThere was a point in the later rounds when Bodell seemed to run out of gas, physically sagging, and it appeared that Bugner could yet save the day with a determined assault. But Bugner let the opportunity pass him by, and it was Bodell who, as we now say, sucked it up. Bodell finished strongly, even sending a demoralised Bugner to the canvas in the 14th round.\nPhysically, in the ring with Bodell, Bugner looked like one of those Greek-god statues but unfortunately was nearly as lifeless.\nPerhaps it had all happened too quickly. Maybe he faltered emotionally. The reaction to his win over Cooper must have been upsetting. It was as though Bugner felt he could not do anything right as far as the public was concerned, so why bother?\nBut Bugner pulled himself together. He was praised for gamely going 12 rounds with Muhammad Ali, despite getting cut over the eye, in February 1973, the year before Ali stunned George Foreman.\nAnd in July 1973, came what I always will regard as Bugner\u0092s greatest night, when he lost honourably to Joe Frazier in a gruelling, compelling 12-round struggle at Earls Court in west London.\nBugner\u0092s nose was bloodied, he was on the point of being overwhelmed at times, but he banged back and had Frazier\u0092s left eye swollen and closing. And, in the 10th round, Bugner finally answered the critics who doubted his courage when, after being knocked down, he not only got off the floor but buckled Smokin\u0092 Joe\u0092s knees with a cracking right-hander.\nIt was hot and cold showings after that. We had the passive 15 rounds with Ali in Kuala Lumpur, followed by a one-round wipe-out over a British rival, Richard Dunn, in the most aggressive showing from Bugner since his beginning days as a professional. Dunn, a Yorkshire southpaw who had been five rounds with Ali, never had a chance to get into the fight against Bugner.\nAnd yet, in his next fight after that, Bugner went back to his conservative, safety-first ways when being outpointed by ex-convict Ron Lyle at Las Vegas. As with Jack Bodell, it was a fight that, it seemed, Bugner could have won - should have won - if only he had dug down and put some pressure on the other man instead of backing up and allowing himself to be outhustled.\nThis was in March 1977, and it was followed by a three-year retirement. Bugner came back to try his luck in America, but lost to Earnie Shavers in two rounds (due to a cut, although he was dropped in that fight).\nHe was promoted for a while by Frank Warren in London and won four fights, but in June 1983, at Atlantic City, in a fight seen live on American and British national television, he was well outpointed by the much smaller, 11-years-younger Marvis Frazier, son of Smokin\u0092 Joe.\nBy 1986 Bugner was living in Australia, where he and wife Marlene were operating a vineyard two hours north of Sydney. Three successive wins in Australia over \"name\" heavyweight veterans - former contenders James Tillis and David Bey and ex-champ Greg Page - earned Bugner a final big payday in Britain, against Frank Bruno at Tottenham Hotspur football ground in north London in October 1987. Predictably, Bugner was battered in eight rounds but the old pro took his lumps gamely.\nThat looked like the end for Bugner, but eight years later he was back again, aged 45 and a grandfather. He had been hammered by the recession of 1989, the vineyard had failed and he estimated having lost one and a half million Australian dollars. He was not ashamed to admit he needed the money.\nTalk of a big fight with George Foreman was fantasy on Bugner\u0092s part, but he did win the Aussie title, and in July last year could actually call himself a world champ - as recognised by a small-time sanctioner - after James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith suffered a dislocated shoulder in the opening round. The combined ages of the two men totalled 93 years.\nThe fight with Levi Billups was in effect a farewell performance. Bugner\u0092s wife of 22 years, Marlene, said she has insisted that there will be no more comebacks. This time, she told reporters, the retirement is definite. Bugner said: \"I\u0092ve had a very good run,\" and indeed he has.\nHe leaves the game - finally - with a record of 69 wins, 13 losses and a draw, and he stopped 41 opponents.\nAmericans will remember Bugner mostly for the way he covered up for almost the entire 15 rounds against Ali, but British boxing followers of a certain age will know that Bugner had far better nights.\nI cannot think of any British heavyweight who could have fought a better, or braver, fight against Joe Frazier than Bugner did that warm July night in 1973.\nA case could be made for Bugner having been the best heavyweight ever produced in Britain (Lennox Lewis, although London-born, came through the Canadian amateur system before returning to Britain to turn professional).\nBugner frustrated us, but also, on occasion, thrilled us. He created considerable excitement during his rise to the top, remained a big name and was involved in some of the biggest British fights of the 1970s.\nAlthough Bugner talked a far better fight than he actually fought when he came back to Britain to meet Bruno, it was just Joe doing his bit to hype the event. There was never any malice in Bugner, and his good nature, the way he never took himself too seriously, struck a chord with the down-to-earth Australians.\nWe may never know the full impact, if any, the death of Ulric Regis had on Bugner\u0092s career. My own feeling is that Bugner never really liked to hit people for a living. He thought too much, and never really had the basic instinct of a fighter. But for all that, Joe didn\u0092t do badly - not badly at all.\nThat fight\nJoe Bugner\u0092s points win over Henry Cooper in March 1971, was one of the most controversial in British ring history. Referee Harry Gibbs, the sole arbiter as is still the custom with British title fights, had the boxers dead-level after 14 rounds. But Bugner clearly outworked a tiring Cooper in the last round, snatching victory on referee Gibbs\u0092s card by 733/4 points to 731/2 under the old quarter-point method.\nI, too, had Bugner pulling out the win although the overwhelming reaction was one of outrage. In the BBC-TV recording, shown the next evening, commentator Harry Carpenter exclaimed: \"I find that amazing!\" when Gibbs raised Bugner\u0092s arm.\nMy impression was that Bugner had outscored Cooper in the early rounds, then let the fight slip away as Cooper came on towards the end. It was surprising to all of us at ringside on the night that the 36-year-old Cooper was closing more strongly than his 21-year-old opponent: the late rounds traditionally favour the younger man. I can remember that Cooper dominated the 12th, 13th and 14th rounds to such an extent that there seemed no way Bugner could halt the older man\u0092s momentum.\nBut then Cooper\u0092s age and the exertions of the previous 14 rounds seemed to catch up with him as Bugner finally, in the last round, reasserted himself. It was as if Bugner had shut down mentally for three rounds in a row but suddenly realised that he still felt strong, that there were just three minutes to go, that he was unlikely to be knocked out and simply decided, as we say today, to go for it.\nIn his autobiography, Box On, Gibbs wrote that Cooper appeared to accept the decision and added: \"The crowd reaction in protest was predictable, and as I remember it not particularly hostile despite the boos. Henry was London\u0092s idol and I suppose seventy five per cent of those in the hall came to see him win.\"\nGibbs\u0092s scoresheet was printed in the book, showing he had given six rounds to Bugner, five to Cooper and four even.\nWhen the film of the fight was shown in its entirety the next evening, the reaction of many of those who watched it seemed to have been that the fight had indeed been desperately close.\nAlso available to read from\nissue:\n"}], [{"score": 367.84622, "uuid": "de4546a2-a4bd-5dc4-8493-12c67f8ac28c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1909wb-61-22447", "target_hostname": "www.tomorrowpictures.tv", "target_uri": "http://www.tomorrowpictures.tv/2011/11/", "page_rank": 1.6188952e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "2011 November Archive at TomorrowPictures.tv", "snippet": "<em>Frazier</em> defeated <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>. in the highly-anticipated \u201cFight of the Century\u201d in 1971 and became the heavyweight champion of the world.", "explanation": null, "document": "Flash\nThe mysterious death of renowned actress Natalie Wood has been brought back to light.

Would Magic Johnson, Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe or Ken Griffey, Jr.? Will Venus Williams?\nWould Jim Brown have been better received if he had not been so protective of and at ease with his Blackness? It can hardly be denied that Jim Brown was as great a football player as Michael Jordan is a basketball player. But when Brown made his excellence clear to the world, he was not greeted with open arms, especially after it became clear that he was not going to abandon his Black value system. Sure, some of the resistance he faced was probably due to the time period, but to leave it at that would be dis-educational. Brown was honored to be Black, he didn't want to be white. That was the key to Jim Brown being less popular than an athlete of his calibre should have been.\nThere is probably no documentation stating that Craig Hodges was prematurely released by the Chicago Bulls because of his openly expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of Black People. No, there probably is no such document, but We know how that works. Hodges had the skills, was one of the best three point shooters in the league in fact; but he didn't go out of his way to accommodate white people. A Black athlete has to accommodate white people in white America. Otherwise, s/he will not become popular or make the kind of money he or she is deserving of.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system. CLICK HERE and order some valuable reading materials .\nHave you noticed: the most popular Black athletes go to predominantly white schools, where they directly or indirectly are encouraged to cross into the white world. The less popular ones either do not attend predominantly white schools or attend them while maintaining contact with the people in the 'hood. In short, the less popular Black athletes prefer to not cross over when they are given the opportunity to do so.\nWhat does this reluctance to cross over represent? It represents a preference for what one grew up with, what one is accustomed to, what one knows about. It represents a statement; that given the choice between the white value system and the Black value system, one prefers the Black value system. Given the choice between the white way of life and the Black way of life, one prefers the Black way. A statement such as that by a popular athlete would make it easier for that athlete's fans to remain true to their roots. But Black People who remain true to their roots upsets the comfort zone of white people and white power advocates.\nSo, white power uses its institutions to make Black athletes aware of how they are expected to act. They don't just come right out and say it, but they let the athletes know via indirect and subliminal channels. The most popular athletes keel over and do as white power \"suggests.\" The others resist, in some way or another, and are penalized; that is, they receive smaller monetary compensation and have to defend their character against damaging assaults and distortions.\nWhatever his/her response, the Black athlete becomes a messenger. The ones who choose Black even when given the opportunity to cross over to white give other Blacks the message that it's alright to be Black and appreciate what is Black while earning a decent living. But white people get a different message. The message whites get is that of a defiant Black athlete, one who does not appreciate the opportunity whites have given him/her. To make sure everyone understands his \"place,\" whites must tear that athlete down, make an example of him/her, and make it clear to all of the other athletes that they will come out on the short end if they do not play the game according to the dictates of white people and white power.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system.

Ali is held in high esteem by many whites, but We must not forget that Ali was despised and hated when he first hit the scene. He was viewed as a rebel, as one who had the nerve to say Black was beautiful, and white people wanted to see someone whip him. When Ali fought Sonny Liston, white people wanted Liston to whip Ali, even though they did not like Liston. When Ali fought Floyd Patterson, white people wanted Patterson to whip Ali. When Ali fought Joe Frazier, they wanted Frazier to whip Ali. After the Liston fight, when Ali revealed his conversion to Islam and association with Black Power advocates like Malcolm X, Ali was attacked mercilessly, prejudicially. Ali then magnified his \"sins\" by publicly questioning the legitimacy of the Viet Nam War and refusing to serve in the United States Army. Ali was simply not setting the example white power wanted individuals of his stature to set, and Ali was made aware of his \"transgression.\"\nWhen faced with the wrath of white power, Ali went about the business of proving that he was no threat. He put adequate space between himself and the Blacks who were most concerned about the well being of Black People. As he did this, white people and white power became less alarmed by him, rewarded him more and more handsomely and, over the years, put Ali on one of their highest pedestals. But this happened only after he accepted the validity of white values and standards as opposed to Black values and standards. Only when he abandoned his own beliefs and accepted the superiority of the white way did he receive the full rewards that an athlete of his calibre was deserving of.\nBoxers are the least respected and most attacked of popular athletes. Why? Generally speaking, boxers do not develop their talents at a college or university. Bluntly stated, boxers don't attend predominantly white prep schools or colleges and are therefore not exposed to the subtle yet systematic brainwashing process that colleges and universities take people through. What boxers know, what they tend to represent, what they tend to appreciate, is what they learned in the 'hood. And much of what they learned about white people and white power did not endear them to the white value system. This, naturally leads Us to Mike Tyson.\n[ MultiServicesShops&Mall ][ Ads ][ Buy Form ]\nIf We put all of the pieces together, it is clear that Mike Tyson represents, either deliberately or uncannily, everything that makes white people feel uncomfortable about a succesful and highly visible Black person. To whites, Mike Tyson is, let us say, a potential Malcolm X with millions of dollars and a lot of supporters. This is not to say that Tyson is a thinker of Malcolm X's quality, or a proponent of Black Power like Malcolm X was, or a person who acts in the interest of Black People like Malcolm X did. What Tyson's political/racial leanings are are beyond my scope of knowledge, and beyond that og white people. But facts and reality do not matter to white people when they have an agenda. What Tyson is is what whites imagine him to be, and what they imagine him to be is what they make him into by way of their institutions, particularly their media. What whites see in Tyson is a highly visible representative of the Black option white people fear most. Tyson, deliberately or uncannily, insists on the legitimacy of the Black reality. Tyson, deliberately or uncannily, rejects the \"foregone conclusion\" that the white way of life, the white value system, is better than any system that represents or validates the Black reality and the Black response to that reality.\nIt is amazing that a so-called educated people could unscientifically attack an individual's intelligence in the manner white \"professionals\" attack the intelligence of Mike Tyson. I have had very little contact with professional athletes, but based on interviews I have seen and articles I have read, I think Tyson tries to address issues at a level of philosophical profundity that few popular athletes have demonstrated. It seems to be that he is an extremely intelligent person--- I feel certain about that. His shortcoming, in part at least, might lie in the fact that he has not been able to put enough of the relevant pieces together that can lead him to peace of mind. I don't think he understands that anger is an appropriate response under some circumstances. I don't think he realizes the extent to which white power had downgraded his life (and the life of every Black individual) before he was even born, paving for him an easy path to anti-social behavior, juvenile delinquency, a troubled soul and failure.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system.

He has to learn how to slip those racist punches. Whether he commits a crime or not, he will be made and treated as a criminal. Whether he has admirable personal traits or not, he will be projected as a brute, a menace to himself, his family and society in general. Whether he proves to be a careful manager of his finances or not, he will be presented as an extravagant spender who will end up broke, having wrecklessly lost every one of his millions. Tyson will be made an example of, has been made an example of, and white power will use him and others like him to send the \"picture\" to other highly visible Blacks.\nAlbert Belle apparently has not gotten the \"picture\" yet. White people want Albert Belle to act like they want him to act. Belle has refused, either deliberately or unwittingly, but whites have not failed to blatantly assasinate his character in the manner they assassinated Mike Tyson's. The same is true for gifted athletes like Chris Webber and Allen Iverson. Success in the white scheme of things means presenting the \"right\" image to the white boys, white girls and white adults that enjoy seeing gifted athletes play ball. You can't present the \"right\" image if you continue to be real with your homeboys.\nMost athletes with star like abilities, Rasheed Wallace is an example, don't seem to have a political ideology at all, yet they are steadily under a white light of criticism because of the way they look, how they dress or who they hang out with. They cause white power's danger alarm to go off, and white people immediately begin to whip the questionable athlete into shape. Should the athlete put up too much resistance, white power makes life hell for them and less rewarding. This is the choice that is in store for up and comers like Venus Williams (who has all the the abilities and intangibles to become a huge star). The question is, \"Will she cave in to the demands of white power?\" Will she cross over and, in so doing, pass along the message to all of her fans that the white value system is superior to a Black value system, that white power is preferable to Black power? Or will she stand her ground, in much the manner that her father seems inclined to do, state the truth as she believes it and let the chips fall where they may?\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system.

An athlete has every right in the world to represent his/her own reality. If others feel threatened by this, then it is those others who are maladjusted, not the athlete. Let's be sensible: no one should break the law, provided that the law is just, but no one should be obligated to abandon their roots and home people simply because they represent values that do not set well with the bastions of the status quo. Black athletes are informed, by way of words, actions and signals, that they must respond to the masses of Black People in much the same way white people do if they expect to be properly compensated; that is, they must ignore the masses of Black People to whatever extent possible, abandon them if push comes to shove and make it crystal clear that the value system of white America is superior to that of Black America.\nSadly enough, most Black athletes make it clear that they get the \"picture.\" Some start off refusing to buckle under, but as they become bombarded with financial considerations and stressed out by the pressure, most start submitting. How unfortunate that is for Us as a People.\nNeither high visibility persons nor anyone else should participate in criminal activities, but personal preferences can not be categorically equated to crimes. The fact that high visibility persons of African descent are attacked and made the objects of character assasination simply because their likes and dislikes do not mirror those of white America is itself criminal. Therefore, the whites who perpetuate these activities are the ones who should be the focus of investigations and intense media scrutiny. However, character assassination is a small crime compared to the insidious, low-down, evil essence of the \"make the highly visible Blacks do right\" process. At its sinister root, one finds white power using high visibility Blacks to \"teach\" the Black masses that white power is better, that white values are superior, and that successful Blacks are better off putting space between themselves and other Blacks. The message is that anything Black is, at best, second rate, so it is better for Black People to not be about Blackness.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system.

Would Magic Johnson, Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe or Ken Griffey, Jr.? Will Venus Williams?\nWould Jim Brown have been better received if he had not been so protective of and at ease with his Blackness? It can hardly be denied that Jim Brown was as great a football player as Michael Jordan is a basketball player. But when Brown made his excellence clear to the world, he was not greeted with open arms, especially after it became clear that he was not going to abandon his Black value system. Sure, some of the resistance he faced was probably due to the time period, but to leave it at that would be dis-educational. Brown was honored to be Black, he didn't want to be white. That was the key to Jim Brown being less popular than an athlete of his calibre should have been.\nThere is probably no documentation stating that Craig Hodges was prematurely released by the Chicago Bulls because of his openly expressed dissatisfaction with the treatment of Black People. No, there probably is no such document, but We know how that works. Hodges had the skills, was one of the best three point shooters in the league in fact; but he didn't go out of his way to accommodate white people. A Black athlete has to accommodate white people in white America. Otherwise, s/he will not become popular or make the kind of money he or she is deserving of.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system. CLICK HERE and order some valuable reading materials .\nHave you noticed: the most popular Black athletes go to predominantly white schools, where they directly or indirectly are encouraged to cross into the white world. The less popular ones either do not attend predominantly white schools or attend them while maintaining contact with the people in the 'hood. In short, the less popular Black athletes prefer to not cross over when they are given the opportunity to do so.\nWhat does this reluctance to cross over represent? It represents a preference for what one grew up with, what one is accustomed to, what one knows about. It represents a statement; that given the choice between the white value system and the Black value system, one prefers the Black value system. Given the choice between the white way of life and the Black way of life, one prefers the Black way. A statement such as that by a popular athlete would make it easier for that athlete's fans to remain true to their roots. But Black People who remain true to their roots upsets the comfort zone of white people and white power advocates.\nSo, white power uses its institutions to make Black athletes aware of how they are expected to act. They don't just come right out and say it, but they let the athletes know via indirect and subliminal channels. The most popular athletes keel over and do as white power \"suggests.\" The others resist, in some way or another, and are penalized; that is, they receive smaller monetary compensation and have to defend their character against damaging assaults and distortions.\nWhatever his/her response, the Black athlete becomes a messenger. The ones who choose Black even when given the opportunity to cross over to white give other Blacks the message that it's alright to be Black and appreciate what is Black while earning a decent living. But white people get a different message. The message whites get is that of a defiant Black athlete, one who does not appreciate the opportunity whites have given him/her. To make sure everyone understands his \"place,\" whites must tear that athlete down, make an example of him/her, and make it clear to all of the other athletes that they will come out on the short end if they do not play the game according to the dictates of white people and white power.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system.

Ali is held in high esteem by many whites, but We must not forget that Ali was despised and hated when he first hit the scene. He was viewed as a rebel, as one who had the nerve to say Black was beautiful, and white people wanted to see someone whip him. When Ali fought Sonny Liston, white people wanted Liston to whip Ali, even though they did not like Liston. When Ali fought Floyd Patterson, white people wanted Patterson to whip Ali. When Ali fought Joe Frazier, they wanted Frazier to whip Ali. After the Liston fight, when Ali revealed his conversion to Islam and association with Black Power advocates like Malcolm X, Ali was attacked mercilessly, prejudicially. Ali then magnified his \"sins\" by publicly questioning the legitimacy of the Viet Nam War and refusing to serve in the United States Army. Ali was simply not setting the example white power wanted individuals of his stature to set, and Ali was made aware of his \"transgression.\"\nWhen faced with the wrath of white power, Ali went about the business of proving that he was no threat. He put adequate space between himself and the Blacks who were most concerned about the well being of Black People. As he did this, white people and white power became less alarmed by him, rewarded him more and more handsomely and, over the years, put Ali on one of their highest pedestals. But this happened only after he accepted the validity of white values and standards as opposed to Black values and standards. Only when he abandoned his own beliefs and accepted the superiority of the white way did he receive the full rewards that an athlete of his calibre was deserving of.\nBoxers are the least respected and most attacked of popular athletes. Why? Generally speaking, boxers do not develop their talents at a college or university. Bluntly stated, boxers don't attend predominantly white prep schools or colleges and are therefore not exposed to the subtle yet systematic brainwashing process that colleges and universities take people through. What boxers know, what they tend to represent, what they tend to appreciate, is what they learned in the 'hood. And much of what they learned about white people and white power did not endear them to the white value system. This, naturally leads Us to Mike Tyson.\n[ MultiServicesShops&Mall ][ Ads ][ Buy Form ]\nIf We put all of the pieces together, it is clear that Mike Tyson represents, either deliberately or uncannily, everything that makes white people feel uncomfortable about a succesful and highly visible Black person. To whites, Mike Tyson is, let us say, a potential Malcolm X with millions of dollars and a lot of supporters. This is not to say that Tyson is a thinker of Malcolm X's quality, or a proponent of Black Power like Malcolm X was, or a person who acts in the interest of Black People like Malcolm X did. What Tyson's political/racial leanings are are beyond my scope of knowledge, and beyond that og white people. But facts and reality do not matter to white people when they have an agenda. What Tyson is is what whites imagine him to be, and what they imagine him to be is what they make him into by way of their institutions, particularly their media. What whites see in Tyson is a highly visible representative of the Black option white people fear most. Tyson, deliberately or uncannily, insists on the legitimacy of the Black reality. Tyson, deliberately or uncannily, rejects the \"foregone conclusion\" that the white way of life, the white value system, is better than any system that represents or validates the Black reality and the Black response to that reality.\nIt is amazing that a so-called educated people could unscientifically attack an individual's intelligence in the manner white \"professionals\" attack the intelligence of Mike Tyson. I have had very little contact with professional athletes, but based on interviews I have seen and articles I have read, I think Tyson tries to address issues at a level of philosophical profundity that few popular athletes have demonstrated. It seems to be that he is an extremely intelligent person--- I feel certain about that. His shortcoming, in part at least, might lie in the fact that he has not been able to put enough of the relevant pieces together that can lead him to peace of mind. I don't think he understands that anger is an appropriate response under some circumstances. I don't think he realizes the extent to which white power had downgraded his life (and the life of every Black individual) before he was even born, paving for him an easy path to anti-social behavior, juvenile delinquency, a troubled soul and failure.\nHelp support this free, alternative educational system.

He has to learn how to slip those racist punches. Whether he commits a crime or not, he will be made and treated as a criminal. Whether he has admirable personal traits or not, he will be projected as a brute, a menace to himself, his family and society in general. Whether he proves to be a careful manager of his finances or not, he will be presented as an extravagant spender who will end up broke, having wrecklessly lost every one of his millions. Tyson will be made an example of, has been made an example of, and white power will use him and others like him to send the \"picture\" to other highly visible Blacks.\nAlbert Belle apparently has not gotten the \"picture\" yet. White people want Albert Belle to act like they want him to act. Belle has refused, either deliberately or unwittingly, but whites have not failed to blatantly assasinate his character in the manner they assassinated Mike Tyson's. The same is true for gifted athletes like Chris Webber and Allen Iverson.

Those looking for a more authentic interpretation of the sport, Knockout Kings 2000, despite its flaws, is attractive for its many impressive features. Its impressive lineup of boxers (which includes the WB's Marlon Wayans and NBA's Tim Duncan!?!) is simply unsurpassed and there's a level of dignity and respect for the sport. But be weary of the complex controls that will reward those who bone-up, but frustrate those looking for a quick fix.\nIn the high-risk industry of interactive entertainment, releasing a game across multiple platforms is a cost-effective method of maximizing profits using minimal resources. To state it plainly, companies get to hock the same lousy game over more platforms in hopes of catching more guppies in a larger pond. This practice usually leads hardcore gamers, who would naturally own more than one platform, into a quandary having to figure out which subtly different version would fancy their particular taste the most. For game reviewers like myself, part of my job is to inform such gamers of the slight, yet significant differences between these platform jumpers and to do so, we have to laboriously play through the same title two to three times over (depending on how many versions are available). Surprisingly, such was not the case with Knockout Kings 2000 (KK2000) because the differences between the two versions released were anything but subtle. While the Nintendo 64 version sported arcade qualities like power-up punches and outrageous flips, the PlayStation one delivered a more well-rounded product containing realistic simulation coupled with an arcade slugfest. This review here will focus on the PlayStation version.\nBoth Dale and I had serious reservations about the N64 version because the prospect of legendary fighters like Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Sugar Ray Leonard participating in silly and over-the-top romps didn't seem quite right to us. A game with such significant figures, we thought, would be more appropriate if it were a serious representation with a focus on authenticity. Moving on now to the PSX version, which has an even more impressive lineup (sans Iron Mike, Prince Nasim, and George Foreman), it's worth noting that right off the bat, it does a better job of honoring legendary and contemporary boxers alike not just in its visuals, but in its gameplay as well.\nIn terms of modes offered, the most engaging is the 'Career' mode where players can create their own personalized fighter, slowly develop his boxing skills, and then go for the championship in his respective weight class. Then there's the 'classic' mode that allows players to simulate legendary matches like the Thrilla in Manilla (Ali vs. Frazier), or Leonard vs. Durant or Leonard vs. Hagler. Mini-biographies for the huge cast of boxers are even included. Finally, of course, there is the obligatory antithesis, Slugfest mode, which allows for less serious boxing fans to pit hefty boxers like Butterbean against lighter peers like De La Hoya, complete with power-up punches and other arcade touches. Though contrary to the strengths of the game, the Slugfest mode isn't a blemish mainly because it's here as an addition rather than as an integral part of the overall package.\nKK2000 plays like a no-nonsense, yet full-featured interpretation of boxing. If you've ever seen it in the ring, you can probably do it in the game (with the exception of having some idiot parachuting into the ring and, thankfully, the patented Tyson-ear chomp). Lunging hooks, combination flurries, and clinches are all here, as well as the less sportsmanlike low blows, elbows, and, my personal favorite, kidney punches. Every button on the PlayStation controller is utilized (for better or worse) with the most basic punches relegated to the four main buttons while blocking is handled with the L1 (high) and L2 (low) shoulder buttons. Things start to get hairy, however, when the player is called upon to press two or more buttons in conjunction (to initiate certain moves) right in the middle of a flurry.\nFor instance, along with low blocking, depressing the L2 button is required for lower body shots. But holding down the R1 button will then convert the four main buttons into flurry punches. Throw in holding down the R2 and those punches turn into powerful lunging ones. Now holding down R1 and R2 at the same time will convert the four main buttons into dirty attacks like low blows. Still with me? Holding down L1 and R1 will put two combatants in a clinch and then the four main buttons will execute rabbit punches, but hold down the R1 during a clinch and you'll get kidney blows. On top of that, signature attacks require pressing two of the four main buttons together and don't even get me started on the combinations outside of the flurries that require Tekken-like combo patterns. Sound confusing? You bet it is. It took me quite a while to come to grips with the control scheme and you better believe your casual gamer is going to give up long before that. Thankfully, training sessions incurred during the 'career' mode will actually try to 'school' players on how to properly execute the extensive techniques, but don't expect the training to be as comprehensive as it should have been considering the complexity of the controls.\nAside from the dense controls, I also had minor issues with KK2000 being billed as a realistic simulator. For the most part, KK2000 delivers what it promises, but strangely enough, I was able to pummel through the ranks largely utilizing only body blow combos. I wasn't intentionally trying to find buggy holes in the system; I simply couldn't find any other successful technique. Computer opponents tended to protect their faces more while exposing their bodies excessively. Being that holding down the L2 button is used for blocking and lower attacks, it also made more sense to attack low because I could quickly revert to a defensive position, though I don't think that's what the developers had in mind. One other thing to note was that in one match I had against Floyd Patterson, I threw over 1,600 punches and landed more than half! I don't know about you, but it sounds a bit extreme to me for a simulator.\nThe developers clearly have their hearts in the right place here. Yet, the final execution isn't what I would describe as stellar, but serviceable. There's a good attempt at giving KK2000 some personality and hip-hop flav by gracing the soundtrack and general background music with multiple full-fledge rap songs (by nobodies, but complete with an MTV-style music video). But beyond the tunes, everything else feels mediocre. Boxers are modeled accurately, but the aging PlayStation has a hard-time breathing life into them. There's heavy banding in the bland colors and after dozens of matches, the animations, while smooth, start to feel monotonous and canned. The repetitious animation really hurts the game because aside from their bodily appearances, none of the fighters have any trademark swaggering entrances to the ring or any distinct pre- or postfight verbal trash-talking or physical posturing that gives boxing its edgy bite (and I'm not talking about Tyson again). Ali stung opponents with his mouth as well as his fists.\nKK2000 suffers a bit by being overly ambitious with its comprehensive roster, but in a good way. I lobbied many complaints and admit to being overly critical of the game, but that's only because I see a tremendous potential for the franchise to entrench itself as the genre-defining standard. With the flaws that I mentioned, I can't see KK2000 proclaiming that just yet. Still, with the reality of today's market, there's but a few scant choices for true boxing fans and KK2000 is still a very attractive package and the only simulator-like game in town. So while I was hampered by the complex controls and turned off by the lack of unique animation, I still enjoyed playing the game and it held my interest long enough for me work my way up to the heavyweight championship and defend it several times. So KK2000 misses the moon, but at least ends up in the stars.\n- Published November 20, 1999\n"}, {"score": 348.0971, "uuid": "77c9248f-09bb-52e2-8185-0d2d5613dba3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0307wb-27-35163", "target_hostname": "blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au", "target_uri": "http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/jacktheinsider/index.php/theaustralian/comments/the_first_australians_and_constitutional_change", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "The first Australians and constitutional change - Jack the Insider", "snippet": "We could celebrate Ali\u2019s birthday by looking at the six punch combination which bought George Foreman crashing to the canvas in Kinshasa in 1974, <em>or</em> the Thriller in Manilla in 1975 when <em>Ali</em> and <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> punched each other to near psychological oblivion, <em>or</em> when <em>Ali</em>, as <em>a</em> precocious 22-year-old challenger", "explanation": null, "document": "Page 1 of 13 1 2 3 > Last \u00bb\nDwight\nFri 20 Jan 12 (03:52pm)\nBrilliant clip!

His trainer, Eddie Futch threw in the towel telling the ref, Carlos Padilla, the bout was over. Ali said; \u201cJoe Frazier, I\u2019ll tell the world right now, brings out the best in me.

I was a fan of his from the late 60\u2019s and when he was finally defeated by Frazier even then he never fell in my esteem. You are a champion Ali not only in the ring but in life. Top stuff Jack.\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (04:22pm)\nFrazier beat him in their first fight by knockout in the final round. Ali beat Frazier on points at Madison Square but these were non title fights. Then there was the Thriller in Manilla with Ali as champion and Frazier as challenger. It was the only time they fought for the belt. Leon Spinks defeated Ali and Ali beat him in the rematch both in 1978. He then retired only to fight Larry Holmes and lose in 1980.

Wrapped in crisp black and red sweats, she climbed through the ropes and moved deliberately around their inside perimeter, leaning into them to feel how they gave, shuffling and bouncing as well to test the footing. Having com- pleted the circuit, she stood in one corner for a few minutes, still and watchful in the gloom, then crossed to the opposite corner and stood there for a while. \"I always do that before a fight,\" she explained a few hours later, after her bout. \"I'm visualizing the fight, how it will go, my opponent. I'm getting used to the surroundings, the room, the lights, everything. There was a soft spot out there in the floor tonight; you need to know that. I don't want anything to catch me off-guard or surprise me, even something like seeing some seats out of the corner of my eye in a place I don't expect them. And I'm a Christian; I don't want to step in there without God's protection and blessing on me, so there's praying going on, too.\"\n\"Smokin'\" Mitzi Jeter, a 38-year-old elementary school gym teacher from Chatsworth, Georgia, was in Boston to defend her International Women's Boxing Federation (IWBF) welterweight title against Dawne \"The Devastator\" George, a 42-year-old prison guard from Gardner, Massachusetts. Their bout headlined a modest Friday night fight card at the Teachers Union Hall, a waterfront blockhouse in Dorchester that squeezed the ring, the fighters, and a couple of hundred spectators between a low drop-ceiling and industrial-strength office carpeting. The promoter had come up with an action-movie tag line to advertise the event--\"Fully Loaded\"--and had arranged an undercard of bouts between men in which local fighters defeated undistinguished opponents. The mismatches were predictable, but not egregious enough to qualify as criminal. The keyed-up local guys furiously assailed the out-of-staters, who, depending on mood and ability, covered up or fought back. Nobody got killed, and everybody except the losers and their seconds had a good time.\nWhen Jeter and her cornermen made their entrance into the ring, two young women and one man preceded them down the aisle, holding high the belts representing Jeter's titles: The IWBF and International Female Boxing Association recognized her as welterweight champion of the world, and she also held the intercontinental title (one step short of the world title) of a third sanctioning body, the Women's International Boxing Federation. Dawne George was already in the ring, the challenger's faction having entered first in accordance with fistic tradition. It was time for the main event.\nThe promoter of the Jeter-George bout might have believed he was making history by presenting a women's title bout as the headliner, a first in Massachusetts, but the evening's historical significance more properly resided in its business-as-usual quality. The two fighters weighed in under the welterweight limit, the commission's mandatory prefight examinations determined that neither fighter was injured or HIV-positive or pregnant, an impartial referee enforced the rules, three licensed judges (two of them from out of state, as Jeter's manager-husband and the IWBF had insisted) rendered an unbiased decision despite the fact that the challenger was local and the champion was not, and everybody got paid--not much, but what they expected. The fight was just another day at the office, and that, in the long view, is news.\nWomen bent on mixing it up have always found their way into the fights, even when the sport or their participation in it was illegal. Women fought on the illicit margins of the legitimate boxing world for most of the 20th century. Bareknuckle bouts between women were common in the 18th and 19th centuries. And (to follow the line all the way back) the recent discovery of the remains of a young woman buried with gladiatorial honors in a Roman cemetery in London seems to confirm archaeologists' belief that fighting women carved out a place for themselves in the ancient world's bloodsport demimonde.\nThe current boom in women's boxing, which began almost a decade ago, may be just the latest episode in this long history, but it also has occasioned major changes in the fight world. The increasingly institutionalized character of women's boxing is a new development: title-granting organizations (multiple, competing, and variably shady, just like those in men's boxing) award belts and rank contenders, state commissions regulate women and men alike, and a formal amateur network undergirds the profession. For the first time since the rise of boxing to state-regulated legitimacy a century ago, it is now common practice to include a women's bout among men's bouts, or to stage all-women's cards. To the extent that any boxing is legitimate, women's boxing has become increasingly legitimate, and sometimes it can even be the main event.\nTo handicap the Jeter-George matchup, one needed to know that Jeter had been winning fights of one kind or another for most of her life, ever since taking up karate in childhood; that her record after three-plus years of professional boxing was 15\u00d03\u00d01; that she usually went the distance, seeming to gain strength as her opponent tired, and won by decision; and that among her victories were two previous decisions over George, who, at 4\u00d07\u00d01, usually knocked out her opponent when she won but had never gone 10 rounds. Both were in sound fighting shape. George, the bigger-framed of the two welterweights, had trained down to a lean but broad-shouldered 145 pounds. Jeter's body, at 146 pounds, was smoother, its strength concentrated in the legs.\nThe challenger landed some hard punches, especially when she switched to a southpaw stance in the middle rounds, but the champion put on the evening's only exhibition of accomplished technical boxing. Jeter jabbed and double-jabbed to set up combinations, circling to create advantageous angles of attack. She made George's punches miss, then made her pay for missing. She drove with her legs and shifted her weight in the clinches, encouraging George to spend her upper-body strength in pushing back with inferior leverage. The only blow that caught Jeter by surprise was an illegal one, an accidental headbutt in the third round that staggered her. The referee, a smiling gent with flowing white hair, gave Jeter a few seconds to recover. After the unscheduled break she went back to work with a burst of punching that won the round for her. An uneasy male voice called out from George's corner, \"Get busy, girlfriend.\"\nBoth boxers' trainers had the limber, straightbacked carriage of fighting men in advanced middle age. Squatting in front of George's stool between rounds, her trainer shouted, \"You got to hit her! Let your hands go! Boom-boom-boom-BOOM!\" He threw an illustrative sequence of punches alarmingly close to her face. Jeter's corner was quieter, almost peaceful. While her husband knelt on the canvas in front of her, silently giving her water and applying ice and then Vaseline to her face, her trainer stood on the ring apron and craned through the ropes to murmur in her ear. When George began to tire in the seventh round, grabbing Jeter more often and leaning heavily on her, Jeter's trainer called out \"Can you feel her weight?\" just loudly enough to cut through the crowd noise. Jeter accepted even more of George's weight in the clinch, then turned her and stepped away suddenly to one side, causing George to stumble forward off-balance. Jeter nailed her with a jab, a cross, and a hook--left, right, left--before George could get back into position.\nJeter scored well the rest of the way with this sidestepping tactic out of the clinches, sweeping the late rounds and winning the fight by a wide margin on every judge's card. Holding her wrist, the referee raised Jeter's ungloved but still-wrapped hand in victory after the ring announcer intoned the traditional formula: \"The winner, and still welterweight champion of the world. . . .\"\nThe individual and ad hoc character of boxing, with a core of serious practitioners and many more who are semiserious or just in it for the workout, makes it difficult to determine how many women box. Frank Globuschutz, founder of an all-women's gym on Long Island and guiding force of the IWBF (in which capacity he gave Mitzi Jeter a big postfight hug), has estimated that there are more than 2,000 female professionals in the United States and perhaps half as many amateurs, each group constituting less than a third of the worldwide total. A woman arriving in the gym these days with an inchoate urge to box finds that, unlike women in previous eras, she can give form to that aspiration by plugging herself into the fight world's standard routine. First, she becomes a regular at the gym, finds a trainer, spars with peers and more experienced stablemates. Then she enters the Golden Gloves amateur tournament in her state; if that goes well, she can fight for national amateur titles and try to qualify for international tournaments. Eventually, if she turns pro, she signs with a manager who can line up plausible competition and pursues the attention of promoters, sponsors, and television executives; as her career progresses, she angles for higher-profile fights, title belts, bigger paydays.\nAmong the several social and cultural frames one might place around this phenomenon--and its high visibility in a recent round of movies, books, news features, and advertisements--is the larger movement of women into traditional proving grounds of American manhood. The generation of women currently integrating boxing, contact sports, hunting, and the military combat arms (not to mention action movies) has grown up in a time of remarkable fluidity in the sexual division of work and play. In particular, the assumption of a male monopoly on skilled, socially valued aggression has been seriously undermined, and not only by the feminist impulse. The Title IX legislation of 1972 that enabled the late 20th-century boom in women's sports was a symptom as much as a cause of the movement of women into previously off-limits areas. Beneath and behind the transformation of play lies the transformation of work: the final collapse of the family wage system that theoretically allowed a working man's salary to support his wife and children, together with the complementary movement of men into service jobs that resemble what used to be called \"women's work.\" Deindustrialization, the mechanization of farming, and the expansion of service work, especially, have helped to undermine the traditional calculus of masculinity based on body work and associated rough play, on being good with one's hands.\nA variety of enterprising women have undertaken to explore the evocative ruins of that partially collapsed tradition and to salvage usable parts for their own purposes. Women pushing for access to the fight world have been part of a larger push in the realms of work and play (which overlap at the fights) to claim once \"manly\" virtues that boxing is known to nurture and embody: autonomy, physical competence, and discipline, all wrapped up with productive aggression.\nWomen who want to fight, driven by an appetite for hitting as incompletely explicable as that which urges men into the ring, come to boxing from a variety of directions. A few come from fighting families; they grow up trading punches with brothers, or learn the ropes from fathers. More women, for the most part educated and middle-class, are recruited through the boxing-themed aerobic exercise regimes currently popular in health clubs. They grow tired of punching air to the beat and begin to wonder what it feels like to hit somebody who hits back. Others, the multi-sport athletes, come to boxing after playing organized sports in high school or college. Most of those sports offer little in the way of a professional future, and boxing is so individualistic that an extraordinarily motivated woman can take it up in earnest while still earning a living at day jobs or even pursuing a full-fledged career.\nThe majority of female boxers come to boxing through martial arts, which tend to emphasize technique over brute strength and which have been relatively integrated in the United States since the late 1960s and 1970s, when feminism and a spike in crime statistics inspired widespread interest in women's self-defense. Dawne George, who began training as a boxer in part to lose weight, has a black belt in tae kwon do. Mitzi Jeter won a national championship in sport karate and tried amateur kickboxing before moving on to boxing. Jeter switched to boxing three-and-a-half years ago, she said, \"in part because of the popularity of women's boxing, but also because of the natural progression of intensity. Sport karate was more like a tag game, kickboxing was more intense, boxing is even more intense. Some things are the same--the fact that it's fighting, the way you stay balanced and centered. But probably the biggest difference is distance, and intensity.\" Jeter was talking to reporters at Slade's, a nightclub in Roxbury, at a press event the day before the fight. She got up to demonstrate how the distance between combatants shrinks and the decisive violence of their encounter escalates as one moves from sport karate to kickboxing to boxing. Everybody gave her plenty of room.\nJeter's and George's biographies also suggest the range of class trajectories that deliver women into the ring. Jeter, like many of her female peers and unlike most men in the business, has solid middle-class credentials: a degree in health and physical education from Barry College in Georgia, a teaching career, options. She never faced the classic choice between fighting and factory work, nor did she take up boxing to protect herself on the street. George's trajectory, by contrast, resembles the classic portrait of the male boxer in at least two respects: She grew strong doing hard manual labor in furniture factories, and she found boxing in prison, albeit as a guard rather than an inmate.\nThe two women have in common their entry into boxing at an extremely advanced age. Neither grew up in boxing, and it is certainly not a sport that they could have learned in school. Both had to make their way to it as adults through a changing social and cultural landscape. One might think of them as part of a backlog of women who have only begun to act on their fighting potential in the past few years. If the sport continues to grow, and if in time at least a prominent handful of women can make a decent living as boxers, this cohort of older pioneers (including most of the middle-class fighters) will be squeezed out by younger women who will come straight to boxing in their teens--hungry, committed fighters, most of them working-class, who will choose boxing over other life options and other sports. (Women's boxing may actually have a recruiting advantage over men's boxing in that respect, because football siphons off many of the boys with an appetite for hitting.)\nNow, for all their seriousness about boxing, neither Jeter nor George can make a living in the ring. Bear in mind that Jeter holds two world welterweight titles but made \"less than $10,000,\" according to her manager-husband, in her fight with George; male welterweight champion Sugar Shane Mosley can make $3 million-plus for an ordinary title defense, much more for a big bout against a marketable opponent. Female boxers, even more than men, do it primarily for the challenge, the feeling of accomplishment, the momentary glory, the potency, the hitting. These mostly intangible rewards matter a great deal, but steady income must derive from elsewhere, which usually entails a working life beyond the ring that eats up significant amounts of time and energy. On the Sunday after their Friday-night fight, George, a single mother of four and a grandmother, would be back at her part-time job as a short-order cook, and on Tuesday she would be back at work at the North Central Correctional Institute. Jeter would be back at the Spring Place Elementary School. \"The kids are done for the year,\" she said, \"but Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at school we have post-planning, then I have to take some classes this summer.\" And both fighters, of course, would soon be back in the gym, training.\nNo matter how hard women work in the gym, though, they face long odds in fighting their way out of the bind that the boxing business, forever suspended between craft and entertainment, puts them in. The novelty of women's boxing, an institutional fledgling, makes it especially susceptible to the eclipse of skillful fighting by the priorities of showbiz.\nThat helps explain the less-than-acceptable current state of women's boxing. A fighter can only improve by facing competent opponents in the gym and in bouts, and there are not enough good female boxers to go around. Dawne George, for example, was game and strong, but her losing record made her a less-than-ideal challenger for a world title, and she did not offer Jeter, who had already beaten her twice, much of a test.\nMany women who fight for titles and on television are just not good enough boxers to merit such exposure, but they are game enough to wade in swinging, which always sells. Managerial skullduggery and incompetence produce far too many mismatches (a major problem in men's boxing, also), but even fair matches between women too often turn into flailing sessions that do not belong on major fight cards. Euphemistic talk about women's boxing as \"more honest\" than men's boxing--\"more action-packed,\" \"tougher,\" and \"fresher\"--draws a veil of marketing-speak over the plain fact that green female scrappers, fighting short, two-minute rounds that encourage bell-to-bell punching (men fight three-minute rounds), often beat the hell out of one another with less regard for defense and technique than more seasoned men display.\nConsider the contrast with women's basketball, which some see as more aesthetically and technically pleasing than men's basketball. Female basketball players, the argument goes, work harder on passing, shooting, and team play because they cannot rely so heavily on the sheer strength and athleticism that often turns the men's game into a Hobbesian bricklaying contest punctuated by improbable dunks. But proper basketball skills may be learned in school, where fisticuffs are always discouraged, and a major part of the entertainment value of women's boxing seems to reside in its unsoundness: wild punching, no blocking or slipping of blows, action to the exclusion of craft.\nWomen's boxing often pleases crowds because it looks, paradoxically, both conventionally manlier than men's boxing and more womanly. It looks more like the way men pretend to fight in movies, dishing out and taking outsize blows by the double handful. Yet at the same time the women's bouts that collapse into unskilled pummeling call to mind certain forms of pornography premised on the principle of the catfight.\nThose bouts anger fighters who pride themselves on their skill. \"I have some strong issues on gender discrimination and sport,\" Mitzi Jeter said at Slade's, her soft Georgia voice hardening a touch. \"More people would enjoy women's fighting if there were better women fighters. But they want to put on a T and A show--pardon my language. It seems like they find the worst women fighters they can. They're all like this:\" She did a perfect imitation of a novice, head back, eyes shut tight, throwing weak rapidfire blows with both hands. \"It's like they want the women to look bad. You see what women can do in other sports, like Flo Jo [the Olympic sprinter], what women have done in basketball, and soccer. And then you look at the women who fight on TV, and you know they aren't the best.\"\nJeter half-jokingly used the word \"conspiracy\" to describe the primitive state of women's boxing, and one can see why she might suspect the fight world's male authorities of colluding to defend the fistic and cultural status quo. Do the best female boxers remain obscure precisely because they are threatening? Why should Mia St. John--not much of a boxer, but easy enough on the eyes to appear on the cover of Playboy wearing boxing gloves and not much else--get bigger bouts than Jeter could ever dream of? Was promoter Bob Arum acting on purely economic motives when he dumped the incomparable Lucia Rijker, the best female boxer on earth, and signed St. John instead? Why should women fight shorter rounds? Perhaps, like the injunction that once barred women from running marathons, the rule protects an embattled orthodoxy rather than women's health.\nThen again, conspiracy might be too strong a word. Powerful mixed motives drive boxing promoters and their associates in television, the casino business, and the sport's public and private governing bodies. Sensing a demand for women's boxing, they want to cultivate an audience for it (and build a bigger female audience for all boxing). Part of cultivating that audience could well be to develop a large cohort of skilled female boxers, but to achieve that end promoters would have to patiently invest in upgrading the quality of women's boxing over the long run. As notoriously sharkish purveyors of violent entertainment, though, promoters are oriented toward short-term profit and not toward effecting long-run change in the business or the surrounding culture. They know they can cash in right now on the appeal of the catfight--premised on the combatants' ineptitude--and the darkly timeless attraction of women getting beat up in public. So promoters go for what they regard as the sure thing, showcasing inexperienced female brawlers and comely incompetents rather than sound boxers. The resulting messy slugfests between women play not only to fans who value action over craft but also to those who regard a match between women as a palate-cleansing freaky sex show inserted among real fights.\nOne might argue that the same mix of fascinations with athletic skill, nakedness, and sexually inflected pain draws fans to men's boxing, but the proportions tend to be reversed. Some spectators may see a pornographic subtext in the spectacle of men boxing, but many spectators see any conjunction of women and violence as primarily a sex show.\nThe tangle of contradictions remains in evidence as women's boxing works into the fight world's collective psyche. Take, for example, the fight magazine Boxing Digest. Its editors, who pine in print for the lost golden age of \"the nocturnal urban male subculture,\" have made clear their preferred understanding of women's place at the fights: They discontinued a new section devoted to women's boxing after only a few issues, while continuing to prominently feature a near-naked \"Round Card Beauty of the Month\" in every issue. But Boxing Digest also offers backhanded respect to women's bouts, which it includes in its small-type capsule reports on fight cards around the world. One typical recent report contrasted a \"tame\" main event between men to a slugfest between women on the undercard that served as \"the real headliner\" because, \"as usual, the women's [bout] produced the most action.\" The mating of \"action\" to \"as usual\" implies praise for women's courage and fortitude (by which many men still affect to be surprised), but also distaste for yet another amateurish fight between female professionals.\nThe staff writers at Boxing Digest exemplify the ringside point of view of most boxing literature--the noncombatant expert's perspective, with authority derived from experience in watching rather than doing. But some of the educated women who were pioneers in legitimate boxing in the 1990s have been writing and making movies about boxing from a commanding new in-the-ring perspective: books like Rene Denfeld's Kill the Body, the Head Will Fall (1997), Kate Sekules's The Boxer's Heart (2000), and Lynn Snowden Picket's Looking for a Fight (2000); movies like Katya Bankowsky's Shadow Boxers (1999) and Karyn Kusama's Girlfight (2000). Firsthand ring experience translates into powerful leverage when these women's books and movies urge a reconsideration of received ideas about gender and aggression, sex and violence. The manly art of self-defense having become esoteric in our age, most partisans of those received ideas have not given or taken a good one to the chops since grade school, which can put them on the defensive when women with bloody knuckles enter the cultural battle royal over the meaning of women's boxing.\nTwo weeks after the Jeter-George fight, a 39-year-old lawyer and ex-college basketball player named Jacqui Frazier-Lyde fought a 23-year-old celebrity-in-training named Laila Ali in the main event of a card at the Turning Stone casino in upstate New York, an event that was broadcast on pay-per-view television. The bout--which the promoters insisted on calling Ali-Frazier IV, placing it in the company of three great fights between the protagonists' illustrious fathers, Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali--exemplified most of what was wrong with women's boxing, and also some of its promise.\nBegin with the promise. Two female novices fighting an eight-round, nontitle bout divided a total purse (including a piece of the TV revenue) amounting to perhaps a quarter-million dollars, probably the biggest payday in the history of women's boxing. Not only did women headline a card that included a number of good male fighters, but the 6,500 or so people in attendance--including hundreds of reporters from all over the world--seemed to accept the notion that two daughters had charged themselves with upholding the family honor the old way, dukes up. A number of fearsome-looking female professionals in street clothes took the opportunity presented by the massive gathering of reporters to lobby for their own shot at the big time. There was a sense of possibility in the air.\nOn the other hand, the fight itself belonged deep on the undercard at a local club, or in a Golden Gloves tournament. The combatants, who showed plenty of heart and little ability, had no business in a much-publicized main event. Frazier-Lyde could barely box at all, and Ali was only beginning to develop a style. Both had skipped amateur careers and assembled brief but undefeated professional records by dispatching sacrificial patsies, so neither had much experience against competent opposition. Frazier-Lyde, the shorter and thicker aggressor, rushed in at the start of every round, taking punches and windmilling her own until she was gasping for breath. Her left-handed blows sort of resembled her father's definitive Philadelphia left hook, but when she threw her right the punch collapsed into a pushing motion known on the street as a moosh, more of a provocation than an effective form of assault. Ali, taller and leaner, knew how to move her feet, jab with her long left arm, and follow up with a straight right, but she forgot about all that and settled for throwing both hands indiscriminately when Frazier-Lyde charged her. If any blows were blocked by either fighter, it happened by accident as an incoming glove ran afoul of an outgoing one. Increasingly winded, the two traded swings like drunken sailors, landing scores of punches without leverage that had little effect other than to generate \"action.\"\nThe crowd, which had been inattentive during the undercard fights, came to life during the main event. This was more like it: a close, fast-paced bout with lots of hitting, celebrities, everything. People shouted out the fighters' names, taking special pleasure in chanting \"A-li, A-li\" again after all these years. They howled when the women went toe-to-toe, which was most of the time. Some of their enthusiasm was about boxing, some about women, some about women boxing--three different things--and some of it sprang from their memories of Ali and Frazier p\u008fres. They went home satisfied by the result, a close victory for Laila Ali by majority decision.\nMitzi Jeter, who was home in Georgia and refused to watch the bout on TV, was not satisfied. Even giving away 15 pounds and a giant reach advantage, she was confident that she could have outboxed Ali and Frazier-Lyde, perhaps even in succession on the same night. She dismissed their bout as \"a publicity stunt\" and worried that it had \"hurt women's boxing.\" Frazier, she said, \"is a joke. Ali, she's better than average, but still not a good fighter. Five years from now, after she's continued to work and train, she could be a good fighter. I'm surprised she let it be so close. That doesn't say much for her.\"\nFive years from now, the statuesque Ali will probably be making action movies and hawking her celebrity workout video; Frazier-Lyde will be lawyering again, happily retired from her brief ring career. Jeter, at 43, will be fighting or training others to fight, because fighting is her craft, her gift, her calling.\nCarlo Rotella, an assistant professor of English at Boston College, is the author of October Cities: The Redevelopment of Urban Literature (1998) and the forthcoming Good with Their Hands, from which portions of this article are adapted.

Every <em>boxer</em> had one objective: to be No.", "explanation": null, "document": "HOME\nBeing No. 1. By Colin Croft\nMy daughter Shannon, 22 on Monday 29th August, never lets me forget this: \"Father,\" she says authoritatively, \"whatever happens to you, I am always your only girl, No. 1!\" (There's a saying: \u2018fruits do not fall far from the tree...')\nShannon is correct: in whatever sphere of life, might it be sport or industry, there really is only one No. 1.\nBeing No. 1 in anything is not that difficult \u2014 not when compared to remaining there, even for a short time. \u00a0Former West Indies captains Clive Lloyd and Brian Lara said it many times in their careers: \"Climbing that hill to be No. 1 is the easy part. Remaining as No. 1 takes so much more effort.\" Yup!\nWorryingly though, ICC's \"All-Time Team\" did not even include (Sir) Garfield Sobers, thought to be, at least, the best all-rounder ever, not to mention that many think that he is the best batsman too \u2014 No. 1.\nThat Darren Sammy has been continued as West Indies captain is good, sensible news. No, he is not the best bowler in West Indies, nor is he the best batsman either. Indeed, he is not close to being the best all-rounder in the Caribbean, but he deserves to have that moniker as he is team captain: El Numero Uno!\nWith that effort against India earlier this year, one that had only one negative spot \u2014 West Indies did not, as should have happened, beat India \u2014 Sammy was the obvious ongoing choice. It is an interesting exercise to understand and appreciate that there are not many contenders for that position anyway.\nWhen boxing was really boxing, there was only one No. 1 \u2014 champion \u2014 in each weight group too. That is why I had loved that sport so much then. No-one else makes a boxer No. 1. Only he does. He is the one who has to go out and, for 15 rounds in the olden days, or 12 nowadays, decimate all opponents.\nThese days, boxing is so watered down that no-one even knows who is fighting whom anymore. I clearly remember boxing titans clashing; Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier - thrice - and especially the first Roberto Duran v Sugar Ray Leonard fight. Every boxer had one objective: to be No. 1.\nSo, picture it \u2014 West Indies tour of England, 1980. Everyone in the team is overly mesmerized by the slick, stealthy and sweet Sugar Ray Leonard, thought to be the reincarnation of the original Sugar Ray Robinson \u2014 except me. With the history that I had on Roberto, I knew that he would win that first fight!\n\u2018Manos de Piedra'\u00a0 Hands of Stone \u2014 Duran was the forerunner of \u2018Iron' Mike Tyson. Neither showed great finesse. They were both big, strong, determined, with one purpose, as Larry Holmes once said: \"To kill or to be killed. You must be prepared to die, to win, and become No. 1\". Or as Ali suggested too: \"Round 13, Round 14, Round 15, championship rounds, rounds to be No. 1!\" Those were the days.\nLeonard was tough. In his career, Leonard did eventually beat Duran (\"No mas!\" etc.), Thomas Hearns, Wilfredo Benitez and \u2018Marvelous' Marvin Hagler \u2014 as good as any boxer could be, genuine No. 1. Leonard was also No. 1 pugilist to make more than US$100,000,000, (one hundred million US dollars) in boxing.\nAnyway, 11:00pm in Montreal that balmy June night was 3:00am in London. We were all up, looking and listening. This was Montreal, where Sugar Ray had won gold at the 1976 Olympics, at light-welterweight. Nearly 50,000 had gathered for \u2018Mano y Mano', Leonard v Duran I, one of the best boxing matches ever.\nMontreal is also where Haseley Crawford, still Trinidad & Tobago's No. 1 (and still only) Olympic Gold medal winner beat Jamaica's Don Quarrie, Russia's Valeriy Borzov, USA's Harvey Glance and Johnny Jones, Panama's Guy Abrahams, East Germany's Klaus-Dieter Kurrat and Bulgaria's Petar Petrove. Crawford's effort, never repeated since, goes to show how hard it can be to be No. 1.\nOn that night, June 20th 1980, I knew who would be No. 1. I even had a wager, for a Chinese dinner \u2014 that was all that we could afford back then \u2014 with the world's No. 1 batsman then, and for some, even now, (Sir) Vivian Richards, our own \u2018Smoking Joe.' He was quite magnanimous after defeat, probably his only defeat.\nLeonard lost because Duran brawled better, having been brought up in the barrios, enduring and beating twice opponents like another legend, Estanban de Jesus. As the saying goes; \"Roberto wanted it more!\" \u2018Hands of stone' forced \u2018the Sugar-man' to fight Duran's fight, a grave mistake for any No. 1.\nIndia also made mistakes in losing its No. 1 Test spot to England. India took its situation for granted, thus finding that being No. 1 is not easy. As former Australian captain, Ian Chappell (who knows what it is to be No. 1, kayoing England, 1974/5, and West Indies, 1975/6) said; \"India thought that they could simply turn up, play, and just win.\" Another No. 1, Curtly Ambrose, would say: \"Nuttin' wuk suh, Jack...\"\nI cannot remember England recently being thought of as No. 1 in Test cricket, though its progress is measured by Ashes series. In 1963, when West Indies beat England 3-1 in that year's Test series, West Indies were thought to have been No. 1, even though they had lost to Australia two years earlier.\nNow, there is no doubt about it. Andy Flower, Andy Strauss and the English boys have shown that with planning, hard work, dedication and considerable skills too, they can justifiably be called No. 1 in Test cricket. Since England also won the last ICC T-20 competition, they are two for two at being No. 1!\nThe trouble is to hold on to those crowns. West Indies lost only one Test series \u2014 a contentious 1-0 defeat, New Zealand 1979-80 \u2014 from 1976 to 1995. That was a tremendously long time to be Test \u2018champeen'. Australia took hold from 1995 until 2009-10, similar kudos to West Indies reign as No. 1.\nIndia, with its internal cricket industry and politics, found out the hard way that is not an easy game in which to be No. 1. They looked unprepared, a poor effort for any defending champion. I fail to understand how such a huge population cannot find ample replacements. There ought to be sanctions for looking so bad!\nEngland are sitting pretty now. You can also rest assured that they will not be sitting back on their laurels, just waiting for something to happen. They will go out and make things happen to keep being No. 1.\nNext month, West Indies starts its Asian winter in Europe, with two T-20s v World Champions England at the Kennington Oval in London. Then they go to Bangladesh for two Tests and three ODIs, then to India for two Tests and five ODIs. This is a good time for West Indies to start climbing back to \u2014 hopefully \u2014 No. 1.

Every <em>boxer</em> had one objective: to be No.", "explanation": null, "document": "COMMENT\nBeing No. 1. By Colin Croft\nMy daughter Shannon, 22 on Monday 29th August, never lets me forget this: \"Father,\" she says authoritatively, \"whatever happens to you, I am always your only girl, No. 1!\" (There's a saying: \u2018fruits do not fall far from the tree...')\nShannon is correct: in whatever sphere of life, might it be sport or industry, there really is only one No. 1.\nBeing No. 1 in anything is not that difficult \u2014 not when compared to remaining there, even for a short time. \u00a0Former West Indies captains Clive Lloyd and Brian Lara said it many times in their careers: \"Climbing that hill to be No. 1 is the easy part. Remaining as No. 1 takes so much more effort.\" Yup!\nWorryingly though, ICC's \"All-Time Team\" did not even include (Sir) Garfield Sobers, thought to be, at least, the best all-rounder ever, not to mention that many think that he is the best batsman too \u2014 No. 1.\nThat Darren Sammy has been continued as West Indies captain is good, sensible news. No, he is not the best bowler in West Indies, nor is he the best batsman either. Indeed, he is not close to being the best all-rounder in the Caribbean, but he deserves to have that moniker as he is team captain: El Numero Uno!\nWith that effort against India earlier this year, one that had only one negative spot \u2014 West Indies did not, as should have happened, beat India \u2014 Sammy was the obvious ongoing choice. It is an interesting exercise to understand and appreciate that there are not many contenders for that position anyway.\nWhen boxing was really boxing, there was only one No. 1 \u2014 champion \u2014 in each weight group too. That is why I had loved that sport so much then. No-one else makes a boxer No. 1. Only he does. He is the one who has to go out and, for 15 rounds in the olden days, or 12 nowadays, decimate all opponents.\nThese days, boxing is so watered down that no-one even knows who is fighting whom anymore. I clearly remember boxing titans clashing; Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier - thrice - and especially the first Roberto Duran v Sugar Ray Leonard fight. Every boxer had one objective: to be No. 1.\nSo, picture it \u2014 West Indies tour of England, 1980. Everyone in the team is overly mesmerized by the slick, stealthy and sweet Sugar Ray Leonard, thought to be the reincarnation of the original Sugar Ray Robinson \u2014 except me. With the history that I had on Roberto, I knew that he would win that first fight!\n\u2018Manos de Piedra'\u00a0 Hands of Stone \u2014 Duran was the forerunner of \u2018Iron' Mike Tyson. Neither showed great finesse. They were both big, strong, determined, with one purpose, as Larry Holmes once said: \"To kill or to be killed. You must be prepared to die, to win, and become No. 1\". Or as Ali suggested too: \"Round 13, Round 14, Round 15, championship rounds, rounds to be No. 1!\" Those were the days.\nLeonard was tough. In his career, Leonard did eventually beat Duran (\"No mas!\" etc.), Thomas Hearns, Wilfredo Benitez and \u2018Marvelous' Marvin Hagler \u2014 as good as any boxer could be, genuine No. 1. Leonard was also No. 1 pugilist to make more than US$100,000,000, (one hundred million US dollars) in boxing.\nAnyway, 11:00pm in Montreal that balmy June night was 3:00am in London. We were all up, looking and listening. This was Montreal, where Sugar Ray had won gold at the 1976 Olympics, at light-welterweight.

Here, Mailer shares a few thoughts on the sport of boxing with his son, John Buffalo Mailer.\nThe full interview can be found in Issue 20: The Boxing Issue\nJohn Buffalo Mailer: How is boxing different from other big sports \u2014 baseball, football, etc.?\nNorman Mailer: It's one against one. Boxing bears as much relation therefore, to chess as to football. In a chess game between two good players, there is humiliation in losing. That humiliation is even greater in boxing. Of course, it's true of all one-on-one sports. Tennis for example. But boxing demands one thing more. Which is hard to name. It's almost like certain courage of the blood that goes very deep. It's what attracts us to boxing. It's the side of boxing that's not too well understood by people who say, \u201cI hate boxing. It's so brutal.\u201d It's the amount of discipline and intelligence and restraint that goes into it. Which is why I consider boxing a social good, not a social ill.\nWhat would a lot of these kids do if there weren't professional boxing and they couldn't make a living out of it? The answer is that a lot of them would be likely to lead violent lives. You know, when people have a little more violence in them than the average, their lives take on all sorts of very difficult turns that can't necessarily be solved by anger management courses. When there's a lot of violence in a man, society can be grateful that there are social ways that violence can be turned into an art form.\nA kid who starts out as a very rough piece of work comes to learn that there's something classy about getting good at this boxing. It's a way for a violent man to begin to comprehend that living in a classic situation \u2013 in other words, living within certain limitations rather than expressing oneself uncontrollably \u2014 is a way to live that he didn't have before. Because don't forget, that when you're violent and undisciplined, life is a nightmare. Any morning when you wake up could be the morning where you go too far, and hurt somebody so badly that you're in the can, or you've killed them. Or you're humiliated. Being macho is no fun. Because macho men have to live for their triumphs and in terror of their humiliations, and there's always another guy who's as macho as you are or more. So boxing enables such kids to find a social form for themselves, where not only their strengths but also their weaknesses can be appreciated. Where in effect they can be taught to get rid of their weaknesses. They begin to learn they have to show up on time, they have to drill, they can drink, but they can't drink too much, they can take pot, but they can't take too much, because the head is too vulnerable after taking pot to get hit steadily through a sparring session. Some even begin to lead lives, which enable them to have a little social standing outside of the gang. And that's a huge step. Because for every 10,000 who train every year, maybe a 1,000 ever make it to a reasonably high amateur level and 500 to the professional level \u2014 I don't know what the numbers are. They're probably larger than that. But the point is, in the course of it, even if they don't succeed, they get a structure to their ego, and some measure of how tough they really are.\nOne of the worst things about being tough is if you don't know how tough you really are, all you know is that you're kind of tough, that's scary. Your ego can be shattered by one episode. But if you go to the gym every day and are subtly humiliated every day by boxers better than you, you begin, in the course of it, to get better. You can make some kind of peace with much that's unsettled in yourself. Boxing gives proportion to the psyche.\nNow, there are penalties to it. You can end up less intelligent than when you started. That's obvious. On the other hand, I remember we had this boxing club we'd go to on Saturday mornings, and then after we'd go out to eat. We'd have hamburgers and beer and I remember saying once, \u201cHey fellas, what would Saturday afternoon be like without a headache?\u201d We all laughed, because it was true. On the other hand, it also occurred to me that this headache I had from boxing was not quite as bad as the headaches I used to have on mornings when I was hung over with a headache much worse than I ever got from boxing. Which also gave me the next perception, which was that those of my friends who were drinkers were punch-drunk. Not from boxing. From booze. So you do pay a price for boxing, but you also pay a price for living. We all punish our bodies.\nJBM: Is machismo a choice?\nNM: Wait a minute. You started with the question, \u201cHow is boxing different from all other sports?\u201d I think there's one way in which it is profoundly different. I, of course, never did enough boxing ever to be able to answer that question with authority, but I once heard Muhammad Ali speak of fighting Joe Frazier and saying, \u201cFighting him was like Death.\u201d And I knew what he meant. It was right after the Thriller in Manilla, which Ali won, but it was an unbelievably arduous, grueling, brutal fight. Several times within the course of that fight I think Ali felt he was going to die if he didn't quit. So there is one element in boxing, which is not unlike Evel Kneivel's stunts \u2014 you can die doing it. Now, few boxers die, but there can be a feeling in the middle of a fight when you're bad used up that to go on is very dangerous. Of course, there are other activities, as well. You see these kids on roller skates and do flip-flops high in the air. They could break their necks if they don't do it properly \u2014 or rock climbing. That can be exceptionally dangerous. The thing about boxing is that the danger is always there in the middle of prodigious punishment. And so it has its own \u00e9clat, it's own honor, its own dignity. Which is that in the middle of pain and grueling dull punishment, there is also honor. Which is very, very important to certain kinds of men, violent men. A violent man without honor is a dreadful piece of work. So, to summarize, let me say that one of the social values of boxing is that it enables men who have difficult and unbalanced psyches to be able to strive legitimately toward personal honor.\n"}, {"score": 331.97226, "uuid": "3804f75b-9942-5efd-8522-b016ce78a9db", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0002wb-87-01489", "target_hostname": "city-journal.org", "target_uri": "http://city-journal.org/2011/21_3_urb-boxing.html", "page_rank": 1.1756673e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "The Ghost Sport by Paul Beston, City Journal Summer 2011", "snippet": "Exiled from boxing for years for his stance on the Vietnam War, <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>, here defeating <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> in 1974, personified an era of rebellion and change.

Outside Grand Central Terminal on a raw spring morning, the UPS drivers are doing their moves: one guy, slight and older, crouching and bobbing his head, his breath making clouds in the chill air, throws hooking punches, left and right, which stop just short of the larger and younger man, who tucks in his elbows as if he were tapping his ancestors\u0092 instincts: protect the body, move your feet, position yourself to be ready when the chance comes. The scrap ends almost as soon as it began, the men laughing.\nPoliticians, pledging to \u0093fight\u0094 for a principle, sometimes hold up boxing gloves as a sign of commitment to cheering supporters. The gloves bring to mind a familiar image: a narrow, roped square; eager spectators surrounding the ring; and, in the fighters\u0092 corners, old, wrinkled seconds with Q-tips behind their ears, holding buckets. The scene frames an odd, brutal human activity that disappears from the public mind for long periods, then surfaces again when a fight or fighter reaches out to us, demanding a response.\nBut that happens rarely today; few Americans could name more than one or two current boxers, if that. Boxing has become a ghost sport, long since discredited but still hovering in the nation\u0092s consciousness, refusing to go away and be silent entirely. There was a time when things were very different. For boxing once stood at the center of American life, and its history winds a thread through the broader history of the nation.\nBoxing\u0092s beginnings in America go back to slave days, when plantation owners pitted slaves against one another and wagered on the outcomes. One freed slave, Tom Molineaux, even fought overseas against the British champion, Tom Cribb\u0097and probably would have won their 1810 match, had Cribb\u0092s desperate supporters not intervened just as Molineaux seized a decisive advantage. Boxing then was conducted with bare fists, under the old London Prize Ring Rules, which stipulated fights to the finish\u0097that is, until one man could not continue. The rules also permitted wrestling holds and other tactics, and rounds ended only with \u0093falls,\u0094 when one man went down, whether from a punch or a throw or sheer exhaustion. Before the Civil War, boxing enjoyed a brief vogue in New York, where fighters often associated with the Tammany Hall machine rose to prominence. But the war interrupted the sport\u0092s momentum.\nOnly with the emergence of its first great figure, John L. Sullivan, did boxing truly arrive in America. Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1858, the son of an immigrant hod carrier from Ireland, Sullivan fought his way to wealth and fame rivaled by few in his time. With his physical prowess and hot-blooded public persona, Sullivan became an Irish-American hero and a symbol of manly vigor to a nation that, experiencing an industrial revolution and transformative changes in living standards and manner of work, worried that its young men might go soft. After he won the heavyweight championship (or at least what Americans generally viewed as the championship) in 1882, he went on a barnstorming national tour, offering $1,000 to anyone who could last four rounds with him in makeshift rings set up in theaters, ballrooms, and saloons. Reportedly, only one man won the money. It\u0092s from Sullivan that we get the boast, still heard today: \u0093I can lick any sonofabitch in the house.\u0094\nSullivan created an archetype that remains in force in 2011: the athlete as cultural icon and all-around moneymaking machine. In Sullivan\u0092s time, that dual role generally meant performing on stage, as he did in Honest Hearts and Willing Hands, a melodrama that toured the country. \u0093Shake the hand that shook the hand of the great John L.!,\u0094 exulted the lucky few who got to meet him. Poet Vachel Lindsay memorialized Sullivan\u0092s most impressive victory, in an 1889 marathon battle with Jake Kilrain\u0097the last bare-knuckle championship, waged in wilting heat and lasting over two hours.\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, boxing remained broadly illegal. To avoid legal scrutiny, Sullivan and Kilrain fought on a lumberman\u0092s estate just south of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, a rural location revealed only to partisans of the sport known as the Fancy. But before Sullivan\u0092s career ended, boxing had moved into the cities, where the gyms, matchmakers, managers, trainers, and promoters were, as well as athletic clubs and arenas for holding the fights. In New York, for instance, while the sport\u0092s legal status was contested for decades, fights nonetheless took place, often as \u0093exhibitions\u0094 or sparring demonstrations.\nOver time, eastern opponents of the sport pushed its locus to cities in the south and west. In 1890, New Orleans legalized boxing under the Marquis of Queensbury Rules, which mandated the use of gloves and three-minute rounds, a ten-count for a fallen fighter, and increased oversight powers for the referee. And it was under those rules, still in effect today, that Sullivan fought in 1892 at the city\u0092s Olympic Club\u0097illuminated by newfangled electric lights\u0097and lost his title to the young, slick James J. Corbett, who would eventually win international recognition as heavyweight champion.\nBoxing\u0092s center of gravity, especially in America, quickly became the heavyweight division, whose champion was seen by the public as a symbol of American masculinity. It mattered to Americans who claimed that distinction, as proved all too clear in 1908, when Jack Johnson, a black man, won the title. Johnson aroused opposition even before the championship fight was over. As he pummeled reigning champ Tommy Burns, police stormed the ring to stop the fight, and film cameras were shut off to spare the world the sight of a black knocking out a white for the crown. Jack London, writing at ringside, immediately issued a call for retired champion James J. Jeffries to return to the ring, \u0093wipe the grin off Johnson\u0092s face,\u0094 and reclaim whites\u0092 pride. Thus was the nation set on a crusade to find a White Hope to defeat Johnson. But he was too good. Inflaming passions further, Johnson made a point of enjoying himself inside the ring, where he often openly mocked his opponents, as well as outside it, where he drove sports cars, wore expensive clothes, frequented nightclubs, and (worst of all for white America) kept intimate company with white women. When Johnson easily defeated the once-great Jeffries in Reno on Independence Day 1910, cities across the nation erupted in race riots. Fearing future unrest, Congress banned the interstate transport of fight films, a law that remained in force for more than a quarter-century.\nJohnson\u0092s brazenness put him in the crosshairs of the U.S. government. In traveling with one of his white consorts, officials charged, Johnson had violated the recently passed Mann Act, which outlawed transporting women \u0093for the purpose of prostitution, debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u0094 The charges were dubious; the law was intended to thwart human trafficking, and though Johnson\u0092s lovers were often prostitutes, the relationships were consensual. Still, Johnson took no chances, jumping bail and living out the rest of his championship reign in foreign exile. In 1915, in Havana, he lost the title to Jess Willard, a giant White Hope recruited expressly for the purpose of beating him. A generation would pass before another black fighter was permitted to challenge for the heavyweight crown.\nDuring Johnson\u0092s long reign, and for a time after it, boxing\u0092s future was uncertain. New York City continued to vacillate, most states still banned the sport, and it lacked a central, unifying figure. That all changed with two seismic forces: American entry into World War I and Jack Dempsey. The American Expeditionary Forces boxed extensively for recreation and training in their barracks in France, and General John Pershing praised the sport\u0092s benefits for young men. Knowing that the doughboys had just faced the kaiser\u0092s guns, Americans found it hard to object to their right to box back home for pay. The summer after the war ended, Dempsey burst onto the national scene, winning the heavyweight title from Willard on a scorching July 4 in Toledo, Ohio.\nDempsey\u0092s arrival closed the circle of eras old and new. His parents had come west, to Manassa, Colorado, in a covered wagon in the 1880s; he\u0092d worked in mining camps in states barely past their frontier days; and his title-winning fight was policed by the aging Old West lawmen Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp, who collected firearms and knives from spectators before they entered the arena. But Dempsey would inaugurate America\u0092s modern age of sports and become a focal point of its dawning celebrity culture. He fought with a ferocity that boxing had never seen\u0097demolishing much larger opponents in just minutes, earning himself nicknames like \u0093the Giant Killer\u0094 and \u0093the Manassa Mauler,\u0094 and igniting a frenzy of popular interest. In 1921, Dempsey\u0092s match against a French war hero, Georges Carpentier, drew more than 80,000 fans into a wobbly, custom-built wooden bowl in Jersey City. They paid $1.7 million in gate receipts\u0097boxing\u0092s first million-dollar gate\u0097and the event captured global headlines. The Radio Corporation of America made its debut that day, transmitting the fight over primitive \u0093radiophone\u0094 technology\u0097radio\u0092s first mass broadcast in the United States.\nSuch unheard-of crowds and profits ended boxing\u0092s shadow existence and ushered in its golden era, which would last through the 1950s. Within a year of Dempsey\u0092s winning the title, New York State legalized boxing for good, and during the twenties, laws against the sport were overturned in state after state. New York quickly became the capital of boxing, with Madison Square Garden its most celebrated venue and Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds hosting huge outdoor crowds for summer matches. Dempsey is often mentioned today as a footnote to his Roaring Twenties sports peers Babe Ruth and Bill Tilden, but he rose to fame before they did and made so much more money\u0097his richest single-fight purse nearly equaled Ruth\u0092s career earnings\u0097that it seems unfair to equate him with anyone. He grew so wealthy that he took three years off from the ring to try his hand at films and the stage. In 1926, his bout with Gene Tunney in Philadelphia drew a record 120,000 fans, who watched in a driving rain as Tunney won the title. The New York Times announced the shocking result in a three-tier, seven-column, front-page headline the next day. The following year, the two men drew more than 100,000 to Chicago\u0092s Soldier Field for the rematch, which Tunney also won, and set a gate-receipts record that stood for half a century.\nDempsey and Tunney retired in the late twenties, and soon afterward, the stock-market crash portended harder times after a decade of spectacle and excess. Mediocrity characterized the heavyweight division during the early 1930s, but boxers in the lower weight classes kept the sport going. The thirties also saw the peak of boxing\u0092s ethnic rivalries: Jewish boxers like Barney Ross, Irishmen like Jimmy McLarnin, and Italians like Tony Canzoneri combined thick immigrant cultural ties with mainstream appeal, illustrating the centrality of boxing in American life.\nWith the advent of Joe Louis, who first gained national prominence in 1935 and became heavyweight champion two years later, the heavyweight division returned to center stage. Louis was the first black man since Johnson to get a shot at the title, after a steep climb out of poverty and the social deprivation that American blacks once endured as a matter of course. A grandson of slaves, he was born in Alabama but moved north with his family, settling in Detroit\u0092s Black Bottom ghetto\u0097so named not for its population but for its dark soil\u0097where he began boxing when still a boy. Unlettered and wary in the public eye, Louis fought in a deliberate, methodical style, always in position to punch and to defend, unhurried but moving toward what came to seem inevitable: another knockout win.\nLouis faced adversity of the kind that today\u0092s black athletes can only imagine. Remembering how Johnson had alienated whites, Louis\u0092s management team installed a set of rules for his conduct. These included a ban on being photographed with white women and a public posture of stoicism and clean living. A generation later, more militant blacks, like Muhammad Ali, would suggest that Louis had been too accommodating of white sensibilities, but their criticism betrayed a lack of understanding of the social context. Blacks were still getting lynched in the South; Louis seemed to understand his opportunity, and he didn\u0092t waste it.\nAt Yankee Stadium in June 1938, Louis met Germany\u0092s Max Schmeling in what remains the most politically charged sports event ever held. Schmeling had become a favorite of the Nazis\u0097not as eagerly as his critics insisted, not as reluctantly as his apologists would later claim\u0097and they often cited his earlier victory over Louis as proof of Aryan supremacy. Here was one of history\u0092s surprises: most of pre\u0096civil rights white America rooting for a black man against a white boxer. Louis, though black, now became America\u0092s representative, as confirmed by a White House visit with Franklin Roosevelt, who told him that the nation was relying on him. Almost half of America\u0092s population\u009760 million people\u0097tuned in to the radio broadcast. What they heard NBC announcer Clem McCarthy describe was probably the supreme example of an athlete executing under pressure. And \u0093execute\u0094 is the right word: Louis finished Schmeling off in barely two minutes.\nAfter the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Louis defended his title twice more, donating his purses to the Army and Navy Relief Funds, before entering the Army himself in 1942. The tribute paid him by sportswriter Jimmy Cannon\u0097\u0093A credit to his race, the human race\u0094\u0097sounds condescending now, but it reflected the impact that Louis had on white perceptions. When Louis finally retired from boxing in 1949, he had held the title for nearly 12 years, the longest run in boxing history.\nLouis\u0092s departure came at a time when boxing probably had its strongest hold on American sporting interest. In television\u0092s early years during the fifties, prime time featured fights nearly every night of the week, the most dependable fare for two major sponsors, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Gillette. Fans saw a worthy successor to Louis in Rocky Marciano, an Italian-American from Massachusetts, who would become the only heavyweight champion to retire without a defeat. In the lower weights, the unparalleled Sugar Ray Robinson\u0097who lost only once in his first 132 fights\u0097would win, lose, and win again the middleweight title in a series of dramatic bouts. He also made himself into a Harlem institution with his pink Cadillac; his nightclub, Sugar Ray\u0092s; and his traveling entourage, which included a masseuse, a barber, a voice coach, a golf instructor, and a dwarf mascot, among other essential personnel.\nBy the time Marciano and Robinson departed the scene, the sport\u0092s ethnic makeup had altered dramatically from the days of Dempsey and Louis. More than any other sport, boxing had always drawn its ranks from the poor, and as postwar prosperity expanded the middle class, the stock of Irish and Italian fighters began thinning out, while the Jewish fighters were all but gone. Hispanic fighters, like Cuba\u0092s Kid Gavilan, became a presence in the U.S., while blacks took the lead. It was all part of the nation\u0092s changing social landscape.\nBut nothing could have prepared America for the sixties\u0097or for Muhammad Ali, as divisive a figure as that traumatic decade produced. Even before he became politically vocal, Ali, originally named Cassius Clay, carried on like no American athlete before him, declaring that he was \u0093the Greatest\u0094 boxer of all time and reciting doggerel poetry predicting the outcomes of his bouts. Unlike most great heavyweights, he won not with heavy punching power but with the speed of his hands and the balletic grace of his feet. So artful and quick was he that he never bothered to learn the rudiments of defense, instead keeping his hands low and often leaning away from an opponent\u0092s punches instead of blocking them. \u0093His hands can\u0092t hit what his eyes can\u0092t see,\u0094 he said. Though purists dismissed his performances inside the ring and out, there was a refreshing exuberance to the young boxer. Absurdly handsome for a fighter, he was a sporting herald of the emerging youth culture; he won the heavyweight title in February 1964, the same month that the Beatles landed in America.\nBut that year, he announced his membership in the Black Muslim movement and changed his name, and in 1967, he refused induction into the U.S. armed forces for service in Vietnam. Ali became a pariah, loathed by many white fans and most established sportswriters. Claiming conscientious-objector status, he saw his boxing license revoked across the country, and for three and a half years found himself banned from the ring and facing numerous legal battles. Only in the 1970s, by which time he\u0092d been reinstated to fight, did he make inroads with more conservative fans. With the war over and the nation trying to come to terms with its shattering effects, Ali\u0092s trajectory now seemed less radical. Even his critics had to admit that he had paid a steep price, losing the prime years of his athletic career. On returning to the ring, he faced two defining adversaries\u0097Joe Frazier and George Foreman\u0097and the pure theater of his battles with them has never been surpassed. As Ali aged and slowed but kept fighting anyway, his fights became mesmerizing dramas of gamesmanship, skill, and, finally, sheer grit. In the ring, he made converts of everyone. He seemed to have more to fight for than his opponents did, not only because his surpassing ego made him willing to endure anything to win, but also because, in casting himself as a racial prophet and champion of the world\u0092s downtrodden, he made it so that he must not lose.\nAli discredited forever the idea of the quiescent athlete, and he was the first truly global sports star. His unmatched gifts as a showman have influenced athletes in all sports, though mostly not for the better: the athletes who mug before the camera, celebrate themselves at every turn, and denigrate opponents are part of Ali\u0092s legacy. In a popular culture addicted to display, those who prefer to keep their thoughts to themselves are now suspect for lacking authenticity. Still, in his sport\u0092s history, Ali is a colossus without successors: he fought like no one before or since.\nIn his usual grandiose way, Ali predicted that boxing would die after he was gone, but for a decade after he left the scene, the sport enjoyed its last great run. The public\u0092s interest turned once again to fighters at the lower weights. This shift was sparked by a gifted boxer from Maryland, Ray Charles Leonard, whose parents named him after the singer but whose boxing tutors cheekily gave him Sugar Ray Robinson\u0092s famous nickname. Articulate, usually gracious, and not given to shouting, he was Ali without the politics or the sometimes cruel theatrics. But like Ali, he would prove himself against the highest level of competition. In the 1980s, Sugar Ray Leonard and his formidable adversaries\u0097Roberto Dur\u00e1n, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler\u0097fought one another in a series of high-profile bouts that made them all multimillionaires. And Leonard would prove more successful than Ali at retaining his earnings and his faculties.\nJust as Leonard and the lower-weight heroes of the eighties were finishing their careers, Mike Tyson emerged as the next great heavyweight, and boxing again had a focal point in its marquee division. Tyson\u0092s worldwide fame would approach Ali\u0092s. A violent youth from Brooklyn\u0092s Brownsville neighborhood, Tyson was legally adopted by the enigmatic trainer and boxing psychologist Cus D\u0092Amato, who saw a future heavyweight champ in the hulking 13-year-old and made him his personal project. D\u0092Amato\u0092s judgment proved correct in 1986, as Tyson, just 20, became the youngest man to win a heavyweight title.\nWhat made Tyson fearsome in the ring was not just his terrifying punching power but his speed. No heavyweight combined the two assets so formidably. In the early years of Tyson\u0092s reign, most opponents were, in effect, beaten before the opening bell, so intimidating was his aura. His Dempsey-like style of early-round knockouts made his name box-office gold. Tyson also won the goodwill of the American public, thanks to an earnest personality\u0097including an inimitable high-pitched voice\u0097and an expertly managed public-relations image. Sportswriters called him Kid Dynamite.\nBut it turned out that the soft-spoken kid with the killer punch had demons that had never been conquered. As his fame and wealth grew, Kid Dynamite gave way to Tabloid Mike. His doomed marriage with a young actress, Robin Givens, made fodder for headlines and ended amid lurid tales of domestic violence. As his personal life spiraled out of control, Tyson lost his focus in the ring. He lacked Ali\u0092s force of will and ability to improvise, and he lost his title at 23. Not long afterward, he was convicted of rape and served three years in prison.\nOn his release, promoters eagerly paid Tyson millions to box again, but Kid Dynamite couldn\u0092t regain his youthful form. Embracing the role of villain, he became one of the more grotesque figures in America\u0092s always bizarre popular culture, uttering statements like \u0093I want to kill people. I want to rip their stomachs out and eat their children.\u0094 Nothing captured Tyson\u0092s depravity more memorably than his 1997 fight with Evander Holyfield, in which he bit off pieces of his opponent\u0092s ears, earning a disqualification and provoking a wild postfight melee.\nTyson\u0092s behavior sullied boxing\u0092s always precarious reputation, making the sport synonymous with freakishness. He would be the last in a long line of heavyweights to bear a symbolic connection to American social trends. For just as the blustery John L. Sullivan represented a growing nation coming into its strength, and the magnetic Dempsey the birth of mass-media celebrity and commercial culture, and the stoic Louis the hard years of depression and war, and the mercurial Ali the age of rebellion and change, so Tyson embodied the postmodern hoodlum\u0097the gangsta from an urban landscape pulverized by fatherlessness and anomie. Remarkably, a middle-aged Tyson is now trying to remake his life, a feat that, given the obstacles, would outstrip anything that his illustrious predecessors achieved, in the ring or out.\nWith Tyson\u0092s fall, boxing completed its transformation from central preoccupation to sideshow. For years, the sport had failed to meet the competitive challenge posed by other sports in the television age. Even as the tube brought fights into millions of homes, it hurt attendance at live events. Looking elsewhere for revenue, promoters began to stage most big fights at gambling casinos, a lucrative prospect for those in the money but one that separated the sport from a reliable fan base in major cities.\nYet the fact that TV proved a huge boon for most other sports suggests that we must look elsewhere for the true causes of boxing\u0092s decline\u0097above all, to changing tastes. In the long postwar boom, prosperity and higher living standards created different expectations for leisure and entertainment, as well as more refined attitudes. Boxing\u0092s endemic corruption and scandal wore away its popular appeal and made the sport seem increasingly atavistic. Crooked managers and promoters; rankings of fighters doctored by fraudulent boxing organizations; allegations of fixed fights and bribed referees and judges; foul play in the ring, from illegal substances to doctored gloves; and fighters killed or maimed who shouldn\u0092t have been fighting in the first place\u0097these were among the reasons that the American public stopped taking the sport seriously.\nWorst of all, though, were the sport\u0092s effects on the human body. Boxing\u0092s fatality rate is lower than that of horse racing and of some other sports, but its real scourge is not death but debility\u0097particularly, brain damage. Today, the specter of brain trauma hovers over professional, college, and even high school football, posing a potential threat to that sport\u0092s future. But awareness of boxing\u0092s dangers long predates modern research. The image of the punch-drunk, shuffling old fighter goes back to the sport\u0092s early days; researchers conducted studies of trauma in ex-fighters as early as the 1920s.\nWhen the subject of boxing and brain trauma comes up today, the first image in everyone\u0092s mind is that of Muhammad Ali, now 69. Afflicted with Parkinson\u0092s disease, he moves hesitantly, is generally unintelligible, and shakes convulsively across his upper body; his moon-shaped face exhibits the masklike blankness so common to Parkinson\u0092s\u0097and Alzheimer\u0092s\u0097sufferers. Ali\u0092s great ring model, Sugar Ray Robinson, who died in 1989, was afflicted with Alzheimer\u0092s disease in his final years. Like Ali, Robinson fought long beyond the point at which he could protect himself. Boxing\u0092s two most gifted and stylish performers, in their prime the antithesis of the brute fighter, ended up indistinguishable from the broken-down old pugs they were sure they\u0092d never become.\nIn 1984, the American Medical Association, after years of study, called for a ban on boxing, citing the sport\u0092s object of causing physical harm and the damage its participants clearly suffered to their mental faculties. Since then, other studies have continued to link boxing to severe brain trauma. But the AMA hasn\u0092t been able to build enough momentum to ban boxing\u0097ironically, because not enough people in the U.S. care one way or the other. Revulsion has passed into indifference.\nEven as its popularity has ebbed, boxing flickers in the American consciousness. One surprising area in which the sport has made small inroads into American habits is the growth of \u0093white-collar boxing,\u0094 in which men and women show up after their day jobs to spar or fight real bouts in a gym. Many health clubs now offer boxing-related fitness programs, as few activities can compete with boxing\u0092s aerobic benefits. Boxing continues to fascinate great writers, as it always has\u0097only baseball has a comparable literary pedigree. And the ring\u0092s elemental sense of conflict has proved endlessly adaptable for filmmakers. The prominence of some recent boxing films, like Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man, and The Fighter, is impressive, considering that the many fine boxing films of the past\u0097from Body and Soul, Champion, and The Set-Up to The Harder They Fall, Fat City, and Raging Bull\u0097could count on broader public enthusiasm for the sport.\nAnd just when one is tempted to turn forever from this sport of too much scandal and sorrow, someone emerges. In the past, boxing has endured other down periods before a galvanizing figure\u0097Dempsey, Louis, Ali, Leonard\u0097rescued it. If it is happening again, it\u0092s thanks to the 32-year-old Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao. He has won titles, or parts of titles, in eight weight divisions, which no one has ever done before. Some have dared say that he is among the greatest fighters in history.\nWhat matters about Pacquiao is not just his record but who he is: a national hero in the Philippines and boxing\u0092s most compelling star in many years. \u0093Manny is our people\u0092s idol and this generation\u0092s shining light,\u0094 says former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. \u0093He is our David against Goliath, our hero and the bearer of the Filipino dream. . . . You can feel the excitement throughout the country every time he is in the ring.\u0094 Such devotion recalls the way fighters of the past were regarded by immigrant communities. Pacquiao seems to relish the burden he carries. Like some former champions, he harbors an epic concept of himself. Being a champion is not enough: he is an elected congressman from the Philippines\u0092 Sarangani province, a job that, by all accounts, he takes seriously. He seems heartfelt in his desire to address the poverty of his native land and to stamp out sex trafficking, among other abuses. He also fancies himself a singer; after several of his recent fights, he has even given concerts.\nPacquiao is the kind of figure who could restore boxing to its former glory, if such a thing were possible. Boxing devotees yearn for him to participate in a \u0093super fight\u0094 like those in which Sugar Ray Leonard fought in the 1980s. The opponent for such a battle is standing in plain sight: Floyd Mayweather, Jr., a brilliant defensive boxer who has never lost. But so far, no deal has been reached to get the two men to fight, and age is encroaching on both. Negotiations have broken down for various reasons, including Mayweather\u0092s insistence that Pacquiao submit to drug testing shortly before the fight; some claim that Mayweather wants to avoid the contest altogether.\nIf the fight does happen, it would be the biggest boxing match in a generation. And though few believe it would work out this way, nothing would be more fitting than for such a battle to occur during a New York summer or early autumn, at Yankee Stadium, near the same spot where Dempsey, Louis, and Ali fought. At long last, America\u0092s ghost sport would have reassembled the throngs\u0097if only for a night.\nPaul Beston is an associate editor of City Journal.\n"}, {"score": 331.88116, "uuid": "d1533bb2-396b-5a57-ac3c-bb69922fdef1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1905wb-54-11280", "target_hostname": "city-journal.com", "target_uri": "http://city-journal.com/2011/21_3_urb-boxing.html", "page_rank": 1.1750767e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "The Ghost Sport by Paul Beston, City Journal Summer 2011", "snippet": "Exiled from boxing for years for his stance on the Vietnam War, <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>, here defeating <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> in 1974, personified an era of rebellion and change.

Anderson .\nPaul Beston\nBoxing, today relegated to the margins, was once central to American life.\nFrank Hurley/NY Daily News/Getty Images\nExiled from boxing for years for his stance on the Vietnam War, Muhammad Ali, here defeating Joe Frazier in 1974, personified an era of rebellion and change.\nEven now, making our twenty-first-century rounds, we\u0092re never far from the reach of the Fancy. Outside Grand Central Terminal on a raw spring morning, the UPS drivers are doing their moves: one guy, slight and older, crouching and bobbing his head, his breath making clouds in the chill air, throws hooking punches, left and right, which stop just short of the larger and younger man, who tucks in his elbows as if he were tapping his ancestors\u0092 instincts: protect the body, move your feet, position yourself to be ready when the chance comes. The scrap ends almost as soon as it began, the men laughing.\nPoliticians, pledging to \u0093fight\u0094 for a principle, sometimes hold up boxing gloves as a sign of commitment to cheering supporters. The gloves bring to mind a familiar image: a narrow, roped square; eager spectators surrounding the ring; and, in the fighters\u0092 corners, old, wrinkled seconds with Q-tips behind their ears, holding buckets. The scene frames an odd, brutal human activity that disappears from the public mind for long periods, then surfaces again when a fight or fighter reaches out to us, demanding a response.\nBut that happens rarely today; few Americans could name more than one or two current boxers, if that. Boxing has become a ghost sport, long since discredited but still hovering in the nation\u0092s consciousness, refusing to go away and be silent entirely. There was a time when things were very different. For boxing once stood at the center of American life, and its history winds a thread through the broader history of the nation.\nBoxing\u0092s beginnings in America go back to slave days, when plantation owners pitted slaves against one another and wagered on the outcomes. One freed slave, Tom Molineaux, even fought overseas against the British champion, Tom Cribb\u0097and probably would have won their 1810 match, had Cribb\u0092s desperate supporters not intervened just as Molineaux seized a decisive advantage. Boxing then was conducted with bare fists, under the old London Prize Ring Rules, which stipulated fights to the finish\u0097that is, until one man could not continue. The rules also permitted wrestling holds and other tactics, and rounds ended only with \u0093falls,\u0094 when one man went down, whether from a punch or a throw or sheer exhaustion. Before the Civil War, boxing enjoyed a brief vogue in New York, where fighters often associated with the Tammany Hall machine rose to prominence. But the war interrupted the sport\u0092s momentum.\nOnly with the emergence of its first great figure, John L. Sullivan, did boxing truly arrive in America. Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1858, the son of an immigrant hod carrier from Ireland, Sullivan fought his way to wealth and fame rivaled by few in his time. With his physical prowess and hot-blooded public persona, Sullivan became an Irish-American hero and a symbol of manly vigor to a nation that, experiencing an industrial revolution and transformative changes in living standards and manner of work, worried that its young men might go soft. After he won the heavyweight championship (or at least what Americans generally viewed as the championship) in 1882, he went on a barnstorming national tour, offering $1,000 to anyone who could last four rounds with him in makeshift rings set up in theaters, ballrooms, and saloons. Reportedly, only one man won the money. It\u0092s from Sullivan that we get the boast, still heard today: \u0093I can lick any sonofabitch in the house.\u0094\nSullivan created an archetype that remains in force in 2011: the athlete as cultural icon and all-around moneymaking machine. In Sullivan\u0092s time, that dual role generally meant performing on stage, as he did in Honest Hearts and Willing Hands, a melodrama that toured the country. \u0093Shake the hand that shook the hand of the great John L.!,\u0094 exulted the lucky few who got to meet him. Poet Vachel Lindsay memorialized Sullivan\u0092s most impressive victory, in an 1889 marathon battle with Jake Kilrain\u0097the last bare-knuckle championship, waged in wilting heat and lasting over two hours.\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, boxing remained broadly illegal. To avoid legal scrutiny, Sullivan and Kilrain fought on a lumberman\u0092s estate just south of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, a rural location revealed only to partisans of the sport known as the Fancy. But before Sullivan\u0092s career ended, boxing had moved into the cities, where the gyms, matchmakers, managers, trainers, and promoters were, as well as athletic clubs and arenas for holding the fights. In New York, for instance, while the sport\u0092s legal status was contested for decades, fights nonetheless took place, often as \u0093exhibitions\u0094 or sparring demonstrations.\nOver time, eastern opponents of the sport pushed its locus to cities in the south and west. In 1890, New Orleans legalized boxing under the Marquis of Queensbury Rules, which mandated the use of gloves and three-minute rounds, a ten-count for a fallen fighter, and increased oversight powers for the referee. And it was under those rules, still in effect today, that Sullivan fought in 1892 at the city\u0092s Olympic Club\u0097illuminated by newfangled electric lights\u0097and lost his title to the young, slick James J. Corbett, who would eventually win international recognition as heavyweight champion.\nBoxing\u0092s center of gravity, especially in America, quickly became the heavyweight division, whose champion was seen by the public as a symbol of American masculinity. It mattered to Americans who claimed that distinction, as proved all too clear in 1908, when Jack Johnson, a black man, won the title. Johnson aroused opposition even before the championship fight was over. As he pummeled reigning champ Tommy Burns, police stormed the ring to stop the fight, and film cameras were shut off to spare the world the sight of a black knocking out a white for the crown. Jack London, writing at ringside, immediately issued a call for retired champion James J. Jeffries to return to the ring, \u0093wipe the grin off Johnson\u0092s face,\u0094 and reclaim whites\u0092 pride. Thus was the nation set on a crusade to find a White Hope to defeat Johnson. But he was too good. Inflaming passions further, Johnson made a point of enjoying himself inside the ring, where he often openly mocked his opponents, as well as outside it, where he drove sports cars, wore expensive clothes, frequented nightclubs, and (worst of all for white America) kept intimate company with white women. When Johnson easily defeated the once-great Jeffries in Reno on Independence Day 1910, cities across the nation erupted in race riots. Fearing future unrest, Congress banned the interstate transport of fight films, a law that remained in force for more than a quarter-century.\nJohnson\u0092s brazenness put him in the crosshairs of the U.S. government. In traveling with one of his white consorts, officials charged, Johnson had violated the recently passed Mann Act, which outlawed transporting women \u0093for the purpose of prostitution, debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u0094 The charges were dubious; the law was intended to thwart human trafficking, and though Johnson\u0092s lovers were often prostitutes, the relationships were consensual. Still, Johnson took no chances, jumping bail and living out the rest of his championship reign in foreign exile. In 1915, in Havana, he lost the title to Jess Willard, a giant White Hope recruited expressly for the purpose of beating him. A generation would pass before another black fighter was permitted to challenge for the heavyweight crown.\nDuring Johnson\u0092s long reign, and for a time after it, boxing\u0092s future was uncertain. New York City continued to vacillate, most states still banned the sport, and it lacked a central, unifying figure. That all changed with two seismic forces: American entry into World War I and Jack Dempsey. The American Expeditionary Forces boxed extensively for recreation and training in their barracks in France, and General John Pershing praised the sport\u0092s benefits for young men. Knowing that the doughboys had just faced the kaiser\u0092s guns, Americans found it hard to object to their right to box back home for pay. The summer after the war ended, Dempsey burst onto the national scene, winning the heavyweight title from Willard on a scorching July 4 in Toledo, Ohio.\nDempsey\u0092s arrival closed the circle of eras old and new. His parents had come west, to Manassa, Colorado, in a covered wagon in the 1880s; he\u0092d worked in mining camps in states barely past their frontier days; and his title-winning fight was policed by the aging Old West lawmen Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp, who collected firearms and knives from spectators before they entered the arena. But Dempsey would inaugurate America\u0092s modern age of sports and become a focal point of its dawning celebrity culture. He fought with a ferocity that boxing had never seen\u0097demolishing much larger opponents in just minutes, earning himself nicknames like \u0093the Giant Killer\u0094 and \u0093the Manassa Mauler,\u0094 and igniting a frenzy of popular interest. In 1921, Dempsey\u0092s match against a French war hero, Georges Carpentier, drew more than 80,000 fans into a wobbly, custom-built wooden bowl in Jersey City. They paid $1.7 million in gate receipts\u0097boxing\u0092s first million-dollar gate\u0097and the event captured global headlines. The Radio Corporation of America made its debut that day, transmitting the fight over primitive \u0093radiophone\u0094 technology\u0097radio\u0092s first mass broadcast in the United States.\nSuch unheard-of crowds and profits ended boxing\u0092s shadow existence and ushered in its golden era, which would last through the 1950s. Within a year of Dempsey\u0092s winning the title, New York State legalized boxing for good, and during the twenties, laws against the sport were overturned in state after state. New York quickly became the capital of boxing, with Madison Square Garden its most celebrated venue and Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds hosting huge outdoor crowds for summer matches. Dempsey is often mentioned today as a footnote to his Roaring Twenties sports peers Babe Ruth and Bill Tilden, but he rose to fame before they did and made so much more money\u0097his richest single-fight purse nearly equaled Ruth\u0092s career earnings\u0097that it seems unfair to equate him with anyone. He grew so wealthy that he took three years off from the ring to try his hand at films and the stage. In 1926, his bout with Gene Tunney in Philadelphia drew a record 120,000 fans, who watched in a driving rain as Tunney won the title. The New York Times announced the shocking result in a three-tier, seven-column, front-page headline the next day. The following year, the two men drew more than 100,000 to Chicago\u0092s Soldier Field for the rematch, which Tunney also won, and set a gate-receipts record that stood for half a century.\nDempsey and Tunney retired in the late twenties, and soon afterward, the stock-market crash portended harder times after a decade of spectacle and excess. Mediocrity characterized the heavyweight division during the early 1930s, but boxers in the lower weight classes kept the sport going. The thirties also saw the peak of boxing\u0092s ethnic rivalries: Jewish boxers like Barney Ross, Irishmen like Jimmy McLarnin, and Italians like Tony Canzoneri combined thick immigrant cultural ties with mainstream appeal, illustrating the centrality of boxing in American life.\nWith the advent of Joe Louis, who first gained national prominence in 1935 and became heavyweight champion two years later, the heavyweight division returned to center stage. Louis was the first black man since Johnson to get a shot at the title, after a steep climb out of poverty and the social deprivation that American blacks once endured as a matter of course. A grandson of slaves, he was born in Alabama but moved north with his family, settling in Detroit\u0092s Black Bottom ghetto\u0097so named not for its population but for its dark soil\u0097where he began boxing when still a boy. Unlettered and wary in the public eye, Louis fought in a deliberate, methodical style, always in position to punch and to defend, unhurried but moving toward what came to seem inevitable: another knockout win.\nLouis faced adversity of the kind that today\u0092s black athletes can only imagine. Remembering how Johnson had alienated whites, Louis\u0092s management team installed a set of rules for his conduct. These included a ban on being photographed with white women and a public posture of stoicism and clean living. A generation later, more militant blacks, like Muhammad Ali, would suggest that Louis had been too accommodating of white sensibilities, but their criticism betrayed a lack of understanding of the social context. Blacks were still getting lynched in the South; Louis seemed to understand his opportunity, and he didn\u0092t waste it.\nAt Yankee Stadium in June 1938, Louis met Germany\u0092s Max Schmeling in what remains the most politically charged sports event ever held. Schmeling had become a favorite of the Nazis\u0097not as eagerly as his critics insisted, not as reluctantly as his apologists would later claim\u0097and they often cited his earlier victory over Louis as proof of Aryan supremacy. Here was one of history\u0092s surprises: most of pre\u0096civil rights white America rooting for a black man against a white boxer. Louis, though black, now became America\u0092s representative, as confirmed by a White House visit with Franklin Roosevelt, who told him that the nation was relying on him. Almost half of America\u0092s population\u009760 million people\u0097tuned in to the radio broadcast. What they heard NBC announcer Clem McCarthy describe was probably the supreme example of an athlete executing under pressure. And \u0093execute\u0094 is the right word: Louis finished Schmeling off in barely two minutes.\nAfter the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Louis defended his title twice more, donating his purses to the Army and Navy Relief Funds, before entering the Army himself in 1942. The tribute paid him by sportswriter Jimmy Cannon\u0097\u0093A credit to his race, the human race\u0094\u0097sounds condescending now, but it reflected the impact that Louis had on white perceptions. When Louis finally retired from boxing in 1949, he had held the title for nearly 12 years, the longest run in boxing history.\nLouis\u0092s departure came at a time when boxing probably had its strongest hold on American sporting interest. In television\u0092s early years during the fifties, prime time featured fights nearly every night of the week, the most dependable fare for two major sponsors, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Gillette. Fans saw a worthy successor to Louis in Rocky Marciano, an Italian-American from Massachusetts, who would become the only heavyweight champion to retire without a defeat. In the lower weights, the unparalleled Sugar Ray Robinson\u0097who lost only once in his first 132 fights\u0097would win, lose, and win again the middleweight title in a series of dramatic bouts. He also made himself into a Harlem institution with his pink Cadillac; his nightclub, Sugar Ray\u0092s; and his traveling entourage, which included a masseuse, a barber, a voice coach, a golf instructor, and a dwarf mascot, among other essential personnel.\nBy the time Marciano and Robinson departed the scene, the sport\u0092s ethnic makeup had altered dramatically from the days of Dempsey and Louis. More than any other sport, boxing had always drawn its ranks from the poor, and as postwar prosperity expanded the middle class, the stock of Irish and Italian fighters began thinning out, while the Jewish fighters were all but gone. Hispanic fighters, like Cuba\u0092s Kid Gavilan, became a presence in the U.S., while blacks took the lead. It was all part of the nation\u0092s changing social landscape.\nBut nothing could have prepared America for the sixties\u0097or for Muhammad Ali, as divisive a figure as that traumatic decade produced. Even before he became politically vocal, Ali, originally named Cassius Clay, carried on like no American athlete before him, declaring that he was \u0093the Greatest\u0094 boxer of all time and reciting doggerel poetry predicting the outcomes of his bouts. Unlike most great heavyweights, he won not with heavy punching power but with the speed of his hands and the balletic grace of his feet. So artful and quick was he that he never bothered to learn the rudiments of defense, instead keeping his hands low and often leaning away from an opponent\u0092s punches instead of blocking them. \u0093His hands can\u0092t hit what his eyes can\u0092t see,\u0094 he said. Though purists dismissed his performances inside the ring and out, there was a refreshing exuberance to the young boxer. Absurdly handsome for a fighter, he was a sporting herald of the emerging youth culture; he won the heavyweight title in February 1964, the same month that the Beatles landed in America.\nBut that year, he announced his membership in the Black Muslim movement and changed his name, and in 1967, he refused induction into the U.S. armed forces for service in Vietnam. Ali became a pariah, loathed by many white fans and most established sportswriters. Claiming conscientious-objector status, he saw his boxing license revoked across the country, and for three and a half years found himself banned from the ring and facing numerous legal battles. Only in the 1970s, by which time he\u0092d been reinstated to fight, did he make inroads with more conservative fans. With the war over and the nation trying to come to terms with its shattering effects, Ali\u0092s trajectory now seemed less radical. Even his critics had to admit that he had paid a steep price, losing the prime years of his athletic career. On returning to the ring, he faced two defining adversaries\u0097Joe Frazier and George Foreman\u0097and the pure theater of his battles with them has never been surpassed. As Ali aged and slowed but kept fighting anyway, his fights became mesmerizing dramas of gamesmanship, skill, and, finally, sheer grit. In the ring, he made converts of everyone. He seemed to have more to fight for than his opponents did, not only because his surpassing ego made him willing to endure anything to win, but also because, in casting himself as a racial prophet and champion of the world\u0092s downtrodden, he made it so that he must not lose.\nAli discredited forever the idea of the quiescent athlete, and he was the first truly global sports star. His unmatched gifts as a showman have influenced athletes in all sports, though mostly not for the better: the athletes who mug before the camera, celebrate themselves at every turn, and denigrate opponents are part of Ali\u0092s legacy. In a popular culture addicted to display, those who prefer to keep their thoughts to themselves are now suspect for lacking authenticity. Still, in his sport\u0092s history, Ali is a colossus without successors: he fought like no one before or since.\nIn his usual grandiose way, Ali predicted that boxing would die after he was gone, but for a decade after he left the scene, the sport enjoyed its last great run. The public\u0092s interest turned once again to fighters at the lower weights. This shift was sparked by a gifted boxer from Maryland, Ray Charles Leonard, whose parents named him after the singer but whose boxing tutors cheekily gave him Sugar Ray Robinson\u0092s famous nickname. Articulate, usually gracious, and not given to shouting, he was Ali without the politics or the sometimes cruel theatrics. But like Ali, he would prove himself against the highest level of competition. In the 1980s, Sugar Ray Leonard and his formidable adversaries\u0097Roberto Dur\u00e1n, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler\u0097fought one another in a series of high-profile bouts that made them all multimillionaires. And Leonard would prove more successful than Ali at retaining his earnings and his faculties.\nJust as Leonard and the lower-weight heroes of the eighties were finishing their careers, Mike Tyson emerged as the next great heavyweight, and boxing again had a focal point in its marquee division. Tyson\u0092s worldwide fame would approach Ali\u0092s. A violent youth from Brooklyn\u0092s Brownsville neighborhood, Tyson was legally adopted by the enigmatic trainer and boxing psychologist Cus D\u0092Amato, who saw a future heavyweight champ in the hulking 13-year-old and made him his personal project. D\u0092Amato\u0092s judgment proved correct in 1986, as Tyson, just 20, became the youngest man to win a heavyweight title.\nWhat made Tyson fearsome in the ring was not just his terrifying punching power but his speed. No heavyweight combined the two assets so formidably. In the early years of Tyson\u0092s reign, most opponents were, in effect, beaten before the opening bell, so intimidating was his aura. His Dempsey-like style of early-round knockouts made his name box-office gold. Tyson also won the goodwill of the American public, thanks to an earnest personality\u0097including an inimitable high-pitched voice\u0097and an expertly managed public-relations image. Sportswriters called him Kid Dynamite.\nBut it turned out that the soft-spoken kid with the killer punch had demons that had never been conquered. As his fame and wealth grew, Kid Dynamite gave way to Tabloid Mike. His doomed marriage with a young actress, Robin Givens, made fodder for headlines and ended amid lurid tales of domestic violence. As his personal life spiraled out of control, Tyson lost his focus in the ring. He lacked Ali\u0092s force of will and ability to improvise, and he lost his title at 23. Not long afterward, he was convicted of rape and served three years in prison.\nOn his release, promoters eagerly paid Tyson millions to box again, but Kid Dynamite couldn\u0092t regain his youthful form. Embracing the role of villain, he became one of the more grotesque figures in America\u0092s always bizarre popular culture, uttering statements like \u0093I want to kill people. I want to rip their stomachs out and eat their children.\u0094 Nothing captured Tyson\u0092s depravity more memorably than his 1997 fight with Evander Holyfield, in which he bit off pieces of his opponent\u0092s ears, earning a disqualification and provoking a wild postfight melee.\nTyson\u0092s behavior sullied boxing\u0092s always precarious reputation, making the sport synonymous with freakishness. He would be the last in a long line of heavyweights to bear a symbolic connection to American social trends. For just as the blustery John L. Sullivan represented a growing nation coming into its strength, and the magnetic Dempsey the birth of mass-media celebrity and commercial culture, and the stoic Louis the hard years of depression and war, and the mercurial Ali the age of rebellion and change, so Tyson embodied the postmodern hoodlum\u0097the gangsta from an urban landscape pulverized by fatherlessness and anomie. Remarkably, a middle-aged Tyson is now trying to remake his life, a feat that, given the obstacles, would outstrip anything that his illustrious predecessors achieved, in the ring or out.\nWith Tyson\u0092s fall, boxing completed its transformation from central preoccupation to sideshow. For years, the sport had failed to meet the competitive challenge posed by other sports in the television age. Even as the tube brought fights into millions of homes, it hurt attendance at live events. Looking elsewhere for revenue, promoters began to stage most big fights at gambling casinos, a lucrative prospect for those in the money but one that separated the sport from a reliable fan base in major cities.\nYet the fact that TV proved a huge boon for most other sports suggests that we must look elsewhere for the true causes of boxing\u0092s decline\u0097above all, to changing tastes. In the long postwar boom, prosperity and higher living standards created different expectations for leisure and entertainment, as well as more refined attitudes. Boxing\u0092s endemic corruption and scandal wore away its popular appeal and made the sport seem increasingly atavistic. Crooked managers and promoters; rankings of fighters doctored by fraudulent boxing organizations; allegations of fixed fights and bribed referees and judges; foul play in the ring, from illegal substances to doctored gloves; and fighters killed or maimed who shouldn\u0092t have been fighting in the first place\u0097these were among the reasons that the American public stopped taking the sport seriously.\nWorst of all, though, were the sport\u0092s effects on the human body. Boxing\u0092s fatality rate is lower than that of horse racing and of some other sports, but its real scourge is not death but debility\u0097particularly, brain damage. Today, the specter of brain trauma hovers over professional, college, and even high school football, posing a potential threat to that sport\u0092s future. But awareness of boxing\u0092s dangers long predates modern research. The image of the punch-drunk, shuffling old fighter goes back to the sport\u0092s early days; researchers conducted studies of trauma in ex-fighters as early as the 1920s.\nWhen the subject of boxing and brain trauma comes up today, the first image in everyone\u0092s mind is that of Muhammad Ali, now 69. Afflicted with Parkinson\u0092s disease, he moves hesitantly, is generally unintelligible, and shakes convulsively across his upper body; his moon-shaped face exhibits the masklike blankness so common to Parkinson\u0092s\u0097and Alzheimer\u0092s\u0097sufferers. Ali\u0092s great ring model, Sugar Ray Robinson, who died in 1989, was afflicted with Alzheimer\u0092s disease in his final years. Like Ali, Robinson fought long beyond the point at which he could protect himself. Boxing\u0092s two most gifted and stylish performers, in their prime the antithesis of the brute fighter, ended up indistinguishable from the broken-down old pugs they were sure they\u0092d never become.\nIn 1984, the American Medical Association, after years of study, called for a ban on boxing, citing the sport\u0092s object of causing physical harm and the damage its participants clearly suffered to their mental faculties. Since then, other studies have continued to link boxing to severe brain trauma. But the AMA hasn\u0092t been able to build enough momentum to ban boxing\u0097ironically, because not enough people in the U.S. care one way or the other. Revulsion has passed into indifference.\nEven as its popularity has ebbed, boxing flickers in the American consciousness. One surprising area in which the sport has made small inroads into American habits is the growth of \u0093white-collar boxing,\u0094 in which men and women show up after their day jobs to spar or fight real bouts in a gym. Many health clubs now offer boxing-related fitness programs, as few activities can compete with boxing\u0092s aerobic benefits. Boxing continues to fascinate great writers, as it always has\u0097only baseball has a comparable literary pedigree. And the ring\u0092s elemental sense of conflict has proved endlessly adaptable for filmmakers. The prominence of some recent boxing films, like Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man, and The Fighter, is impressive, considering that the many fine boxing films of the past\u0097from Body and Soul, Champion, and The Set-Up to The Harder They Fall, Fat City, and Raging Bull\u0097could count on broader public enthusiasm for the sport.\nAnd just when one is tempted to turn forever from this sport of too much scandal and sorrow, someone emerges. In the past, boxing has endured other down periods before a galvanizing figure\u0097Dempsey, Louis, Ali, Leonard\u0097rescued it. If it is happening again, it\u0092s thanks to the 32-year-old Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao. He has won titles, or parts of titles, in eight weight divisions, which no one has ever done before. Some have dared say that he is among the greatest fighters in history.\nWhat matters about Pacquiao is not just his record but who he is: a national hero in the Philippines and boxing\u0092s most compelling star in many years. \u0093Manny is our people\u0092s idol and this generation\u0092s shining light,\u0094 says former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. \u0093He is our David against Goliath, our hero and the bearer of the Filipino dream. . . . You can feel the excitement throughout the country every time he is in the ring.\u0094 Such devotion recalls the way fighters of the past were regarded by immigrant communities. Pacquiao seems to relish the burden he carries. Like some former champions, he harbors an epic concept of himself. Being a champion is not enough: he is an elected congressman from the Philippines\u0092 Sarangani province, a job that, by all accounts, he takes seriously. He seems heartfelt in his desire to address the poverty of his native land and to stamp out sex trafficking, among other abuses. He also fancies himself a singer; after several of his recent fights, he has even given concerts.\nPacquiao is the kind of figure who could restore boxing to its former glory, if such a thing were possible. Boxing devotees yearn for him to participate in a \u0093super fight\u0094 like those in which Sugar Ray Leonard fought in the 1980s. The opponent for such a battle is standing in plain sight: Floyd Mayweather, Jr., a brilliant defensive boxer who has never lost. But so far, no deal has been reached to get the two men to fight, and age is encroaching on both. Negotiations have broken down for various reasons, including Mayweather\u0092s insistence that Pacquiao submit to drug testing shortly before the fight; some claim that Mayweather wants to avoid the contest altogether.\nIf the fight does happen, it would be the biggest boxing match in a generation. And though few believe it would work out this way, nothing would be more fitting than for such a battle to occur during a New York summer or early autumn, at Yankee Stadium, near the same spot where Dempsey, Louis, and Ali fought. At long last, America\u0092s ghost sport would have reassembled the throngs\u0097if only for a night.\nPaul Beston is an associate editor of City Journal.\n"}, {"score": 331.85367, "uuid": "60ea52c0-c644-5f65-9ef6-269568952384", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1007wb-41-00667", "target_hostname": "www.city-journal.com", "target_uri": "http://www.city-journal.com/2011/21_3_urb-boxing.html", "page_rank": 1.1750776e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "The Ghost Sport by Paul Beston, City Journal Summer 2011", "snippet": "Exiled from boxing for years for his stance on the Vietnam War, <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>, here defeating <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> in 1974, personified an era of rebellion and change.

Anderson .\nPaul Beston\nBoxing, today relegated to the margins, was once central to American life.\nFrank Hurley/NY Daily News/Getty Images\nExiled from boxing for years for his stance on the Vietnam War, Muhammad Ali, here defeating Joe Frazier in 1974, personified an era of rebellion and change.\nEven now, making our twenty-first-century rounds, we\u0092re never far from the reach of the Fancy. Outside Grand Central Terminal on a raw spring morning, the UPS drivers are doing their moves: one guy, slight and older, crouching and bobbing his head, his breath making clouds in the chill air, throws hooking punches, left and right, which stop just short of the larger and younger man, who tucks in his elbows as if he were tapping his ancestors\u0092 instincts: protect the body, move your feet, position yourself to be ready when the chance comes. The scrap ends almost as soon as it began, the men laughing.\nPoliticians, pledging to \u0093fight\u0094 for a principle, sometimes hold up boxing gloves as a sign of commitment to cheering supporters. The gloves bring to mind a familiar image: a narrow, roped square; eager spectators surrounding the ring; and, in the fighters\u0092 corners, old, wrinkled seconds with Q-tips behind their ears, holding buckets. The scene frames an odd, brutal human activity that disappears from the public mind for long periods, then surfaces again when a fight or fighter reaches out to us, demanding a response.\nBut that happens rarely today; few Americans could name more than one or two current boxers, if that. Boxing has become a ghost sport, long since discredited but still hovering in the nation\u0092s consciousness, refusing to go away and be silent entirely. There was a time when things were very different. For boxing once stood at the center of American life, and its history winds a thread through the broader history of the nation.\nBoxing\u0092s beginnings in America go back to slave days, when plantation owners pitted slaves against one another and wagered on the outcomes. One freed slave, Tom Molineaux, even fought overseas against the British champion, Tom Cribb\u0097and probably would have won their 1810 match, had Cribb\u0092s desperate supporters not intervened just as Molineaux seized a decisive advantage. Boxing then was conducted with bare fists, under the old London Prize Ring Rules, which stipulated fights to the finish\u0097that is, until one man could not continue. The rules also permitted wrestling holds and other tactics, and rounds ended only with \u0093falls,\u0094 when one man went down, whether from a punch or a throw or sheer exhaustion. Before the Civil War, boxing enjoyed a brief vogue in New York, where fighters often associated with the Tammany Hall machine rose to prominence. But the war interrupted the sport\u0092s momentum.\nOnly with the emergence of its first great figure, John L. Sullivan, did boxing truly arrive in America. Born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1858, the son of an immigrant hod carrier from Ireland, Sullivan fought his way to wealth and fame rivaled by few in his time. With his physical prowess and hot-blooded public persona, Sullivan became an Irish-American hero and a symbol of manly vigor to a nation that, experiencing an industrial revolution and transformative changes in living standards and manner of work, worried that its young men might go soft. After he won the heavyweight championship (or at least what Americans generally viewed as the championship) in 1882, he went on a barnstorming national tour, offering $1,000 to anyone who could last four rounds with him in makeshift rings set up in theaters, ballrooms, and saloons. Reportedly, only one man won the money. It\u0092s from Sullivan that we get the boast, still heard today: \u0093I can lick any sonofabitch in the house.\u0094\nSullivan created an archetype that remains in force in 2011: the athlete as cultural icon and all-around moneymaking machine. In Sullivan\u0092s time, that dual role generally meant performing on stage, as he did in Honest Hearts and Willing Hands, a melodrama that toured the country. \u0093Shake the hand that shook the hand of the great John L.!,\u0094 exulted the lucky few who got to meet him. Poet Vachel Lindsay memorialized Sullivan\u0092s most impressive victory, in an 1889 marathon battle with Jake Kilrain\u0097the last bare-knuckle championship, waged in wilting heat and lasting over two hours.\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, boxing remained broadly illegal. To avoid legal scrutiny, Sullivan and Kilrain fought on a lumberman\u0092s estate just south of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, a rural location revealed only to partisans of the sport known as the Fancy. But before Sullivan\u0092s career ended, boxing had moved into the cities, where the gyms, matchmakers, managers, trainers, and promoters were, as well as athletic clubs and arenas for holding the fights. In New York, for instance, while the sport\u0092s legal status was contested for decades, fights nonetheless took place, often as \u0093exhibitions\u0094 or sparring demonstrations.\nOver time, eastern opponents of the sport pushed its locus to cities in the south and west. In 1890, New Orleans legalized boxing under the Marquis of Queensbury Rules, which mandated the use of gloves and three-minute rounds, a ten-count for a fallen fighter, and increased oversight powers for the referee. And it was under those rules, still in effect today, that Sullivan fought in 1892 at the city\u0092s Olympic Club\u0097illuminated by newfangled electric lights\u0097and lost his title to the young, slick James J. Corbett, who would eventually win international recognition as heavyweight champion.\nBoxing\u0092s center of gravity, especially in America, quickly became the heavyweight division, whose champion was seen by the public as a symbol of American masculinity. It mattered to Americans who claimed that distinction, as proved all too clear in 1908, when Jack Johnson, a black man, won the title. Johnson aroused opposition even before the championship fight was over. As he pummeled reigning champ Tommy Burns, police stormed the ring to stop the fight, and film cameras were shut off to spare the world the sight of a black knocking out a white for the crown. Jack London, writing at ringside, immediately issued a call for retired champion James J. Jeffries to return to the ring, \u0093wipe the grin off Johnson\u0092s face,\u0094 and reclaim whites\u0092 pride. Thus was the nation set on a crusade to find a White Hope to defeat Johnson. But he was too good. Inflaming passions further, Johnson made a point of enjoying himself inside the ring, where he often openly mocked his opponents, as well as outside it, where he drove sports cars, wore expensive clothes, frequented nightclubs, and (worst of all for white America) kept intimate company with white women. When Johnson easily defeated the once-great Jeffries in Reno on Independence Day 1910, cities across the nation erupted in race riots. Fearing future unrest, Congress banned the interstate transport of fight films, a law that remained in force for more than a quarter-century.\nJohnson\u0092s brazenness put him in the crosshairs of the U.S. government. In traveling with one of his white consorts, officials charged, Johnson had violated the recently passed Mann Act, which outlawed transporting women \u0093for the purpose of prostitution, debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u0094 The charges were dubious; the law was intended to thwart human trafficking, and though Johnson\u0092s lovers were often prostitutes, the relationships were consensual. Still, Johnson took no chances, jumping bail and living out the rest of his championship reign in foreign exile. In 1915, in Havana, he lost the title to Jess Willard, a giant White Hope recruited expressly for the purpose of beating him. A generation would pass before another black fighter was permitted to challenge for the heavyweight crown.\nDuring Johnson\u0092s long reign, and for a time after it, boxing\u0092s future was uncertain. New York City continued to vacillate, most states still banned the sport, and it lacked a central, unifying figure. That all changed with two seismic forces: American entry into World War I and Jack Dempsey. The American Expeditionary Forces boxed extensively for recreation and training in their barracks in France, and General John Pershing praised the sport\u0092s benefits for young men. Knowing that the doughboys had just faced the kaiser\u0092s guns, Americans found it hard to object to their right to box back home for pay. The summer after the war ended, Dempsey burst onto the national scene, winning the heavyweight title from Willard on a scorching July 4 in Toledo, Ohio.\nDempsey\u0092s arrival closed the circle of eras old and new. His parents had come west, to Manassa, Colorado, in a covered wagon in the 1880s; he\u0092d worked in mining camps in states barely past their frontier days; and his title-winning fight was policed by the aging Old West lawmen Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp, who collected firearms and knives from spectators before they entered the arena. But Dempsey would inaugurate America\u0092s modern age of sports and become a focal point of its dawning celebrity culture. He fought with a ferocity that boxing had never seen\u0097demolishing much larger opponents in just minutes, earning himself nicknames like \u0093the Giant Killer\u0094 and \u0093the Manassa Mauler,\u0094 and igniting a frenzy of popular interest. In 1921, Dempsey\u0092s match against a French war hero, Georges Carpentier, drew more than 80,000 fans into a wobbly, custom-built wooden bowl in Jersey City. They paid $1.7 million in gate receipts\u0097boxing\u0092s first million-dollar gate\u0097and the event captured global headlines. The Radio Corporation of America made its debut that day, transmitting the fight over primitive \u0093radiophone\u0094 technology\u0097radio\u0092s first mass broadcast in the United States.\nSuch unheard-of crowds and profits ended boxing\u0092s shadow existence and ushered in its golden era, which would last through the 1950s. Within a year of Dempsey\u0092s winning the title, New York State legalized boxing for good, and during the twenties, laws against the sport were overturned in state after state. New York quickly became the capital of boxing, with Madison Square Garden its most celebrated venue and Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds hosting huge outdoor crowds for summer matches. Dempsey is often mentioned today as a footnote to his Roaring Twenties sports peers Babe Ruth and Bill Tilden, but he rose to fame before they did and made so much more money\u0097his richest single-fight purse nearly equaled Ruth\u0092s career earnings\u0097that it seems unfair to equate him with anyone. He grew so wealthy that he took three years off from the ring to try his hand at films and the stage. In 1926, his bout with Gene Tunney in Philadelphia drew a record 120,000 fans, who watched in a driving rain as Tunney won the title. The New York Times announced the shocking result in a three-tier, seven-column, front-page headline the next day. The following year, the two men drew more than 100,000 to Chicago\u0092s Soldier Field for the rematch, which Tunney also won, and set a gate-receipts record that stood for half a century.\nDempsey and Tunney retired in the late twenties, and soon afterward, the stock-market crash portended harder times after a decade of spectacle and excess. Mediocrity characterized the heavyweight division during the early 1930s, but boxers in the lower weight classes kept the sport going. The thirties also saw the peak of boxing\u0092s ethnic rivalries: Jewish boxers like Barney Ross, Irishmen like Jimmy McLarnin, and Italians like Tony Canzoneri combined thick immigrant cultural ties with mainstream appeal, illustrating the centrality of boxing in American life.\nWith the advent of Joe Louis, who first gained national prominence in 1935 and became heavyweight champion two years later, the heavyweight division returned to center stage. Louis was the first black man since Johnson to get a shot at the title, after a steep climb out of poverty and the social deprivation that American blacks once endured as a matter of course. A grandson of slaves, he was born in Alabama but moved north with his family, settling in Detroit\u0092s Black Bottom ghetto\u0097so named not for its population but for its dark soil\u0097where he began boxing when still a boy. Unlettered and wary in the public eye, Louis fought in a deliberate, methodical style, always in position to punch and to defend, unhurried but moving toward what came to seem inevitable: another knockout win.\nLouis faced adversity of the kind that today\u0092s black athletes can only imagine. Remembering how Johnson had alienated whites, Louis\u0092s management team installed a set of rules for his conduct. These included a ban on being photographed with white women and a public posture of stoicism and clean living. A generation later, more militant blacks, like Muhammad Ali, would suggest that Louis had been too accommodating of white sensibilities, but their criticism betrayed a lack of understanding of the social context. Blacks were still getting lynched in the South; Louis seemed to understand his opportunity, and he didn\u0092t waste it.\nAt Yankee Stadium in June 1938, Louis met Germany\u0092s Max Schmeling in what remains the most politically charged sports event ever held. Schmeling had become a favorite of the Nazis\u0097not as eagerly as his critics insisted, not as reluctantly as his apologists would later claim\u0097and they often cited his earlier victory over Louis as proof of Aryan supremacy. Here was one of history\u0092s surprises: most of pre\u0096civil rights white America rooting for a black man against a white boxer. Louis, though black, now became America\u0092s representative, as confirmed by a White House visit with Franklin Roosevelt, who told him that the nation was relying on him. Almost half of America\u0092s population\u009760 million people\u0097tuned in to the radio broadcast. What they heard NBC announcer Clem McCarthy describe was probably the supreme example of an athlete executing under pressure. And \u0093execute\u0094 is the right word: Louis finished Schmeling off in barely two minutes.\nAfter the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Louis defended his title twice more, donating his purses to the Army and Navy Relief Funds, before entering the Army himself in 1942. The tribute paid him by sportswriter Jimmy Cannon\u0097\u0093A credit to his race, the human race\u0094\u0097sounds condescending now, but it reflected the impact that Louis had on white perceptions. When Louis finally retired from boxing in 1949, he had held the title for nearly 12 years, the longest run in boxing history.\nLouis\u0092s departure came at a time when boxing probably had its strongest hold on American sporting interest. In television\u0092s early years during the fifties, prime time featured fights nearly every night of the week, the most dependable fare for two major sponsors, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Gillette. Fans saw a worthy successor to Louis in Rocky Marciano, an Italian-American from Massachusetts, who would become the only heavyweight champion to retire without a defeat. In the lower weights, the unparalleled Sugar Ray Robinson\u0097who lost only once in his first 132 fights\u0097would win, lose, and win again the middleweight title in a series of dramatic bouts. He also made himself into a Harlem institution with his pink Cadillac; his nightclub, Sugar Ray\u0092s; and his traveling entourage, which included a masseuse, a barber, a voice coach, a golf instructor, and a dwarf mascot, among other essential personnel.\nBy the time Marciano and Robinson departed the scene, the sport\u0092s ethnic makeup had altered dramatically from the days of Dempsey and Louis. More than any other sport, boxing had always drawn its ranks from the poor, and as postwar prosperity expanded the middle class, the stock of Irish and Italian fighters began thinning out, while the Jewish fighters were all but gone. Hispanic fighters, like Cuba\u0092s Kid Gavilan, became a presence in the U.S., while blacks took the lead. It was all part of the nation\u0092s changing social landscape.\nBut nothing could have prepared America for the sixties\u0097or for Muhammad Ali, as divisive a figure as that traumatic decade produced. Even before he became politically vocal, Ali, originally named Cassius Clay, carried on like no American athlete before him, declaring that he was \u0093the Greatest\u0094 boxer of all time and reciting doggerel poetry predicting the outcomes of his bouts. Unlike most great heavyweights, he won not with heavy punching power but with the speed of his hands and the balletic grace of his feet. So artful and quick was he that he never bothered to learn the rudiments of defense, instead keeping his hands low and often leaning away from an opponent\u0092s punches instead of blocking them. \u0093His hands can\u0092t hit what his eyes can\u0092t see,\u0094 he said. Though purists dismissed his performances inside the ring and out, there was a refreshing exuberance to the young boxer. Absurdly handsome for a fighter, he was a sporting herald of the emerging youth culture; he won the heavyweight title in February 1964, the same month that the Beatles landed in America.\nBut that year, he announced his membership in the Black Muslim movement and changed his name, and in 1967, he refused induction into the U.S. armed forces for service in Vietnam. Ali became a pariah, loathed by many white fans and most established sportswriters. Claiming conscientious-objector status, he saw his boxing license revoked across the country, and for three and a half years found himself banned from the ring and facing numerous legal battles. Only in the 1970s, by which time he\u0092d been reinstated to fight, did he make inroads with more conservative fans. With the war over and the nation trying to come to terms with its shattering effects, Ali\u0092s trajectory now seemed less radical. Even his critics had to admit that he had paid a steep price, losing the prime years of his athletic career. On returning to the ring, he faced two defining adversaries\u0097Joe Frazier and George Foreman\u0097and the pure theater of his battles with them has never been surpassed. As Ali aged and slowed but kept fighting anyway, his fights became mesmerizing dramas of gamesmanship, skill, and, finally, sheer grit. In the ring, he made converts of everyone. He seemed to have more to fight for than his opponents did, not only because his surpassing ego made him willing to endure anything to win, but also because, in casting himself as a racial prophet and champion of the world\u0092s downtrodden, he made it so that he must not lose.\nAli discredited forever the idea of the quiescent athlete, and he was the first truly global sports star. His unmatched gifts as a showman have influenced athletes in all sports, though mostly not for the better: the athletes who mug before the camera, celebrate themselves at every turn, and denigrate opponents are part of Ali\u0092s legacy. In a popular culture addicted to display, those who prefer to keep their thoughts to themselves are now suspect for lacking authenticity. Still, in his sport\u0092s history, Ali is a colossus without successors: he fought like no one before or since.\nIn his usual grandiose way, Ali predicted that boxing would die after he was gone, but for a decade after he left the scene, the sport enjoyed its last great run. The public\u0092s interest turned once again to fighters at the lower weights. This shift was sparked by a gifted boxer from Maryland, Ray Charles Leonard, whose parents named him after the singer but whose boxing tutors cheekily gave him Sugar Ray Robinson\u0092s famous nickname. Articulate, usually gracious, and not given to shouting, he was Ali without the politics or the sometimes cruel theatrics. But like Ali, he would prove himself against the highest level of competition. In the 1980s, Sugar Ray Leonard and his formidable adversaries\u0097Roberto Dur\u00e1n, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler\u0097fought one another in a series of high-profile bouts that made them all multimillionaires. And Leonard would prove more successful than Ali at retaining his earnings and his faculties.\nJust as Leonard and the lower-weight heroes of the eighties were finishing their careers, Mike Tyson emerged as the next great heavyweight, and boxing again had a focal point in its marquee division. Tyson\u0092s worldwide fame would approach Ali\u0092s. A violent youth from Brooklyn\u0092s Brownsville neighborhood, Tyson was legally adopted by the enigmatic trainer and boxing psychologist Cus D\u0092Amato, who saw a future heavyweight champ in the hulking 13-year-old and made him his personal project. D\u0092Amato\u0092s judgment proved correct in 1986, as Tyson, just 20, became the youngest man to win a heavyweight title.\nWhat made Tyson fearsome in the ring was not just his terrifying punching power but his speed. No heavyweight combined the two assets so formidably. In the early years of Tyson\u0092s reign, most opponents were, in effect, beaten before the opening bell, so intimidating was his aura. His Dempsey-like style of early-round knockouts made his name box-office gold. Tyson also won the goodwill of the American public, thanks to an earnest personality\u0097including an inimitable high-pitched voice\u0097and an expertly managed public-relations image. Sportswriters called him Kid Dynamite.\nBut it turned out that the soft-spoken kid with the killer punch had demons that had never been conquered. As his fame and wealth grew, Kid Dynamite gave way to Tabloid Mike. His doomed marriage with a young actress, Robin Givens, made fodder for headlines and ended amid lurid tales of domestic violence. As his personal life spiraled out of control, Tyson lost his focus in the ring. He lacked Ali\u0092s force of will and ability to improvise, and he lost his title at 23. Not long afterward, he was convicted of rape and served three years in prison.\nOn his release, promoters eagerly paid Tyson millions to box again, but Kid Dynamite couldn\u0092t regain his youthful form. Embracing the role of villain, he became one of the more grotesque figures in America\u0092s always bizarre popular culture, uttering statements like \u0093I want to kill people. I want to rip their stomachs out and eat their children.\u0094 Nothing captured Tyson\u0092s depravity more memorably than his 1997 fight with Evander Holyfield, in which he bit off pieces of his opponent\u0092s ears, earning a disqualification and provoking a wild postfight melee.\nTyson\u0092s behavior sullied boxing\u0092s always precarious reputation, making the sport synonymous with freakishness. He would be the last in a long line of heavyweights to bear a symbolic connection to American social trends. For just as the blustery John L. Sullivan represented a growing nation coming into its strength, and the magnetic Dempsey the birth of mass-media celebrity and commercial culture, and the stoic Louis the hard years of depression and war, and the mercurial Ali the age of rebellion and change, so Tyson embodied the postmodern hoodlum\u0097the gangsta from an urban landscape pulverized by fatherlessness and anomie. Remarkably, a middle-aged Tyson is now trying to remake his life, a feat that, given the obstacles, would outstrip anything that his illustrious predecessors achieved, in the ring or out.\nWith Tyson\u0092s fall, boxing completed its transformation from central preoccupation to sideshow. For years, the sport had failed to meet the competitive challenge posed by other sports in the television age. Even as the tube brought fights into millions of homes, it hurt attendance at live events. Looking elsewhere for revenue, promoters began to stage most big fights at gambling casinos, a lucrative prospect for those in the money but one that separated the sport from a reliable fan base in major cities.\nYet the fact that TV proved a huge boon for most other sports suggests that we must look elsewhere for the true causes of boxing\u0092s decline\u0097above all, to changing tastes. In the long postwar boom, prosperity and higher living standards created different expectations for leisure and entertainment, as well as more refined attitudes. Boxing\u0092s endemic corruption and scandal wore away its popular appeal and made the sport seem increasingly atavistic. Crooked managers and promoters; rankings of fighters doctored by fraudulent boxing organizations; allegations of fixed fights and bribed referees and judges; foul play in the ring, from illegal substances to doctored gloves; and fighters killed or maimed who shouldn\u0092t have been fighting in the first place\u0097these were among the reasons that the American public stopped taking the sport seriously.\nWorst of all, though, were the sport\u0092s effects on the human body. Boxing\u0092s fatality rate is lower than that of horse racing and of some other sports, but its real scourge is not death but debility\u0097particularly, brain damage. Today, the specter of brain trauma hovers over professional, college, and even high school football, posing a potential threat to that sport\u0092s future. But awareness of boxing\u0092s dangers long predates modern research. The image of the punch-drunk, shuffling old fighter goes back to the sport\u0092s early days; researchers conducted studies of trauma in ex-fighters as early as the 1920s.\nWhen the subject of boxing and brain trauma comes up today, the first image in everyone\u0092s mind is that of Muhammad Ali, now 69. Afflicted with Parkinson\u0092s disease, he moves hesitantly, is generally unintelligible, and shakes convulsively across his upper body; his moon-shaped face exhibits the masklike blankness so common to Parkinson\u0092s\u0097and Alzheimer\u0092s\u0097sufferers. Ali\u0092s great ring model, Sugar Ray Robinson, who died in 1989, was afflicted with Alzheimer\u0092s disease in his final years. Like Ali, Robinson fought long beyond the point at which he could protect himself. Boxing\u0092s two most gifted and stylish performers, in their prime the antithesis of the brute fighter, ended up indistinguishable from the broken-down old pugs they were sure they\u0092d never become.\nIn 1984, the American Medical Association, after years of study, called for a ban on boxing, citing the sport\u0092s object of causing physical harm and the damage its participants clearly suffered to their mental faculties. Since then, other studies have continued to link boxing to severe brain trauma. But the AMA hasn\u0092t been able to build enough momentum to ban boxing\u0097ironically, because not enough people in the U.S. care one way or the other. Revulsion has passed into indifference.\nEven as its popularity has ebbed, boxing flickers in the American consciousness. One surprising area in which the sport has made small inroads into American habits is the growth of \u0093white-collar boxing,\u0094 in which men and women show up after their day jobs to spar or fight real bouts in a gym. Many health clubs now offer boxing-related fitness programs, as few activities can compete with boxing\u0092s aerobic benefits. Boxing continues to fascinate great writers, as it always has\u0097only baseball has a comparable literary pedigree. And the ring\u0092s elemental sense of conflict has proved endlessly adaptable for filmmakers. The prominence of some recent boxing films, like Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man, and The Fighter, is impressive, considering that the many fine boxing films of the past\u0097from Body and Soul, Champion, and The Set-Up to The Harder They Fall, Fat City, and Raging Bull\u0097could count on broader public enthusiasm for the sport.\nAnd just when one is tempted to turn forever from this sport of too much scandal and sorrow, someone emerges. In the past, boxing has endured other down periods before a galvanizing figure\u0097Dempsey, Louis, Ali, Leonard\u0097rescued it. If it is happening again, it\u0092s thanks to the 32-year-old Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao. He has won titles, or parts of titles, in eight weight divisions, which no one has ever done before. Some have dared say that he is among the greatest fighters in history.\nWhat matters about Pacquiao is not just his record but who he is: a national hero in the Philippines and boxing\u0092s most compelling star in many years. \u0093Manny is our people\u0092s idol and this generation\u0092s shining light,\u0094 says former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. \u0093He is our David against Goliath, our hero and the bearer of the Filipino dream. . . . You can feel the excitement throughout the country every time he is in the ring.\u0094 Such devotion recalls the way fighters of the past were regarded by immigrant communities. Pacquiao seems to relish the burden he carries. Like some former champions, he harbors an epic concept of himself. Being a champion is not enough: he is an elected congressman from the Philippines\u0092 Sarangani province, a job that, by all accounts, he takes seriously. He seems heartfelt in his desire to address the poverty of his native land and to stamp out sex trafficking, among other abuses. He also fancies himself a singer; after several of his recent fights, he has even given concerts.\nPacquiao is the kind of figure who could restore boxing to its former glory, if such a thing were possible. Boxing devotees yearn for him to participate in a \u0093super fight\u0094 like those in which Sugar Ray Leonard fought in the 1980s. The opponent for such a battle is standing in plain sight: Floyd Mayweather, Jr., a brilliant defensive boxer who has never lost. But so far, no deal has been reached to get the two men to fight, and age is encroaching on both. Negotiations have broken down for various reasons, including Mayweather\u0092s insistence that Pacquiao submit to drug testing shortly before the fight; some claim that Mayweather wants to avoid the contest altogether.\nIf the fight does happen, it would be the biggest boxing match in a generation. And though few believe it would work out this way, nothing would be more fitting than for such a battle to occur during a New York summer or early autumn, at Yankee Stadium, near the same spot where Dempsey, Louis, and Ali fought. At long last, America\u0092s ghost sport would have reassembled the throngs\u0097if only for a night.\nPaul Beston is an associate editor of City Journal.\n"}, {"score": 326.00052, "uuid": "be6461be-91f9-59b0-9dea-c6bf0218c9f4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0605wb-93-10168", "target_hostname": "www.thesweetscience.com", "target_uri": "http://www.thesweetscience.com/news/articles/12557-george-foreman-predicts-hopkins-will-end-drough-ko-pascal", "page_rank": 1.1808183e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "George Foreman Predicts Hopkins Will End Drought, KO Pascal", "snippet": "<em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> <em>was</em> always, <em>\u00e2</em>\u0080\u0098Keep punching.

Thankfully, I acquired him in my biggest money league coming off his bye week after his production tailed off in the three previous weeks following an incredible start. I attributed the three \u0093down\u0094 weeks to New England trying to establish the run and bleed the clock to help cover for its defense, which meant Gronk would be asked to stay in and block on a regular basis. Needless to say after weeks of living with the meager production of Lance Kendricks (Week 1) and Dustin Keller (Weeks 2-7), I cannot tell you how much joy I feel seeing Tom Brady target him as often as he has over the past two weeks. Against the Giants, Brady was so intent on feeding him the ball on the Pats\u0092 final scoring drive that he targeted Gronkowski on three straight downs, including the fourth-down catch that gave New England a short-lived lead. Gronk\u0092s 15 targets in Week 9 were the most by any TE this season. Because he is such a great all-around TE, there\u0092s no guarantee that Gronk won\u0092t have a down game or two when the Pats decide to focus on the run. But in terms of the scoring upside of TEs going forward, he is easily in the top five and may be Jimmy Graham \u0092s only true threat for the highest-scoring player at the position this year.\nJake Ballard is still a little ways away from appearing on this list, but it is getting harder and harder to ignore his level of production. Over the last five weeks, Ballard is the fifth-most productive TE in fantasy (PPR), outscoring the likes of Jason Witten , Aaron Hernandez and Tony Gonzalez . Of the 27 TEs who currently average more targets/game, only Heath Miller \u0092s 76% surpasses Ballard\u0092s 74% catch rate. Surprisingly, Fred Davis has overcome a great deal of change around him and is converting 70% of his targets, which speaks volumes about his upside in 2012 and beyond.\nBetween Weeks 6 and 7 last season, a thumb injury for Dallas Clark \u0096 which ended up being a season-ender \u0096 displayed the true power of Peyton Manning to make just about any player in his offense a household name in fantasy circles. It\u0092s not that Jacob Tamme lacks for talent as a receiver, it just seemed unlikely at the time that any player \u0096 much less Clark\u0092s little-used backup \u0096 could fill in so effectively for him and become a fantasy force in his own right. Just over one year later, here we are again; Clark may miss significant time with a leg injury. This year, however, it\u0092s hard to say that Tamme is even worth a pickup. Clark has been exposed as a blocker this season and Tamme proved last year he is a liability in that phase of the game, so one could easily deduce that last year\u0092s waiver-wire wonder will not see the field much outside of passing downs (even if he is technically the starter). Clark was already a borderline TE2 as a full-time player, so expecting his replacement to do more than that with less playing time and Curtis Painter throwing the ball is asking for too much.\nFinally, it would be careless of me not to mention the absence of one very prominent TE from the list above, Vernon Davis . A top-two PPR tight end (total fantasy points) in 2009 and 2010, Davis has carried significant fantasy risk for his entire NFL career since he has been linked to Alex Smith. In previous seasons, San Francisco needed to pass the ball more often in order to compensate for a less-than-stellar defense. This season, with the defense performing at a near-elite level, the passing game has taken a back seat and so has Smith\u0092s reliance on Davis. Michael Crabtree 7.3 targets/game dwarfs Davis\u0092 4.8, so even though the athletic TE is converting an incredible 82% of his targets, it is nearly impossible to expect him to be a fantasy force with so little opportunity. Davis\u0092 one truly solid fantasy performance this season was against Cincinnati\u0092s top-notch defense, so he may actually be an anti-matchup play for the remainder of the season. In other words, Davis may be at his best in fantasy when the matchup suggests the Niners will struggle to run the ball. If this is a correct assessment, Davis could be useful in Week 12 at Baltimore, Week 15 vs. Pittsburgh and Week 16 at Seattle.\nBefore I wrap up this portion of the Blitz, I feel somewhat obligated to pay my respects to the passing of \u201cSmokin\u201d Joe Frazier. For a number of younger readers of this column, I am old enough to remember when boxing was not only considered a major sport, but also seemed to produce a legendary matchup on a regular basis with multiple all-time greats competing in the same weight class at the same time. While Frazier\u2019s prime predates my birth, ask anyone who had a TV set or interest in sports in the early-to-mid 70s about \u201cThe Fight of the Century\u201d or the \u201cThrilla in Manila\u201d and see how quickly their eyes light up and the passion with which they speak about those matches against Muhammad Ali.\nHowever, the appeal of these fights (especially the first one) wasn\u2019t just about the quality of the boxers, it was cultural as well. Whether Ali or Frazier asked for it or not, each fighter served as a symbol for a country divided by the Vietnam War. Ali represented those who denounced the war because he famously declined to serve (and was incarcerated because of it) while Frazier had the support of the pro-war movement, even though Smokin\u2019 Joe didn\u2019t actually fight in the war because he was a father. Regardless, this is just one of many examples of what can happen when legendary talent does battle on a stage where the fight itself almost means as much \u2013 if not more \u2013 than the final result. Some 40 years after their first fight, many still regard Frazier vs. Ali as one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports.\nNext Week\u2019s Waiver Wire Stars\nEach week, I\u2019ll select one player at QB, RB, WR and TE that is available in at least three of my five leagues and make a case as to why they could be important to you the following week or at some point in the very near future. For those of you who have been loyal readers for some time, you already know I am not concerned with making safe picks; selective and smart aggressiveness is often the name of the game in fantasy.\nI cannot emphasize enough these players are not necessarily recommended additions to your fantasy team \u2013 I will make sure to make that obvious if that is the case \u2013 but have a chance, however small, to make an impact as a potentially valuable reserve down the line.\nQB: Colt McCoy , Cleveland. I make this recommendation with a great deal of hesitation, so only the most desperate of owners should even consider him. But with several of the QBs I would like to feature this week already having served as previous selections, I am almost forced to go with McCoy. Here\u2019s the good: McCoy has no immediate threat at his position and faces the Rams\u2019 highly questionable secondary this week. His 308 attempts register as the fifth-highest total in the league and third among those QBs who have already served their bye week. With Chris Ogbannaya struggling mightily as a runner, the temptation will be to throw the ball even more, so it\u2019s not unthinkable that McCoy could have his first 300-yard passing game since Week 4 or first two-TD game since Week 6 this week. Now, the bad news: after this week, the Browns face the Jags, Bengals, Ravens and Steelers, which means McCoy will have virtually no value again until Week 15 vs. Arizona.\nPrevious recommendations: Matt Cassel, Week 3; Vince Young, Week 4; Tim Tebow, Week 5; John Beck, Week 6; Christian Ponder, Week 7\nRB: Tashard Choice , Washington. I mentioned Choice in last week\u2019s blog , but I feel somewhat compelled to discuss him here as well. And let\u2019s be clear about something before I go any further: Roy Helu is the most talented back remaining on the Redskins\u2019 roster and should have been the starter from the minute Tim Hightower was injured. My support of Choice at this point does not have a great deal to do with the ability he may or may not still have, but more to do with the lack of trust I think HC Mike Shanahan has in Helu. My main questions: why has it taken this long for Shanny to hand the rookie significant carries? And if he does trust his current stable of healthy RBs, why have they combined for just 19 carries in the last two games? If there is anything Shanahan loves to do more than upset fantasy owners, it is running the football. In short, something doesn\u2019t add up here and I believe it has to do with a lack of trust in Helu and Ryan Torain. I acknowledge trying to read Shanahan\u2019s mind is an exercise in futility, but with Choice practicing fully this week and a game against the Cowboys in Week 11, I sense another changing of the guard. Washington\u2019s upcoming schedule isn\u2019t particularly RB-friendly, but a motivated Choice could easily work his way into the backfield mix this week and be in line for 10-15 carries as early as next week.\nNote: Please feel free to check out my aforementioned blog entry for other RBs to consider.\nPrevious recommendations: Alfonso Smith, Week 3; Keiland Williams Week 4; Jackie Battle/Jazquizz Rodgers, Week 5; Joe McKnight, Week 6; Phillip Tanner, Week 7\nWR: Josh Cribbs , Cleveland. Much like McCoy above, this is pretty much a one-week recommendation. Cribbs\u2019 two-game scoring streak has definitely helped his overall fantasy numbers, but his production against Houston and San Francisco has caught my eye, even if it a good part of it came during garbage time. Again, like McCoy, Cribbs should only be considered in the deepest of leagues this week, but he\u2019s seen five or more targets in five of his last six games and figures to remain a big part of the weekly gameplan for as long as Ogbannaya struggles to run the football. At some point, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see the Browns use him more as a runner since he has proven to be adept in that aspect of the game, although it would likely take injuries to Ogbannaya and Thomas Clayton for that to happen. Even without any future rushing yards, Cribbs\u2019 ability in the open field is undeniable, so he warrants a look, especially this week as McCoy attempts 35-40 more passes vs. the Rams.\nPrevious recommendations: Michael Jenkins/Dane Sanzenbacher, Week 3; Mark Clayton, Week 4, Naaman Roosevelt, Week 5; Arrelious Benn, Week 6; Roy Williams, Week 7\nTE: Dennis Pitta , Baltimore. If you would have asked me this summer which Ravens\u2019 TE was going to step up to fill the void left behind by Todd Heap, I would have said Pitta. Ed Dickson is easily the flashier and more athletic player of the two, but QBs often favor the more consistent route-runner, which is what I believe Pitta is. Whether or not Dickson became more of a priority for OC Cam Cameron after his huge Week 1 performance, the two have essentially been the same fantasy TE since. And over the last two weeks, Pitta has actually outscored Dickson and posted low-end TE1 totals in PPR leagues. The fact he has seen eight targets in each of those games is even more encouraging. Without a doubt, the upside here is small, but sometimes, fantasy owners only need a player they know will keep them competitive at a position. This week\u2019s opponent (Seattle) isn\u2019t exactly the kind of TE-friendly matchup fantasy owners target, but upcoming matchups against Cincinnati, San Francisco and Cleveland are worth considering.\nPrevious recommendations: Ben Watson, Week 3; Jake Ballard, Week 4; Joel Dreessen, Week 5; Lance Kendricks, Week 6; Visanthe Shiancoe/Jeremy Shockey, Week 7\nSuggestions, comments, musings about the article or fantasy football in general?

As a teenager he worked as a shipping hand, and at the age of 16, aboard a ship bound for India, he carved a wooden model of a handgun with a revolving chamber. The idea was suggested to him by the wheel of the ship, with its mechanism of spokes aligned by a clutch.\nAfter five years of development and refinement of his \"revolver\", he patented a working model in England and France, and the following year, on February 25, 1836, he received a U.S. patent. However, sales of the early revolvers were slow, and the company that was marketing them went bankrupt.\nColt's fortunes brightened in 1847 when the U.S. Army ordered 1,000 of the handguns for use in the Mexican War. From then on demand soared, and Colt set up the world's largest armory in his hometown of Hartford, Connecticut. Colt Firearms Company helped the South to build up its firearm supply prior to the Civil War, but once the war broke out, the company was fully devoted to supplying the Union Army. Samuel Colt died in 1862; his invention and company have since become American legends.\n1862: Legal Tender Act Passed\nThe U.S. Congress passes the Legal Tender Act, authorizing the use of paper notes to pay the government's bills. This ended the long-standing policy of using only gold or silver in transactions, and it allowed the government to finance the enormously costly war long after its gold and silver reserves were depleted.\nSoon after the war began, the federal government began to run low on specie. Several proposals involving the use of bonds were suggested. Finally, Congress began printing money, which the Confederate government had been doing since the beginning of the war. The Legal Tender Act allowed the government to print $150 million in paper money that was not backed by a similar amount of gold and silver. Many bankers and financial experts predicted doom for the economy, as they believed that there would be little confidence in the scheme. There were also misgivings in Congress, as many legislators worried about a complete collapse of the nation's financial infrastructure.\nThese notes, called \"greenbacks,\" worked much better than expected. It allowed the government to pay its bills and, by increasing the money in circulation, greased the wheels of northern commerce. The greenbacks were legal tender, which meant that creditors had to accept them at face value. The same year, Congress passed an income tax and steep excise taxes, both of which cooled the inflationary pressures created by the greenbacks.\nAnother legal tender act passed in 1863, and by war's end nearly a half-billion dollars in greenbacks had been issued. The Legal Tender Act laid the foundation for the creation of a permanent currency in the decades after the Civil War.\nOn February 25, 1964, 22-year-old Cassius Clay\nshocks the odds-makers by dethroning world heavyweight boxing champ Sonny Liston in a seventh-round technical knockout. The dreaded Liston, who had twice demolished former champ Floyd Patterson in one round, was an 8-to-1 favorite. However, Clay predicted victory, boasting that he would \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\" and knock out Liston in the eighth round. The fleet-footed and loquacious youngster needed less time to make good on his claim--Liston, complaining of an injured shoulder, failed to answer the seventh-round bell. A few moments later, a new heavyweight champion was proclaimed.\nCassius Marcellus Clay Jr. was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1942. He started boxing when he was 12 and by age 18 had amassed a record of over 100 wins in amateur competition. In 1959, he won the International Golden Gloves heavyweight title and in 1960 a gold medal in the light heavyweight category at the Summer Olympic Games in Rome. Clay turned professional after the Olympics and went undefeated in his first 19 bouts, earning him the right to challenge Sonny Liston, who had defeated Floyd Patterson in 1962 to win the heavyweight title.\nOn February 25, 1964, a crowd of 8,300 spectators gathered at the Convention Hall arena in Miami Beach to see if Cassius Clay, who was nicknamed the \"Louisville Lip,\" could put his money where his mouth was. The underdog proved no bragging fraud, and he danced and backpedaled away from Liston's powerful swings while delivering quick and punishing jabs to Liston's head. Liston hurt his shoulder in the first round, injuring some muscles as he swung for and missed his elusive target. By the time he decided to discontinue the bout between the sixth and seventh rounds, he and Clay were about equal in points. A few conjectured that Liston faked the injury and threw the fight, but there was no real evidence, such as a significant change in bidding odds just before the bout, to support this claim.\nTo celebrate winning the world heavyweight title, Clay went to a private party at a Miami hotel that was attended by his friend Malcolm X, an outspoken leader of the African American Muslim group known as the Nation of Islam. Two days later, a markedly more restrained Clay announced he was joining the Nation of Islam and defended the organization's concept of racial segregation while speaking of the importance of the Muslim religion in his life. Later that year, Clay, who was the descendant of a runaway Kentucky slave, rejected the name originally given to his family by a slave owner and took the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali.\nMuhammad Ali would go on to become one of the 20th century's greatest sporting figures, as much for his social and political influence as his prowess in his chosen sport. After successfully defending his title nine times, it was stripped from him in 1967 after he refused induction into the U.S. Army on the grounds that he was a Muslim minister and therefore a conscientious objector. That year, he was sentenced to five years in prison for violating the Selective Service Act but was allowed to remain free as he appealed the decision. His popularity plummeted, but many across the world applauded his bold stand against the Vietnam War.\nIn 1970, he was allowed to return to the boxing ring, and the next year the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Ali's draft evasion conviction. In 1974, he regained the heavyweight title in a match against George Foreman in Zaire and successfully defended it in a brutal 15-round contest against Joe Frazier in the Philippines in the following year. In 1978, he lost the title to Leon Spinks but later that year defeated Spinks in a rematch, making him the first boxer to win the heavyweight title three times. He retired in 1979 but returned to the ring twice in the early 1980s. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.\nIf you have other Birthdays or events to add for this day please E-Mail me.\nToday\n"}], [{"score": 309.38684, "uuid": "31b93075-ea34-5d16-ba63-3d4f2d3e65a8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0600tw-47-19129", "target_hostname": "www.rottentomatoes.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017776-rocky/", "page_rank": 1.3127213e-09, "spam_rank": 87, "title": "Rocky - Rotten Tomatoes", "snippet": "Since the film <em>was</em> to be made on <em>a</em> shoestring and marketed on <em>a</em> low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists <em>was</em> small.

Rather it\u2019s that journalistic skepticism and independence are too often discarded by quasi-fans who report from inside locker rooms. What makes Lipsyte\u2019s new memoir such a plum, especially to us scribes who have written for the odd sports section, is Lipsyte\u2019s ability to core his own profession with the same antagonistic bent that got him through an on-again, off-again career writing sports and features for The New York Times and sundry network television work. Whatever your bone about the quality of sports media, Lipsyte likely has the same gripe, in trump suit.\nWhile he chides himself for missing big stories during his career\u2014not uncovering a fifteen-year-old Tiger Woods was one\u2014he upbraids his colleagues for ignoring real news on their beats, for \u201cgodding up\u201d jocks, and for reacting with feigned moral outrage when someone outside the \u201cthe lodge brothers\u201d (Lipsyte\u2019s term for sports journos) punctures the culture with something so outrageous as outside perspective.\nOn the deafening silence following Woods\u2019s Cadillac-crashing marital meltdown: \u201cMost golf writers tended to be quiet at first, soaking in their shame, I\u2019d like to think. What a crew of house pets!\u201d\nOn the reaction from NASCAR writers once he left the beat and published a book: \u201cI sensed begrudgment. Did they think I had crossed to the other side, did they resent me as a scorpion who\u2019d gotten out of the barrel?\u201d\nOn the decay of the business as a whole: \u201cMass media conferences are tightly controlled now. One-on-one interviews are negotiated with agents and public relations advisers. Sportswriting has become another department of celebrity journalism. As it should be. I may feel nostalgic about interviewing Namath at the pool or Casey Stengel at the bar, but those memories seem like tribal legends.\u201d\nAnd then there\u2019s this hypodermic jab at the ghost of The Sweet Science author A.J. Liebling, which itself demonstrates Lipsyte\u2019s penchant for butter-smooth wording: \u201cIt would be some time before I began to figure out why so many of the boxing trainers and cornermen who seemed all but mute to me were masters of aphorism for him. Liebling was a superb writer.\u201d Note that he didn\u2019t say superb reporter. In Lipsyte\u2019s hands, elision, that staple of look-the-other-way celebrity coverage, can also be used to un-god a subject.\nUnlike most sportswriters, Lipsyte was never what you\u2019d call a fan. To him, sport was never an end to itself but instead a conduit for life at large. Muhammad Ali was beautiful, brash, casually racist, relentlessly libidinous\u2014and, yes, a boxer. Billie Jean King was \u201ca mind in motion, one of the smartest athletes I\u2019ve known.\u201d Lipsyte extols her effect on femininity in sport while barely mentioning the Battle of the Sexes, which he attended.\nApart from exceptions like those two and Joe DiMaggio, whose other-ness from the jock circus did appear to move Lipsyte, the admiration the author feels for his subject seems inversely proportional to a given athlete\u2019s fame. Mickey Mantle was pushy, brusque and vain. Bill Walton, at twenty-three, \u201cseemed kind of goofy and didn\u2019t have all that much interesting to say.\u201d He dotes on pioneers\u2014the high school football star who came out to his teammates with bravery and grace, the Onandaga chief who bridges cultures through lacrosse\u2014and on the occasional Gay Talese or Howard Cosell or DiMaggio, who, like Lipsyte, never quite embraced the sporting lives they came to inhabit.\nLipsyte is justifiably hard on the lodge brothers, sparing himself least. He calls an inner tantrum sparked by a lackluster Ali interview \u201cmy egoshit.\u201d He excoriates himself for not standing up to administrators who refused to offer his daughter\u2019s favorite sport, soccer, to the girls in her high school: \u201cIn retrospect, I feel ashamed. And stupid. What a chance to put into practice all that abstract reporting, that pose of liberated macho, make a fuss, challenge the school, create a soccer team. Be useful.\u201d If there\u2019s a thread of regret running through the book, it may be Lipsyte\u2019s cool regard for his own sporting oeuvre. He seems happiest when smuggling topics of heavier social import (gender discrimination, racial turmoil) past the metal detectors of the sports page.\nThere\u2019s a great case to be made, and he makes it, that sports journalism was a worm-eaten craft even before athletes\u2019 ballooning salaries goaded writers from boosterism to cynicism. If anything, Lipsyte may be too rough on sports pages, which are beloved by readers who otherwise might not so much as scan a newspaper. You can\u2019t fault him for holding sportswriters to the same standards as other journalists. But I would posit to him that the simplicity of sportswriting as a whole is in fact its appeal. I would also suggest to any self-aware reader that beyond a certain age\u2014fourteen seems about right\u2014you should be skimming game coverage and spending real time on sports coverage, like Lipsyte\u2019s, that attempts to engage your prefrontal lobe rather than your brain stem.\nLipsyte mentions the first several novels he has written for young adults, The Contender, released in 1967: \u201cThe times were right for the book \u0085 [T]here was a generation of librarians and teachers dedicated to getting realistic fiction into the hands of boys. That\u2019s been a mission of mine, too.\u201d The wry implication, in my reading, is that sportswriting is largely realistic fiction for boys (and girls). As snide as that could seem, it\u2019s not unfair. Sports\u2014not politics, business, policy or even the arts\u2014is that thing you can follow with a relatively high degree of sophistication before you understand much of anything about adults. Considering adults\u2019 record on those other matters, you may be the better for it.\nClick here for a complete Page Views archive.\n"}, {"score": 305.6477, "uuid": "9e83fe28-855d-57a0-a07b-0c8dc25e17b0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1913wb-48-31771", "target_hostname": "www.kenspelman.com", "target_uri": "http://www.kenspelman.com/York%20Booksellers/homepages/hedgerowsportboxing.html", "page_rank": 1.1951342e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Yorkbooksellers.co.uk - Hedgerow Books - Boxing", "snippet": "<em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>, The Champ Nobody Knew..

High school and middle school students design and build 15-pound robots that do battle with each other in a double-elimination tournament.\nJust like the \u201cThrilla in Manila,\u201d perhaps the greatest boxing match of the 20th century which pitted heavyweight boxers Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, it was a technical knockout that decided the winner as The Terminator, robot of The Underdogs of Conneaut Lake High School, was named champion.\nThe Terminator reached the finals bracket with no losses while Fabius had only one loss in the double-elimination tournament.\nThe two robots battered each other \u2014 grueling hits with sparks flying and Fabius besting The Terminator to force a tie as each now had one loss.\nHowever, each robot had inflicted serious damage upon the other during the match, causing both teams to scramble to make repairs in preparation for the final showdown.\nWhile both teams tore down their robots, replaced parts and got the robot back into the arena within the allotted time, Fabius wouldn\u2019t move when the match began, giving The Terminator the victory. A robot has to show movement within a 20-second time limit or it\u2019s considered a TKO.\n\u201cWe were happy to just win some matches we never expected first place,\u201d said Jeremy Dygert, a 10th-grader on The Underdogs of Conneaut Lake.\n\u201cWe\u2019re surprised we did so well, this is our first year,\u201d said Justin Sobieski, the team\u2019s driver and a fellow 10th-grader.\nRobobots, started in 2007 to create interest in technical education careers among high school students, apparently is doing just that.\nSobieski and Dyert are interested in engineering or technical careers as are many other students in the competition.\nAmber Festa, a senior at Cambridge Springs High School and a member of Team Fabius, plans to study mechanical engineering at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College next fall.\n\u201cI\u2019m leaning toward designing cars or amusement park rides,\u201d said Festa, who studies advanced placement physics in high school. \u201cWith Robobots, you see the way things are tied to the class. You learn the ways electric motors and gear sets work.\u201d\nThe win by Conneaut Lake High School brings the Robobots title back to Crawford County.\nIn 2011, Bloomsburg Area High School with its robot Pixie was champion of the local tournament and went on to win yet another national title last May.\nHowever, Bloomsburg\u2019s two robotics teams were eliminated in the early rounds of the tournament Saturday.\n\u201cI told the kids sometimes you\u2019ve got to fall before you rise,\u201d said Kirk Marshall, coach of the Bloomsburg teams.\n\u201cThe teams here really have escalated in talent and design,\u201d Marshall said of northwestern Pennsylvania. \u201cThey\u2019ve really stepped it up and this is now the hotbed (for robots) in Pennsylvania.\u201d\nKeith Gushard can be reached at 724-6370 or by email at kgushard@meadvilletribune.com.\nWhat is Robobots\nRobobots is a hands-on robot-building contest for high school and middle school students that is sponsored by the northwestern Pennsylvania chapter of the National Tooling and Machining Association. The program was started in 2007 to create interest in technical education careers among high school and middle school students.\nThis year, 32 teams from 17 schools in the region had robots battle each other Saturday at Meadville Area Senior High School in a double-elimination tournament.\nRobobots champions\n2008 Cambridge Springs High School\n2009 Venango Technology Center\n2010 Crawford County Career and Technical Center\n2011 Bloomsburg Area High School\n2012 Conneaut Lake Area High School\nFull tournament results and matches\nFor full tournament results go to allprosoftware.net/toolcity2012.\nArmstrong, the cable television provider for the Meadville, Cochranton, Conneaut Lake, Linesville and Saegertown areas, will show Saturday\u2019s tournament on cable channel 23 at 4 p.m. April 7.\n"}, {"score": 293.19437, "uuid": "2aec40fa-e566-5315-ae83-9894b30206ed", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0103wb-07-03464", "target_hostname": "www.boxingforum.com", "target_uri": "http://www.boxingforum.com/boxing-history/index3.html", "page_rank": 1.1821081e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Boxing History - Page 3 - Boxing Forum - Boxing Discussion Forums", "snippet": "Poll: If <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> had fought George Foreman in 1977, <em>who</em> would have won?

I love dogs and believe in treating them the way I would want to be treated. To fight and abuse dogs is wrong and I look forward to helping stop this cruel and illegal activity.\"\nWard joins a growing list of professional athletes who have teamed up with the 501(c)3 nonprofit organization For Pits' Sake, Inc. to stop cruelty and abuse. \"We are very excited to have Andre as part of our team,\" said Crawford. \"Andre's character, drive and determination to reach for his goals, both personally and professionally, make him a champion both in and out of the ring.\"\nThe Knock Out Dog Fighting program is an award-winning youth intervention program created to stop the cycle of violence. Team members work on the ground level teaching empathy for animals and help at-risk youth make better choices, develop self-respect and healthy lifestyles. This reduces the potential of involvement in dog fighting and other gang-related activities.\nKnock Out Dog Fighting partners with community based organizations, schools, community centers, juvenile detention facilities, law enforcement and gang prevention task forces to stop cruelty, abuse and to reduce violence in the community. \"We can't simply prosecute our way out of the problem,\" said Dolores Carr, Santa Clara County District Attorney . \"We recognize the importance of collaborative prevention and the need to have messages delivered to at-risk youth from people these kids look up to. The Knock Out Dog Fighting program plays an important part in those efforts.\"\nA recent study revealed that more and more kids are looking to professional athletes and celebrities as role models and they imitate everything they see. They try to copy the way their idol looks, including haircuts, tattoos and what they wear, to the way they act - even if that includes illegal behavior. Dog fighting has become increasingly more popular with 13 to 17 year old inner-city youth. They saw that role model Michael Vick was involved and think, \"If Vick did it, it's cool.\" The fact that Vick got caught and sent to prison is not a deterrent because he is back in the NFL making millions of dollars again. Plus, young people have a high discount rate for danger. Meaning they don't think they'll get caught so the level of punishment doesn't even enter into it.\nThat\u2019s why the Knock Out Dog Fighting program's proactive approach is so important.\u00a0 \u201cWe are out in the community, on the ground level, in schools, community centers and juvenile detention facilities with positive role models to teach children and young adults about discipline, respect and that it's not a sign of strength, power or greatness to fight, torture or abuse animals,\u201d said Crawford.\nWard takes his responsibility of being a role model very seriously. He knows that because he is a professional athlete there is a child somewhere watching what he says and what he does. Ward knows that he can impact lives. \"I plan to partner with the Knock Out Dog Fighting team, as well as use the platform I have been given, to bring awareness and knowledge to all who will listen about the cruelties of dog fighting. In addition, I want to educate people about dogs, how to treat them, love them, and care for them as well as the impact dog fighting has on both the animals and those who participate in dog fighting.\"\nWard has worked his way from the streets of the San Francisco Bay area to an unbeaten professional record. His crowning moment came at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece where he won the Gold medal in the light heavyweight boxing division. Ward is the only Gold medal winner for an American fighter in the last three Olympics. Self-assured and driven in his chosen profession, Ward is following in the footsteps of former Olympic Boxing Gold medallists Cassius Clay (Muhammad Ali) in 1960, Joe Frazier in 1964, George Foreman in 1968, Sugar Ray Leonard in 1976, and Oscar de la Hoya in 1992.\nWard is a religious man that doesn't trash talk other fighters, he lets his actions speak for him. Recently Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums praised Ward's \"unwavering desire and compassion for the prize fighting profession, as well as his strength as an ambassador to the sport, serving as a role model to millions of young men and women in Oakland and beyond,\" by declaring May 11, 2009 \" Andre Ward Day \" in the city of Oakland.\nAir Jordan, a division of Nike, Inc., was so impressed by Ward's limitless potential and tremendous work ethic, they made Ward only the second professional boxer signed to an endorsement deal. Ward joined professional boxer Roy Jones, Jr., and sports superstars Carmelo Anthony, Jason Kidd and Ray Allen (NBA); Derek Jeter and Andruw Jones (MLB); and Marvin Harrison, Randy Moss and Jason Taylor (NFL) honored by Jordan.... (see videos below)\nWard will be fighting WBA Champion Mikkel Kessler on November 21, 2009, for the WBA Super Middleweight World Championship in the Super Six World Boxing Classic which will be aired live on Showtime.

I like my athlete's great and arrogant about their greatness\u2014it makes their successes and failures more interesting to me.\nClearly, I'm not alone in this\u2014the appeal of Ali and Frazier has been rehashed quite a bit in the wake of Frazier's passing, and an oft repeated exchange stands out for me. I've read at least three different versions of this, but the gist is that during the first Ali-Frazier fight in 1971 , Ali was supposedly shouting at Frazier, over and over:\n\"Don't you know I'm God?\"\nAt least one version has Ali punctuating each swing of his fists with it, as if by repeating it, in combination with his incredible talent, he would make it true. Frazier, for his part, was unimpressed. There are conflicting versions of how the then champion responded (and hell, let's admit this all is at best 50-50 for ever happening), but in my favorite Frazier responds almost apologetically:\n\"Lord, you in the wrong place tonight.\"\nDevastating. Ali and Frazier was the collision of two athletes who carry the mentality I mentioned earlier\u2014Ali and Frazier were each so sure of their ability, so assured of victory, that the former was willing to assert that he was God\u2014all powerful, the creator\u2014and the other was willing to accept that but counter that he could, in fact, knock God down often enough to win the fight. And, of course, he did.\nBaseball hasn't recently lent itself to the kind of grandstanding that makes me gleeful\u2014Albert Belle hanging out of the dugout pointing at his bicep is one of my favorite sports moments of all time, and it's also a moment that clearly would seem out of place in this era, where an excess of power is the equivalent of a scarlet \"WINSTROL\" across your chest, where an explosive personality is an easy way to raise flags. Albert Pujols , clearly one of the very best players of the last decade, is nicknamed ' The Machine ', and there's a lot about baseball's last decade in that. A Machine is efficient, excellent, and maybe, if we're felling personify-ing, ruthless; a machine is not arrogant, communicative, or interested in asserting its excellence after the job has already been completed. I am totally uninterested in the athlete as machine. To see the expressive and cocksure Brewers lose to Tony LaRussa's Golden Machine and The Aww Shucks Squad was a disappointment.\nIn light of all this, it's not hard to discern that I often find the Indians disappointing. I'm inclined to imagine (and impose) the alchemy of greatness and ego that I want on the team. I see Chris Perez as an untouchable fire-eater when, actually, he might be a player worth flipping for an interesting guy at AA; I remember Fausto as the 2007 ALDS world beater when, actually, his nerves appear made of rock candy, not steel. At least this season brought Asdrubal and his occasional bat flip, and, of course, Carlos, who exudes exactly my sort of catnip.\nSmack in the middle of this, of course, is the player I wrote about on Halloween , Grady Sizemore . Grady was considered a generational talent from nearly the beginning, and he's one of only a few Indians of my lifetime who really approached the talent level that really sucks me (and most fans) into a persona. At his peak, Grady would occasionally give me what I was after, in the form of a disingenuous \"Who, me?\" smirk after smacking a baseball 420 feet or legging out a triple. Now, though, the potential that such a posture would be routine for him is long gone.\nThe Indians appear to be moving in the right direction, though, and some new swagger may soon be earned. Masterson is a gigantic talent and, with a well placed scream or two, he can worm his way deeper into my heart. Kipnis, Carlos, and Cabrera have a chance to throw blankets of fear over opponents, and Santana most clearly among them seems capable of physically embodying that threat with his walk, glare, and wildman's swing. Add to this the intriguing possibility that Yoenis Cespedes could be the Indians next center fielder , and you can start to see a team that's a lot of fun. Clearly, sustained greatness is probably not in the cards for the 2012 Cleveland Indians , but it's my hope that we can at least see moments of true greatness, and when those moments come I hope they're punctuated by sideways grins, helmet tosses, and derisive barks\u2014whatever it takes to let opponents know that these moments are not isolated incidents but, instead, the advanced scouts for a forthcoming army of pain.\n"}], [{"score": 276.84076, "uuid": "7a4751a9-cadc-518d-b532-51942bab95dc", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-82-08987", "target_hostname": "www.punchbagblog.com", "target_uri": "http://www.punchbagblog.com/2011/11/beginners-guide-to-watching-good-boxing.html", "page_rank": 1.2133207e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "The Beginner's Guide to Watching Good Boxing Fights", "snippet": "Likewise, <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em> vs. <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> has attained mythical status.

If you want a more rewarding boxing experience, here's a handy guide on how to separate the wheat from the chaff.\u00a0But first, let me answer what seems to be the most obvious question:\nWhy am I not watching the good fights?\nIf you're from North America, the juggernaut of boxing broadcasting is HBO. For the past few years the content on HBO has been suffering. The reason for this is Ross Greenburg, president of HBO Sports from 2000-2011.\nRoss Greenburg has never been a boxing fan, and has never liked dealing with boxing promoters. In fact, it's commonly known in the boxing world that Greenburg loathed building good boxing match-ups, and gave boxers who didn't deserve it high paydays -- even though they didn't bring in high ratings.\nThankfully, Greenburg has been fired from HBO, replaced by Ken Hershman, the guy responsible for taking Showtime from zero to hero in the boxing world despite having a significantly lower budget than HBO. This means better fights are on the horizon.\u00a0Unfortunately, the fights booked on HBO are still on the agenda for the rest of the year; the good fights won't be seen until 2012.\nHBO Sport's ex-president, Ross Greenburg, hates boxing.\nWhere can I find the good fights now?\nFor American viewers, the best boxing fights are broadcast on Showtime, followed by ESPN2. While the talent is not necessarily top tier, it is close and offers more entertainment value than the hyped fights on HBO.\nBut if you're unconcerned about top level talent, and just want to see a good show, there's more options. Telemundo, Fox Deportes, and TeleFutura are all American Spanish TV networks that regularly match up-and-comers with grizzled vets. The result is often knockouts, upsets, and assorted fireworks.\nIf you are more adventurous, and want to seek out what the International scene has to offer, find a BoxNation stream. It is a British TV channel that offers 24 hours boxing content. Other great channels are TyC in Argentina, Main Event in Australia, TV Azteca in Mexico, and RTL in Germany.\nFrank Warren's Box Nation streams UK and international fights. \u00a0When the stream works, that is.\nDo talented fighters make good fights?\nNot necessarily. Good fights are about good style match-ups, not good fighters. If you put two boxers in the ring and their styles don't \"gel\", the result will be a snoozer. What you need to find are two fighters with opposing styles that complement each other.\nUnderstanding styles may take time, but for a good introduction to this topic, please see Wikipedia's article on boxing styles.\nHow often do good fights happen?\nLiterally every week. Nearly a hundred fights happen each week, so there's bound to be a few of them worth watching.\nThe reason these fights don't necessarily get a whole lot of love is because boxing is a sport with international appeal, so finding a good fight is kind of like globetrotting. Thankfully, with the Internet, every high profile international fight is a click a way, and is often available on YouTube within 24 hours.\nWhat's the profile of a good fight?\nBefore tuning in to a fight, see if the fighters in question are out to prove themselves or just want a payday. Reading this blog would be a good start there. If one fighter is on the edge of retirement and has successive losses, the fights not going to be good. On the other hand, if there's a lot on the line, and a win promises bigger and better things, chances are there will be fireworks.\nAnother factor (as previously alluded) is styles. If you match two counterpunchers together, as in Mayweather vs Marquez, the result will be a snoozefest. However, if you match a boxer-puncher against a counterpuncher, as in Pacquiao vs Marquez, the result will be fireworks. Brawlers are almost always crowd pleasers, even against themselves - as was the case with the Gatti-Ward trilogy.\nFinally, look at a fighter's resume. If you see that a particular boxer fought a few noteworthy names, even if the result was a few losses, it may be because he leaves it all in the ring every time. One example of such a fighter is Michael Katsidis. Though he's had consecutive losses against Juan Manuel Marquez, Robert Guerrero, and Ricky Burns, he always pushes his opponents to bring out their best.\nIf a fight is a Pay Per View, does that mean it will live up to the hype?\nNo. Pay-per-views are based on the names on the main event, not the quality of fight. As mentioned before, good fights are based on styles match-ups, not names. This is why certain high profile PPVs, such as Pacquiao-Clottey, ended up as disappointments. Or in the case of Hopkins-Dawson, you don't even get two rounds of action.\nIn contrast, there are fights between no-name fighters, broadcast on free TV, that become legendary. A good example of this would be Wolak vs Rodriguez I, which was broadcast on ESPN2 for free. This was a classic styles match-up between an out-boxer and swarmer.\nSo am I saying that it's never worth it to buy a PPV? Not at all. Look for main events that are sequels, as well as an undercard with good styles match-ups. This will insure that your PPV is enjoyable every time.\nDo Bernard Hopkins and Chad Dawson owe fans their money back? Maybe.\nWhat about potential legendary superfights?\nSadly, few of them ever live up to the hype. Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson was a potential superfight that broke pay per view records. It resulted in a ho hum match. Oscar de la Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather broke Tyson-Lewis' record, but has since been lowly regarded due to de la Hoya being over-the-hill.\nThat said, there are a few that do live up to the hype. Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns has since been regarded as the definitive fight of the 80s. Likewise, Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier has attained mythical status.\u00a0The key, as in all fights, is the styles match-ups.\nHow do I get started?\nKeep informed. The best way to start is by gauging what boxing fans think of a fight, not what the promoters think of it.\u00a0Beyond that, check up on post fight analyses, then keep them under your hat for future reference. A good place to start is Boxing Scene as well as Fight News .\nFinally, go into a fight with an open mind, and be prepared for anything.\nPosted with kind permission from youhavethenerve, a member of the Reddit boxing community.

Sorry Jack..\nAccountability\nFri 20 Jan 12 (07:27pm)\nThe Australian Constitution is a very inferior document. That racism is enshrined in it is an outrage which must be addressed forthwith. Whilst this is the focus of the argument, it must not be forgotten that all Australians have no entrenched rights e.g. free speech. The exception is freedom of religion. Whilst recogniton of the indigenous people in the Constitution is a must, we need to go further. It is most unfortunate that we have an awful and inadequate Constitution and that it\u2019s overall will be exceedingly difficult. I urge all to read the thing. Inspiring, profound and non-discriminatory it is not.\nNonna\nFri 20 Jan 12 (07:45pm)\nJust what will this Panel (and the elistis who support it), have to say to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders if this goes to a referendum and fails?\nWhat will I say to my Aboriginal neighbours (on two sides), if this fails. We get on well and are friends. But if this fails, how do I look them in the eye? They will be left feeling inferior. If it succeeds, I will feel like all the other \u2018excluded\u2019 Australians......resentful that one race is given \u2018privilage\u2019 and mention over other Australians in our Constitution.\nThank goodness, the Panel has decided not to recommend (at this time), that consideration be given to dedicated or reserved seats for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Island peoples in the Federal Parliament. I would have predicted a violent reaction to that notion if it has been \u2018put up\u2019.\nThis exceeds what was proposed by the Howard Government. I wonder why? Perhaps something to do with Rudd\u2019s signing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples? The insertion, Sect 51A, recommended by the Panel, bears a striking resemblance to the aims and objectives of the Declaration.\nLet\u2019s have a referendum. Let\u2019s get rid of Sect 25 and 51xxvi. Let\u2019s forget about the nonsense of mention in the preamble. Let\u2019s stride into the 21st century as an intelligent country.\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (07:59pm)\nWhat will happen if it fails, Nonna? I think the nation will be diminished. The Govt and Opposition need to put party politics aside on this one and come with a bill that has their support and they can endorse to the people.\nSir Liberal\nFri 20 Jan 12 (07:47pm)\n\u201cThe zombie-like lurching antics of a desperate, doomed government.\u201d Can I use that?\nRhys Needham\nFri 20 Jan 12 (07:56pm)\nI like the ideas of the panel that I\u2019ve seen so far, but I think I\u2019d sort of prefer that the recognition of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders (weren\u2019t the Tasmanian ones that got wiped out (the full-bloods at least) in the middle third, roughly (starting in the first), of the Nineteenth Century supposedly a different bunch again?) stay more in the preamble than the Constitution itself. It looks more like a preamble statement to me, that\u2019s all. The other two I\u2019m OK with.\nJust to be partisan, I can imagine Abbott doing his usual Jim Trott from the Vicar of Dibley impression, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no, no, yes\u201d. Julia Gillard looks like she\u2019s doing an impression Jim\u2019s wife to Andrew Wilkie, \u201cYes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no\u201d.

Tombstone now holds my interest - what a Wild West town that was! Cheers Jean.\nAnya\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:07pm)\nI\u2019m thinking some public damage has already been done as far as perceptions and motives go. The panel is more open when talking about the deletion of racist clauses, but seems to be tiptoeing around the addition of other ethnically positive discrimination amendments. As well it might\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s got a chance of getting up with the latter attached to it.\nRecognition of historical fact is one thing, but that\u2019s a long way from a constitution that permanently allows discrimination based solely on ethnicity.\nIt\u2019s a given that a negative vote will result in simplistic accusations of racism, and it\u2019s already started at the lower levels ..(see Steven King at 6:36pm)...but the whole thing will be killed off if the panel tries to get too clever and bury the more contentious elements within a trickily-worded proposition.\nAs for the proposed 127A, there were over 500 disparate languages spoken. Trying to recreate that into some sort of pre-existing national institution is not even credible. And to what purpose, except more symbolism?\nAlso can\u2019t see that it\u2019s necessarily true that this panel is \u201cexpert\u201d at anything other than lobbying on indigenous matters, or that they\u2019re especially qualified on critical constitutional changes. They certainly don\u2019t constitute a cross-section of who such a panel should include if agenda is not the over-riding factor.\u00a0 Langton\u2019s \u201cunintended consequences\u201d are just another way of splitting the bet each way.There are already practical policies in place to assist aboriginal people\u2026 by enshrining them into the constitution, we live with them long term. How relevant will they be in 100 years time, or do we then do another rewrite for another group?\n1967 was a good result, and fair. Fix what remains wrong, but I\u2019ve got a real problem with messing around with the underlying premise of equality for all.\u00a0 Further fiddling to suit the hot topic of any given decade, ideology, or demographic, is dangerous on all levels.\nJackSprat\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:17pm)\nIf you want to put into the constitution \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander\u201d, should there not be a definition?.\nWhat is being used now as a definition \u201ca person who identifies with \u2026\u201d\nAs at the year 2000, there were 700 pieces of legislation with 67 definitions.\nhttp://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2000-01/01rn18.htm\nIf I am going to vote for changes to the constitution that gives special privileges to a group of people, I think I would like to know who I am giving those privileges to.\nThis whole thing is riddled with problems that have been pushed under the carpet for quite some time.\nBarney in Saigon\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:18pm)\nIn a brutal sport which, when done badly I believe is pointless, ugly and boring, Ali brought beauty in the way only a true master of their craft may.\nRhys Needham\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:20pm)\nEarl Hose\nFri 20 Jan 12 (04:12pm), wouldn\u2019t we have to re-number all the subsequent articles, then?\nNonna\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:39pm)\nJtI,\nI think you miss the point. The nation will be diminished if this succeeds.\nDon\u2019t know where you live, but I live in an area with a high indigenous population.\nBeing in small business for many years, I found that I had to \u2018self-censor\u2019 anything I said when dealing with some these people. Whilst it was not the intention (probably) of the Racial Discrimination Act, I can attest that it was used as a \u2018weapon\u2019. If I was unable to provide a service, and the person requesting that service was of the indigenous race, in many instances I was reminded that.....\"We are protected, you know. We\u2019ll tell the fella that comes here about you. You are picking on me because I am black.\u201d They also trespassed on my property and when challenged I was told....\"We own the land,bro.\u201d I never, ever provoked the situation and \u2018buttoned my lip\u2019. They were wrong, but it didn\u2019t eliminate my fear of being hauled up before a HRC tribunal. That is wrong in anyone\u2019s book. I (and others) should not be placed in that position.\nNow. You don\u2019t know me. But, I can assure you that I am not known for deriding people based on their race. God knows, I\u2019ve had a pizzling on the Bolt and Blair blogs for condemning those who choose to hate anyone \u2018different\u2019. I genuinely believe this recent issue will split this country.\nAlso, when I was in Year 12 (equivalent) in 1964, I kept company with a wonderful foreign student (Chinese). We were often abused by white bigots backed by the insidious White Australia Policy. Also, I was spotted by one of my teachers whilst out with this fellow. The next day of school I was made to stand up and was berated in front of my classmates.....the gist being, that a \u2018good, white Australian girl\u2019 should not be keeping such bad company.\u201d\nSo my history re \u2018racism\u2019 goes back a long way. I\u2019ve copped it from both angles. Any legislative instrument that mentions race is racist by its nature. Experience is not learned from books.\nSorry to sound aggressive! Maybe we should have a beer!:)\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (09:27pm)\nIt all depends on what changes are made to the constitution, Nonna. There are some racist relics in it. I mean, the states having the right to withhold the votes of one racial group or other? Come on. That\u2019s not right or proper for a modern democracy. Now if you told me that the changes to the constitution were going to lead to an imbalance in the legal status of Australians, I\u2019d be concerned. In any event, I have listed the panel\u2019s recommendations and I\u2019d be more than interested to hear from anyone who could show me how that imbalance would be created within the draft bill.\nBASSMAN\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:40pm)\nAnother \u201cdocument\\\u201d that millions of our money will be spent on.

We really are.\nThis thing will grow some legs and Abbott had better see it as an oppurtunity to demonstrate some reasonableness. Whats he got to lose? The dogs in the manger (theres a few off their leashes tonight) will choke on their miserable indignation before they vote Labor or Greens.\nI don\u2019t begrudge the Aboriginal peoples a cent, perceived excesses included.

Sure, some in his mob have gone off the tracks but name me one mob that is perfect? If I had my say to the urbane elitists who seem to be making a career off the backs of my fellow Australians I would say, \u201cLeave them alone as you have diminished their pride by determining their future and you are not helping them with your patriarchal condescension!\nI tell you what, this sit down money and treating my brothers and sisters like children is the problem, especially where there is no work. Don\u2019t you understand? The work they did was hunt and gather and now that has been taken away and now they have not only lost their connection to the land but also the very thing that is the foundation of all people, their sense of being!\nThen there are the ones that say they should integrate and lead the soul-less existence of city folk but why should they? Talk about culture! To me it is still a melting pot but lacking of the vital ingredient, acceptance and seems like a one way street paved by the whitefella.\nAnyway, that\u2019s all I have to say.

My main point is that any existing reference to race in the Constitution should be done away with and not replaced with yet another reference to race. Make the Constitution \u2018race\u2019 free.\nBut surely, your concern should also go beyond the imbalance of legal status....which may not be the case. What about the \u2018imbalance\u2019 of equality? Doesn\u2019t that count? Either way, one sector of the community, be it the Aboriginals and\nTorres Strait Islanders you would wish to be recognised/mentioned/acknowledged/included in the Constitution or the remainder of the community that will NOT be recognised/mentioned/acknowledged/included would feel second class citizens and irrelevant.....depending on the outcome of a referendum.\nWhy take the gamble that could racially divide the country?\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:13pm)\nSo your concern is that indigenous Australians will become privileged, Nonna?

Transfer that instead into building homes, education, and medical care to communities that have little of any, would make far more of a difference. I think they are on to something there. All the committees, legislation and pollie back slapping, are not going to change anything. Most Australians recognise that they, the indigenous people, are the rightful owners, no argument there. How about we cut the bovine manure, and instead of making the politically correct feel good, we make the indigenous people feel good instead, if you can believe my mates this is not the way to go about it.\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:21pm)\nPerhaps it is time to revisit the progress on the National Partnership Program on Remote Indigenous Housing, Anne.

And Frazier always referred to Ali at least publicly as the Champ. Far too much has been written about Ali\u2019s sledging - we would call it sledging - of Frazier before their first fight. The Gorilla epithet stayed around until Manilla. These men were preparing to get into the ring and beat the shit out of each other. Who said what to who at a weigh-in before a sanctioned heavyweight fight shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously.\njack\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:19pm)\naccountability is correct, our constitution is not an inspiring document, but it has, with a few other factors, served us well for hundred or so years of stable and generally good government.\nFor that very good reason, Australian voters have been reluctant to amend it, and I can\u2019t point to a vote they got wrong.\nThis despite having a good mate who was quite closely involved in the four-zip thrashing in 1988. Jack, you will be able to guess who.\nI suspect that Chris Curtis is correct, has his finger on the nub of the issue so to speak, or was that the last blog.\nAnyway, I reckon that if the referendum removes dodgy bits from the constitution it will succeed, if it attempts to enshrine new rights for some Australians it will fail, as no-one can say with certainty where that will lead.\nFor starters, if certain additional constitutional rights accrue to indigenous Australians only, then there will inevitably be a shit-fight about who is or is not indigenous, and I will take any odds that no-one will be happy with the outcome or the process, well excepting the lawyers of course.\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (11:01pm)\nHow would the intervention fare under a High Court challenge? If the draft bill was enacted, would a challenge be more or less likely? Those are fairly strong markers for what should be proposed.\nRhys Needham\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:23pm)\nRob Banks\nFri 20 Jan 12 (08:57pm), or that it will be constitutionally mandated that everyone will HAVE to be exactly like him and his hivemind - same skin colour, same views, same jobs (or whatever they do when they\u2019re not whinging), and same everything else. Gina Rinehart, though, won\u2019t be able to give us all plum TV jobs.\nRhys Needham\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:26pm)\nBailey\u2019s Mother\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:15pm), what do I call the ones that have dual Indigenous parentage, then? It\u2019s still probably better than half-caste, quadroon, or octoroon, though.\nThe Bow-Legged Swantoon\nFri 20 Jan 12 (10:31pm)\nThank-you, Jack. You said it would be a great clip and you picked a winner in more ways than one.\nI\u2019m going to have a long think about the suggested changes to the Constitution. I already have a position on it and as a bit of a statutory-interpretation freak there were ideas just pinging up like crazy as I read the proposed additions. Needs a bit of time and reflection.\nJack the Insider\nFri 20 Jan 12 (11:36pm)\nI\u2019d never seen it before, BLS but it was a beaut. Walter Cronkite reading it, too. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it is ...\u201d.\n"}, {"score": 262.23584, "uuid": "0bd12037-1590-55e8-b887-09642428d13b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200wb-68-24875", "target_hostname": "www.giannamariagarbelli.com", "target_uri": "http://www.giannamariagarbelli.com/new/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=159%3Atyson-lezione-di-vita&catid=58%3Anews&Itemid=175&lang=en", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Tyson, lezione di vita", "snippet": "From that Gym passed everyone <em>who</em> is important; from Phil Terranova and Jake the Motta to Rocky Graziano and Carmen Basilio, from <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Al\u00ec</em> and <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em> to Larry Holmes and George Foreman, from Kid Paret and Emile Griffith to Carlos Ortiz, Vito Antuofermo, Roberto Duran, until today to Arthur Gatti", "explanation": null, "document": "LA GAZZETTA DELLO SPORT - Venerd\u00ec 30th April 2004 -\nThe Story The Stories\nBy Gianna Garbelli\nThe Story The Stories\nAn important witness to the Gleason's Gym, the gym where Mike Tyson learned the art of boxing and where he actually discounts the last penal sentence. Teaching the secrets of the boxing to the children and transforming themselves in the positive symbol of the values of friendship of sport. Between the historical walls of the boxing gym passed the most famous of New York unforgettable legends of the ring, from Jake La Motta and Rocky Graziano until Shane Mosley. By now the ex irradiation heavy weight is the attraction: back on the ring in order to conquer them all, with a smile.\nTyson, lesson of life\nBy Gianna Garbelli\nVisiting the gym where Iron Mike is redeeming himself training the children: a monster of lovability.\nGianna Garbelli filmmaker and daughter of art. Second daughter of the first mariage of Giancarlo Garbelli, boxer from Milano,was one of the most admired champion at the end of the '50 biggining '60. The grandfather Cesare also, was protagonist on the ring conquered the title of Italian amateurs in 1926, Gianna is born in Varese and grow up in Milano. Mike is a trainer because a penalty.\nMike Tyson teaching boxing after the sentence because a brawl in Brooklyn in front of Marriot Hotel last 21st of June 2003. The boxer make two men to go in the hospital because they make joke of him after he refused to make autographs. To avoid one year in prison ex irradiation heavy weight has negotiated at 100 hours at social services.\nI have seen Mike Tyson to discount his penalty at Gleason's Gym of Brooklyn. There's a beautiful phrase written on the wall as soon as you enter, is taken from the Eneide written by Virgilio: \"Now whoever has courage, and strong and collected spirit in his breast, let him come forth, lace up his gloves, and put up his hands.\" Mike is not ugly and bad. The last sentence that makes him an executioner it forces him to return to the Gleason's Gym where he was born, where he was carried by the great Cus D'Amato, who has introduced him and grown. He's now there with the children of ten years, all the colors, he teaches them how to carry the blows. One of them takes his hand and he doesn't detach it . He goes that way all around the gym. The children watch him seriously, hang from his lips, bewitched by his movements, his style, his sweet and convincing smile. Mike makes some feint, plays, the boys compete for him. Me with them. All to the bag, all to the speedy ball, all in circle, convinced of its athletic model. He is a great entertainer, he cares about his boys, jumping the rope so fast and you cannot see him doing. The oldest boys they ate him with their eyes and one of them quite goes up on the ring, under the eyes wide opened of all the people, for sparring a much light one, wink blows to the body and the ace. A great lesson of boxing and everybody there is proud of being with the great Iron Mike. It will be therefore every day until the end of the penalty. The small boxers do not know anything of the injuries with some too much eager woman and some \"friend\" too much interested, have fed his reputation of monster. Mike has his fault, it's true, but he's also a difficult boy, with existential trauma in his past and therefore ready to cross the ropes of the ring. It's a rule: in needs a shock in order to go up on the ring. I make my excuses for the non-psychiatric license. Mike Tyson is an adorable person, a legend of boxing. He represents the Gleason's Gym. The myth of the gyms in America, the most important from 1937, when an Italian-American named Bob Gagliardi, in order to give appeal to his original Gym of the Bronx, has used the name of an Irish boxer: Bobby Gleason. In that period the Irish had the better one to New York. The arena cost two dollars to the month. From that Gym passed everyone who is important; from Phil Terranova and Jake the Motta to Rocky Graziano and Carmen Basilio, from Muhammad Al\u00ec and Joe Frazier to Larry Holmes and George Foreman, from Kid Paret and Emile Griffith to Carlos Ortiz, Vito Antuofermo, Roberto Duran, until today to Arthur Gatti, Shane Mosley, Mike Tyson. A lot of young people is trained every day, all of them under the Gleason's Gym rules. The gym leaves you intense vibrations, it has special smells of humanity, any is the reason for which you enter, in order to train you because you're a real champion or because you make part of those that want to be there, or you're a simple spectator. However you are welcome and the respect to you is due. The Gleason's Gym is beautiful, with its red walls, the concrete pavement, four ring, on one of them you can only go up with the skin ankle boots and leather soles, ten heavy bags at least, ropes, mirrors where to make movements, cyclette, dressing rooms, showers, cabinets, approximately 1500 meters of boxing paradise. I do not forget the smell of it. I brought it with me. You can arrive passing under the bridge of Brooklyn; the gym is in Front Street at the second floor. The panorama in the outskirts is unparalleled, even though the sky is angry or blue or it is reflected on the water. At the corner of the road, the director Sergio Leone shot one scene of his movie \"Once upon a time in America\". To the Gleason's Gym Martin Scorsese shot \"Raging Bull\" and here Robert De Niro has been trained for months, then awarded with the Oscar for the role of Jake the Motta. Bruce Silverglade waits for you, he is available for all the people. He is the third owner since Gagliardi. He takes care of the gym, it's his house, he has invested all his money, maintaining the heat and the harmony that Gagliardi had created. The gym is clean and there is no conditioned air, but it has great impellers when the air of New York becomes unsupportable. The price is equal for everybody: 70 dollars for a month, the amateurs pay 10 less dollars and then a beautiful initiative has been created: \"Give a kid a dream \" program, which affords underprivileged children the opportunity to train at gym without paying dues. The Gleason's Gym gushes a feeling of equality and true acceptance, a microcosm of the society, crude, difficult, of all races, all with great dreams to realize. For me it' clear from where the great reputation comes. . Bruce tells to me that in the gym there are represented 167 nations. In Bruce's office you get lost on the walls to watch the photos of the legendary champions, in a little corner of the bar there's a television set that transmits only boxing fights.\nAnd the trainers? Some great former champion like Carlos Ortiz, who has won and then he has lost two times with Duillio Loi; I meet Emile Griffith that tells things to me from his deep one and sends a great kiss to his godson Giuliano Benvenuti; the third party match with Nino, his father, was the splendid inauguration of the new Madison Square Garden. Vito Antuofermo capture me and we start talking, but we are interrupted by Bruce Sivlerglade who has words that go beyond the boxing themes, for his greatest humanity. Then Bob Jackson who comes from the recovery of the boys in the prison of Sing Sing (asking me: \"Who is the greatest champion of all times?\" My straight answer to the heart does not disappoint him: Sugar Ray Robinson\". And it starts rivers of words and stories and anecdotes). There are 78 trainers, who motivate and assemble personality pieces in order to make champions, or show to boys the right way. With a bit of talent and a lot of discipline you can make yours the noble art.\nIt's simple to understand that Mike Tyson feels like home, supported by love of the great boxing family, that it is so intimate. Mike is admired here for its lovability. I speak and he does not detach his look from mine, While the words are threading one behind the other. It has been in Italy, embraces to me strong, gives to me an \"high five\", he tightens the hand without hurting me. Bruce takes the photo. Mike signs autograph without no presumptuousness. In the gestures of Mike there's no misinterpreting. The girls, some of them convinced boxer, the greater part of them in gym in order to keep themselves in shape, struck with the champion. In the gym there are the rules sport and here Mike is in his own right atmosphere and everyone with him respect the rules. He's a sport man not a criminal. Boxing has redeemed him, he has a debt with it. I like the way he took the decision to discount the penalty after the brawl in Brooklyn not only between the boys and between the professionals boxers but also between the employers who want to be on the ring for one day. They are business men, lawyers, judges, others are the mothers of the young people aspirants; it's good for Mike, but it's good also for the people to see his real face. As I've seen it.\nInspired to the life of Giancarlo Garbelli\nWe'll see Gleason's Gym in the \"The Fighter\" feature film.\nThe life of Mike Tyson in some way remembered me my first film \" Tentazioni Metropolitane aka Jailbirds\", the story of a girl held in semy custody that I have produced, written, directed and interpreted in Milan between the jails of Saint Vittore and Opera. The world of boxing loves me and I love the world of boxing. I was born in it and I recognize the smells and the emotions since when I was a child. I entered this world in tip of feet, I have been recognized as daughter of art. I did not realize that until the moment, three years ago, I started to build \"the Italian fighter\", history of my grandfather and my father boxing champions . They wait for me and I does not lack the smell of the sweat and the hard work in order to realize the great dreams, without whom the cinema does not exist. Many appointments, lair solidarity, a \"Cigar Night\" in favor of the FITS (the foundation that supports the boxers when they finish the career. Where do the purposes that I have collected for the bill for the annuity of the former Italian boxers, a generation on extinction, ended?). A lot of material for my back stage, a documentary of whom I have already recorded 7 hours. The outskirts of the gym are fantastic, the water, the bridges of Brooklyn and Manhattan, the romantic but metropolitan pedestrian way, with the cars that you can feel but you do not see. The sky with the horse light, wonderful, with the background of a barge on whom I could write \"Mamma Leone Restaurant\", beautiful than how it was, another different one, but the cinema is fantasy, therefore, in my mind, I have a precise vision. The colors are magic. I've adapted my screenplay, with the advising of precious companies of this sport, in English-American with most likeable and prepared writer of American boxing, Bert Randolph Sugar, and by now it's in the hand of the powerful agents of the star system. I have headed up for the cast of \" The Italian Fighter\", but I also have found a young cast, as it is obvious are the athletes. My discovery to the Gleason's Gym, is Paul \"Magic Man\" Malignaggi, 23 years-old, he was born in Brooklyn from Italian parents, a good boxer (17 victories on 17 encounter), disciplined, able, arrogating, funny, he surely got a role in my film. He deserves it. He has already a great artistic sparring partner: Giancarlo Giannini.\nAt the Gleason's Gym I feel myself just like at home in Milan, with my friends boxers, the masters of boxing, the Andrew's Square, gym of boxing and everything else, than as far as its acceptance it does not have anything to make me mourn. So in Milan like in New York I have found a great heat, affection and real professional support for the film. \"We miss you\", they have written to me from the Gleason's Gym and I now must return with all pieces of the large puzzle of the film between Italy and America. It's my dream that is coming true, with all the possible poetry, in order to render homage to the boxing that represents social redemption. The ring does not send you to jail, it lets you out from the abyss, it helps you to not to desperate. Boxing gives you the rules in order to enter the society and to live in it as an healthy man. copyright(c)2004allrightsreserved\nYou may not distribute or otherwise make available, copies to others, whether or not for payment or other consideration, without the written permission from info@giannamariagarbelli.com\nAll content displayed or transmitted on this web site is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.\nThe editorial content is owned by Gianna Maria Garbelli. copyright\u00a9giannamariagarbelliallrightsreserved\nCopyright \u00a9 2012.

Smith\nEmail: pugilist@fightfranchise.com\nTweet\nPacquiao (left) and Marquez will complete a famous trilogy on Saturday\nFive-time, three-weight World champion Juan Manuel Marquez (53-5-1, 39KO\u2019s) could be forgiven for resting on his laurels and looking back at a career well done, but instead, this Saturday, faces the biggest test of his boxing life to date, against the great Manny Pacquiao (53-3-2, 38KO\u2019s), a man he has already fought twice before.\nThis trilogy will be remembered in the same vain as the great ones and is a fitting occasion following the death of Joe Frazier earlier this week, who of course delivered us possibly the greatest trilogy of all time against Muhammad Ali.\nAlthough Marquez disputes the outcome of both fights, the fact is he has only managed to lose and draw with Pacquiao and will have to pull off the performance of his life to go one further and defeat the legendary Filipino on Saturday at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\u201cYou have to use everything \u2014 strength, intelligence, speed. This is a fight you almost have to be perfect,\u201d said Marquez.\nThat sums up perfectly the kind of performance Marquez will need to defeat Pacquiao. Every great fighter has their bogeyman and Marquez has been nothing but a headache for Pacquiao, but the task he faces is a huge one.\nIn their first fight Marquez was dropped heavily three times inside the first round and was seconds away from a blowout. The fact that he managed to claw his way back into the fight and frustrate Pacquiao to the point of desperation before gaining an impossible draw says everything you need to know about the Mexico City-born fighter\u2019s heart. The fact that he improved on that performance in their second fight with a display of beautiful, if at times slightly negative, boxing further displays just how dangerous Marquez is.\nMarquez knows he has to fight the perfect fight to win\nIn that fight in 2008, four years after their first one, Marquez could be considered unlucky not to get the nod and although losing a split-decision to Pacquiao managed to not only stay on his feet throughout but outbox the wild, swinging Pacquiao for long periods of time.\nSince then Marquez has been defeated by Floyd Mayweather in a soul destroying fight for the Mexican veteran, but has rebounded flawlessly, most notably with a nine round stoppage of Australian warrior Michael Katsidis in a fight considered by many to be the best of 2010. Marquez showed true determination and proved to his doubters that he is still able to operate at the top level despite the crushing Mayweather loss.\nUnfortunately for Marquez, Pacquaio has not put a foot wrong since their last bout, winning seven fights in a row against a who\u2019s who of elite fighters in the sport today. Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, Ricky Hatton and Antonio Margarito are just some of the victims on Pacquiao\u2019s resume, and prove without a shadow of a doubt that as things stand he is the best fighter on the planet today, both through achievement and sheer talent. Excitement follows Manny Pacquiao like a shadow, and despite his mild manner outside the ring is a phenom inside it.\nFor this fight Pacquiao has been making all the right noises, as has trainer Freddie Roach, about how he is more prepared for Marquez\u2019s style this time, and has even promised a KO, but talk and action are two very different things.\n\u201cThe problem before [against Marquez] is that I never studied the style of being a counter puncher,\u201d Pacquiao said. \u201cI learned that after we fought two times. From then, I studied how to fight a good counter puncher like Marquez. I think I improved a lot. I\u2019m ready to fight a counterpuncher boxer.\u201d\nPacquiao says he has learned how to beat Marquez now\n\u201cManny used to be able to move in one direction, but now he moves laterally in both directions much better,\u201d trainer Roach has said. \u201cAnd Manny\u2019s punching power has grown with the weight gain. I think if Manny puts him down this time, he won\u2019t get up.\n\u201cI told everyone I\u2019m not going to be satisfied until his right hand is as good as his left, and it is at this point. He can knock him out with both hands. In the first two fights, Manny only had the left hand.\u201d\nThe key to it seems to be movement. Pacquiao can be a little ponderous and one-dimensional at times and goes looking for the knockout. Although very few fighters can negate this all-out assault Marquez, if he can weather the early storm, does have a chance of winning the tactical battle and exploit Pacquiao\u2019s enthusiasm, using it to counter and frustrate him, but it takes a brave man to stand up to that sort of aggression.\nWhether Marquez has the heart is not in doubt, he has proven it time and again, but whether his aging body can withstand another onslaught from the World\u2019s most dangerous fighter remains to be seen. If, as he says, Pacquiao genuinely believes he has been able to adapt to Marquez\u2019s style of fighting more then the ask looks even bigger, but as we know, words don\u2019t mean anything once that first bell rings.\nBoth men sound like they mean business this time\nShould Pacquiao win there will be only one man in his sights. Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao has already expressed a desire to face his pound-for-pound rival and has even gone as far as admitting his career would be unfulfilled should he fail to face Mayweather. Strong words indeed from a man billed as being an eight-weight World champion, but with the disputes over drug-testing and purse shares the fight looks no closer to happening than it did eighteen months ago.\nOne thing Pacquiao cannot afford to do is lose sight of Juan Manuel Marquez this weekend, or his dreams of facing Mayweather could all go up in smoke. The most likely outcome will be a late stoppage over Marquez, but you would be stupid to put too much money against a man who has given Pacquiao so much trouble in the past.\nNo related posts.\n"}, {"score": 245.38876, "uuid": "ae417eb7-e18d-5ec3-9dd1-bbf94d4d2ced", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0606wb-12-14309", "target_hostname": "www.philly.com", "target_uri": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl/", "page_rank": 2.4941112e-08, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Flickgrrl", "snippet": "PFF includes <em>a</em> sports-movie sidebar, including documentaries about two <em>boxers</em> <em>who</em> went toe-to-toe with <em>Muhammad</em> <em>Ali</em>: The Real Rocky, about Chuck Wepner, the guy <em>who</em> inspired the character of Rocky Balboa, and <em>Joe</em> <em>Frazier</em>: When the Smoke Clears.", "explanation": null, "document": "Posted by Carrie Rickey @ 2:51 PM Permalink | 3 comments\nWednesday, September 21, 2011\nSteve Martin's unsolicited advice to Eddie Murphy\nSteve Martin and Eddie Murphy in \"Bowfinger\"\nOnce upon a time, in 1999 it was, Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy co-starred in Bowfinger, a very meta, very funny, and very forgotten spoof of the movie industry.

It hosted three local writers \u2013 Amanda Marrone, Douglas Clegg, and Allan G. Johnson \u2013 as part of the 2010 CT Authors Trail. When he spoke at Preston in July, Doug discussed his books, answered questions about writing, and asked the audience questions about its writing and reading experiences.\nIn a recent interview, Doug Clegg said the reissued Neverland \u2013 first published in 1991 \u2013 is \u201ca southern gothic set on the fictional Gull Island, Georgia, in the 1960s.\u00a0 Two families come together at their summer ancestral house with the grandmother-matriarch.\u201d Before long family secrets and conflicts force two cousins to journey into the woods, where they find an old shack and turn it into their clubhouse. \u201cThey name it Neverland,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause it\u2019s where they\u2019ve been told never to go.\u201d\nOf course, there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s \u201ca forbidden place. If I tell more, there\u2019d be no reason to open the book \u2026 Neverland has a supernatural edge that grows into brooding horror.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Doug spent a lot of his youth on an island off the coast of Georgia, similar to the one he writes about in Neverland.\nThe author of over twenty-five books, Doug said he writes \u201cfor the same reason I breathe: It\u2019s part of my nature and my life and keeps me alive. Writing has saved me again and again \u2013 since I was seven or eight years old. It carried me through rough as well as good years.\u201d And it\u2019s always challenging. He continued: \u201cIf the novel I\u2019m working on now isn\u2019t tougher for me to write than the one before, I\u2019m doing it wrong.\u201d\nAs a youngster, Doug rarely talked about his writing and later, when in college, only few people knew he wanted to be a writer: \u201cBy the time I sent off my first novel \u2013 I was in my 20\u2032s \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d be a professional writer or not.\u201d But Doug\u2019s huge talent couldn\u2019t be ignored. Recognizing his powerful imagination, a major publisher accepted his first book and since then \u201cI\u2019ve been making a living writing for more than twenty years.\u201d\nA New York Times best-selling author, what Doug finds most interesting about writing is how \u201cit begins with an impulse to make something from the raw material of imagination.\u201d More, he hopes readers take away from his books \u201ca story. If I\u2019m lucky, it\u2019ll be a great story. Maybe some scares. I spend my adult life creating stories with the goal of engaging the reader until the last page.\u201d\nWhen Doug isn\u2019t writing, he travels, canoes, bikes \u201cand hangs out with friends or at home.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s also an animal rescue advocate. The pets he has are \u201call rescues\u201d and he encourages people looking for pets \u201cto first go to animal rescue groups, such as the CT Humane Society and its local pounds and animal shelters. The best animals I\u2019ve ever known have come from these places \u2013 and the people who run them deserve support.\u201d\nBookmark to:\n"}, {"score": 228.01398, "uuid": "fd4c9ba7-366d-573f-9550-246305471037", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-12-15170", "target_hostname": "www.theresident.com", "target_uri": "http://www.theresident.com/author/rzotti/", "page_rank": 1.1841673e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "RZotti | The Resident", "snippet": "(At the time, his vice-president <em>was</em> Don King.)

I have no professional background. I\u2019ve played guitar and drums most of my life. But really this book isn\u2019t written from the point of view of a music or wine expert. It\u2019s written by someone whose favorite moments in life \u2013 well, music and wine have been a big part of those moments. And I found they go together really well.\u201d\nA Certified Sommelier, Michael has worked in hospitality for twenty-five years. In the 1980s, he said, \u201cI took over the dining-room management at Flood Tide Restaurant at The Inn at Mystic and we had a pretty good wine list written by a purveyor. But there was no one on staff who understood wine.\u201d So he educated himself and researched wine \u201cpretty much the way someone would write a term paper \u2013 by studying and investigating and making sense of the subject.\u201d And he hasn\u2019t stopped learning and teaching:\u00a0 \u201cI was an inn-keeper for twenty-five years and have taught wine both to wait staff and dinner classes.\u201d\nHow and where does one start with wine? I mean, I suppose I have to pay big bucks for a bottle of \u201cquaffable\u201d red or white. \u201cNo!\u201dMichael said.\u00a0 \u201cThis book recommends a procedure exactly for that.\u201d Of the five thousand grapes used to produce wine, Michael suggests learning eight of them \u2013 \u201cand I list the eight in the book. Once you learn the eight and reach a comfort level with them, after that you can begin to explore elsewhere.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what Michael \u2013 who now works as a sommelier at a private golf club in Rhode Island \u2013 hopes readers take away from his book: \u201cAs we choose the music of our lives, we learn to understand what we enjoy. We love the music that\u2019s part of our lives.\u201d It\u2019s the same with wine. \u201cThere\u2019s this worry in wine drinkers they\u2019re supposed to taste and enjoy what someone else likes \u2013 and that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019d be happy if people realized that their own favorite wines should be their own favorites.\u201d\nReaction to the book has been good, though Michael admitted \u201cit\u2019s not a subject that will ever be a best-seller. It\u2019s a specialized subject. The people who have enjoyed it \u2013 especially young people new to wine \u2013 have found it helpful.\u201d\nMichael Maderia took a diverse and daunting subject and \u2013 in clear, often lyrical prose \u2013 demystified it and made it exciting and enjoyable. His metaphoric technique demonstrates his knowledge, passion and appreciation for wine and music. The Song of Wine is a marvelous introduction to wine.\nSo, folks, forget what Miles, Paul Giamatti\u2019s character in the film Sideways, said about Merlot and instead let\u2019s treat ourselves to a glass.\nBookmark to:\n"}]]}
