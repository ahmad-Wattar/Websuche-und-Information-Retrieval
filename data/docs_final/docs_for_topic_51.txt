So is their weight. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs are available in a variety of forms and dosages to satisfy these important criteria.\nLiquid medicines, often designed for children, are typically packaged with a small cup, dropper or cylindrical spoon to increase dosage accuracy. Don't use household spoons to administer medication, since they are rarely equivalent to the teaspoon or tablespoon dose advised on the package.\nTablets and caplets, usually aimed at adults, come in various shapes and sizes, as well as dose levels. Fever reducers also can be taken rectally as suppositories, which is useful if the patient is vomiting and cannot ingest anything by mouth.\nBe sure to read the label of any medicine you or a family member is about to take. All OTC medication labels list the active ingredient(s), what symptoms the product helps, who it's for, how much to take and how often. Labels also state if the product is safe for children over 2. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends that OTC cough and cold medicines not be used for those less than 2 years old and are not advised for those under 4. However, single-ingredient OTC fever reducers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen are approved for infants, though parents are advised to consult a doctor regarding the correct dosage for those under 2.\nWhat else to watch for when using these meds? Unintentional overdoses of fever reducers are quite common because their active ingredients are duplicated in other common OTC medications. For instance, a cold sufferer may take a multi-symptom cold medicine containing acetaminophen along with headache medicine containing the same active ingredient, essentially receiving a double dose, without even realizing it.\nAdditionally, these medications can become toxic, even at correct dosages, among young children suffering from dehydration due to fever, vomiting and/or diarrhea.\nExcess levels of acetaminophen or NSAIDs are not harmless. The risk of liver damage increases in those who drink three or more alcoholic beverages each day while taking ongoing doses of acetaminophen, and emergency rooms see many who took much more than the recommended dose and ended up with a life-threatening case of acetaminophen poisoning. NSAIDs can cause stomach bleeding or kidney problems, especially in senior citizens and those on certain medications.\nCheck with your doctor if you have any questions about which OTC fever reducers are right for you.\nSources:\n\"Child Warning Labels Added to Over-the-Counter Cough and Cold Medicine.\" oklahomapoison.org. 19 Dec. 2008.

For many parents, this scenario prompts an immediate reaction to lower the fever as quickly as possible, often using an overthe- counter medicine such as Tylenol or Advil. But is your child's fever really a cause for concern, and is lowering it the best choice? In most cases, a simple fever is actually a sign that your child's immune system is working at its best. Virtually all animals naturally develop a fever when they're fighting a bacterial or viral illness, and this response occurs because it improves your body's ability to get rid of the bug.\nSo in many cases, lowering a fever is not only unnecessary, it could actually hamper your child's recovery process, prolonging the illness rather than resolving it more quickly. There is good evidence that fever actually serves as a healthy stimulus to develop a strong immune system and typically the higher the fever the better the stimulus.\nFever should not be regarded as a dangerous or unhealthy process in the body. If we feel uncomfortable, achy, or even delirious during the course of a fever, these sensations are due to the toxicity that the fever is working to eliminate. The fever isn't the problem: it's the solution. Giving Advil or Tylenol to lower it is akin to killing the messenger.\nMany parents' dread of fevers has to do with the fear of fever convulsions or brain damage. This fear is unfounded. The great majority of fevers are perfectly benign, and the vast majority of children are not susceptible and won't develop fever convulsions, even with very high fevers. Children who do get convulsions naturally have low thresholds to them, and even in this small segment of the population, convulsions will occur only once or twice between six months and six years of age, and are harmless. Lowering fever with Tylenol, Advil, or baths will not prevent fever convulsions in children susceptible to them. Such measures may even increase the risk of brain damage by hindering the immune system from discharging the body's toxins. This would explain the relationship between aspirin and Reye's Syndrome.\nThe Benefits of Fever\nWhen an organism invades your body, it triggers the release of pyrogen, a substance that signals your brain's hypothalamus to raise your body's temperature. This is done through a number of different mechanisms--shivering, increased metabolism, release of hormone TRH, minimizing heat loss to name a few.\nThe fever, in turn, launches a number of beneficial body processes that either directly or indirectly help to ward off the invading bacteria or virus. Some of these benefits include:\nIncrease in antibodies -- cells trained to specifically attack the exact type of invader that your body is suffering from\nMore white blood cells are produced to help fight off the invading bugs\nMore interferon, a natural antiviral and anticancer substance, is produced, which helps block the spread of viruses to healthy cells\nWalling off of iron, which bacteria feed on\nIncreased temperature, which directly kills microbes (most bacteria and viruses actually grow better at temperatures lower than the human body)\nImproved ability of certain white blood cells to destroy bacteria and infected cells\nFever also impairs the replication of many bacteria and viruses\nIt is rare for a fever to rise higher than 104 or 105 degrees F, and as long as your child does not seem distressed, there is no harm in letting a fever run its course. Keep in mind also that fevers tend to spike in the late afternoon and evening, so a slight increase in fever during this time is not necessarily cause for alarm.\nWhy Medications to Lower Fever are Typically Unnecessary, and Even Harmful\nEven the American Academy of Pediatrics Does NOT Recommend Fever-Reducing Drugs for fevers. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recognizes that fever is not a disease, but a sign that your body is doing what it's supposed to do, to fight infection. They state \"Fever is not an illness, rather, it is a symptom of sickness and is usually a positive sign that the body is fighting infection.\"\nAs mentioned earlier, in most cases you should avoid giving your child medications to lower fever, as these medications will typically only suppress the natural healing mechanisms of the fever and prolong the illness. In fact, several studies supporting the fact that lowering fever actually prolongs illness:\nA study of adults with colds found that aspirin and acetaminophen suppressed production of antibodies and increased cold symptoms, with a trend toward longer infectiousness.\nIn a study of children with chickenpox, acetminophen prolonged itching and the time to scabbing compared to placebo treatment.\nIn test-tube studies, therapeutic levels of aspirin suppressed the ability of human white blood cells to destroy bacteria.\nAnother study found that a host of pain relievers, including aspirin and ibuprofen, inhibited white-cell production of antibodies by up to 50 percent.\nThese medications also carry risks of side effects, including liver damage with acetaminophen, stomach upset with Ibuprofen and Reye's syndrome with aspirin.\nRemember, the point of the fever is to stimulate the immune system and create an inhospitable environment for invading organisms, essentially turning up the heat high enough that the invading microbes cannot live. So anytime you lower a fever artificially you're making your body more hospitable to the invading pathogens. Lowering a fever with medications also masks your symptoms, which may lead you to return to your normal activities too soon, when your body could still benefit from rest.\nHome Management of Fevers\nDo give your child lots to drink. Fever increases fluid loss, and dehydration can drive up your child's temperature. Kids with fever often do not feel thirsty, or by the time they do, they're already dehydrated. So keep offering fluids.\nSmall, frequent sips are often best, especially if the child feels nauseated. If necessary, use a plastic medicine dropper to gently insert water into your child's mouth. The type that holds several ounces is best to use.\nDress lightly or bundle? The answer depends on your children's perception of temperature - follow their cues. If your child looks pale, shivers, or complains of feeling chilled (things that tend to happen in the early stages of fever), bundle them in breathable fabrics so that sweat will evaporate, but make sure they can easily remove the layers. If they are comfortable and the fever is low, dress them snuggly and give warm liquids to assist the body's fever production. If they sweat and complain of heat, dress them lightly and let them throw off the covers. Older kids will take care of these needs themselves.\nDon't push food. People with fevers generally don't have much appetite. Let your child determine when and what they eat. Just bear in mind that consumption of sugary foods and dairy products could delay the natural immune response.\nWhen There May Be Cause For Concern\nThere are some instances, however, when a fever may require special attention. This includes: Fever in an infant younger than 3 months; Fever above 102.5 degrees F children between 3 months and 36 months, IF they appear very ill (not responding normally); Anytime a fever rises over 105 degrees F.\n"}, {"score": 1472.7758, "uuid": "6c81b64f-db96-5b71-b2cd-c2ffca8cce52", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1314wb-72-19073", "target_hostname": "www.lpch.org", "target_uri": "http://www.lpch.org/DiseaseHealthInfo/HealthLibrary/infectious/fevers.html", "page_rank": 1.1764261e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>Fevers</em>", "snippet": "<em>In</em> <em>children</em>, a <em>fever</em> that <em>is</em> equal to <em>or</em> greater than 102.2\u00b0 should be treated. <em>Children</em> older than two months of age with a <em>fever</em> of 102\u00b0 <em>or</em> higher that does not respond to <em>fever</em>-<em>reducing</em> medication should be seen by a physician.", "explanation": null, "document": "Fevers\nWhat is a fever?\nA\u00a0temperature of up to 100.3\u00ba F may be normal. A temperature greater than this may be a sign of a health problem. Your child's age and behavior may be a more important indicator.\nThe body has several ways to maintain normal body temperature. The organs involved in helping with temperature regulation include the brain, skin, muscle, and blood vessels. The body responds to changes in temperature by:\nincreasing or decreasing sweat production.\nmoving blood away from, or closer to, the surface of the skin.\ngetting rid of, or holding on to, water in the body.\nnaturally wanting to seek a cooler or warmer environment.\nWhen your child has a fever, the body works the same way to control the temperature, but it resets its thermostat at a higher temperature. The temperature increases for a number of reasons:\nChemicals, called cytokines and mediators, are produced in the body in response to an invasion from a microorganism, malignancy, or other intruder.\nThe body is making more macrophages, which are cells that go to combat when intruders are present in the body. These cells actually \"eat-up\" the invading organism.\nThe body is busily trying to produce natural antibodies, which fight infection. These antibodies will recognize the infection next time it tries to invade.\nMany bacteria are enclosed in an overcoat-like membrane. When this membrane is disrupted or broken, the contents that escape can be toxic to the body and stimulate the brain to raise the temperature.\nWhat conditions can cause a fever?\nThe following conditions can cause a fever:\ninfectious diseases\ndisorders in the brain\nWhat are the benefits of a fever?\nA fever actually helps the body destroy its microbial invader. It also stimulates an inflammatory response, which sends all kinds of substances to the area of infection to protect the area, prevent the spread of the invader, and start the healing process.\nWhat are the symptoms that my child may have a fever?\nChildren with fevers may become more uncomfortable as the temperature rises. The following are the most common symptoms of a fever. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. In addition to body temperature greater than 100.4\u00ba F, symptoms may include:\nYour child may not be as active or talkative as usual.\nHe/she may seem fussier, less hungry, and thirstier.\nYour child may feel warm or hot. Remember that even if your child feels like he/she is \u201cburning up,\" the actual rectal or oral temperature may not be that high.\nThe symptoms of a fever may resemble other medical conditions. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, if your child is younger than two months of age and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, you should call your pediatrician. If you are unsure, always consult your child\u2019s physician for a diagnosis.\nWhen should a fever be treated?\nIn children, a fever that is equal to or greater than 102.2\u00b0 should be treated. Children older than two months of age with a fever of 102\u00b0 or higher that does not respond to fever-reducing medication should be seen by a physician. Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years can develop seizures from a high fever (called febrile seizures). If your child does have a febrile seizure, there is a chance that the seizure may occur again, but, usually, children outgrow the febrile seizures. A febrile seizure does not mean your child has epilepsy.\nWhat can I do to decrease my child's fever?\nSpecific treatment for a fever will be determined by your physician based on:\nAspirin and the Risk of Reye Syndrome in Children Do not give aspirin to a child without first contacting the child's physician. Aspirin, when given as treatment for children, has been associated with Reye syndrome, a potentially serious or deadly disorder in children. Therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers recommend that aspirin (or any medication that contains aspirin) not be used to treat any viral illnesses in children.\nyour child's age, overall health, and medical history\nextent of the condition\nyour child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies\nexpectations for the course of the disease\nyour opinion or preference\nAdminister an anti-fever medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. DO NOT give your child aspirin, as it has been linked to a serious, potentially fatal disease, called Reye syndrome.\nOther ways to reduce a fever:\nDress your child lightly if this makes him/her feel better. Excess clothing will trap body heat and cause the temperature to rise.\nGive your child a lukewarm bath.\nEncourage your child to drink plenty of fluids, such as juices, soda, punch, or popsicles.\nPlace cold washcloths over areas of the body where the blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin such as the forehead, wrists, and groins.\nDo not use alcohol baths.\nWhen should I call my child's physician?\nCall your child's physician immediately if your child is:\nyounger than\u00a03 months old with any fever greater than 100.4\u00ba F\nyour child is crying inconsolably\nyour child is difficult to awaken\nyour child's neck is stiff\nyour child has a convulsion\nany purple spots are present on the skin\nbreathing is difficult AND no better after you clear the nose\nyour child is unable to swallow anything and is drooling saliva\nyour child looks or acts very sick\nCall your child's physician within 24 hours if your child is >\u00a03 months old and any of the following conditions are present:\nburning or pain occurs with urination\nyour child has had a fever for more than 24 hours without an obvious cause or location of infection and seems to be getting worse\nCall your child's physician during office hours if any of the following conditions are present:\nyour child has had a fever more than 72 hours\nthe fever went away for more than 24 hours and then returned\nyou have other concerns or questions\nTopic Home Page | Return to Full List of Topics\nThe information on this Web page is provided for educational purposes.

You should make sure you are fully aware of the symptoms. Further information is available from The Meningitis Research Foundation at www.meningitis.org.\nWhat to expect:\nFever in children usually settles within a day. A rapidly rising temperature may cause chills (shivering) and, in some infants, a high fever (over 39\u00b0C) can lead to seizures, known as febrile convulsions. During a febrile convulsion, the body may shake and twitch and the eyes may roll back, as the high temperature affects the electrical activity in the brain. This usually lasts less than five minutes and while very frightening for you, is thought to be harmless.\nThis said, you should always seek medical advice if it happens. Up to four per cent of children under five years have febrile convulsions at some point and your child will be totally unaware that it has happened. Just be sure to keep them safe, lay them on their side on the floor and remove any dangerous objects they could harm themselves on. It is also important you do not try to restrain your child, as you could hurt them.\nHow to treat fever in children:\nThe good news is that there is plenty you can do to help reduce your child's fever and make them more comfortable. Children's ibuprofen suspensions (Such as Nurofen for Children ) are clinically proven to effectively reduce fever, and Paracetamol suspensions (such as Disprol Paracetamol Suspension ) can also help lower your child's temperature. Always read the product label.\nParacetamol is gentle on the stomach and Disprol is available as a paracetamol suspension or soluble tablets for infants as young as three months. Younger infants may also be able to take Disprol, following advice from a doctor.\nIbuprofen is a fast acting medicine and Nurofen for Children is an effective way to help make your child feel better, fast. Nurofen for Children was the first Ibuprofen suspension suitable to give your baby from just three months (weighing over 5kg). It starts working to reduce fever in babies and children in just 15 minutes, and lasts longer than Paracetamol based medicines (up to eight hours) - just enough to get a good night's sleep! In fact, nothing reduces fever faster or lasts for longer than Nurofen for Children!\nIt is useful to take your sick baby's temperature before giving any fever-reducing medication, so that you can monitor your child's progress.\nTo help reduce discomfort from fever children should be kept cool. You can do this by:\nRemoving excess clothing\nKeeping the room cool (approximately 20\u00b0C)\nUsing a light sheet in the cot rather than blankets or duvets\nGive babies smaller and more frequent feeds to help keep them hydrated\nPhysical methods of cooling an infant such as fanning, cold bathing and tepid sponging are controversial. They can cause discomfort and probably have little effect.\nIf you are unable to control your child's fever or it persists for more than 24 hours always seek medical advice.\nRemember that you must not give aspirin to a child under 16 years of age, except under medical advice.\nClick here for more information on Nurofen for Children or Disprol Paracetamol Suspension\nNurofen for Children contains Ibuprofen.

While much of it is attributable to diet, a substantial part is synthesized endogenously . [2]\nAspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane , which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent heart attacks , strokes , and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots. [3] It has also been established that low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack or of the death of cardiac tissue. [4] [5]\nThe main undesirable side-effects of aspirin taken by mouth are gastrointestinal ulcers , stomach bleeding, and tinnitus , especially in higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer indicated to control flu-like symptoms or the symptoms of chickenpox or other viral illnesses, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome . [6]\nAspirin is part of a group of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but differs from them in the mechanism of action .[ clarification needed ] Though it, and others in its group called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme cyclooxygenase , aspirin (but not the other salicylates) does so in an irreversible manner and, unlike others, affect more the COX-1 variant than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme. [7] For example, NSAIDs' antiplatelet effects normally last in the order of hours, whereas aspirin's effects last for days (until the body replaces the suppressed platelets). Hence, when physicians tell patients to stop taking NSAIDs, they usually imply aspirin as well.\nToday, aspirin is one of the most widely used medications in the world, with an estimated 40,000 tonnes of it being consumed each year. [8] In countries where Aspirin is a registered trademark owned by Bayer , the generic term is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). [9]\nContents\n11 External links\nMedical uses\nAspirin is used for the treatment of a number of conditions including: fever , pain, rheumatic fever , and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis , pericarditis , and Kawasaki disease . [10] It is used in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks , strokes , heart attacks , pregnancy loss , and cancer . [10]\nPain\nIn general, aspirin works well for dull, throbbing pain; it is ineffective for pain caused by most muscle cramps , bloating , gastric distension , and acute skin irritation. [11] The most studied example is pain after surgery, such as tooth extraction, for which the highest allowed dose of aspirin (1 g) is equivalent to 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen), 60\u00a0mg of codeine , or 5\u00a0mg of oxycodone . A combination of aspirin and caffeine , in general, affords greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent aspirin alleviates pain much faster than aspirin in tablets (15\u201330 min vs. 45\u201360 min). [12]\nNevertheless, as a postsurgery painkiller, aspirin is inferior to ibuprofen and has higher gastrointestinal toxicity. The maximum dose of aspirin (1 g) provides weaker pain relief than an intermediate dose of ibuprofen (400\u00a0mg), and this relief does not last as long. [12] A combination of aspirin and codeine may have a slightly higher analgesic effect than aspirin alone; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful. [13] It appears ibuprofen is at least equally, and possibly more, effective than this combination. [14]\nAccording to a 1998 meta-analysis of clinical trials for menstrual pain , aspirin demonstrated higher efficacy than placebo, but lower than ibuprofen or naproxen , although maximum doses of aspirin were never used in these trials. The authors concluded ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio. [15]\nAspirin did not ease pain during cycling exercise, [16] while caffeine was very effective. [17] [18] Likewise, aspirin, codeine, or paracetamol was not better than placebo for muscle soreness after exercise. [19]\nHeadache\nAspirin is a first-line drug in the treatment of migraine , bringing relief in 50\u201360% of the cases. [20] When used at a high dose of 1000\u00a0mg (as compared to 275\u2013325\u00a0mg when used as a pain killer or 81\u00a0mg as an antiplatelet therapy), no significant differences were seen as compared to triptan medication, sumatriptan (Imitrex) [21] and other painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) [22] or ibuprofen . [23] The combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine (as found in the OTC brand Excedrin ) is even more potent. For the treatment of migraine headache, this formulation works better than any of its three components taken separately, [22] better than ibuprofen [24] and better than sumatriptan. As with all other medications for migraine, it is recommended to take aspirin at the first signs of the headache, and it is the way these medications were used in the comparative clinical trials. [25]\nAspirin alleviates pain in 60\u201375% of patients with episodic tension headaches . [26] [27] It is equivalent to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in that respect, except for the higher frequency of gastrointestinal side-effects. [27] Comparative clinical trials indicated metamizole and ibuprofen may relieve pain faster than aspirin, although the difference becomes insignificant after about two hours. The addition of caffeine in a dose of 60\u2013130\u00a0mg to aspirin increases the analgesic effect in headache. [26] [28] The combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine is still more effective, but at the cost of more stomach discomfort, nervousness and dizziness. [29]\nThere is some evidence low-dose aspirin has benefit for reducing the occurrence of migraines in susceptible individuals. [30] [31] [32] [33]\nPrevention of heart attacks and strokes\nThere are two distinct uses of aspirin for prophylaxis of cardiovascular events: primary prevention and secondary prevention. Primary prevention is about decreasing strokes and heart attacks in the general population of those who have no diagnosed heart or vascular problems. Secondary prevention concerns patients with known cardiovascular disease . [34]\nLow doses of aspirin are recommended for the secondary prevention of strokes and heart attacks. For both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and ischaemic stroke by about a fifth.[ citation needed ] This translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.[ citation needed ] Although aspirin also raises the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and other major bleeds by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive. Thus, in secondary prevention trials, aspirin reduced the overall mortality by about a tenth. [34]\nFor persons without cardiovascular problems, the benefits of aspirin are unclear. In the primary prevention trials, aspirin decreased the overall incidence of heart attacks and ischaemic strokes by about a tenth. However, since these events were rare, the absolute reduction of their rate was low: from 0.57% to 0.51% per year. In addition, the risks of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding almost completely offset the benefits of aspirin. Thus, in the primary prevention trials, aspirin did not change the overall mortality rate. [34] Further trials are in progress [update] . [34]\nThe expert bodies diverge in their opinions regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention, such as can be accomplished by including aspirin in a polypill for the general population. The US Government Preventive Services Task Force recommended making individual, case by case choices based on the estimated future risk and patients' preferences. [35] [36] On the other hand, Antithrombotic Trialists\u2019 Collaboration argued such recommendations are unjustified, since the relative reduction of risk in the primary prevention trials of aspirin was same for persons in high- and low-risk groups and did not depend on the blood pressure. The Collaboration suggested statins as the alternative and more effective preventive medication. [34]\nCoronary and carotid arteries, bypasses and stents\nThe coronary arteries supply blood to the heart . Aspirin is recommended for one to six months after placement of stents in the coronary arteries and for years after a coronary artery bypass graft .\nThe carotid arteries supply blood to the brain . Patients with mild carotid artery stenosis benefit from aspirin; it is recommended after a carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stent.\nAfter vascular surgery of the lower legs using artificial grafts that are sutured to the arteries to improve blood supply, aspirin is used to keep the grafts open because it serves as type of blood thinner, reducing the likelihood of clots forming.\nOther uses\nAlthough aspirin has been used to combat fever and pains associated with common cold for more than 100 years, its efficacy in this role was only recently confirmed in controlled clinical trials on adults. One gram of aspirin, on average, reduced the oral body temperature from 39.0 \u00b0C (102.2\u00a0\u00b0F) to 37.6 \u00b0C (99.7\u00a0\u00b0F) after three hours. The relief began after 30 minutes, and after six hours, the temperature still remained below 37.8 \u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F). Aspirin reduces fever by inhibition of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1 , both being pyrogens. [37] Aspirin also helped with \"achiness\", discomfort, and headache, [38] and with sore throat pain, for those who had it. [39] The effects of aspirin were indistinguishable from those obtained using paracetamol in any respect, except for, possibly, a slightly higher incidence of sweating and gastrointestinal side-effects. [38]\nFever and joint pain of acute rheumatic fever respond extremely well, often within three days, to high doses of aspirin. The therapy usually lasts for one to two weeks; and only in about 5% of the cases it has to continue for longer than six months. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin treatment is unnecessary, as it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. [40] In addition, the high doses of aspirin used caused liver toxicity in about 20% of the treated children, [41] [42] who are the majority of rheumatic fever patients, and increased the risk of their developing Reye's syndrome . [40] Naproxen was shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic; due to the limited clinical experience, however, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment. [40] [43]\nAlong with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children, although even this use has been questioned by some researchers. [44] In the United Kingdom, the only indications for aspirin use in children and adolescents under 16 are Kawasaki disease and prevention of blood clot formation.\nAspirin is also used in the treatment of pericarditis , coronary artery disease , and acute myocardial infarction . [45] [46] [47]\nTaking aspirin before air travel in cramped conditions has been suggested to decrease the risk of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). The reason for taking aspirin is the long period of sitting without exercise, not air travel itself. A large, randomized, controlled trial in 2000 of aspirin against placebo in 13,000 patients with hip fractures found \"a 29% relative risk reduction in DVT with 160 mg of aspirin taken daily for five weeks. Although there are obvious problems with extrapolating the data to long-distance travelers, this is the best evidence we could find to justify aspirin use\". [48]\nExperimental\nAspirin has been theorized to reduce cataract formation in diabetic patients, but one study showed it was ineffective for this purpose. [49] The role of aspirin in reducing the incidence of many forms of cancer has also been widely studied. In several studies, its use did not reduce the incidence of prostate cancer . [50] [51] Its effects on the incidence of pancreatic cancer are mixed; one study published in 2004 found a statistically significant increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer among women, [52] while a meta-analysis of several studies, published in 2006, found no evidence aspirin or other NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk for the disease. [53] The drug may be effective in reduction of risk of various cancers, including those of the colon , [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] lung , [60] [61] and possibly the upper GI tract, though some evidence of its effectiveness in preventing cancer of the upper GI tract has been inconclusive. [62] [62] [63] Its preventative effect against adenocarcinomas may be explained by its inhibition of PTGS2 (COX-2) enzymes expressed in them. [64]\nA 2009 article published by the Journal of Clinical Investigation suggested that aspirin might prevent liver damage. In their experiment, scientists from Yale University and The University of Iowa induced damage in certain liver cells ( hepatocytes ) using excessive doses of acetaminophen . This caused hepatoxicity and hepatocyte death, which triggered an increase in the production of TLR9 . The expression of TLR9 caused an inflammatory cascade involving pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18. Aspirin was found to have a protective effect on hepatocytes because it led to the \"downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines\". [65]\nIn another 2009 article published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, men and women who regularly took aspirin after colorectal cancer diagnosis were found to have lower risks of overall and colorectal cancer death compared to patients not using aspirin. [66]\nA 2010 article in the Journal of Clinical Oncology has suggested aspirin may reduce the risk of death from breast cancer. [67] While the information has been well-circulated by the media, [68] [69] official health bodies and medical groups have expressed concern over the touting of aspirin as a \"miracle drug\". [70]\nA 2010 study by Oxford University involving over 25000 patients showed taking a small (75\u00a0mg) daily dose of aspirin for between four and eight years substantially reduces death rates from a range of common cancers by at least a fifth and the reduction of risk continued for 20 years in both men and women. For specific cancers the, reduction was about 40% for bowel cancer , 30% for lung cancer , 10% for prostate cancer and 60% for oesophageal cancer , while the reductions in pancreas , stomach , brain , breast and ovarian cancers were difficult to quantify because there were not enough data, but other studies are in progress. However, taking aspirin doubles the annual risk of major internal bleeding that normally has a very low incidence (about 1 in 1000) in middle age, but increased dramatically after 75 years old. [71]\nResistance\nFor some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men, [72] and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 patients found 28% to be resistant. [73] A study in 100 Italian patients found that, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others were noncompliant . [74]\nDosage\nCoated 325\u00a0mg aspirin tablets\nAdult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300\u00a0mg in Britain and 325\u00a0mg in the USA. Smaller doses are based on these standards; e.g. 75- and 81-milligram tablets are used; there is no medical significance in the slight difference. It is of historical interest that in the U.S., a 325\u00a0mg dose is equivalent to the historic 5- grain aspirin tablet in use prior to the metric system.\nIn general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, [75] with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever. [76] For the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily. [75]\nNew recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, March, 2009) on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45\u201379 and women aged 55\u201379 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. [77] The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81\u00a0mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. [77] Low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81\u00a0mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention. [77]\nIn children with Kawasaki disease , aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks. [78]\nAdverse effects\nContraindications\nAspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen , [79] [80] or who have salicylate intolerance [81] [82] or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID -precipitated bronchospasm . Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers , mild diabetes , or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. [79] [83] Even if none of these conditions is present, there is still an increased risk of stomach bleeding when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin . [79] [80] Patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. [79] [83] Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in particular in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. [84] Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. [85] People with kidney disease , hyperuricemia , or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid , and thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome . [6]\nGastrointestinal\nAspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding . [86] Although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being \"gentle to the stomach\", in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk. [86] Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has also been shown to further increase this risk. [86] Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. [87]\nIn addition to enteric coating, \"buffering\" is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses MgO. Other preparations use CaCO3. [88]\nTaking it with vitamin C is a more recently investigated method of protecting the stomach lining. According to research done at a German university, taking equal doses of vitamin C and aspirin decreases the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone. [89] [90]\nIt is reported that deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), an extract of the popular herb licorice, helps relieve the symptoms of gastritis. In a 1979 research study, a dose of 350 milligrams of DGL was shown to decrease the amount of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by three adult-strength aspirin tablets (750 milligrams). [91]\nA dose of 500 milligrams of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe, an amino acid naturally formed in the body) given together with a large dose of aspirin (1300 milligrams) in a research study reduced the amount of stomach damage by 90 percent. [92]\nA study found that, in contrast to oral aspirin, intravenous injection of aspirin did not produce detectable histological damage or significantly alter gastric mucosal potential difference, and concluded that high blood levels of circulating salicylate did not acutely damage gastric mucosa, so that gastric mucosal damage produced acutely after single oral doses of aspirin are due to its topical , rather than systemic, action. [93]\nCentral effects\nLarge doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, have been proposed to cause tinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade. [94]\nReye's syndrome\nMain article: Reye's syndrome\nReye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver , can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in under-18 patients were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection , chickenpox , or diarrhea . Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. [95] After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General 's warning and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. [95] The United States Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, [6] and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor. [96]\nHives and swelling\nFor a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms that resemble an allergic reaction, including hives , swelling and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy , but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose .\nOther effects\nAspirin can induce angioedema (swelling of skin tissues) in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients participating in the study. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared. [97]\nAspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on MRI scans of 5\u201310\u00a0mm or smaller hypointense (dark holes) patches. [98] [99] Such cerebral microbleeds are important since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage , Binswanger disease and Alzheimer's disease .[ original research? ]\nA study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated that there was an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10.000 persons. [100] In comparison, there was an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per 10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic stroke. [100] In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH of approximately 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6). [101]\nAspirin and other NSAIDs can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state. [102]\nAspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 elective surgical patients required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients.

Women may possibly benefit less from aspirin than men. [17] [18]\nStroke \u2014 as secondary prevention (i.e. to prevent recurrence)\nDosage\nEdit\nFor adults doses of 300 to 1000 mg are generally taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with a maximum dose of 8000 mg a day. [19] The correct dose of aspirin depends on the disease process that is being treated. For instance, for the treatment of rheumatic fever, doses near the maximal daily dose have been used historically. For the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, doses as low as 75 mg daily (or possibly even lower) are sufficient.\nFor those under 12 years of age, the dose previously varied with the age, but aspirin is no longer routinely used in children due to the association with Reye's syndrome ; paracetamol or other NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen , are now being used instead. Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children with aspirin initially started at 7.5-12.5 mg/kg body weight taken four times a day for up to two weeks and then continued at 5 mg/kg once daily for a further six to eight weeks. [20]\nDangers of low-dose aspirin\nEdit\nA recent review states: \"....low-dose aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding 2-fold compared with placebo. However, the annual incidence of major bleeding due to low-dose aspirin is modest\u2014only 1.3 patients per thousand higher than what is observed with placebo treatment. Treatment of approximately 800 patients with low-dose aspirin annually for cardiovascular prophylaxis will result in only 1 additional major bleeding episode.\" Further, \"...the cost to prevent one major GI bleeding episode from aspirin in 1 year by substituting clopidogrel therapy would be $1,216,180...\" [21]\nContraindications and warnings\nAspirin should be avoided by those known to be allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen .\nCaution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID -precipitated bronchospasm .\nIt is generally recommended that one seek medical help if symptoms do not improve after a few days of therapy.\nCaution should be taken in patients with kidney disease , peptic ulcers , mild diabetes , gout or gastritis ; manufacturers recommend talking to one's doctor before using this medicine.\nTaking aspirin with alcohol increases the chance of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (stomach bleeding).\nChildren, including teenagers, are discouraged from using aspirin in cold or flu symptoms as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome . [1]\nPatients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take salicylates.\nSome sources recommend that patients with hyperthyroidism avoid aspirin because it elevates T4 levels. [2]\nCommon side-effects\nEdit\nGastrointestinal complaints (stomach upset, dyspepsia , heartburn, small blood loss). To help avoid these problems, it is recommended that aspirin be taken at or after meals. Undetected blood loss may lead to hypochromic anemia . The Gastrointestinal complications that may result from a dose of Aspirin are due to Aspirin inhibitory action on Cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2.\nSevere gastrointestinal complaints (gross bleeding and/or ulceration), requiring discontinuation and immediate treatment. Patients receiving high doses and/or long-term treatment should receive gastric protection with high-dosed antacids, ranitidine or omeprazole .\nFrequently, central effects (dizziness, tinnitus , hearing loss, vertigo , centrally mediated vision disturbances, and headaches). The higher the daily dose is, the more likely it is that central nervous system side-effects will occur.\nSweating, seen with high doses, independent from antipyretic action\nLong-term treatment with high doses (arthritis and rheumatic fever): often increased liver enzymes without symptoms, rarely reversible liver damage. The potentially fatal Reye's syndrome may occur, if given to pediatric patients with fever and other signs of infections. The syndrome is due to fatty degeneration of liver cells. Up to 30 percent of those afflicted will eventually die. Prompt hospital treatment may be life-saving.\nChronic nephritis with long-term use, usually if used in combination with certain other painkillers. This condition may lead to chronic renal failure.\nProlonged and more severe bleeding after operations and post-traumatic for up to 10 days after the last aspirin dose. If one wishes to counteract the bleeding tendency, fresh thrombocyte concentrate will usually work.\nSkin reactions, angioedema , and bronchospasm have all been seen infrequently.\nPatients that have the genetic disease known as Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) should avoid this drug as it is known to cause hemolytic anemia in large doses depending on the severity of the disease.\nInteractions\nEdit\nAspirin can interact with some other drugs. Some drugs, for example those used for diabetes , are bound by plasma protein in the blood supply and are therefore not free to react with their targets. However, aspirin may displace them from plasma protein, leading to a drug overdose . Aspirin has this same effect on anticoagulants .\nOverdose\nEdit\nAspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, supratherapeutic doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. [22]\nSymptoms\nEdit\nAspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with mild intoxication frequently have nausea and vomiting , abdominal pain, lethargy, tinnitus , and dizziness . More significant symptoms occur in more severe poisonings and include hyperthermia , tachypnea , respiratory alkalosis , metabolic acidosis , hyperkalemia , hypoglycemia , hallucinations , confusion , seizure , cerebral edema , and coma . The most common cause of death following an aspirin overdose is cardiopulmonary arrest usually due to pulmonary edema . [23]\nToxicity\nEdit\nThe toxic dose of aspirin is generally considered greater than 150 mg per kg of body mass. Moderate toxicity occurs at doses up to 300 mg/kg, severe toxicity occurs between 300 to 500 mg/kg, and a potentially lethal dose is greater than 500 mg/kg. [24] This is the equivalent of many dozens of the common 325 mg tablets, depending on body weight. Note that children cannot tolerate as much aspirin per unit body weight as adults can, even when aspirin is indicated. Label-directions should be followed carefully.\nTreatment\nEdit\nAll overdose patients must be taken to a hospital immediately.\nInitial treatment of an acute overdose includes gastric decontamination of the patient. This is achieved by administering activated charcoal which adsorbs the aspirin in the gastrointestinal tract . Stomach pumps are no longer routinely used in the treatment of poisonings but are sometimes considered if the patient has ingested a potentially lethal amount up to 1 hour previously. [25] Repeated doses of charcoal have been proposed to be beneficial in aspirin overdose. [26] A study performed found that repeat dose charcoal might not be of significant value. [27] However, most toxicologists will administer additional charcoal if serum salicylate levels are increasing.\nPatients are monitored until their peak salicylate blood level has been determined. [28] Blood levels are usually performed 4 hours after ingestion and then every 2 hours after that to determine the maximum level. Maximum levels can be used as a guide to toxic effects expected. [29]\nThere is no antidote to salicylate poisoning. Frequent blood work is performed to check metabolic , salicylate , and blood sugar levels; arterial blood gas assessments are performed to test for respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis . Patients are monitored and often treated according to their individual symptoms, patients may be given intravenous potassium chloride to counteract hypokalemia , glucose to restore blood sugar levels, benzodiazepines for any seizure activity, fluids for dehydration , and importantly sodium bicarbonate to restore the blood's sensitive pH balance. Sodium bicarbonate also has the effect of increasing the pH of urine, which in turn increases the elimination of salicylate. Additionally, hemodialysis can be implemented to enhance the removal of salicylate from the blood. Hemodialysis is usually used in severely poisoned patients; for example, patients with significantly high salicylate blood levels, significant neurotoxicity (agitation, coma, convulsions), renal failure, pulmonary edema, or cardiovascular instability are hemodialyzed. [28] Hemodialysis also has the advantage of restoring electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities; hemodialysis is often life-saving in severely ill patients.\nIf the overdose was intentional, the patient should undergo psychiatric evaluation, as with any suicide attempt.\nEpidemiology\nEdit\nIn the later part of the 20th century the number of salicylate poisonings has declined mainly due to the popularity of other over-the-counter analgesics such as paracetamol . Fifty-two deaths involving single-ingredient aspirin were reported in the United States in the year 2000. However, in all but three cases, the reason for the ingestion of lethal doses was intentional, predominantly suicides. [30]\nResearch into cancer prevention\nEdit\nThe role that aspirin might have in reducing the rates of certain cancers has been the subject of many studies. However, given the side-effects of NSAIDs on increased gastrointestinal bleeding and rates of heart disease, there is no current medical recommendation to use these drugs for cancer reduction.\nProstate - While there is some epidemiological information suggesting a correlation between the reduction of prostate cancer and aspirin use, two recent studies (a multicentric case-control study and epidemiological study) were inconclusive. [31] [32]\nColon - A 2005 JAMA article states that aspirin may prevent carcinoma of the colon, when taken in at least twice-daily adult (325 mg) doses. [33] It follows an earlier study, also using the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) women, which had similar conclusions but with a smaller testing population. [34] The conclusion of the JAMA study was that both aspirin and other non-aspirin NSAIDs used over a long time (best results seen after at least a decade of regular use) reduce risk of colorectal cancer. The risk was reduced the most at doses higher than 14 tablets per week (full-strength aspirin twice a day). However, these doses can have a higher incidence of serious gastrointestinal bleeding, and reduced doses (even the low doses recommended for cardiovascular health (81 mg/day)) also seem to have an anti-cancer effect, albeit not as much as the higher doses. The results of these studies have been correlated with experimental studies in human volunteers and in rodents. At least four clinical trials show that small doses of aspirin reduce, modestly, intestinal polyps recurrence in patients with some history of adenomas. [35] Some twenty carcinogenesis studies in rats or mice also support that aspirin can prevent cancer, also reported in the Chemoprevention of Colorectal Cancer Database .\nGall bladder - There is some evidence that aspirin may increase gall bladder motility and thus be effective in treating gall bladder disease.[ How to reference and link to summary or text ]\nPancreatic - A study in 2004 showed that increases in dose and duration of aspirin may significantly increase the risk of pancreatic cancer in women (only women were in the study); however this did not seem to affect current, regular users. [36]\nUpper GI tract - A study published in 2003 reported that people who had been taking aspirin regularly for 5 or more years seemed to have a two-thirds less risk of mouth, throat and esophageal cancer than non-users. [37] This study was done on both cancer patients and other people in hospital for various reasons, and was done by comprehensive epidemiological questionnaires of life habits rather than empirical testing.\nLung - A 20-year study published in 2002 showed that in a group of 14,000 women in New York City, regular aspirin use (defined as at least once a week, various doses) reduced their risk of lung cancer, especially small-cell carcinoma. [38] This may be because many lung tumors have high amounts of COX-2 enzymes expressed in them, especially in adenocarcinomas and tumors caused by asbestosis . [39] Aspirin is a known blocker of both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, although this study suggests that if the COX-2 link is direct, other COX-2 inhibitors may also play a similar role.\nAnother study in 2002 of both men and women found that risk reduction was more significant in males than females; overall, the effects of smoking were far more influential than aspirin use in determining cancer risks. [40] Of those who smoked, those who smoked the least got the most benefit from aspirin use. Some of the heaviest smokers saw no benefit from aspirin at all.\nAspirin in pets\nEdit\nAspirin may be used in cats, but only under a veterinarian's strict supervision, as aspirin has a biological half-life of 3 days in cats (cats have trouble breaking down aspirin). Dogs may also use aspirin under a vet's strict supervision, though dogs are more susceptible to aspirin-caused GI bleeds than humans. Aspirin is generally not recommended for pets, though, as there are much safer alternatives for pain relief, and aspirin interacts with several other drugs including cortisones , digoxin , some antibiotics, phenobarbital and furosemide (Lasix).

Women may possibly benefit less from aspirin than men. [17] [18]\nStroke \u2014 as secondary prevention (i.e. to prevent recurrence)\nDosage\nEdit\nFor adults doses of 300 to 1000 mg are generally taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with a maximum dose of 8000 mg a day. [19] The correct dose of aspirin depends on the disease process that is being treated. For instance, for the treatment of rheumatic fever, doses near the maximal daily dose have been used historically. For the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, doses as low as 75 mg daily (or possibly even lower) are sufficient.\nFor those under 12 years of age, the dose previously varied with the age, but aspirin is no longer routinely used in children due to the association with Reye's syndrome ; paracetamol or other NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen , are now being used instead. Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children with aspirin initially started at 7.5-12.5 mg/kg body weight taken four times a day for up to two weeks and then continued at 5 mg/kg once daily for a further six to eight weeks. [20]\nDangers of low-dose aspirin\nEdit\nA recent review states: \"....low-dose aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding 2-fold compared with placebo. However, the annual incidence of major bleeding due to low-dose aspirin is modest\u2014only 1.3 patients per thousand higher than what is observed with placebo treatment. Treatment of approximately 800 patients with low-dose aspirin annually for cardiovascular prophylaxis will result in only 1 additional major bleeding episode.\" Further, \"...the cost to prevent one major GI bleeding episode from aspirin in 1 year by substituting clopidogrel therapy would be $1,216,180...\" [21]\nContraindications and warnings\nAspirin should be avoided by those known to be allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen .\nCaution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID -precipitated bronchospasm .\nIt is generally recommended that one seek medical help if symptoms do not improve after a few days of therapy.\nCaution should be taken in patients with kidney disease , peptic ulcers , mild diabetes , gout or gastritis ; manufacturers recommend talking to one's doctor before using this medicine.\nTaking aspirin with alcohol increases the chance of gastrointestinal hemorrhage (stomach bleeding).\nChildren, including teenagers, are discouraged from using aspirin in cold or flu symptoms as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome . [1]\nPatients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take salicylates.\nSome sources recommend that patients with hyperthyroidism avoid aspirin because it elevates T4 levels. [2]\nCommon side-effects\nEdit\nGastrointestinal complaints (stomach upset, dyspepsia , heartburn, small blood loss). To help avoid these problems, it is recommended that aspirin be taken at or after meals. Undetected blood loss may lead to hypochromic anemia . The Gastrointestinal complications that may result from a dose of Aspirin are due to Aspirin inhibitory action on Cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2.\nSevere gastrointestinal complaints (gross bleeding and/or ulceration), requiring discontinuation and immediate treatment. Patients receiving high doses and/or long-term treatment should receive gastric protection with high-dosed antacids, ranitidine or omeprazole .\nFrequently, central effects (dizziness, tinnitus , hearing loss, vertigo , centrally mediated vision disturbances, and headaches). The higher the daily dose is, the more likely it is that central nervous system side-effects will occur.\nSweating, seen with high doses, independent from antipyretic action\nLong-term treatment with high doses (arthritis and rheumatic fever): often increased liver enzymes without symptoms, rarely reversible liver damage. The potentially fatal Reye's syndrome may occur, if given to pediatric patients with fever and other signs of infections. The syndrome is due to fatty degeneration of liver cells. Up to 30 percent of those afflicted will eventually die. Prompt hospital treatment may be life-saving.\nChronic nephritis with long-term use, usually if used in combination with certain other painkillers. This condition may lead to chronic renal failure.\nProlonged and more severe bleeding after operations and post-traumatic for up to 10 days after the last aspirin dose. If one wishes to counteract the bleeding tendency, fresh thrombocyte concentrate will usually work.\nSkin reactions, angioedema , and bronchospasm have all been seen infrequently.\nPatients that have the genetic disease known as Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) should avoid this drug as it is known to cause hemolytic anemia in large doses depending on the severity of the disease.\nInteractions\nEdit\nAspirin can interact with some other drugs. Some drugs, for example those used for diabetes , are bound by plasma protein in the blood supply and are therefore not free to react with their targets. However, aspirin may displace them from plasma protein, leading to a drug overdose . Aspirin has this same effect on anticoagulants .\nOverdose\nEdit\nAspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, supratherapeutic doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. [22]\nSymptoms\nEdit\nAspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with mild intoxication frequently have nausea and vomiting , abdominal pain, lethargy, tinnitus , and dizziness . More significant symptoms occur in more severe poisonings and include hyperthermia , tachypnea , respiratory alkalosis , metabolic acidosis , hyperkalemia , hypoglycemia , hallucinations , confusion , seizure , cerebral edema , and coma . The most common cause of death following an aspirin overdose is cardiopulmonary arrest usually due to pulmonary edema . [23]\nToxicity\nEdit\nThe toxic dose of aspirin is generally considered greater than 150 mg per kg of body mass. Moderate toxicity occurs at doses up to 300 mg/kg, severe toxicity occurs between 300 to 500 mg/kg, and a potentially lethal dose is greater than 500 mg/kg. [24] This is the equivalent of many dozens of the common 325 mg tablets, depending on body weight. Note that children cannot tolerate as much aspirin per unit body weight as adults can, even when aspirin is indicated. Label-directions should be followed carefully.\nTreatment\nEdit\nAll overdose patients must be taken to a hospital immediately.\nInitial treatment of an acute overdose includes gastric decontamination of the patient. This is achieved by administering activated charcoal which adsorbs the aspirin in the gastrointestinal tract . Stomach pumps are no longer routinely used in the treatment of poisonings but are sometimes considered if the patient has ingested a potentially lethal amount up to 1 hour previously. [25] Repeated doses of charcoal have been proposed to be beneficial in aspirin overdose. [26] A study performed found that repeat dose charcoal might not be of significant value. [27] However, most toxicologists will administer additional charcoal if serum salicylate levels are increasing.\nPatients are monitored until their peak salicylate blood level has been determined. [28] Blood levels are usually performed 4 hours after ingestion and then every 2 hours after that to determine the maximum level. Maximum levels can be used as a guide to toxic effects expected. [29]\nThere is no antidote to salicylate poisoning. Frequent blood work is performed to check metabolic , salicylate , and blood sugar levels; arterial blood gas assessments are performed to test for respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis . Patients are monitored and often treated according to their individual symptoms, patients may be given intravenous potassium chloride to counteract hypokalemia , glucose to restore blood sugar levels, benzodiazepines for any seizure activity, fluids for dehydration , and importantly sodium bicarbonate to restore the blood's sensitive pH balance. Sodium bicarbonate also has the effect of increasing the pH of urine, which in turn increases the elimination of salicylate. Additionally, hemodialysis can be implemented to enhance the removal of salicylate from the blood. Hemodialysis is usually used in severely poisoned patients; for example, patients with significantly high salicylate blood levels, significant neurotoxicity (agitation, coma, convulsions), renal failure, pulmonary edema, or cardiovascular instability are hemodialyzed. [28] Hemodialysis also has the advantage of restoring electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities; hemodialysis is often life-saving in severely ill patients.\nIf the overdose was intentional, the patient should undergo psychiatric evaluation, as with any suicide attempt.\nEpidemiology\nEdit\nIn the later part of the 20th century the number of salicylate poisonings has declined mainly due to the popularity of other over-the-counter analgesics such as paracetamol . Fifty-two deaths involving single-ingredient aspirin were reported in the United States in the year 2000.

It isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. It most likely just means that your body is functioning the way it should. Now there are a few situations where a fever is something that you should worry about, like with newborns, children, and elderly people. This is especially true if the fever is accompanied by one of the symptoms from the list on the right. The rest of the article goes into greater detail about those situations.\nOne major threat posed by fevers is permanent brain damage caused by a very high fever. This is called hyperpyrexia, and it happens when your fever is over 106.7\u00ba F. But you should already be at the doctor when your fever goes over 103\u00ba F. And doctors can deal with fevers quite well. At home, fevers are more of a nuisance than a threat. The key is to get rest and stay hydrated. And if reducing a child's fever, it is absolutely necessary use ibuprofen, not aspirin. Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 18 years of age.\nFever Treatments\nFever in a newborn. A fever in a newborn is a rectal temperature of more than 100.4\u00ba F or an underarm (axillary) temperature over 98.6\u00ba F. Doctors used to recommend taking a newborn's temperature rectally and some might still, but call your doctor's office to find out. Ask them for directions, if they want a rectal temperature. Otherwise, if you're taking your newborn's temperature on your own, try taking it under their arm. There are thermometers available for purchase that are specifically made for taking underarm temperatures in newborns and children. Otherwise, use an oral thermometer\u2014place the thermometer in your baby's armpit and hold their arm down with the thermometer underneath until the reading is complete. Fevers are normally caused by infection, but occasionally in newborns, especially premature infants, an infection may not be the cause of a fever. Fevers in infants and newborns should always be treated by a doctor.\nFever in children. An oral temperature of 99.5\u00ba F or a rectal temperature of 100.4\u00ba F is considered a fever in children. Many children are capable of tolerating a fever. If the child is responsive, able to drink fluids, and wants to play, there probably isn't anything to worry about. If the child becomes listless, has a severe headache, has persistent vomiting, or has a fever that isn't responding to fever-reducing medication, see a doctor. Don't use aspirin to reduce a fever. It has been linked to Reye's syndrome. Fevers are serious business, so if you have any concerns about your child's well-being, call your doctor.\nCool down your body. The trick is to cool the body down without causing it to get the chills or go into shock. You may have seen people with fevers get ice baths in the movies, but that's an extreme circumstance. A more realistic approach would be to take a bath in water that is around 95\u00ba F. If the person begins to get the chills or shivers, stop the bath. Never put an infant in a cool bath. Their bodies are too small to handle the extreme temperature change. Otherwise, try a cool, wet cloth on the forehead, or an ice pack on the head, groin, or armpits.\nKeep your body hydrated. Ask a doctor what to do about a fever, and that doctor will most likely tell you to keep hydrated and get some rest. That is as long as the fever is under 103\u00ba F. If your fever gets above 103\u00ba F or if you have a fever for more than three days, see a doctor. If your fever hasn't reached either of these levels, drink water with electrolytes in it, along with soup broth, Gatorade, Sprite, and plain water too. Just don't drink more than a gallon of water in a day. That's too much water.\nTylenol and NSAIDs are fever reducers. The best fever reducer is without a doubt ibuprofen, which is an NSAID, which stands for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Other NSAIDs are naproxen sodium and ketoprofen. Aspirin and other salicylates also reduce fever but should never be taken by someone under the age of 18. Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, (brand name: Tylenol) reduces fever for some people but not all, like myself. Other drugs that reduce inflammation are metamizole, nabumetone, nimesulide, and phenazone. If you have any questions about whether or not reducing a fever is the right thing to do, read the next section.\nReducing Fevers vs. Letting Them Run Their Course\nI am not a doctor, but I think fevers should only be reduced when it is absolutely needed. A fever is your body doing what it's supposed to do. Our immune system functions much more efficiently at a warmer temperature. And when you have an infection, you want your immune system to function as best it can. In fact, you want to support it by drinking water and taking vitamins and supplements to give your body energy and materials to fight the infection.\nOn the other hand, a fever can be very difficult on a child and on us. And occasionally relieving a child's fever may give the child a chance to sleep, relax, or calm down. It may also give you some reprieve from the illness. But it really should only be done when absolutely needed because suppressing our immune systems will only keep ourselves sick longer. And no one wants that.\nFever Emergency\nTemperature of 101\u00ba F for 3 days\nNewborn temperature over 100.4\u00ba F\nFever accompanied by the following symptoms:\nSeizure\n"}], [{"score": 1298.7932, "uuid": "67086dfe-54f0-5b36-bc28-52094b2c7943", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0302wb-90-11598", "target_hostname": "www.uchicagokidshospital.org", "target_uri": "http://www.uchicagokidshospital.org/online-library/content=P02512", "page_rank": 1.1948685e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>Fevers</em> - Comer Children&#x27;s Hospital <em>at</em> the University of Chicago", "snippet": "<em>In</em> <em>children</em>, a <em>fever</em> that <em>is</em> equal to <em>or</em> greater than 102.2\u00b0 F should be treated. <em>Children</em> older than two months of age with a <em>fever</em> of 102\u00b0 <em>or</em> higher that does not respond to <em>fever</em>-<em>reducing</em> medication should be seen by a physician.", "explanation": null, "document": "disorders in the brain\nWhat are the benefits of a fever?\nA fever actually helps the body destroy its microbial invader.

The following are the most common symptoms of a fever. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. In addition to body temperature greater than 100.4\u00ba F, symptoms may include:\nYour child may not be as active or talkative as usual.\nHe/she may seem fussier, less hungry, and thirstier.\nYour child may feel warm or hot.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, if your child is younger than two months of age and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, you should call your pediatrician. If you are unsure, always consult your child's physician for a diagnosis.\nWhen should a fever be treated?\nIn children, a fever that is equal to or greater than 102.2\u00b0 F should be treated. Children older than two months of age with a fever of 102\u00b0 or higher that does not respond to fever-reducing medication should be seen by a physician. Children between the ages of 6 months and\u00a03 years can develop seizures from a high fever (called febrile seizures). If your child does have a febrile seizure, there is a chance that the seizure may occur again, but, usually, children outgrow the febrile seizures. A febrile seizure does not mean your child has epilepsy.\nIf your child is very uncomfortable with a lower fever, treatment may be necessary. Treating your child's fever will not help the body get rid of the infection any quicker, it simply will relieve discomfort associated with fever.\nWhat can I do to decrease my child's fever?\nSpecific treatment for a fever will be determined by your physician based on:\nAspirin and the Risk of Reye Syndrome in Children\nDo not give aspirin to a child without first contacting the child's physician. Aspirin, when given as treatment for children, has been associated with Reye syndrome, a potentially serious or deadly disorder in children.

[11] The most studied example is pain after surgery, such as tooth extraction, for which the highest allowed dose of aspirin (1 g) is equivalent to 1 g of paracetamol (acetaminophen), 60\u00a0mg of codeine , or 5\u00a0mg of oxycodone . A combination of aspirin and caffeine , in general, affords greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent aspirin alleviates pain much faster than aspirin in tablets (15\u201330 min vs. 45\u201360 min). [12]\nNevertheless, as a postsurgery painkiller, aspirin is inferior to ibuprofen and has higher gastrointestinal toxicity. The maximum dose of aspirin (1 g) provides weaker pain relief than an intermediate dose of ibuprofen (400\u00a0mg), and this relief does not last as long. [12] A combination of aspirin and codeine may have a slightly higher analgesic effect than aspirin alone; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful. [13] It appears ibuprofen is at least equally, and possibly more, effective than this combination. [14]\nAccording to a 1998 meta-analysis of clinical trials for menstrual pain , aspirin demonstrated higher efficacy than placebo, but lower than ibuprofen or naproxen , although maximum doses of aspirin were never used in these trials. The authors concluded ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio. [15]\nAspirin did not ease pain during cycling exercise, [16] while caffeine was very effective. [17] [18] Likewise, aspirin, codeine, or paracetamol was not better than placebo for muscle soreness after exercise. [19]\n[ edit ] Headache\nAspirin is a first-line drug in the treatment of migraine , bringing relief in 50\u201360% of the cases. [20] When used at a high dose of 1000\u00a0mg (as compared to 275\u2013325\u00a0mg when used as a pain killer or 81\u00a0mg as an antiplatelet therapy), no significant differences were seen as compared to triptan medication, sumatriptan (Imitrex) [21] and other painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) [22] or ibuprofen . [23] The combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine (as found in the OTC brand Excedrin ) is even more potent. For the treatment of migraine headache, this formulation works better than any of its three components taken separately, [22] better than ibuprofen [24] and better than sumatriptan. As with all other medications for migraine, it is recommended to take aspirin at the first signs of the headache, and it is the way these medications were used in the comparative clinical trials. [25]\nAspirin alleviates pain in 60\u201375% of patients with episodic tension headaches . [26] [27] It is equivalent to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in that respect, except for the higher frequency of gastrointestinal side-effects. [27] Comparative clinical trials indicated metamizole and ibuprofen may relieve pain faster than aspirin, although the difference becomes insignificant after about two hours. The addition of caffeine in a dose of 60\u2013130\u00a0mg to aspirin increases the analgesic effect in headache. [26] [28] The combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine is still more effective, but at the cost of more stomach discomfort, nervousness and dizziness. [29]\nThere is some evidence low-dose aspirin has benefit for reducing the occurrence of migraines in susceptible individuals. [30] [31] [32] [33]\n[ edit ] Prevention of heart attacks and strokes\nThere are two distinct uses of aspirin for prophylaxis of cardiovascular events: primary prevention and secondary prevention. Primary prevention is about decreasing strokes and heart attacks in the general population of those who have no diagnosed heart or vascular problems. Secondary prevention concerns patients with known cardiovascular disease . [34]\nLow doses of aspirin are recommended for the secondary prevention of strokes and heart attacks. For both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and ischaemic stroke by about a fifth.[ citation needed ] This translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.[ citation needed ] Although aspirin also raises the risk of hemorrhagic stroke and other major bleeds by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive. Thus, in secondary prevention trials, aspirin reduced the overall mortality by about a tenth. [34]\nFor persons without cardiovascular problems, the benefits of aspirin are unclear. In the primary prevention trials, aspirin decreased the overall incidence of heart attacks and ischaemic strokes by about a tenth. However, since these events were rare, the absolute reduction of their rate was low: from 0.57% to 0.51% per year. In addition, the risks of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding almost completely offset the benefits of aspirin. Thus, in the primary prevention trials, aspirin did not change the overall mortality rate. [34] Further trials are in progress [update] . [34]\nThe expert bodies diverge in their opinions regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention, such as can be accomplished by including aspirin in a polypill for the general population. The US Government Preventive Services Task Force recommended making individual, case by case choices based on the estimated future risk and patients' preferences. [35] [36] On the other hand, Antithrombotic Trialists\u2019 Collaboration argued such recommendations are unjustified, since the relative reduction of risk in the primary prevention trials of aspirin was same for persons in high- and low-risk groups and did not depend on the blood pressure. The Collaboration suggested statins as the alternative and more effective preventive medication. [34]\n[ edit ] Coronary and carotid arteries, bypasses and stents\nThe coronary arteries supply blood to the heart . Aspirin is recommended for one to six months after placement of stents in the coronary arteries and for years after a coronary artery bypass graft .\nThe carotid arteries supply blood to the brain . Patients with mild carotid artery stenosis benefit from aspirin; it is recommended after a carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stent.\nAfter vascular surgery of the lower legs using artificial grafts that are sutured to the arteries to improve blood supply, aspirin is used to keep the grafts open because it serves as type of blood thinner, reducing the likelihood of clots forming.\n[ edit ] Other uses\nAlthough aspirin has been used to combat fever and pains associated with common cold for more than 100 years, its efficacy in this role was only recently confirmed in controlled clinical trials on adults. One gram of aspirin, on average, reduced the oral body temperature from 39.0 \u00b0C (102.2\u00a0\u00b0F) to 37.6 \u00b0C (99.7\u00a0\u00b0F) after three hours. The relief began after 30 minutes, and after six hours, the temperature still remained below 37.8 \u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F). Aspirin also helped with \"achiness\", discomfort, and headache, [37] and with sore throat pain, for those who had it. [38] The effects of aspirin were indistinguishable from those obtained using paracetamol in any respect, except for, possibly, a slightly higher incidence of sweating and gastrointestinal side-effects. [37]\nFever and joint pain of acute rheumatic fever respond extremely well, often within three days, to high doses of aspirin. The therapy usually lasts for one to two weeks; and only in about 5% of the cases it has to continue for longer than six months. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin treatment is unnecessary, as it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. [39] In addition, the high doses of aspirin used caused liver toxicity in about 20% of the treated children, [40] [41] who are the majority of rheumatic fever patients, and increased the risk of their developing Reye's syndrome . [39] Naproxen was shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic; due to the limited clinical experience, however, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment. [39] [42]\nAlong with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children, although even this use has been questioned by some researchers. [43] In the United Kingdom, the only indications for aspirin use in children and adolescents under 16 are Kawasaki disease and prevention of blood clot formation.\nAspirin is also used in the treatment of pericarditis , coronary artery disease , and acute myocardial infarction . [44] [45] [46]\nTaking aspirin before air travel in cramped conditions has been suggested to decrease the risk of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). The reason for taking aspirin is the long period of sitting without exercise, not air travel itself. A large, randomized, controlled trial in 2000 of aspirin against placebo in 13,000 patients with hip fractures found \"a 29% relative risk reduction in DVT with 160 mg of aspirin taken daily for five weeks. Although there are obvious problems with extrapolating the data to long-distance travelers, this is the best evidence we could find to justify aspirin use\". [47]\n[ edit ] Experimental\nAspirin has been theorized to reduce cataract formation in diabetic patients, but one study showed it was ineffective for this purpose. [48] The role of aspirin in reducing the incidence of many forms of cancer has also been widely studied. In several studies, its use did not reduce the incidence of prostate cancer . [49] [50] Its effects on the incidence of pancreatic cancer are mixed; one study published in 2004 found a statistically significant increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer among women, [51] while a meta-analysis of several studies, published in 2006, found no evidence aspirin or other NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk for the disease. [52] The drug may be effective in reduction of risk of various cancers, including those of the colon , [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] lung , [59] [60] and possibly the upper GI tract, though some evidence of its effectiveness in preventing cancer of the upper GI tract has been inconclusive. [61] [61] [62] Its preventative effect against adenocarcinomas may be explained by its inhibition of PTGS2 (COX-2) enzymes expressed in them. [63]\nA 2009 article published by the Journal of Clinical Investigation suggested that aspirin might prevent liver damage. In their experiment, scientists from Yale University and The University of Iowa induced damage in certain liver cells ( hepatocytes ) using excessive doses of acetaminophen . This caused hepatoxicity and hepatocyte death, which triggered an increase in the production of TLR9 . The expression of TLR9 caused an inflammatory cascade involving pro\u2013IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 . Aspirin was found to have a protective effect on hepatocytes because it led to the \"downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines\". [64]\nIn another 2009 article published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, men and women who regularly took aspirin after colorectal cancer diagnosis were found to have lower risks of overall and colorectal cancer death compared to patients not using aspirin. [65]\nA 2010 article in the Journal of Clinical Oncology has suggested aspirin may reduce the risk of death from breast cancer. [66] While the information has been well-circulated by the media, [67] [68] official health bodies and medical groups have expressed concern over the touting of aspirin as a \"miracle drug\". [69]\nA 2010 study by Oxford University involving over 25000 patients showed taking a small (75\u00a0mg) daily dose of aspirin for between four and eight years substantially reduces death rates from a range of common cancers by at least a fifth and the reduction of risk continued for 20 years in both men and women. For specific cancers the, reduction was about 40% for bowel cancer , 30% for lung cancer , 10% for prostate cancer and 60% for oesophageal cancer , while the reductions in pancreas , stomach , brain , breast and ovarian cancers were difficult to quantify because there were not enough data, but other studies are in progress. However, taking aspirin doubles the annual risk of major internal bleeding that normally has a very low incidence (about 1 in 1000) in middle age, but increased dramatically after 75 years old. [70]\n[ edit ] Resistance\nFor some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men, [71] and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 patients found 28% to be resistant. [72] A study in 100 Italian patients found that, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others were noncompliant . [73]\n[ edit ] Dosage\nCoated 325\u00a0mg aspirin tablets\nAdult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300\u00a0mg in Britain and 325\u00a0mg in the USA. Smaller doses are based on these standards; e.g. 75- and 81-milligram tablets are used; there is no medical significance in the slight difference. It is of historical interest that in the U.S., a 325\u00a0mg dose is equivalent to the historic 5- grain aspirin tablet in use prior to the metric system.\nIn general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, [74] with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever. [75] For the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily. [74]\nNew recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF, March, 2009) on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45\u201379 and women aged 55\u201379 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. [76] The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81\u00a0mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. [76] Low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81\u00a0mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention. [76]\nIn children with Kawasaki disease , aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks. [77]\n[ edit ] Contraindications\nAspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen , [78] [79] or who have salicylate intolerance [80] [81] or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID -precipitated bronchospasm . Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers , mild diabetes , or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. [78] [82] Even if none of these conditions is present, there is still an increased risk of stomach bleeding when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin . [78] [79] Patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. [78] [82] Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), in particular in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. [83] Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. [84] People with kidney disease , hyperuricemia , or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid , and thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome . [6]\n[ edit ] Gastrointestinal\nAspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding . [85] Although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being \"gentle to the stomach\", in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk. [85] Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has also been shown to further increase this risk. [85] Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. [86]\nIn addition to enteric coating, \"buffering\" is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses MgO. Other preparations use CaCO3. [87]\nTaking it with vitamin C is a more recently investigated method of protecting the stomach lining. According to research done at a German university, taking equal doses of vitamin C and aspirin decreases the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone. [88] [89]\nIt is reported that deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), an extract of the popular herb licorice, helps relieve the symptoms of gastritis. In a 1979 research study, a dose of 350 milligrams of DGL was shown to decrease the amount of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by three adult-strength aspirin tablets (750 milligrams). [90]\nA dose of 500 milligrams of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe, an amino acid naturally formed in the body) given together with a large dose of aspirin (1300 milligrams) in a research study reduced the amount of stomach damage by 90 percent. [91]\nA study found that, in contrast to oral aspirin, intravenous injection of aspirin did not produce detectable histological damage or significantly alter gastric mucosal potential difference, and concluded that high blood levels of circulating salicylate did not acutely damage gastric mucosa, so that gastric mucosal damage produced acutely after single oral doses of aspirin are due to its topical , rather than systemic, action. [92]\n[ edit ] Central effects\nLarge doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, have been proposed to cause tinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade. [93]\nMain article: Reye's syndrome\nReye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver , can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in under-18 patients were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection , chickenpox , or diarrhea . Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. [94] After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General 's warning and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. [94] The United States Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, [6] and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor. [95]\n[ edit ] Hives and swelling\nFor a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms that resemble an allergic reaction, including hives , swelling and headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy , but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose .\n[ edit ] Other effects\nAspirin can induce angioedema (swelling of skin tissues) in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients participating in the study. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared. [96]\nAspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on MRI scans of 5\u201310\u00a0mm or smaller hypointense (dark holes) patches. [97] [98] Such cerebral microbleeds are important since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage , Binswanger disease and Alzheimer's disease .[ original research? ]\nA study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated that there was an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10.000 persons. [99] In comparison, there was an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per 10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic stroke. [99] In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH of approximately 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6). [100]\nAspirin and other NSAIDs can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state. [101]\nAspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 elective surgical patients required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients.

There is no single value that defines fever though there are some generally accepted guidelines:\nOral temperature above 99.5\u00baF\nAxillary (armpit) temperature above 99\u00baF\nRectal temperature above 100.4\u00baF\nTo regulate the immune, inflammatory and hematopoietic (blood forming) responses, our body releases proteins (cytokines) from cells in our blood or tissues.\u00a0 Once released, cytokines enter our blood and are carried to our brain where they raise the set-point for body temperature - much like turning up a thermostat.\u00a0 Now the body registers the temperature too low, and makes the body generate more heat until it reaches the new set-point.\nFever Fights Infection\nFever is an important part of the body's inflammatory response, which helps fight infection.\nEvery time you reduce your child\u2019s fever, it\u2019s like knocking them off their feet.\nThey stand back up (mounting their beneficial fever to fight infection),\nand then you reduce their fever and knock them off their feet again\n(preventing their immune system from doing its job).\nStudies have demonstrated that using fever reducers in children prolongs their symptoms (e.g runny nose, etc.).[1,2]\u00a0 Fever in the range of 104\u00baF makes it difficult for some bacteria and viruses to survive, which helps the immune system fight the infection as well.\u00a0 If the body\u2019s temperature is too high, these same benefits are not seen.\u00a0 This magic body temperature is not known, though some studies have shown the benefits of fever are reduced when the fever is over 104\u00baF.[3] An analogy would be a friend helping you with a task.\u00a0 If the friend helps too much and goes into overdrive, her help becomes a hindrance.\nWhy Do Most Doctors Recommend Reducing a Fever?\nFever can be uncomfortable, since it is often associated with increased heart rate, sore muscles/joints, and sleepiness.\u00a0 Fever also increases the metabolic rate, which places increased demands on the heart and lungs.\u00a0 For the normal child, this is NOT a problem.\u00a0 For children with heart or lung abnormalities, the stress of fever can offset the benefit of fever to the immune system.\u00a0 In some susceptible children between 6 months to 5 years of age, fever can also cause seizures.\u00a0 Seizures associated with fever, called febrile seizures, are not known to cause any permanent brain damage, though obviously can be disturbing to see. Interestingly, treating at fever onset for those with a history of febrile seizure does NOT affect the recurrence rate of febrile seizures, though this practice is often still recommended.

In fact, this little pill found in just about every medicine cabinet across the world was discovered way back in 1853, but not used medicinally until 1897 first as a powder, then introduced as that little white pill we all are so familiar with in 1915. Despite its long standing years of use, there are some serious health complications that can result from taking aspirin.\nThere are three main reasons that people take aspirins regularly:\n\u2022Pain reliever & inflammation reducer\n\u2022Heart attack & stroke prevention\n\u2022Fever reducer\nWhen a person takes aspirin for one of these conditions there see the pain relieving benefits. But you must know that you can gain the same type of benefits with using different therapies other than aspirin which can in the long run do more harm than good.\nIf you take (or are considering taking) an aspirin a day for heart attack prevention or to deal with painful inflammation, there are a few facts you\u2019ll want to consider first. Then carefully consider all of your options as there are safe, all natural replacements for taking aspirin for many conditions.\nUnderstanding the Common Physical Problems Associated with Aspirin\nRemember when I speak of these problems from taking aspirin I\u2019m not talking about a very occasional aspirin, it\u2019s the long term use that\u2019s a potential problem (unless you have an aspirin allergy, in which case you should obviously avoid aspirin altogether).\nThere are some people who are more susceptible to complications from aspirins and they should carefully consider any use of aspirin. These people fall into the following categories:\n\u2022Heart failure\n\u2022Stomach ulcers\n\u2022Bleeding or clotting disorders\n\u2022Diabetes (the American Diabetes Association advises people with diabetes take only the very lowest dosage of aspirin)\nEven if you don\u2019t fall under one of the above categories, taking aspirin regularly can cause some serious health concerns you must know about.\n6 Health Problems Associated with Aspirin\nKidney failure\nAccording to many sources, including the Mayo Clinic, damage to the kidney from regular aspirin use, called analgesic nephropathy, can occur. Many times this chronic kidney disease exists without immediate symptoms and leads to deadly kidney failure or the need for daily kidney dialysis.\nLiver failure\nThe liver absorbs aspirin with regular use, leading to liver failure\u2013a serious problem for all. The liver is your body\u2019s detoxification system. When toxins are continually put into the body, toxic overload can cause the liver to fail.\nUlcers\nAccording to the American College of Gastroenterology, the second leading cause of ulcers is from the regular use of aspirin leading to irritation of the stomach lining. Regular use of aspirin when an ulcer exists can lead to further complications including bleeding ulcers and perforated ulcers.\nTinnitus\nThis annoying \u2018ringing in the ears\u2019 problem can not just be caused by regular use of aspirin, it can actually lead to permanent hearing damage. However in most cases the solution is to simply stop using aspirin and the condition reverses itself.\nHemorrhagic stroke\nAs you know many people take daily aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke by keeping the blood thin. The problem here is that in some cases this seemingly \u2018innocent\u2019 aspirin may end up doing more harm than good. In some strokes the cause is bleeding in the brain, in which case the blood-thinning aspirin only exacerbates the problem, potentially leading to permanent brain damage or death.\nReye\u2019s syndrome\nThis deadly condition occurs swiftly, delivering deadly blows to children as it damages the vital organs, especially the brain and liver. The cause of Reye\u2019s syndrome in most cases is a child with a viral infection, such as chicken pox, taking aspirin for fever reduction and pain relief. It\u2019s vital that all parents avoid giving their children aspirin for this reason.\nAs you can see the health complications that are associated with regular aspirin consumption are very serious and not to be taken lightly. Of course I\u2019m not suggesting you suffer with pain or risk heart attacks. There are far better ways to take care of those things. What I am asking you to do is consider your own personal risk for serious side effects from aspirin, then explore alternative treatment options that are much better for your body.\nSafe, Effective Alternatives to Aspirin\nDepending on the reason you take aspirin, you can find safe alternatives. However, it\u2019s vital that you first consult with your health care practitioner to be sure that none of the other medications you may be taking will interact in an adverse way with the all natural therapies.\nAnti-inflammatory Diet\nAn anti-inflammatory diet [1] is the one of the best ways to reduce unhealthy, painful inflammation in the body. When you follow a diet based on eating lots of fish, nuts, fruits, vegetables, beans, and healthy oils like olive and coconut oils you\u2019ll not only reduce inflammation in the body, but this can also lead to a reduced risk of heart disease.\nGinger\nAdding this little root to your daily diet can really help to not just fight nausea but also ward off inflammation. Ginger has been a common staple in Asian, Indian, and Arabic healing therapies to treat inflammation associated with arthritis and ulcerative colitis for years. You can take ginger in it\u2019s whole form, capsule form, or as a tea.\nTurmeric\nTurmeric, also known as curcumin, is a common ingredient in many dishes. This spice also has been used for thousands of years to fight inflammation. Add a bit to your eggs, soup, salad dressings, pasta sauces and more. This spice not only reduces inflammation but aides in digestion. Add a bit of cayenne pepper to help your body make the most of the turmeric.\nMSM\nThis compound with the official name methyl sulfonyl methane combats inflammation with sulfur. Found naturally in cow\u2019s milk, fruits and veggies, as well as meat and seafood, MSM works by adding sulfur to the body which in turn strengthens vital collagen. MSM is available in tablets, capsules, and creams for topical application.\nBromelain\nOne of the most commonly sold German supplements, this enzyme found in pineapples is often used to treat inflammation in conditions such as arthritis. It is sold in tablet form and also at the grocery store as a meat tenderizer.\nWobenzym N\nThis is a commonly used over the counter all natural supplement effective in treating inflammation and related conditions. This powerful combination of plant enzymes, antioxidants, and pancreatic enzymes encourages and supports the body\u2019s own inflammation response. You can read more about Wobenzym N here [2].\nIf you are taking or thinking about taking aspirin on a regular basis I hope you\u2019ve now thought again. The side effects of regular aspirin consumption far outweigh the benefits. Consider any one of these all natural therapies after consulting with your health care practitioner to avoid possible drug interactions.\nIt\u2019s your life, your body, and your choice. Make it an informed one!\nSources\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology (2010) [3]\nMayo Clinic (2010) [4]\nNational Institutes of Health (1996) [5]\nUniversity of Maryland (2008) [6]\n"}, {"score": 1229.1924, "uuid": "fc1e2707-f90a-56aa-8bd2-4d1d5871df39", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1010wb-03-04295", "target_hostname": "www.doctorwascher.com", "target_uri": "http://www.doctorwascher.com/category/aspirin", "page_rank": 1.1905178e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "<em>Aspirin</em> | Weekly Health Update", "snippet": "The findings of this important study suggest that the humble <em>aspirin</em> tablet may significantly reduce the risk of developing <em>what</em> <em>is</em> arguably the most lethal of all cancers (<em>in</em> addition to <em>reducing</em> the risk of colorectal cancer and, potentially, other cancers as well).", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1226.0579, "uuid": "88ce7b07-26f6-59df-a998-3f265c62bd34", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0305wb-43-18601", "target_hostname": "www.uthealthleader.org", "target_uri": "http://www.uthealthleader.org/archive/Medication_Health/2005/aspirin-0615.html", "page_rank": 1.2674967e-09, "spam_rank": 95, "title": "Health Leader, <em>Aspirin</em>: a humble miracle worker", "snippet": "And, <em>in</em> light of recent concerns over cousin-drugs like <em>ibuprofen</em> and naproxen and the outright removal of Vioxx and Bextra from the market, the humble little <em>aspirin</em> <em>is</em> enjoying renewed attention.

Can a drug that\u2019s been around for thousands of years really be as good as\u2014and safer than\u2014newer prescription medications?\n\u201cI am still captivated by aspirin. I have been since I was a kid and it was just for reducing fever then,\u201d says Dr. Lenard M. Lichtenberger, professor in the Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology at The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston. Lichtenberger has spent much of his career studying aspirin. \u201cI believe that aspirin deserves all the credit that it receives.\u201d\nBarking Up the Right Tree\nHipprocates, the father of modern medicine, used ground willow tree bark to ease aches and pains way back in the fifth century. Willow bark contains the chemical salicin, or salicylic acid.\nBy the late 1800s, salicylic acid became the standard drug to treat arthritis. However, it was very harsh and irritated the stomach. Felix Hoffmann, a German chemist with Friedrich Bayer and Company, synthesized acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in 1897 as a treatment for his father's arthritis. The synthesized form of the drug didn\u2019t hurt the stomach as much and was better at treating pain. By 1899, The Bayer Company was providing aspirin to physicians to give to their patients.\nWhy Aspirin Works\nAfter all these years, experts still are not exactly sure how it works. The most widely accepted theory is that aspirin helps reduce the level of chemicals in the blood called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause pain by stimulating the muscles to contract and blood vessels to dilate. Aspirin stops the prostaglandins from forming by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 or COX-2. Aspirin is the first known COX-2 inhibitor, and the first of a class of drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s).\nThe downside is that aspirin also blocks the COX-1 enzyme which helps protects the lining of the stomach. As a result, aspirin can increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.\nOver the past few decades, researchers have developed new NSAIDS. General NSAIDS like ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) block both COX-1 and COX-2 and are available over the counter. To better protect the stomach, even more targeted NSAIDS, called COX-2 inhibitors were developed to block only the COX-2 enzyme. But two of these drugs, Vioxx and Bextra were taken off the market earlier this year because of increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) is a separate class of pain relievers and fever reducers, and is gentler on the stomach than NSAIDS but boasts no anti-inflammatory properties.\nHeart Disease and Aspirin\nBecause aspirin is so safe, doctors say taking it daily or every other day is an easy way for most people older than age 40 to protect their hearts. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men age 40 and older, women who are past menopause and younger people with risk factors for heart attack or stroke, such as diabetes or smoking, discuss aspirin therapy with their doctors.\n\u201cAspirin is very inexpensive, it not only relieves pain and fever but has an anti- inflammatory effect,\u201d says cardiologist Dr. Samuel W. Casscells, the John Edward Tyson Distinguished Professor of Medicine at the UT Houston Medical School. \u201cAspirin and aspirin only prevents blood clots. Aspirin\u2019s cousins, such as NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors, don\u2019t prevent blood clots.\u201d\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in 1985 the use of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in patients who had either suffered a previous heart attack or suffered from unstable angina. The decision was based on evidence that aspirin reduced the risk of a second heart attack by 20 percent. For patients suffering from unstable angina, the risk of a heart attack decreased by 51 percent.\nThe most effective dosage of aspirin is still a matter of contention, although most doctors recommend the lowest dose possible to minimize side effects. Doses range from one-quarter of a baby aspirin to full adult doses, depending on its medical purpose and your doctor\u2019s recommendations.\nAspirin\u2019s role in preventing heart attacks has not been studied as much in women. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative, a randomized study of 40,000 women between the ages of 45 and 65, found that low dose aspirin did not prevent first heart attacks or cardiovascular events in the total group of women studied.\nHowever, for women older than 65 in the study, aspirin reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 26 percent.\nStroke and Aspirin\nAspirin has also been shown to help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (a result of a clot blocking an artery in the brain) which is also the most common kind of stroke. And in some cases, aspirin may work better at preventing stroke in high-risk patients than more sophisticated anti-clotting drugs.\n\u201cPeople at risk of developing ischemic strokes should consider aspirin instead of warfarin, a common anti-clot drug,\u201d says Dr. James Grotta, professor of neurology at the medical school and director of the stroke program at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\nIn a study of 569 people, patients on warfarin (Coumadin), suffered a higher death rate and had more bleeding compared to those who took aspirin. Results of the study appeared in the March 31 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\nAspirin reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in women who took low-dose aspirin by 24 percent, according to the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study. It also has shown some promise in preventing a variety of diseases and health conditions ranging from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to colon cancer.\nNot for Everyone\nAspirin is not without some risks.\nBecause it increases risk for stomach bleeding, consult your doctor before taking aspirin therapy if you have an ulcer. Your doctor may also prescribe a medicine to counteract acid in the stomach.\nPeople with certain clotting deficiencies should not take aspirin.\nChildren under age 18 should not be given aspirin to treat viral infections because of its link to the deadly condition known as Reye's Syndrome. Always consult your doctor, first.\nDon\u2019t take aspirin if you have an aspirin allergy or a history of uncontrolled high blood pressure.\nWhile aspirin is often recommended to treat a heart attack until the patient can get medical help, don\u2019t take aspirin to treat a stroke.\n\u201cIf you think you are having a stroke call 9-1-1, don\u2019t take an aspirin,\u201d Grotta says. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain and aspirin may make it worse, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take aspirin until you know it is not a bleeding stroke.\u201d\nThe bottom line? Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of aspirin and any risk factors you may have before starting aspirin therapy.\nImproving a Miracle\nWhile researchers continue to uncover new ways to use aspirin, others are working hard to improve it. Lichtenberger has developed a patented process that binds aspirin with phosphatidylcholine (PC), a purified form of lecithin derived from soybeans. The PC-aspirin protects the lining of the stomach. But unlike currently used enteric coatings, it is easily dissolved, allowing the aspirin to cross into the bloodstream more quickly.\n\u201cEvery few months I get surprised by another new application for aspirin,\u201d Lichtenberger says. \u201cBut I think another area of interest that we are pursuing is reducing the side effects of aspirin and getting a much better understanding of NSAIDS and how they act, with the hope that we can further improve the drug\u2019s cardioprotective actions.\u201d\nHe hopes protecting the stomach may make aspirin a more palatable option for people prone to gastrointestinal bleeds, but also at high risk for heart attack. Such a development would be more than welcome by doctors like Casscells, looking for a safe and effective drug to prescribe their patients.\n\u201cAspirin is still a miracle drug,\u201d Casscells says. \u201cNumber one: the other more expensive drugs don\u2019t prevent blood clots. Number two: we\u2019ve had it for 100 years, and it is a natural compound from tree bark. These reasons give you great comfort when prescribing aspirin.\u201d\nLast Updated: 6-15-2005\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), the most comprehensive academic health center in The UT System and the U.S. Gulf Coast region, is home to schools of biomedical informatics, biomedical sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing and public health.

Can a drug that\u2019s been around for thousands of years really be as good as\u2014and safer than\u2014newer prescription medications?\n\u201cI am still captivated by aspirin. I have been since I was a kid and it was just for reducing fever then,\u201d says Dr. Lenard M. Lichtenberger, professor in the Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology at The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston. Lichtenberger has spent much of his career studying aspirin. \u201cI believe that aspirin deserves all the credit that it receives.\u201d\nBarking Up the Right Tree\nHipprocates, the father of modern medicine, used ground willow tree bark to ease aches and pains way back in the fifth century. Willow bark contains the chemical salicin, or salicylic acid.\nBy the late 1800s, salicylic acid became the standard drug to treat arthritis. However, it was very harsh and irritated the stomach. Felix Hoffmann, a German chemist with Friedrich Bayer and Company, synthesized acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in 1897 as a treatment for his father's arthritis. The synthesized form of the drug didn\u2019t hurt the stomach as much and was better at treating pain. By 1899, The Bayer Company was providing aspirin to physicians to give to their patients.\nWhy Aspirin Works\nAfter all these years, experts still are not exactly sure how it works. The most widely accepted theory is that aspirin helps reduce the level of chemicals in the blood called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause pain by stimulating the muscles to contract and blood vessels to dilate. Aspirin stops the prostaglandins from forming by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 or COX-2. Aspirin is the first known COX-2 inhibitor, and the first of a class of drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s).\nThe downside is that aspirin also blocks the COX-1 enzyme which helps protects the lining of the stomach. As a result, aspirin can increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.\nOver the past few decades, researchers have developed new NSAIDS. General NSAIDS like ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) block both COX-1 and COX-2 and are available over the counter. To better protect the stomach, even more targeted NSAIDS, called COX-2 inhibitors were developed to block only the COX-2 enzyme. But two of these drugs, Vioxx and Bextra were taken off the market earlier this year because of increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) is a separate class of pain relievers and fever reducers, and is gentler on the stomach than NSAIDS but boasts no anti-inflammatory properties.\nHeart Disease and Aspirin\nBecause aspirin is so safe, doctors say taking it daily or every other day is an easy way for most people older than age 40 to protect their hearts. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men age 40 and older, women who are past menopause and younger people with risk factors for heart attack or stroke, such as diabetes or smoking, discuss aspirin therapy with their doctors.\n\u201cAspirin is very inexpensive, it not only relieves pain and fever but has an anti- inflammatory effect,\u201d says cardiologist Dr. Samuel W. Casscells, the John Edward Tyson Distinguished Professor of Medicine at the UT Houston Medical School. \u201cAspirin and aspirin only prevents blood clots. Aspirin\u2019s cousins, such as NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors, don\u2019t prevent blood clots.\u201d\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in 1985 the use of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in patients who had either suffered a previous heart attack or suffered from unstable angina. The decision was based on evidence that aspirin reduced the risk of a second heart attack by 20 percent. For patients suffering from unstable angina, the risk of a heart attack decreased by 51 percent.\nThe most effective dosage of aspirin is still a matter of contention, although most doctors recommend the lowest dose possible to minimize side effects. Doses range from one-quarter of a baby aspirin to full adult doses, depending on its medical purpose and your doctor\u2019s recommendations.\nAspirin\u2019s role in preventing heart attacks has not been studied as much in women. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative, a randomized study of 40,000 women between the ages of 45 and 65, found that low dose aspirin did not prevent first heart attacks or cardiovascular events in the total group of women studied.\nHowever, for women older than 65 in the study, aspirin reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 26 percent.\nStroke and Aspirin\nAspirin has also been shown to help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (a result of a clot blocking an artery in the brain) which is also the most common kind of stroke. And in some cases, aspirin may work better at preventing stroke in high-risk patients than more sophisticated anti-clotting drugs.\n\u201cPeople at risk of developing ischemic strokes should consider aspirin instead of warfarin, a common anti-clot drug,\u201d says Dr. James Grotta, professor of neurology at the medical school and director of the stroke program at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\nIn a study of 569 people, patients on warfarin (Coumadin), suffered a higher death rate and had more bleeding compared to those who took aspirin. Results of the study appeared in the March 31 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\nAspirin reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in women who took low-dose aspirin by 24 percent, according to the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study. It also has shown some promise in preventing a variety of diseases and health conditions ranging from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to colon cancer.\nNot for Everyone\nAspirin is not without some risks.\nBecause it increases risk for stomach bleeding, consult your doctor before taking aspirin therapy if you have an ulcer. Your doctor may also prescribe a medicine to counteract acid in the stomach.\nPeople with certain clotting deficiencies should not take aspirin.\nChildren under age 18 should not be given aspirin to treat viral infections because of its link to the deadly condition known as Reye's Syndrome. Always consult your doctor, first.\nDon\u2019t take aspirin if you have an aspirin allergy or a history of uncontrolled high blood pressure.\nWhile aspirin is often recommended to treat a heart attack until the patient can get medical help, don\u2019t take aspirin to treat a stroke.\n\u201cIf you think you are having a stroke call 9-1-1, don\u2019t take an aspirin,\u201d Grotta says. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain and aspirin may make it worse, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take aspirin until you know it is not a bleeding stroke.\u201d\nThe bottom line? Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of aspirin and any risk factors you may have before starting aspirin therapy.\nImproving a Miracle\nWhile researchers continue to uncover new ways to use aspirin, others are working hard to improve it. Lichtenberger has developed a patented process that binds aspirin with phosphatidylcholine (PC), a purified form of lecithin derived from soybeans. The PC-aspirin protects the lining of the stomach. But unlike currently used enteric coatings, it is easily dissolved, allowing the aspirin to cross into the bloodstream more quickly.\n\u201cEvery few months I get surprised by another new application for aspirin,\u201d Lichtenberger says. \u201cBut I think another area of interest that we are pursuing is reducing the side effects of aspirin and getting a much better understanding of NSAIDS and how they act, with the hope that we can further improve the drug\u2019s cardioprotective actions.\u201d\nHe hopes protecting the stomach may make aspirin a more palatable option for people prone to gastrointestinal bleeds, but also at high risk for heart attack. Such a development would be more than welcome by doctors like Casscells, looking for a safe and effective drug to prescribe their patients.\n\u201cAspirin is still a miracle drug,\u201d Casscells says. \u201cNumber one: the other more expensive drugs don\u2019t prevent blood clots. Number two: we\u2019ve had it for 100 years, and it is a natural compound from tree bark. These reasons give you great comfort when prescribing aspirin.\u201d\nLast Updated: 6-15-2005\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), the most comprehensive academic health center in The UT System and the U.S. Gulf Coast region, is home to schools of biomedical informatics, biomedical sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing and public health.

Search:\n~ Newly Discovered Benefits of Aspirin\nAspirin - Remarkable Research Uncovers Lifesaving Benefits Beyond Cardiovascular Protection\nLife Extension, always at the forefront in uncovering the latest scientific and medical breakthroughs for our members, recommended aspirin therapy for cardiovascular protection long before this practice became a standard treatment by cardiologists and other doctors. Life Extension continues to closely scrutinize ongoing scientific research associated with aspirin. Recently, scientists have uncovered tantalizing evidence suggesting that aspirin may help prevent skin cancer and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe common thread linking aspirin\u0092s beneficial effects on colorectal cancer, skin cancer, and Alzheimer's appears to be its remarkable ability to reduce excess inflammation and promote healthy blood flow. Today, medical science is confirming what Life Extension has known for some time \u0097 that chronic inflammation underlies many of the most lethal degenerative diseases.\nCells throughout the body manufacture hormone-like substances called prostaglandins, which are involved in fever, inflammation, and pain, as well as thromboxanes, which help regulate blood vessel tone, platelet aggregation, and clot formation.1,2\nThe fatty acid arachidonic acid is transformed into prostaglandins and thromboxanes through the action of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Aspirin works by irreversibly disabling the COX enzymes so that they can no longer produce prosta-glandins and thromboxanes.3-5\nBy reducing prostaglandin and thromboxane production, aspirin decreases inflammation, pain, fever, and blood clotting. As people grow older, they commonly experience increased inflammation as well as a greater prevalence of undesirable blood-clotting tendencies. Scientists believe that increased oxidative stress and greater levels of pro-inflammatory mediators may induce these changes in aging adults.6,7 Aspirin\u0092s demonstrated ability to reduce inflammation may play a key role in helping to counteract many of the adverse biochemical changes that accompany aging. These very same properties also make aspirin a powerful weapon against many major diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.\nHOW ASPIRIN DIFFERS FROM OTHER NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS)\nAspirin is perhaps the best-known member of the family of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for the production of hormone-like biochemicals called prostaglandins and thromboxanes.\nThe COX-1 enzyme produces thromboxanes that support platelet function and prostaglandins that protect the stomach lining. By contrast, the COX-2 enzyme produces prostaglandins that may contribute to inflammation and cancer. Agents that inhibit the COX-2 enzyme may help protect against certain cancers.8-10\nBecause it inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, aspirin is considered a non-specific NSAID. Other non-specific NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and indomethacin. However, aspirin is distinct from these other non-specific NSAIDs because its inhibition of the COX enzymes is irreversible. This may make aspirin particularly beneficial for inhibiting undesirable blood clotting that can contribute to heart attack and stroke. Aspirin\u2019s ability to block the COX-2 enzyme may help protect against certain cancers. Side effects associated with non-specific NSAIDs like aspirin include stomach irritation and increased bleeding tendency.8-10\nSelective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae), make up another class of NSAID drugs. COX-2 inhibitors were initially hailed as breakthrough drugs for treating conditions such as arthritis, because they reduce inflammation while producing fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the non-specific NSAIDs. However, alarming research in recent years has shown that while some selective COX-2 inhibitors may lower the risk for certain cancers, they also may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.8-10 (See \u201cArthritis After Vioxx\u00ae,\u201d Life Extension, February 2005.)\nThese startling research findings concerning the potential cardiovascular risks of selective COX-2 inhibitors have shifted the spotlight back to aspirin, a potent therapeutic that both inhibits inflammation and provides protection against cardiovascular events.\nAspirin and Cancer Prevention\nLife Extension has long warned that chronic inflammation can pave the way for many deadly diseases, including cancer. Inflammation plays many roles in encouraging normal cells to become cancerous. For example, inflammation generates free radicals that can damage the genetic material responsible for regulating normal cell death and reproduction.11 While the bulk of the research examining aspirin\u0092s effects against cancer has focused on colorectal cancer, emerging evidence indicates that aspirin may also markedly reduce the risk of cancers of the skin, breast, ovary, lung, and other organs.12\nAspirin offers protection against cancer through its effects on the COX enzymes. While the COX-1 enzyme promotes blood clotting and helps protect the stomach lining, COX-2 participates in harmful inflammation and cancer. Aspirin inhibits both types of COX enzymes, which may account for its protective effects against various cancers.12 Life Extension has long advocated the use of anti-inflammatory therapies, including natural therapeutics such as curcumin and green tea, as strategies to help prevent and fight cancer.13\nAspirin lowers skin cancer risk. A recent study out of sun-drenched Australia offers compelling evidence that aspirin use protects against skin cancer. This study found that people who regularly used aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were less likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (a pre-cancerous skin condition linked to excessive sun exposure). The lead investigator reported that people who had used aspirin or other NSAIDs at least twice a week for five years reduced their risk of skin cancer by a remarkable 60%, while those who used aspirin daily for five years saw an astounding decrease of nearly 90% in their risk of developing skin cancer. The benefits from regular use of NSAIDs were evident after as little as one year of use, according to the study authors.14,15\nAspirin reduces breast cancer risk. Aspirin may offer protection against two cancers that afflict women: breast cancer and ovarian cancer. A study reported in late 2005 noted that women who used more than 100 mg of aspirin on a frequent basis (for 90 days or more) during the year prior to mammogram testing had a lower risk of breast cancer than infrequent users or non-users of aspirin.16 In 2006, researchers reported the findings of a population-based, case-controlled study of women with ovarian cancer. They noted that women who used any NSAIDs such as aspirin within the previous five years had a reduced risk of developing ovarian cancer. Their data suggests that greater use of NSAIDs correlates with a lower risk of ovarian cancer.17\nAspirin protects against colon cancer. In a double-blind study reported in 2003, researchers gave groups of more than 350 adults a daily dose of either 81 or 325 mg of aspirin, or a placebo pill, for three years. All the subjects had had colon polyps removed in the past, but were free of polyps at the study\u0092s onset. Many colon cancers are thought to develop from polyps. After approximately three years, the subjects underwent another colonoscopy to determine how many growths were present. Subjects who took the 81-mg dose of aspirin had 19% fewer polyps than those in the placebo group. The researchers concluded that low-dose aspirin had a modest effect in reducing the incidence of potentially pre-cancerous polyps.18\nAnother study examined 635 patients with a history of colorectal cancer. Half took 325 mg of aspirin a day, while half took a placebo. After roughly a year, each group underwent a colonoscopy to check for polyps. The results were even more impressive: subjects in the aspirin group had a 35% lower risk of polyps than those who took placebo. In addition, it took longer for polyps to develop in the subjects who took aspirin.19 These findings suggest an important role for aspirin in preventing colon cancer.\nAspirin and Alzheimer's Disease\nAlzheimer's disease not only changes people\u0092s mental abilities, but also alters the physical appearance of their brains. In people who have Alzheimer's, the brain tissue literally shrinks.20\nThis condition is also marked by scattered, abnormal structures called beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease, beta-amyloid plaques are found around the cerebral cortex, as well as in a structure deeper in the brain called the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory storage. Neurofibrillary tangles are found inside the neurons, where they can cause the neuron to have difficulty communicating with other neurons, and later to die. Although many healthy older people have some plaques and tangles in their brains, people with Alzheimer's disease have far more. Substances involved in inflammation have been found in these plaques, and scientists suspect this inflammation contributes to neuronal death.21\nOne potentially dangerous substance that has been found in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers is the COX-2 enzyme. Some research has shown a link between excess COX enzymes and prostaglandins with more beta-amyloid in brains. Elevated COX-2 has also been found in hippocampal neurons of people with Alzheimer's, and has been correlated with the withering of neurons and more dense plaques in that region of the brain.22\nAnother theory suggests that prostaglandins produced by the COX enzymes may also increase the effects of a neurotransmitter called glutamate. Neurotransmitters such as glutamate help nerve cells communicate. If too much glutamate lingers in the space between neurons, it can overstimulate the cells, causing them to die. Researchers have proposed that inhibiting the COX enzymes and thus reducing prostaglandins could reduce the excess stimulation caused by glutamate, thus protecting cells against inflammation and neurodegenerative disease.23-25\nRegular use of anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly aspirin, has been associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, along with improved preservation of cognitive function. For example, a meta-analysis examined the use of NSAIDs in relation to the development of Alzheimer's disease in adults over the age of 55. Individuals who regularly used anti-inflammatory drugs had a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's, and the risk reduction increased as the duration of anti-inflammatory use lengthened. People who used the anti-inflammatory medications for 24 months, for example, had an amazing 73% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's.26 An analysis of more than 700 individuals over the age of 80 showed that those who regularly used aspirin had a markedly lower prevalence of Alzheimer's dementia. Furthermore, this group maintained better cognitive function than those who did not use aspirin.27\nAspirin\u0092s Role in Heart Disease\nLife Extension has repeatedly alerted its members to the lethal dangers of endothelial dysfunction, the key underlying factor in the progression of atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.\nEndothelial dysfunction occurs when the blood vessel linings can no longer dilate in response to demands for increased blood flow. Emerging studies indicate that aspirin may protect against heart disease in part by improving endothelial function. In a study of 14 patients with coronary atherosclerosis, aspirin helped improve the ability of blood vessels to dilate, indicating an improvement in endothelial function. This led the study authors to suggest that aspirin therapy could help improve endothelial dysfunction and inhibit the advance of atherosclerosis.28\nThe heart depends on its coronary arteries for the oxygen supply that fuels this most vital of organs. Coronary heart disease occurs when normal blood flow through the arteries that feed the heart is slowed or interrupted by factors such as blood clots or plaque.\nPreventing clots is another way that aspirin helps prevent heart attacks. By irreversibly blocking production of the clot-promoting biochemicals known as thromboxanes, aspirin prevents platelets in the blood from latching on to each other and forming a clot. A platelet has a life span of 10 days, and aspirin permanently impairs the platelet\u0092s clotting ability.29 Aspirin helps blood flow more smoothly past any plaque that is narrowing an artery, and if a plaque ruptures, aspirin will reduce the likelihood of a clot clinging to it.30\nAspirin can also help prevent heart disease through its anti-inflammatory action. Inflammation participates in many disease processes in the body, including plaque accumulation in the arteries.31 The growth of plaque can obstruct blood flow through the arteries. If a plaque ruptures due to inflammation, it can trigger a heart attack.\nA 2003 meta-analysis examined aspirin\u0092s effects on primary heart-attack prevention (that is, the prevention of first heart attacks). In more than 55,000 men and women, aspirin use was associated with a 32% reduction in the risk of having a first heart attack, and with a 15% reduction in the risk of all major vascular events.32\nA study presented at the 2005 meeting of the American Heart Association reported on the lifesaving benefits of aspirin therapy. This study examined nearly 9,000 women with stable heart disease, ranging in age from 50 to 79. During more than six years of follow-up, women taking aspirin were 25% less likely to die from heart disease and 17% less likely to die from any cause. Some women took 81 mg of aspirin daily, while others took 325 mg. The study authors stated that the two doses appeared to be similarly effective, but that higher doses of aspirin are associated with a greater risk of certain side effects, such as stomach bleeding.33\nA meta-analysis published in 2006 examined the effects of aspirin therapy in preventing cardiovascular events in women and men. Examining data from more than 50,000 women, investigators determined that aspirin therapy was associated with a significant 12% reduction in cardiovascular events in women. Among more than 44,000 men, aspirin therapy produced a significant 14% reduction in all cardiovascular events and an even more impressive 32% reduction in heart attacks.34\nAccording to the US Preventive Services Task Force, aspirin\u0092s proven benefits are reason enough for people to start using it if they have at least a 6% chance of developing coronary heart disease in the next 10 years. By contrast, the American Heart Association recommends aspirin for people whose 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease is 10% or higher, as long they have no medical contraindications for taking the drug. A doctor can help you calculate your cardiovascular risk based on factors such as tobacco use, cholesterol, and blood pressure.35,36 You can also assess your cardiovascular risk by using online risk factor calculators available at the American Heart Association website.\nLife Extension strongly recommends that people who have already had a heart attack (or other episode of heart disease) discuss aspirin therapy with their doctor as part of a strategy to prevent future problems. Life Extension also suggests that people with no previous history of cardiovascular disease\u0097but who are nevertheless at high risk for heart disease\u0097strongly consider aspirin therapy in consultation with their personal physician. The recommended dose for preventing heart-related problems is 81-325 mg daily. Speak with your doctor about your personal needs before beginning aspirin therapy.\nAspirin and Stroke: Risk vs. Benefit\nThe brain requires a constant supply of oxygen from freshly flowing blood to convert glucose into energy.38 During a stroke, blood flow to part of the brain is cut off, and the damage from this interruption can cause death, disability, impaired speech, and myriad other adverse effects.\nThe most common type of stroke \u0097 known as ischemic stroke \u0097 occurs when an artery becomes blocked, limiting blood supply to areas of the brain. This type of stroke accounts for about 80% of stroke cases. The other 20% or so are cases of hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by a blood vessel rupturing and spilling blood into the brain. Aspirin plays vastly different roles in these two types of stroke.\nAspirin helps to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke by keeping blood platelets from sticking together to form a clot, so that blood continues to flow past any narrowed spots in the arteries that feed the brain. However, some studies suggest that taking aspirin may cause a slight increase in a person\u0092s chance of having a hemorrhagic stroke. The US Preventive Services Task Force estimates that if 1,000 people took aspirin for five years, as many as 2 would suffer a hemorrhagic stroke.39\nA study published in March 2005 examined aspirin\u0092s effects on women. Nearly 40,000 middle-aged and older women were assigned to take either placebo or 100 mg of aspirin every other day for 10 years. Women who took aspirin had a notable 24% reduced risk of ischemic stroke. In this study, however, aspirin use was associated with slightly higher risks of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke.40\nASPIRIN THERAPY: BALANCING BENEFITS AND SIDE EFFECTS\nWhile aspirin therapy is known to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and ischemic stroke, it is also associated with an increased risk of certain adverse side effects, including peptic ulcer disease and hemorrhagic stroke.\nFor example, according to the US Preventive Services Task Force, if 1,000 people with a 1% risk of coronary heart disease took aspirin regularly for five years, this treatment would prevent 1-4 heart attacks, but would produce up to 2 cases of bleeding in the brain and 2-4 cases of major gastrointestinal bleeding. By contrast, if 1,000 people with a 5% (five times higher) risk of coronary heart disease events used aspirin therapy for five years, the treatment would prevent 6-20 heart attacks, but would contribute to up to 2 cases of bleeding in the brain and 2-4 major gastrointestinal bleeding events. Thus, the net benefit of aspirin therapy is increased in individuals with progressively greater degrees of cardiovascular risk.35\nChronic use of aspirin therapy has been associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. Concomitant use of cimetidine (Tagamet\u00ae) or antacids may help heal ulcerations. Some findings suggest that aspirin-induced damage to the gastrointestinal tract can be minimized by using enteric-coated tablets. Smaller doses of aspirin are generally less likely to induce gastrointestinal side effects.37 Consult your doctor to determine if you are a good candidate for aspirin therapy and what dosage may be best for you.\nAnother study reported in late 2005 examined the effects of aspirin therapy in more than 50,000 women who did not have coronary heart disease. Aspirin use was associated with a 17% reduction in the risk of suffering a stroke, and a 24% reduction in the risk of ischemic stroke. In this study, aspirin use did not appear to increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.33\nOnce your risk factors for stroke \u0097 like hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, or smoking \u0097 start adding up, you and your doctor need to discuss aspirin therapy, particularly as you grow older and advance into age groups that bear a heavier stroke risk. If you have suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, aspirin should not be used. In general, 81-325 mg of aspirin daily is used as part of a stroke-prevention program.\nASPIRIN'S OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR BENEFITS\nNumerous recent studies suggest that aspirin is underutilized in the prevention and management of other conditions affecting the cardiovascular system.\nDoctors know, for instance, that people who have conditions such as metabolic syndrome, kidney dialysis, peripheral arterial disease, and angina have elevated risks of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks. Research findings from the past two years indicate that aspirin therapy may help to mitigate the elevated cardiovascular disease risk experienced in these patient populations.41-44\nConclusion\nLife Extension was at the forefront in advocating aspirin use to decrease cardiovascular risk, long before the mainstream medical community finally recognized the lifesaving benefits of aspirin.\nExciting new research findings support a disease-preventive benefit for aspirin in other potentially lethal conditions such as skin cancer, colon cancer, and Alzheimer's. Life Extension will continue to monitor ongoing research on aspirin and share with members important findings that are often overlooked by the mainstream medical establishment.\nAn overlooked staple of the medicine cabinet, aspirin continues to prove its value as one of our most powerful allies in fighting the deadly diseases that accompany aging.\nCaution: Individuals with allergies to aspirin or other salicylates should not use aspirin. People with a history of bleeding disorders, hemorrhagic stroke, asthma, or ulcers should speak with a doctor before using aspirin. Consult a physician before using aspirin in combination with over-the-counter or prescription medications. Children and teenagers with symptoms of flu or chicken pox should not take aspirin.\n~ Newly Discovered Benefits of Aspirin - References\nFREE SHIPPING IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES!\nThe statements made here have not been evaluated by the FDA.

Can a drug that\u2019s been around for thousands of years really be as good as\u2014and safer than\u2014newer prescription medications?\n\u201cI am still captivated by aspirin. I have been since I was a kid and it was just for reducing fever then,\u201d says Dr. Lenard M. Lichtenberger, professor in the Department of Integrative Biology & Pharmacology at The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston. Lichtenberger has spent much of his career studying aspirin. \u201cI believe that aspirin deserves all the credit that it receives.\u201d\nBarking Up the Right Tree\nHipprocates, the father of modern medicine, used ground willow tree bark to ease aches and pains way back in the fifth century. Willow bark contains the chemical salicin, or salicylic acid.\nBy the late 1800s, salicylic acid became the standard drug to treat arthritis. However, it was very harsh and irritated the stomach. Felix Hoffmann, a German chemist with Friedrich Bayer and Company, synthesized acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in 1897 as a treatment for his father's arthritis. The synthesized form of the drug didn\u2019t hurt the stomach as much and was better at treating pain. By 1899, The Bayer Company was providing aspirin to physicians to give to their patients.\nWhy Aspirin Works\nAfter all these years, experts still are not exactly sure how it works. The most widely accepted theory is that aspirin helps reduce the level of chemicals in the blood called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause pain by stimulating the muscles to contract and blood vessels to dilate. Aspirin stops the prostaglandins from forming by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 or COX-2. Aspirin is the first known COX-2 inhibitor, and the first of a class of drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s).\nThe downside is that aspirin also blocks the COX-1 enzyme which helps protects the lining of the stomach. As a result, aspirin can increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.\nOver the past few decades, researchers have developed new NSAIDS. General NSAIDS like ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) block both COX-1 and COX-2 and are available over the counter. To better protect the stomach, even more targeted NSAIDS, called COX-2 inhibitors were developed to block only the COX-2 enzyme. But two of these drugs, Vioxx and Bextra were taken off the market earlier this year because of increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) is a separate class of pain relievers and fever reducers, and is gentler on the stomach than NSAIDS but boasts no anti-inflammatory properties.\nHeart Disease and Aspirin\nBecause aspirin is so safe, doctors say taking it daily or every other day is an easy way for most people older than age 40 to protect their hearts. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men age 40 and older, women who are past menopause and younger people with risk factors for heart attack or stroke, such as diabetes or smoking, discuss aspirin therapy with their doctors.\n\u201cAspirin is very inexpensive, it not only relieves pain and fever but has an anti- inflammatory effect,\u201d says cardiologist Dr. Samuel W. Casscells, the John Edward Tyson Distinguished Professor of Medicine at the UT Houston Medical School. \u201cAspirin and aspirin only prevents blood clots. Aspirin\u2019s cousins, such as NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors, don\u2019t prevent blood clots.\u201d\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in 1985 the use of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in patients who had either suffered a previous heart attack or suffered from unstable angina. The decision was based on evidence that aspirin reduced the risk of a second heart attack by 20 percent. For patients suffering from unstable angina, the risk of a heart attack decreased by 51 percent.\nThe most effective dosage of aspirin is still a matter of contention, although most doctors recommend the lowest dose possible to minimize side effects. Doses range from one-quarter of a baby aspirin to full adult doses, depending on its medical purpose and your doctor\u2019s recommendations.\nAspirin\u2019s role in preventing heart attacks has not been studied as much in women. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative, a randomized study of 40,000 women between the ages of 45 and 65, found that low dose aspirin did not prevent first heart attacks or cardiovascular events in the total group of women studied.\nHowever, for women older than 65 in the study, aspirin reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 26 percent.\nStroke and Aspirin\nAspirin has also been shown to help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (a result of a clot blocking an artery in the brain) which is also the most common kind of stroke. And in some cases, aspirin may work better at preventing stroke in high-risk patients than more sophisticated anti-clotting drugs.\n\u201cPeople at risk of developing ischemic strokes should consider aspirin instead of warfarin, a common anti-clot drug,\u201d says Dr. James Grotta, professor of neurology at the medical school and director of the stroke program at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\nIn a study of 569 people, patients on warfarin (Coumadin), suffered a higher death rate and had more bleeding compared to those who took aspirin. Results of the study appeared in the March 31 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\nAspirin reduced the risk of ischemic stroke in women who took low-dose aspirin by 24 percent, according to the Women\u2019s Health Initiative study. It also has shown some promise in preventing a variety of diseases and health conditions ranging from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to colon cancer.\nNot for Everyone\nAspirin is not without some risks.\nBecause it increases risk for stomach bleeding, consult your doctor before taking aspirin therapy if you have an ulcer. Your doctor may also prescribe a medicine to counteract acid in the stomach.\nPeople with certain clotting deficiencies should not take aspirin.\nChildren under age 18 should not be given aspirin to treat viral infections because of its link to the deadly condition known as Reye's Syndrome. Always consult your doctor, first.\nDon\u2019t take aspirin if you have an aspirin allergy or a history of uncontrolled high blood pressure.\nWhile aspirin is often recommended to treat a heart attack until the patient can get medical help, don\u2019t take aspirin to treat a stroke.\n\u201cIf you think you are having a stroke call 9-1-1, don\u2019t take an aspirin,\u201d Grotta says. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain and aspirin may make it worse, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take aspirin until you know it is not a bleeding stroke.\u201d\nThe bottom line? Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of aspirin and any risk factors you may have before starting aspirin therapy.\nImproving a Miracle\nWhile researchers continue to uncover new ways to use aspirin, others are working hard to improve it. Lichtenberger has developed a patented process that binds aspirin with phosphatidylcholine (PC), a purified form of lecithin derived from soybeans. The PC-aspirin protects the lining of the stomach. But unlike currently used enteric coatings, it is easily dissolved, allowing the aspirin to cross into the bloodstream more quickly.\n\u201cEvery few months I get surprised by another new application for aspirin,\u201d Lichtenberger says. \u201cBut I think another area of interest that we are pursuing is reducing the side effects of aspirin and getting a much better understanding of NSAIDS and how they act, with the hope that we can further improve the drug\u2019s cardioprotective actions.\u201d\nHe hopes protecting the stomach may make aspirin a more palatable option for people prone to gastrointestinal bleeds, but also at high risk for heart attack. Such a development would be more than welcome by doctors like Casscells, looking for a safe and effective drug to prescribe their patients.\n\u201cAspirin is still a miracle drug,\u201d Casscells says. \u201cNumber one: the other more expensive drugs don\u2019t prevent blood clots. Number two: we\u2019ve had it for 100 years, and it is a natural compound from tree bark. These reasons give you great comfort when prescribing aspirin.\u201d\nLast Updated: 6-15-2005\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), the most comprehensive academic health center in The UT System and the U.S. Gulf Coast region, is home to schools of biomedical informatics, biomedical sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing and public health.

These so-called antipyretic agents include acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin. All three of these over-the-counter drugs appear to be equally effective at reducing fever. However, because aspirin may cause or be associated with Reye syndrome , the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend using aspirin to treat a simple fever in children.\nAcetominophen can be given without a doctor\u2019s advice once your child is older than three months, and ibuprofen can be given to children older than six months of age. However, if your child has kidney disease, asthma, an ulcer, or other chronic illness, ask your doctor first if ibuprofen is safe. If your child is dehydrated or vomiting, ibuprofen should only be given under the supervision of a doctor due to risk of kidney damage.\nIdeally, the doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen should be based on a child\u2019s weight, not his age. However, the dosages listed on the labels of acetaminophen bottles (which are usually calculated by age) are generally safe and effective unless your child is unusually light or heavy for his age. Keep in mind that at too high doses of acetaminophen, a toxic response in the liver can develop, although it happens only rarely. When a toxic reaction does occur, the symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort.\nAs a general guideline, read and follow the instructions on the manufacturer\u2019s label when using any medication. Following the instructions is important to ensure that your child receives the proper dosages. Also, other over-the-counter medications , such as cold and cough preparations, may contain acetaminophen. The simultaneous use of more than one acetaminophen-containing product may be dangerous, so read all medication labels to ensure that your child is not receiving multiple doses of the same medicine. Also, as a general rule, do not give a child under two years old either acetaminophen or any other medication without the advice of your pediatrician.\nSome parents have tried alternating between giving acetaminophen and ibuprofen when their child is running a fever. This approach, however, can cause medication errors\u2014\u201cWhich medicine am I supposed to give him next?\u201d\u2014and could lead to potential side effects.

Always consult your doctor before changing the dose schedule, or using these medicines in combination.\nAlso keep in mind that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines should not be given to infants and children under two years of age because of potentially serious side effects. Studies also have shown that these cough and cold products are not effective in treating the symptoms of children under six years old, and may even pose health risks.\nLast Updated\n10/4/2011\nSource\n"}, {"score": 1117.8328, "uuid": "728f4c16-1a93-5280-84b4-67090908f012", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0510wb-12-03695", "target_hostname": "www.mayoclinic.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/daily-aspirin-therapy/HB00073/METHOD=print", "page_rank": 1.174096e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "Daily <em>aspirin</em> therapy: Understand the benefits and risks - MayoClinic.com", "snippet": "And then, only take <em>aspirin</em> with your doctor&#x27;s approval.

It's not as easy a decision as it sounds. Know the benefits and risks before considering daily aspirin therapy.\nBy Mayo Clinic staff\nDaily aspirin therapy may lower your risk of heart attack and stroke, but daily aspirin therapy isn't for everyone. Is it right for you?\nYou should consider daily aspirin therapy only if you've had a heart attack or stroke, or you have a high risk of either. And then, only take aspirin with your doctor's approval. Although taking an occasional aspirin or two is safe for most adults to use for headaches, body aches or fever, daily use of aspirin can have serious side effects, including internal bleeding.\nHow does aspirin prevent a heart attack or stroke?\nAspirin interferes with your blood's clotting action. When you bleed, your blood's clotting cells, called platelets, build up at the site of your wound. The platelets help form a plug that seals the opening in your blood vessel to stop bleeding.\nBut this clotting can also happen within the vessels that supply your heart and brain with blood. If your blood vessels are already narrowed from atherosclerosis \u2014 the buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries \u2014 a fatty deposit in your vessel can burst. Then, a blood clot can quickly form and block the artery. This prevents blood flow to the heart or brain and causes a heart attack or stroke. Aspirin therapy reduces the clumping action of platelets \u2014 possibly preventing heart attack and stroke.\nDoes daily aspirin therapy differ between men and women?\nAspirin can have different effects between the sexes, and for women, among age groups.\nFor men of all ages, aspirin can:\nPrevent a first and second heart attack\nReduce heart disease risk\nFor women younger than 65, aspirin can:\nPrevent a first stroke\nPrevent a second heart attack\nReduce heart disease risk\nFor women 65 and older, aspirin can:\nPrevent a first and second heart attack\nPrevent a first stroke\nReduce heart disease risk\nThe risk of bleeding with daily aspirin therapy, however, is about the same in both sexes.\nShould you take a daily aspirin?\nWhether you need daily aspirin therapy depends on your risk of heart disease and stroke. Risk factors for a heart attack or stroke include:\nSmoking tobacco\nHigh blood pressure \u2014 a systolic pressure of 140 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher\nTotal cholesterol level of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) \u2014 6.22 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) \u2014 or higher\nLow-density lipoprotein (\"bad\") cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) or higher\nLack of exercise\nDiabetes\nStress\nHaving more than two alcoholic drinks a day for men, one drink a day for women\nFamily history of a stroke or heart attack\nIf you've had a heart attack or stroke, chances are your doctor has talked to you about taking aspirin to prevent a second occurrence.\nIf you have strong risk factors, but have not had a heart attack or stroke, you may also benefit from taking an aspirin every day. First, you'll want to discuss with your doctor whether you have any conditions that make taking aspirin dangerous for you.\nShould you avoid daily aspirin therapy if you have another health condition?\nYou shouldn't take a daily aspirin if you have some health conditions that could increase your risk of bleeding or other complications. These conditions include:\nA bleeding or clotting disorder (bleeding easily)\nAsthma\nStomach ulcers\nHeart failure\nFor people who have diabetes, the American Diabetes Association and other medical associations recommend a low-dose aspirin only for men older than 50 and women older than 60 who have at least one additional risk factor for heart disease, such as smoking, family history of heart disease, high cholesterol or high blood pressure.\nIt's also important to tell your doctor what other medications or supplements you might be taking, even if it's just ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Taking aspirin and ibuprofen together reduces the beneficial effects of the aspirin. Taking aspirin with other anticoagulants, such as warfarin (Coumadin), could greatly increase your chance of bleeding.\nWhat's the best dose of aspirin to take?\nThere's no uniform dose of aspirin you should take to get the benefits of daily aspirin therapy. You and your doctor will discuss what dose is right for you. Very low doses of aspirin \u2014 75 milligrams (mg), which is less than a standard baby aspirin \u2014 can be effective. Your doctor may prescribe a daily dose anywhere from 81 mg \u2014 the amount in a baby aspirin \u2014 to 325 mg (regular strength).\nWhat happens if you stop taking aspirin every day?\nYou might be surprised to learn that stopping daily aspirin therapy can have a rebound effect that may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. If you've been on daily aspirin therapy and want to stop, it's important to talk to your doctor before making any changes. Suddenly stopping daily aspirin therapy could have a rebound effect that may trigger a blood clot.\nCan you take aspirin if you regularly take ibuprofen for another condition?\nBoth aspirin and ibuprofen reduce the clotting action of blood platelets. Regular ibuprofen use can increase your bleeding risk.\nIf you need only a single dose of ibuprofen, take it eight hours before or 30 minutes after the aspirin. If you need to take ibuprofen more often, talk to your doctor about medication alternatives that won't interfere with daily aspirin therapy.\nWhat are the possible side effects of daily aspirin therapy?\nSide effects and complications of taking aspirin include:\nHemorrhagic stroke. While daily aspirin can help prevent a clot-related stroke, it may increase your risk of a bleeding stroke (hemorrhagic stroke).\nGastrointestinal bleeding. Daily aspirin use increases your risk of developing a stomach ulcer. And, if you have a bleeding ulcer, taking aspirin will cause it to bleed more, perhaps to a life-threatening extent.\nAllergic reaction. If you're allergic to aspirin, taking any amount of aspirin can trigger a serious allergic reaction.\nRinging in the ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss. Too much aspirin (overdosing) can cause tinnitus and eventual hearing loss in some people.\nIf you're taking aspirin and need a surgical procedure or dental work, be sure to tell the surgeon or dentist that you take daily aspirin and how much. Otherwise you risk excessive bleeding during surgery.\nThe Food and Drug Administration also warns that people who regularly take aspirin should limit the amount of alcohol they drink because of its additional blood-thinning effects and potential to upset your stomach. If you take daily aspirin therapy, you should not have more than one drink a day if you're a woman or two drinks a day if you're a man.\nWhat are possible drug interactions with daily aspirin therapy?\nIf you're already taking an anticoagulant such as warfarin (Coumadin) for another condition, combining it with aspirin may greatly increase the risk of major bleeding complications. However, there may be some conditions for which combining a low dose of aspirin with warfarin is appropriate (for example, with certain types of artificial heart valves for secondary stroke prevention), but this therapy always needs to be carefully discussed with your doctor.\nOther medications and herbal supplements also may increase your risk of bleeding. Medications that can interact with aspirin include:\nWarfarin (Coumadin)\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), when taken regularly\nCorticosteroids\nSome antidepressants (clomipramine, paroxetine, others)\nTaking some dietary supplements can also increase your bleeding risk. These include:\nDanshen\n"}, {"score": 1090.0287, "uuid": "f2f19b26-7fb7-5b9c-972f-138c0f2c3c2e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0506wb-57-03468", "target_hostname": "www.mayoclinic.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/headaches-in-children/DS01132/METHOD=print", "page_rank": 1.181061e-09, "spam_rank": 98, "title": "Headaches <em>in</em> <em>children</em> - MayoClinic.com", "snippet": "Use caution when giving <em>aspirin</em> to <em>children</em> <em>or</em> teenagers.

Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days.\nCluster headache\nCluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually:\nOccur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging in frequency from one headache every other day up to eight a day\nInvolve a sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts from 15 minutes to three hours\nAre accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or a heightened sense of restlessness or agitation\nChronic daily headache\nBoth migraines and tension-type headaches can increase in frequency. If your child has headaches more than 15 days a month for more than three months, doctors call this \"chronic daily headache.\" Sometimes, an infection or minor head injury precipitates a continuous, persistent headache. This problem can also occur when your child takes pain medications \u2014 even the nonprescription variety \u2014 too frequently.\nWhen to see a doctor\nMost headaches aren't serious, but seek prompt medical care if your child's headaches:\nOccur at least once a week\nFollow an injury, such as a blow to the head\nFeature persistent vomiting or visual changes\nAre accompanied by fever, along with neck pain or stiffness\nCauses\nA number of factors, singly or in combination, can cause your child to develop headache. Some of these factors include:\nIllness and infection. Common illnesses such as colds, flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of headache in children. More-serious infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, also can cause headache, but are usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as fever and neck stiffness.\nHead trauma. Accidental bumps and bruises can cause headaches. Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention if your child falls hard on his or her head. Also contact a doctor if your child has a steadily worsening head pain after a head injury.\nEmotional factors. High levels of stress and anxiety \u2014 perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents \u2014 can play a role in children's headaches. Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness.\nGenetic predisposition. Headaches, particularly migraines, tend to run in families.\nCertain foods and beverages. Nitrates \u2014 a kind of food preservative found in such foods as bacon, bologna and hot dogs \u2014 have been known to trigger headaches, as can the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG). Also, too much caffeine \u2014 contained in foods such as soda, chocolate, coffee and tea \u2014 can cause headaches.\nProblems in the brain. Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess, or bleeding in the brain, may create pressure on areas of the brain, causing a chronic, worsening headache. Typically in these cases, however, headache is accompanied by other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness, lack of coordination and other neurological problems.\nRisk factors\nAny child can develop headaches, but they're more common in:\nGirls after they reach puberty\nChildren who have a family history of headaches or migraines\nPreparing for your appointment\nFor headaches in children, you typically make an appointment with your family doctor or your child's pediatrician. Depending on the frequency and severity of your child's symptoms, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in conditions of the brain and nervous system (neurologist).\nBecause appointments can be brief and there's often a lot of ground to cover, it can help to be well prepared. Here are some tips to help you get ready for your child's appointment and what to expect from the doctor.\nWhat you can do\nWrite down your child's signs and symptoms, when they occurred and how long they lasted. It may help to keep a headache diary \u2014 listing each headache, when it happens, how long it lasts, and what might have caused it.\nMake a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins or supplements, that your child is taking.\nWrite down questions to ask your doctor. Don't be afraid to ask questions or to speak up when you don't understand something your doctor says.\nList your questions from most important to least important in case your time with your doctor runs out. For headaches in children, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\nWhat is likely causing the symptoms?\nAre tests needed to confirm the diagnosis?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nDoes my child need prescription medication, or would an over-the-counter medication work?\nWhat kind of follow-up, if any, is needed?\nWhat can we do at home to help lessen the pain?\nWhat can we do at home to prevent headaches?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment at any time that you don't understand something.\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:\nWhen did the symptoms first start?\nHow often does your child experience these symptoms?\nHow long does the headache usually last?\nWhere does the pain occur?\nHave the symptoms been continuous or intermittent?\nDoes your child have other symptoms, such as nausea or dizziness?\nWhat, if anything, makes it better?\nWhat, if anything, makes it worse?\nHave the symptoms changed over time?\nWhat treatments have you tried?\nWhat medications does your child take?\nDo other family members experience headaches?\nWhat you can do in the meantime\nWhile waiting for your child's appointment, place a cool, wet cloth on your child's forehead and encourage him or her to take a nap in a dark, quiet room.\nAlso, consider giving your child over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) to ease symptoms. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\nTests and diagnosis\nTo learn about the nature of your child's headache, your doctor will likely recommend the following steps:\nHeadache history. Your doctor asks you and your child to describe the headaches in detail, to see if there's a pattern or a common trigger. Your doctor may also ask you to keep a headache diary for a time, so you can record more details about your child's headaches, such as frequency, severity of pain and possible triggers.\nPhysical exam. The doctor also performs a physical exam, including measuring your child's height, weight, head circumference, blood pressure and pulse, and examining your child's eyes, neck, head, shoulders and spine.\nNeurological exam. Your doctor checks for any problems with movement, coordination or sensation.\nIf your child is otherwise healthy and headache is the only symptom, no further testing usually is needed. In a few cases, however, imaging scans and other evaluations are needed to pinpoint a diagnosis or to rule out other medical conditions that could be causing the headaches. These tests may include:\nComputerized tomography (CT). This imaging procedure uses a series of computer-directed X-rays that provide a cross-sectional view of your child's brain. This helps doctors diagnose tumors, infections and other possible medical problems that may be causing headaches.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRIs use radio waves and a powerful magnet to produce very detailed views of the brain. MRI scans help doctors diagnose tumors, strokes, aneurysms, neurological diseases and other brain abnormalities. An MRI can also be used to examine the blood vessels that supply the brain.\nSpinal tap (lumbar puncture). If your doctor suspects that an underlying condition, such as bacterial or viral meningitis, is the cause of your child's headaches, he or she may recommend a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted between two vertebrae in the lower back to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory analysis.\nTreatments and drugs\nMost of the time, you can treat your child's headache at home with rest, decreased noise, plenty of fluids, balanced meals and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers. If your child is older and has frequent headaches, learning to relax and manage stress through different forms of therapy may help, as well.\nMedications\nOTC pain relievers. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) can typically relieve headaches for your child. Some studies show that ibuprofen may work faster than acetaminophen in relieving migraine pain. OTC medications such as these are inexpensive and readily available and don't require a prescription from your doctor. They should be taken at the first sign of headache.\nUse caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\nPrescription medications. Sumatriptan (Imitrex), a prescription drug, is effective and can be safely used in children over the age of 12.\nIf your child experiences nausea and vomiting with migraines, your doctor may prescribe an anti-nausea drug, such as promethazine. The medication strategy differs from child to child, however. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.\nCaution: Overuse of medications is itself a contributing factor to headache (rebound headache). Over time, painkillers and other medications may lose their effectiveness. In addition, all medications have side effects. If your child takes medications regularly, including products you buy over-the-counter, discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.\nTherapies\nWhile stress doesn't appear to cause headaches, it can act as a trigger for headache or make headache worse. Depression and other mental health disorders also can play a role. For these situations, your doctor may recommend one or more behavior therapies, such as:\nRelaxation training. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, which is accomplished by tensing one muscle at a time, and then completely releasing the tension, until every muscle in the body is relaxed. An older child can learn relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books or tapes.\nBiofeedback training. Biofeedback teaches your child to control certain body responses that help reduce pain. During a biofeedback session, your child is connected to devices that monitor and give feedback on body functions, such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. Your child then learns how to reduce muscle tension and slow his or her heart rate and breathing. The goal of biofeedback is to help your child enter a relaxed state to better cope with pain.\nCognitive behavioral therapy. This therapy can help your child learn to manage stress and reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. During this type of talk therapy, a counselor helps your child learn ways to view and cope with life events more positively.\nLifestyle and home remedies\nOver-the-counter (OTC) pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others), are usually effective in reducing headache pain. Before giving your child pain medication, keep these points in mind:\nRead labels carefully and use only the dosages recommended for your child.\nDon't give doses more frequently than recommended.\nDon't give your child OTC pain medication more than two or three days a week. Daily use can trigger a rebound headache, a type of headache caused by overuse of pain medications.\nUse caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\nIn addition to OTC pain medications, the following measures can help ease your child's headache:\nRest and relax. Encourage your child to rest in a dark, quiet room. Sleeping often resolves headaches in children.\nUse a cool, wet compress. While your child rests, place a cool, wet cloth on his or her forehead.\nOffer a healthy snack. If your child hasn't eaten in a while, offer a piece of fruit, whole-wheat crackers or low-fat cheese. Going without meals can sometimes make headaches worse.\nPrevention\nThe following may help you prevent headaches or reduce the severity of headaches in children:\nPractice healthy behaviors. Behaviors that promote general good health also may help prevent headaches for your child. These lifestyle measures include getting plenty of sleep, staying physically active, eating healthy meals and snacks, and avoiding caffeine.\nReduce stress. Stress and busy schedules may increase the frequency of headaches. Be alert for things that may cause stress in your child's life, such as difficulty doing schoolwork or strained relationships with peers. If your child's headaches are linked to anxiety or depression, consider talking to a counselor.\nKeep a headache diary. A diary can help you determine what causes your child's headaches. Note when the headaches start, how long they last and what, if anything, provides relief. Record your child's response to taking any headache medication. Over time, the items you note in the headache diary should help you understand your child's symptoms so that you can take specific preventive measures.\nAvoid headache triggers. Avoid any food or drinks, such as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches. Your headache diary can help you determine what prompts your child's headaches, so you know what to avoid.\nFollow your doctor's plan. Your doctor may recommend preventive medication if the headaches are severe, occur daily and interfere with your child's normal lifestyle. Certain medications taken at regular intervals \u2014 such as certain antidepressants or anti-seizure medications \u2014 may reduce the frequency and severity of headaches.\n"}, {"score": 1109.4619, "uuid": "3c7f10fd-1d6d-5f0d-ae99-e669a4db3bd2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1711wb-06-13085", "target_hostname": "www.allkids.org", "target_uri": "http://www.allkids.org/body.cfm?id=412&action=detail&aeproductid=Greystone_newsletter&aearticleid=280&AEArticleType=Breaking%20News", "page_rank": 1.1918639e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "New Advice on <em>Fevers</em>: Wait and Watch", "snippet": "&quot;If you bring a <em>fever</em> down, your child may not produce as many white cells to fight the infection.&quot; On the other hand, if your child seems lethargic and <em>is</em> generally uncomfortable, <em>fever</em>-<em>reducing</em> medications such as acetaminophen <em>or</em> <em>ibuprofen</em> may make your child feel a little <em>better</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Health Information\nNew Advice on Fevers: Wait and Watch\n< Mar. 02, 2011 > -- When a child runs a fever, most parents run to the medicine cabinet to offer relief.\nBut here's the latest word from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP): Wait.\n\"Sometimes, parents think that if they treat a fever that their child will get better faster, but fever is a sign of illness, and it's the body's way of slowing the germs down to help get rid of them,\" says Janice Sullivan, M.D., at the University of Louisville.\nObserve behavior\nThe AAP, in a report published in this month's Pediatrics, now recommends that parents only treat a fever if it's making their child feel uncomfortable. Instead of focusing on the thermometer reading, parents should monitor their child's behavior.\nIf your child is eating and drinking well, and playing, you probably don't need to offer any fever-reducing medication, the AAP says.\n\"Fever is one of the triggers that your body uses to produce more white cells,\" says Dr. Sullivan. \"If you bring a fever down, your child may not produce as many white cells to fight the infection.\"\nUse only as directed\nOn the other hand, if your child seems lethargic and is generally uncomfortable, fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may make your child feel a little better. Give these medications only as directed by the package or your child's health care provider, based on your child's age and weight.\nDr. Sullivan says it's important to not give your children adult formulations of anti-fever drugs, even if you attempt to break tablets up to provide the correct dose.\nAnd NEVER give aspirin to children, because of its association with Reye syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition.\nIn addition\nHere is other fever advice from the AAP:\nStore any fever-reducing medication safely away from young children.\nAlways use an accurate measuring device for each dose.\nDon't wake a sleeping child to give fever-reducing medication.\nWhen should you call the doctor about a fever? Dr. Sullivan offers these general guidelines:\nAn infant under 3 months of age with a fever of 100.4 degrees or more\nAn infant between 3 and 6 months of age with a fever of 101.5 degrees or more\nAn older child with a fever of 103 degrees or more\nAny child with a fever plus lethargy, headache, skin rash, difficulty breathing, or dehydration\nFor more information on health and wellness, please visit health information modules on this website.\nHow to Take a Rectal Temperature\nWhen your little one is ill and you need to check his temperature, follow these steps:\nUse a lubricating jelly to lubricate the tip of the thermometer. (A water-soluble jelly such as K-Y is preferred. You may also use a disposable plastic cover on the thermometer. Check with your child's health care provider to see what he or she recommends.)\nPlace the child across your lap, making sure to support his head. You can also lay him on the changing table or other firm surface.\nHold the baby still by pressing the palm of one hand on his lower back.\nWith the other hand, insert the thermometer one-half inch to one inch into the rectum. Stop immediately if the thermometer meets resistance.\nHold the thermometer between your second and third fingers and cup your hand around the child's rear. As you hold the thermometer in place, calm the child by speaking softly to him.\nKeep the thermometer in place until you hear the signal or beep that it is ready. Write down the temperature, the date and time of day.\nAlways talk with your health care provider to find out more information.\nOnline Resources\n"}, {"score": 1107.1766, "uuid": "25bcacf0-c3bf-5f15-964e-e471b9928582", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0601wb-03-18602", "target_hostname": "www.health24.com", "target_uri": "http://www.health24.com/medical/Symptoms/777-4194,44200.asp", "page_rank": 2.394688e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>Fever</em> : Health24: Symptoms", "snippet": "<em>Ibuprofen</em> (Nurofen and others) <em>is</em> another <em>fever</em>-<em>reducing</em> medication that relieves mild to moderate aches and pains.

Like adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraines or stress-related (tension) headaches. Children can also have chronic daily headaches.\nIn some cases, headaches in children are caused by an infection, high levels of stress or anxiety, or minor head trauma. That's why it's important to pay attention to your child's headache symptoms and to consult a doctor if the headache worsens or occurs frequently. Headaches in children can usually be treated with over-the-counter pain medications and other lifestyle and home measures.\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.\nSymptoms\nChildren get the same types of headaches that adults do, although their symptoms may be different. For example, a migraine in an adult almost always affects just one side of the head, whereas a child's migraine often affects both sides of the head. In addition, headache symptoms in children don't always meet the full criteria for a specific type of headache. As a result, it may be difficult to pinpoint a specific type of headache in a child, especially in a younger child who isn't able to adequately describe his or her symptoms. As a child grows into adolescence and adulthood, headache symptoms may evolve, as well.\nIn general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently under certain categories.\nMigraine\nAbdominal pain\nExtreme sensitivity to light and sound\nEven infants can have migraines. A child who's too young to tell you what's wrong may cry and hold his or her head to indicate severe pain. Migraines in children may last an hour or more.\nTension-type headache\nTension-type headaches are typically characterized by the following features:\nA pressing tightness that occurs on both sides of the head\nPain that's usually more dull than throbbing\nPain that's not worsened by physical activity\nHeadache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine\nTelltale signs in younger children may include withdrawal from regular play and a desire to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days.\nCluster headache\nCluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually:\nOccur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging in frequency from one headache every other day up to eight a day\nInvolve a sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts from 15 minutes to three hours\nAre accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or a heightened sense of restlessness or agitation\nChronic daily headache\nBoth migraines and tension-type headaches can increase in frequency. If your child has headaches more than 15 days a month for more than three months, doctors call this \"chronic daily headache.\" Sometimes, an infection or minor head injury precipitates a continuous, persistent headache. This problem can also occur when your child takes pain medications \u2014 even the nonprescription variety \u2014 too frequently.\nWhen to see a doctor\nMost headaches aren't serious, but seek prompt medical care if your child's headaches:\nOccur at least once a week\nFollow an injury, such as a blow to the head\nFeature persistent vomiting or visual changes\nAre accompanied by fever, along with neck pain or stiffness\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.\nCauses\nA number of factors, singly or in combination, can cause your child to develop headache. Some of these factors include:\nIllness and infection. Common illnesses such as colds, flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of headache in children. More-serious infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, also can cause headache, but are usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as fever and neck stiffness.\nHead trauma. Accidental bumps and bruises can cause headaches. Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention if your child falls hard on his or her head. Also contact a doctor if your child has a steadily worsening head pain after a head injury.\nEmotional factors. High levels of stress and anxiety \u2014 perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents \u2014 can play a role in children's headaches. Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness.\nGenetic predisposition. Headaches, particularly migraines, tend to run in families.\nCertain foods and beverages. Nitrates \u2014 a kind of food preservative found in such foods as bacon, bologna and hot dogs \u2014 have been known to trigger headaches, as can the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG). Also, too much caffeine \u2014 contained in foods such as soda, chocolate, coffee and tea \u2014 can cause headaches.\nProblems in the brain. Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess, or bleeding in the brain, may create pressure on areas of the brain, causing a chronic, worsening headache. Typically in these cases, however, headache is accompanied by other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness, lack of coordination and other neurological problems.\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.\nAny child can develop headaches, but they're more common in:\nGirls after they reach puberty\nChildren who have a family history of headaches or migraines\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.\nPreparing for your appointment\nFor headaches in children, you typically make an appointment with your family doctor or your child's pediatrician. Depending on the frequency and severity of your child's symptoms, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in conditions of the brain and nervous system (neurologist).\nBecause appointments can be brief and there's often a lot of ground to cover, it can help to be well prepared. Here are some tips to help you get ready for your child's appointment and what to expect from the doctor.\nWhat you can do\nWrite down your child's signs and symptoms, when they occurred and how long they lasted. It may help to keep a headache diary \u2014 listing each headache, when it happens, how long it lasts, and what might have caused it.\nMake a list of all medications, as well as any vitamins or supplements, that your child is taking.\nWrite down questions to ask your doctor. Don't be afraid to ask questions or to speak up when you don't understand something your doctor says.\nList your questions from most important to least important in case your time with your doctor runs out. For headaches in children, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\nWhat is likely causing the symptoms?\nAre tests needed to confirm the diagnosis?\nWhat is the best course of action?\nDoes my child need prescription medication, or would an over-the-counter medication work?\nWhat kind of follow-up, if any, is needed?\nWhat can we do at home to help lessen the pain?\nWhat can we do at home to prevent headaches?\nIn addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment at any time that you don't understand something.\nWhat to expect from your doctor\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask:\nWhen did the symptoms first start?\nHow often does your child experience these symptoms?\nHow long does the headache usually last?\nWhere does the pain occur?\nHave the symptoms been continuous or intermittent?\nDoes your child have other symptoms, such as nausea or dizziness?\nWhat, if anything, makes it better?\nWhat, if anything, makes it worse?\nHave the symptoms changed over time?\nWhat treatments have you tried?\nWhat medications does your child take?\nDo other family members experience headaches?\nWhat you can do in the meantime\nWhile waiting for your child's appointment, place a cool, wet cloth on your child's forehead and encourage him or her to take a nap in a dark, quiet room.\nAlso, consider giving your child over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) to ease symptoms. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.\nTests and diagnosis\nTo learn about the nature of your child's headache, your doctor will likely recommend the following steps:\nHeadache history. Your doctor asks you and your child to describe the headaches in detail, to see if there's a pattern or a common trigger. Your doctor may also ask you to keep a headache diary for a time, so you can record more details about your child's headaches, such as frequency, severity of pain and possible triggers.\nPhysical exam. The doctor also performs a physical exam, including measuring your child's height, weight, head circumference, blood pressure and pulse, and examining your child's eyes, neck, head, shoulders and spine.\nNeurological exam. Your doctor checks for any problems with movement, coordination or sensation.\nIf your child is otherwise healthy and headache is the only symptom, no further testing usually is needed. In a few cases, however, imaging scans and other evaluations are needed to pinpoint a diagnosis or to rule out other medical conditions that could be causing the headaches. These tests may include:\nComputerized tomography (CT). This imaging procedure uses a series of computer-directed X-rays that provide a cross-sectional view of your child's brain. This helps doctors diagnose tumors, infections and other possible medical problems that may be causing headaches.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRIs use radio waves and a powerful magnet to produce very detailed views of the brain. MRI scans help doctors diagnose tumors, strokes, aneurysms, neurological diseases and other brain abnormalities. An MRI can also be used to examine the blood vessels that supply the brain.\nSpinal tap (lumbar puncture). If your doctor suspects that an underlying condition, such as bacterial or viral meningitis, is the cause of your child's headaches, he or she may recommend a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted between two vertebrae in the lower back to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory analysis.\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). Terms of use.\nTreatments and drugs\nMost of the time, you can treat your child's headache at home with rest, decreased noise, plenty of fluids, balanced meals and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers. If your child is older and has frequent headaches, learning to relax and manage stress through different forms of therapy may help, as well.\nMedications\nOTC pain relievers. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) can typically relieve headaches for your child. Some studies show that ibuprofen may work faster than acetaminophen in relieving migraine pain. OTC medications such as these are inexpensive and readily available and don't require a prescription from your doctor. They should be taken at the first sign of headache.\nUse caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\nPrescription medications. Sumatriptan (Imitrex), a prescription drug, is effective and can be safely used in children over the age of 12.\nIf your child experiences nausea and vomiting with migraines, your doctor may prescribe an anti-nausea drug, such as promethazine. The medication strategy differs from child to child, however. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.\nCaution: Overuse of medications is itself a contributing factor to headache (rebound headache). Over time, painkillers and other medications may lose their effectiveness. In addition, all medications have side effects. If your child takes medications regularly, including products you buy over-the-counter, discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.\nTherapies\nWhile stress doesn't appear to cause headaches, it can act as a trigger for headache or make headache worse. Depression and other mental health disorders also can play a role. For these situations, your doctor may recommend one or more behavior therapies, such as:\nRelaxation training. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, which is accomplished by tensing one muscle at a time, and then completely releasing the tension, until every muscle in the body is relaxed. An older child can learn relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books or tapes.\nBiofeedback training. Biofeedback teaches your child to control certain body responses that help reduce pain. During a biofeedback session, your child is connected to devices that monitor and give feedback on body functions, such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. Your child then learns how to reduce muscle tension and slow his or her heart rate and breathing. The goal of biofeedback is to help your child enter a relaxed state to better cope with pain.\nCognitive behavioral therapy. This therapy can help your child learn to manage stress and reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. During this type of talk therapy, a counselor helps your child learn ways to view and cope with life events more positively.\n\u00a91998-2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

You are said to be suffering from a fever if your body temperature is over 37\u00b0C (37.8\u00b0C or more when measured rectally).\nIn an adult, the level of fever generally reflects the severity of the illness causing it. In a child, however, this is not necessarily the case. A child with a mild cold may have a temperature of 40\u00b0C, while a child with a serious illness - bacterial pneumonia, for example - may have a temperature lower than that.\nIn a newborn, the body's temperature control is not yet well developed. As a result, signs other than a fever - poor appetite, lethargy and irritability - may be earlier indicators of an infection and are more helpful than temperature in assessing a newborn's condition.\nThe function of a fever\nIn the majority of cases, a fever is the body's natural reaction to an acute viral or bacterial infection and is not necessarily considered a dangerous condition in itself. Rather, a fever is a sign that the body is defending itself against the infectious invader. Since viruses and bacteria do not survive as well in a body with an elevated temperature, fever is actually an ally in fighting infection. An elevated temperature also increases the production of infection-fighting white blood cells and even increases their speed of response and enhances their killing capacity.\nCauses\nA fever can be caused by a wide variety of factors. Dehydration, overexertion, mosquito bites, bee stings, allergic or toxic reactions and viral or bacterial infections are just a few. A fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a condition defined as an elevated temperature lasting for three weeks or more without an identifiable cause.\nTreatment\nParacetamol (found in\u00a0 Panado, Calpol and other over-the-counter medications) is a drug that helps to lower fever. Paracetamol is also an analgesic (pain reliever), so it eases the discomfort and body aches that often accompany fever. It is available in liquid or pill form, as well as in suppository form for infants.\nadvertisement\nNote: In excessive amounts, this drug can cause liver damage. Be careful not to exceed the correct dosage for your child's age and size.\nIbuprofen (Nurofen and others) is another fever-reducing medication that relieves mild to moderate aches and pains. Be sure to take the medication with food to prevent irritation of the stomach. Ibuprofen is available in liquid or pill form. Follow dosage directions on the product label.\nDo notgive aspirin to a child with a fever. Many fevers are caused by viral infections, and the combination of aspirin and viral illness has been linked to the development of Reye's syndrome, a progressive and very dangerous liver disease.\nHome treatment\nAdminister paracetamol to reduce a fever of 40\u00b0C or higher. Do not use/give in higher doses or more frequently than directed.\nIt is very important to maintain fluid balance, so drink plenty of water or fruit juices.\nFor a temperature of above 40\u00b0C, bathe or sponge the skin with lukewarm water (not cold water). Evaporation will have a cooling effect.\nRemain at home and rest.\nRemove extra layers of clothing.\nWhen a newborn has an elevated (or low) temperature.\nIf the sufferer is a child under six months of age.\nWhen the fever is accompanied by a stiff neck, confusion, lack of energy, difficulty in awakening or inconsolability.\nWhen the sufferer has fever and shows signs of febrile seizures: muscles throughout the entire body stiffen, eyes may roll, your child's head may jerk, hands and/or feet may tap, and loss of bowel and urine control may occur.\nPreviously reviewed by Prof Helmuth Reuter, University of Stellenbosch and Tygerberg Academic Hospital\nReviewed by Prof E Weinberg, Emeritus Professor of Paediatrics, May 2011\n.\n"}, {"score": 1069.119, "uuid": "784cc6d4-c6ae-5d77-9f3d-8da718deb9f6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1905wb-38-14439", "target_hostname": "www.flu.gov", "target_uri": "http://www.flu.gov/at-risk/children/", "page_rank": 1.1780815e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>Children</em> &amp; Infants <em>at</em> Risk for the Flu | Flu.gov", "snippet": "When can he <em>or</em> she go to back to school <em>or</em> day care?

Parents have concerns, and there are a lot of myths about bad things that can happen with a fever,\" said the report's lead author, Dr. Janice Sullivan, a professor of pediatric clinical care and clinical pharmacology at the University of Louisville School of Medicine and Kosair Children's Hospital, in Kentucky.\n\"Sometimes, parents think that if they treat a fever that their child will get better faster, but fever is a sign of illness, and it's the body's way of slowing the germs down to help get rid of them. Fever is one of the triggers that your body uses to produce more white cells. If you bring a fever down, your child may not produce as many white cells to fight the infection,\" she explained.\n\"Families need to remember that when a child has a fever, it's a symptom, not the primary problem. Fever may be beneficial, so parents should really look at what's causing the fever, not the fever itself,\" suggested Dr. Basil Zitelli, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\nThe AAP report, which is published in the March issue of Pediatrics, suggests that instead of focusing on the number on the thermometer, parents should let their child's behavior be a guide for whether or not to give fever-reducing medications.\n\"If your child is eating and drinking well, and still engaged in some activities -- though they may not be as active as normal -- and doesn't seem particularly uncomfortable, why take away a natural defense mechanism?\" said Zitelli.\nOn the other hand, if your child seems lethargic and generally uncomfortable, fever-reducing medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may make your child feel a little better. Give these medications as directed by the package or your pediatrician, based on your child's age and weight.\nHowever, the AAP recommends caution when administering these products, as serious, and even life-threatening, overdoses can occur. And, Sullivan said that previous research has shown that about half of parents don't give their children the correct dose of medication.\nSome health-care practitioners have begun recommended that parents alternate the use of these medications, but the AAP said there currently isn't sufficient evidence to either recommend or discourage the use of this practice. But, it did express concern that parents might not receive or fully understand the more complicated dosing regimen required when alternating medications.\nSullivan said that it's important that parents don't give their children adult formulations of anti-fever drugs, even if they attempt to break tablets up to provide the correct dose. \"It's important to use the appropriate medication for the child's age, and to use the appropriate measuring device,\" said Sullivan.\nThe AAP report also reminds parents not to give aspirin to children, as its use has been associated with the development of a potentially life-threatening condition called Reye syndrome. The AAP also recommends against alcohol baths for cooling -- too much alcohol can be absorbed through the skin.\nSullivan said that during well-child visits, parents should have discussion with their pediatricians about what to do when a child becomes ill. And, they should be given advice about when they should call their child's doctor.\nIn general, she said, parents should alert their child's doctor if:\nAn infant is under 3 months old and has a fever of 100.4 F or above.\nAn infant between 3 and 6 months old has a fever of 101.5 F or more.\nAn older child has a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.\nAny child has a fever accompanied by lethargy, headache, skin rash, trouble breathing or dehydration.\nMore information\nLearn more about fever from the Nemours Foundation .\nSOURCES: Janice Sullivan, M.D., professor, pediatric clinical care and clinical pharmacology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, and Kosair Childrens Hospital, Louisville, Ky.; Basil Zitelli, M.D., chief, Paul C.

The following are the most common symptoms of a fever. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. In addition to body temperature greater than 100.4\u00ba F, symptoms may include:\nYour child may not be as active or talkative as usual.\nHe/she may seem fussier, less hungry, and thirstier.\nYour child may feel warm or hot.

A high fever can make your\u00a0child irritable,\u00a0so medicine can be used to lower his temperature if he\u2019s really uncomfortable.\nIf your child has a fever, her body\u2019s probably fighting an infection, and medicine might slow down this process. It\u2019s more important to monitor other symptoms, such as vomiting and coughing, than just looking at her temperature.\nParacetamol is safe if you follow the recommended doses, but an overdose can cause liver failure. Also, giving paracetamol to a child under one year of age has been shown to increase the risk of asthma. Speak to your doctor for further information on suitable medication options for your child.\nParacetamol for children comes in different strengths and varieties, so read the label and follow the instructions carefully. Make sure you give your child the right amount for his weight.\nIbuprofen is a safe alternative to paracetamol, but avoid it if your child is vomiting or has asthma.\nAspirin should never be given to young children, because there\u2019s a strong possibility of serious side effects.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics work only on bacterial infections, not on viruses. Research suggests that children with viral infections such as colds or the flu are being prescribed antibiotics unnecessarily. Using antibiotics incorrectly can lead to side effects such as diarrhoea , dehydration and allergies.\nYour doctor has many different antibiotics to choose from. Some are effective against only certain types of bacteria. Others target a broad range of bacteria and are called \u2018broad-spectrum antibiotics\u2019. Your doctor will try to choose the right antibiotic to fight the bacteria infecting your child. The doctor might also need to order some tests to find out what type of bacteria is causing\u00a0your child\u2019s\u00a0infection.\nThe decision to use antibiotics depends on your doctor, and your child\u2019s symptoms and medical history. If your child needs to take antibiotics, she should complete the entire course of antibiotics, even if she seems better after a few days. Infection might come back a week or two later if the bacteria aren\u2019t completely gone from her system.\nDecongestants\nMany parents give their children decongestants to relieve cold and flu symptoms, but there\u2019s little evidence that these actually work.\nIn fact, coughing is actually a great way to clear mucus from airways, and helps prevent children from getting another infection. Also, drinking plenty of water does more to relieve a cough than medicine \u2013 but do see your doctor if the cough persists, or seems particularly bad.\nDecongestants might cause unpleasant side effects like grumpiness, confusion and sleepiness.\nAntihistamines\nItching, sneezing, swelling or rashes can all be symptoms of allergies. Medications known as antihistamines are used to block these symptoms.\nAntihistamines can sometimes cause dry mouths, drowsiness and upset stomachs. Some brands don\u2019t have a sedating effect (for example, Zyrtec and Claratyne) and are more suitable for your child. Antihistamines can be given with any antibiotic, paracetamol (such as Panadol), ibuprofen (such as Nurofen), decongestants or cough suppressants.\nThey can\u2019t be used to treat croup because they\u2019ll dry out your child\u2019s air passages.\nChildren under two years shouldn\u2019t be given anithistamines. Also, antihistamines aren\u2019t recommended for long-term use, so check with your doctor before giving them to your child.\nPhenergan\nSome parents give their children antihistamines, such as Phenergan (which is one of a few brands of the drug promethazine), to help them sleep. Research shows that antihistamines have almost no effect on children\u2019s sleep patterns. If you\u2019re having trouble getting your child to sleep, our guide to solving sleep problems might help.\nYou might be thinking about giving your child medication to calm difficult behaviour. These medications sometimes cause drowsiness, so they might also affect his ability to learn. On the other hand, they cause some children to become more active and alert.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about giving your child medicine for sleep or behaviour problems, always talk to your doctor first about what\u2019s safe and what will work. You can also find more information in our article on pills, potions and tonics for sleep .\nMedicines to avoid\nThink very carefully before giving your child any medicine that hasn\u2019t been prescribed by a doctor.\nAspirin can make your child susceptible to Reye\u2019s syndrome , a rare but potentially fatal illness. It can also cause serious illness or even death in children with chicken pox or flu symptoms. Not all over-the-counter medicines are aspirin-free, so you need to check this with your pharmacist or doctor, or read the label. Aspirin is sometimes referred to as \u2018salicylate\u2019 or \u2018acetylsalicylic acid\u2019.\nAnti-nausea medications have risks and possible complications. Don\u2019t give your child anti-nausea medication unless the doctor specifically recommends it. Usually vomiting is pretty short-lived, and children can handle it without medication. If your child is vomiting and begins to get dehydrated, contact your doctor immediately.\nIf your child\u00a0is already taking prescribed medicine, it\u2019s best to check with your doctor before giving her any paracetamol\u00a0or ibuprofen. Paracetamol or ibuprofen are found in many over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, so it pays to read the label carefully.\nOral decongestants like Dimetapp Elixir and Demazin Syrup aren\u2019t recommended for children under two years of age.\nAdult medications or medication prescribed for someone else might harm your child. It\u2019s never safe to give these to your child.\nExpired medicine doesn\u2019t work and can even be harmful.\nChewable tablets are too small to give to your child \u2013 he can easily\u00a0choke on them.\nIf you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s in a particular medicine, ask the pharmacist or your child\u2019s doctor.\nMixing prescription medicine and over-the-counter medicine from a pharmacist can be very dangerous. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist first.\nVitamins: a good idea?\nThere\u2019s no evidence that vitamin and mineral supplements help children\u2019s health in any way unless the child has a deficiency of some kind \u2013 and very few children suffer from these deficiencies. Check with your doctor if you think this might be the case with your child.\nYou might also like to read our article on vitamins and minerals .\nWhat to ask your doctor and pharmacist\nWhen your doctor prescribes medicine for your child, you might like to ask:\n\u2018What\u2019s the medicine prescribed for?\u2019\n\u2018Will it have side effects?\u2019 (For example, high doses of vitamins A and D can accumulate in the body\u00a0and cause\u00a0side effects.)\n\u2018How soon will it start to work?\u2019\n\u2018How much should I give my child, and how should I give it to her?\u2019\n\u2018Should I give the medicine at any specific time, like before or after food?\u2019\n\u2018How long should the prescription last?\u2019\n\u2018Will the medicine interact or interfere with anything else my child is taking?\u2019\n\u2018Does the medicine need to be kept in the fridge or away from light or heat?\u2019\n\u2018Can I put the medicine in food, or should I be giving my child certain foods with the medicine?\u2019\nIf you\u2019re getting over-the-counter medicine from the chemist, you should ask the pharmacist all the questions above. Also ask whether the medicine is safe for your child, how long you should wait to visit your doctor if problems don\u2019t go away, and whether there\u2019s any alcohol or aspirin in the ingredients.\nRated\n"}, {"score": 941.475, "uuid": "4f3c4826-ae16-5cd6-9575-c755541a8d7d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0502wb-39-13891", "target_hostname": "www.medicalnewstoday.com", "target_uri": "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/184802.php", "page_rank": 1.2067991e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>Is</em> Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?", "snippet": "Please use one of the following formats to cite this article <em>in</em> your essay, paper <em>or</em> report: &quot;<em>What</em> <em>Is</em> Chronic Fatigue Syndrome? <em>What</em> Causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?.&quot; &quot;<em>What</em> <em>Is</em> Chronic Fatigue Syndrome? <em>What</em> Causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?.&quot;", "explanation": null, "document": "What Is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome? What Causes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nEditor's Choice\n1 posts\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome is a condition of prolonged and severe tiredness or weariness ( fatigue ) that is not relieved by rest and is not directly caused by other conditions. To be diagnosed with this condition, your tiredness must be severe enough to decrease your ability to participate in ordinary activities by 50%.\nAccording to Medilexicon's medical dictionary :\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome is a syndrome of persistent incapacitating weakness or fatigue, accompanied by nonspecific somatic symptoms, lasting at least 6 months, and not attributable to any known cause.\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS or ME/CFS) is much more than just being tired a lot. People with ME/CFS are so run down that it interferes with their lives and can make it hard to function at all. Some people with ME/CFS say they have trouble staying on top of their responsibilities at home and on the job, while others are severely disabled and even bedridden. Furthermore, they're not just dealing with extreme fatigue but with a wide range of other symptoms, including flu-like symptoms and chronic pain.\nWhen referring to chronic fatigue syndrome, patients and patient advocates often prefer to call the condition chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) to convey the complexity of the illness and its profound impact on people's lives.\nFor unknown reasons CFS occurs most often in people in their 40s and 50s, more often in women than men, and is less prevalent among children and adolescents.\nEmployment rates through the past decade vary with over half unable to work and nearly two-thirds limited in their work because of their illness. More than half were on disability benefits or temporary sick leave, and less than a fifth worked full-time.\nLiterature on ME/CFS (by different names) dates back to the 1700s. Through the centuries, it's been falsely attributed to various causes and is only now beginning to be better understood by medical science.\nWhat are the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nA symptom is something the patient senses and describes, while a sign is something other people, such as the doctor notice. For example, drowsiness may be a symptom while dilated pupils may be a sign.\nSymptoms of CFS are similar to those of most common viral infections (muscle aches, headache , and fatigue). They come on within a few hours or days and last for 6 months or more.\nExamples of chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms include headaches, tender lymph nodes, sore throat , muscle pain, joint pain, feeling tired, and feeling discomfort after physical exertion. These symptoms either stay with a person or come and go for more than six months. It's important to note that the signs and symptoms are often similar to those of other health conditions.\nPatients report critical reductions in levels of physical activity and a reduction in the complexity of activity has been observed, with reported impairment comparable to other fatiguing medical conditions such as late-stage AIDS , lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the effects of chemotherapy. CFS affects a person's functional status and well-being more than major medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis , congestive heart failure , or type II diabetes mellitus. While some lead relatively normal lives, others are totally bed-ridden and unable to care for themselves.\nWhat are the causes of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nThe cause of CFS is unknown. To discover possible triggers, researchers are studying the relationship between stress , the immune system, toxins, the central nervous system, and activation of latent virus.\nSome researchers suspect it may be caused by a virus, such as Epstein-Barr virus or human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6). However, no specific virus has been identified as the cause.\nStudies suggest that CFS may be caused by inflammation along the nervous system, and that this inflammation may be some sort of immune response or process.\nOther factors such as age, prior illness, stress, environment, or genetics may also play a role.\nDiagnosing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nSince there is not a specific lab test that reliably identifies chronic fatigue syndrome, and because CFS closely resembles other illnesses such as mononucleosis, fibromyalgia , Lyme disease , and multiple sclerosis, the first diagnostic step usually involves a series of tests that will help the physician rule out other illnesses.\nWhat are the treatment options for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nThe main goal of CFS treatment is to achieve symptom relief.\nCFS patients should avoid overexertion and physical and emotional stress. Moderate exercise that is monitored by a doctor or physical therapist may improve symptoms. Light exercise and stretching four hours before bedtime may help with sleep.\nCognitive behavioral therapy, activity pacing, and envelope theory can help moderate activity and spread it evenly throughout the day, without overexertion.\nMedications used to treat specific symptoms of CFS include antidepressants to help improve sleep and relieve depression , anti-anxiety drugs to treat panic disorders, acetaminophen (Tylenol); aspirin (Bayer); and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ), such as ibuprofen (eg, Advil, Motrin) to treat pain and fever .\nStimulants may be helpful, but strong stimulants may cause the \"push-crash cycle\" and lead to relapse.\nPreventing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nThere are no guidelines for preventing CFS because the cause is unknown.\nWritten by Sy Kraft (B.A.)\nCopyright: Medical News Today\n"}, {"score": 933.7147, "uuid": "3b2b988a-312f-505d-ae3f-55cd4fb3ff0b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-91-03155", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Asthma+in+children+and+adolescents", "page_rank": 1.1712931e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Asthma <em>in</em> <em>children</em> and adolescents Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) <em>in</em> the nasal passages.

Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nWheezing is nearly always present during an attack.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in patients with asthma.\nCoughing. In some people, the first symptom of asthma is a nonproductive cough. The cough may be worse at night.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAny of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nThe following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly to a serious condition, but at times a fatal or near-fatal attack may develop within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious.\nEarly symptoms or lack thereof do not always reflect the ultimate severity of an attack. Some studies even suggest that people at high risk for fatal or near-fatal asthma attacks are those with poor awareness of their own reduced ability to breathe and who are slow in seeking help. Monitoring peak flow rates is an important management component since it provides a more accurate assessment of lung function than symptoms alone.\nExercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People who have only EIA do not appear to need long-term maintenance therapy.\nClick the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of patients with the condition. Attacks often occur between 2 - 4 a.m. Some experts believe that nocturnal asthma may actually be a unique form of asthma, with its own specific biologic mechanisms occuring only at night and reducing natural steroid hormones (which block inflammation).\nBack to Top\nCauses\nAsthma occurs in about 5 million American children. Each year about 200,000 of them are hospitalized. It is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.\nGeneral Causes of Asthma\nThe mechanisms that cause asthma are complex and vary among population groups and even individuals. For example, asthma in children is highly associated with allergies. However, only a minority of children with allergies have asthma, and allergic response cannot explain all cases of asthma. Other factors, such as genetics or environmental conditions, are probably involved in the development of asthma. Most likely, several genes combine to make a child susceptible to environmental triggers, not only allergens but also possibly infections, dietary patterns, or air pollution. Physical factors, particularly having smaller lungs, affect the chances for later asthma.\nThe Allergic Response\nAsthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also at greater risk for developing asthma as adults.\nThe allergic process, called atopy, and its connection to asthma are not completely understood. The process involves various airborne allergens or other triggers that set off a cascade of events in the immune system, leading to inflammation and hyperreactivity in the airways. Here is an example of the allergic process::\nThe conductor in an orchestra of immune factors that contribute to allergies and asthma appears to be a category of white blood cells known as helper T cells, in particular a subgroup called Th2 cells.\nTh2 cells overproduce interleukins (ILs), immune factors that stimulate the production and release of antibody groups known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). (People with both asthma and allergies appear to have a genetic predisposition for overproducing IgE.)\nDuring an allergic attack, these IgE antibodies can bind to special cells in the immune system called mast cells, which are generally concentrated in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes. This bond triggers the release of a number of active chemicals, importantly potent molecules known as leukotrienes. These chemicals cause airway spasms, overproduce mucus, and activate nerve endings in the airway lining.\nOne specific interleukin attracts white blood cells known as eosinophils. These cells accumulate and remain in the airways after the first attack. They persist for weeks and mediate the release of other damaging particles that remain in the airways.\nOver the course of years the repetition of the inflammatory events involved in asthma can cause irreversible structural and functional changes in the airways, a process called remodeling. The remodeled airways are persistently narrow and can cause chronic asthma. Researchers are trying to determine how this process occurs.\nEnvironmental Factors\nAn asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants or allergens include the following:\nSmoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases their babie's risks for asthma\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.\nAnimal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on. When children are exposed to more than one dog or cat during their first year, they have a much lower risk for allergies and asthma.\nMolds.\nCockroaches. Cockroaches are major asthma triggers and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nPollen. An asthma attack from an allergic response to pollen is more likely to occur during extreme air changes, such as thunderstorms. Major weather changes, such as El Nino, can affect the timing of allergy seasons because they cause seasonal changes (and pollen) to start earlier.\nFood allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies. These children also appear to have a high risk for very serious reactions to such foods. In infants and toddlers, allergy to eggs appears to be a predictor of asthma.\nFossil Fuels. Certain chemicals may trigger allergic rhinitis. Some experts believe that refined fossil fuels, such as diesel fuel and particularly kerosene, may be important triggers for allergic rhinitis. In people who already have allergies or asthma, exposure to such fossil fuels may worsen symptoms.\nGenetic Factors\nAbout one-third of all persons with asthma share this condition with another member of their immediate family. Asthma may be more likely to be passed to children from the mother than from the father. Both allergies and asthma are strongly associated with hereditary factors, sharing certain genetic markers, but they are not always inherited together.\nResearch on the genetics of these conditions is confusing. While candidate genes have been identified, no specific genetic variant enhances the risk for asthma across all populations. Multiple genetic variants probably exist and play a role in the incidence of asthma and its response to different treatments. Expression of this genetic trait, however, varies across different populations.\nThe Complex Role of Early Infections\nThe role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.\nEarly Respiratory Infections as Causes of Asthma. Studies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has been implicated in the development of asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.\nCommon respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. A 2007 study suggested that children who have a wheezing rhinovirus during infancy are at increased risk for developing asthma by age 6. Even if these viruses do not directly cause asthma, they can worsen asthma in children who already have it. Rhinovirus has been reported to be the most common infection associated with asthma attacks. In one study, it was associated with 61% of asthma worsening in children. Some research suggests that colds promote inflammation in patients with existing asthma and increase the intensity of airway responsiveness for weeks.\nThe Hygiene Theory: Early Infections as Protection Against Asthma. This theory associates the increased incidence in asthma with a reduction in childhood infections that have occurred with modern hygiene and antibiotic use. The basic theory rests on the idea that infections that occur early in life stimulate production of specific immune factors called Th1 cells. As these cells build up, they replace other immune factors called Th2 cells, which react to allergens -- a less serious threat to the body. Without infections to stimulate the production of the Th1 infection fighters, the Th2 allergen fighters are not replaced, and they persist at high levels, making the growing child more susceptible to allergies and asthma.\nSome studies suggest that being part of a large family or attending day care increases the risk for early respiratory infections but reduces the risk of childhood asthma. The occasional cold, then, may be protective.\nThe standard vaccinations against serious childhood infections, according to several important studies, pose no risk for asthma. No one should stop giving their children vaccinations against childhood killers.\nBack to Top\nPrognosis\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma is rarely fatal in children, with only 187 asthma deaths reported in 2002 in children under age 18. In fact, a 2006 study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that asthma death rates for children have steadily declined since 1999. (During the same time, the number of doctor visits for asthma treatment more than doubled.) Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma\nTwo or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the past year\nUsing two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral or psychosocial problems\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat\nAfrican-American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk.\nLong-Term Outlook\nIn a study published in 2003, researchers followed people with asthma for more than 30 years. About a third of children had outgrown their asthma in adulthood. In general, the more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will persist. For example, only 23% of children who experienced wheezy bronchitis (wheezing during respiratory infections) suffered from frequent or persistent asthma in adulthood.\nThere is evidence that severe asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest, however, when asthma strikes children in the first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nPsychologic Factors\nStudies are mixed over the effects of emotional disorders on the severity of asthma. One study indicated that parents of children with asthma may suffer greater psychological stress than their children. A 2000 study reported that mild-to-moderate asthma does not significantly affect the psychological well-being of most children ages 5 - 12. Teenagers and preteens may have particular difficulty coping with what they perceive as the social stigma of asthma. Parents and older children should not hesitate to seek help from support groups, doctors, friends, or family members. Support programs may help children to better manage their asthma and even reduce hospitalization.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAsthma affects about 5 million American children ages of 5 - 14. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. From 1980 - 1994, asthma increased 160% in American children younger than 4 years and. Experts are puzzling over the cause of this phenomenon.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it may be more common in girls.\nSocioeconomic Factors\nUrban Life. Urban life is strongly associated with a higher risk. Although poverty plays a significant role, urban life has been associated with a higher risk for asthma in any income group and among both children and adults. In some urban areas, as many as 25% of children have asthma or show signs of wheezing. In fact, it may be greatly underdiagnosed in city children.\nEthnicity. Since 1980, asthma rates have risen the most dramatically among African-American children, and they have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children.\nSome studies indicate that the difference in risk exists simply because African-Americans and other minority groups are more likely to live in urban areas. Poverty and lack of access to health care also play a role. However, Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma, and rural African-American children do not.\nUrban life and socioeconomic factors, however, may not fully explain the ethnic disparity.\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nA variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies include:\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. Children born in the winter may have a greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nVitamin D. Pregnant women who have a higher intake of vitamin D may be less likely to give birth to children who develop asthma.\nBreastfeeding. Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 3 months of life can help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for the child's first 6 months.\nComplications of Pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nIn both adults and children, the incidence of obesity and asthma has been increasing over recent years. Studies report a strong association between the two conditions. Some experts suggest that excess weight pressing on the lungs may trigger the hyperreactive response in the airways typical of asthma. Others believe that asthma leads to obesity by inhibiting physical activity, although several studies have found no difference in activity levels between people with or without asthma. Some studies suggest that many obese people may be misdiagnosed as having asthma when they are simply short of breath, possibly because of the increased effort required for breathing.\nIn any case, there is evidence that losing weight can relieve asthma symptoms. Some evidence also suggests that people who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath reduces airway obstruction and improves lung function. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #53: Weight control and diet .].\nOther Risk Factors\nGERD. At least half of patients with asthma also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors.\nGERD is sometimes hard to detect and might be suspected as a contributor in the following patients:\nThose who do not respond to asthma treatments\nThose whose asthma attacks follow episodes of heartburn\nThose whose attacks are worse after eating or exercise\nThose whose coughs follow episodes of acid reflux. (One study found that GERD was associated with about half of the episodes of coughs and wheezes in patients with asthma.)\n[For more information, see In-Depth Report #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease .]\nSinusitis. Almost half of children and adults with allergic asthma have sinus abnormalities, and in various studies, 17 - 30% of patients with asthma develop true sinusitis. The presence of sinusitis, however, does not appear to increase the severity of asthma.\nClick the icon to see an image of sinusitis.\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. About 10% of adults and some fewer children have aspirin-induced asthma (AIA). With this condition, asthma gets worse when patients take aspirin. Aspirin is one of the drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although aspirin is used to reduce inflammation in other disorders, it appears to have the opposite effect in some asthma cases. It is not wholly known why this occurs. AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition and is associated with up to 25% of asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nPatients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and most likely NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).\nDiagnosis\nPulmonary Function Tests\nIf symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor will usually perform tests known as pulmonary function tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:\nVital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or exhaled.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.\nForced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 second.\nIf the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on the results, the doctor will take the following steps:\nIf measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a bronchodilator. This drug is used in asthma to open the air passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma is strongly suspected.\nIf measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is still suspected, the doctor may perform a challenge test. It involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests may be the best predictive test for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOther Tests\nTests that either rule out other diseases or obtain more information about the causes of asthma include:\nA complete blood count\nChest and sinus x-rays\nComputed tomography (CT) scans. CT scans may be helpful in certain cases, such as for determining wall thickness in airways in patients who are difficult to treat, which could signify a higher risk for lung damage.\nExamination of the patient's sputum for eosinophils (white blood cells that in high levels are associated with severe allergic asthma).\nResearchers are investigating measurements of certain chemicals in sputum or exhaled air that indicate airway inflammation. Such chemical markers include nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide.\nTreatment\nGeneral Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma\nWhile medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, appropriate management of asthma involves much more:\nIdentifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers\nFollowing appropriate drug treatments\nHome monitoring performed by either patient or family\nGood communication between the doctor and patient\nNeeded psychosocial support\nTreatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)\nThe severity of asthma has now been classified into four groupings: Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:\nSymptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout the day\nNighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly\nShort-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or fewer days per week to several times per day\nInterference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited\nLung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary function testing at the doctor's office\nNumber of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.\nOnce patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age groupings:\n4 years old or younger\n5 - 11 years old\nTreating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease\nMedications for asthma fall into two categories:\nRescue (Quick-Relief) Medications. Medications that open the airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.\nLong-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications. Long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For adults and children over age 5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, experts now recommend inhaled corticosteroids with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.\nThe goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children's asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time. Unfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.\nThese are the signs of well-controlled asthma:\nAsthma symptoms occur twice a week or less\nRescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less\nSymptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening\nSymptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities\nPeak flow meter readings are normal or the patient's personal best\nBoth the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled\nSteps for Treating Asthma\nA stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on severity of patients' asthma and their age, there are specific recommendations regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations based on a specific patient.\nIn choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks to assess response.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger include:\nLong-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.\nNebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer medications to children this age.\nOnly certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are recommended for these children.\nClose follow-up is recommended\nAvoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:\nParticipation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged.\nSchools, child care, and camps. should all have a copy of the asthma action plan.\nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies that are usually used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.\nAvoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.\nThe variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.\nDevices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), breath-actuated inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering any asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.\nThe spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient additional time to inhale. They vary, however, in their effectiveness. It should be noted that MDIs can continue to deliver propellant even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing a metered dose inhaler.\nBreath-Actuated Inhalers. Breath-actuated rotary inhalers (Easi-Breathe and Autohaler) deliver the drug directly to the back of the throat as the user inhales. Their primary advantage over the MDI is their ease of use. They also do not use CFCs as propellants. In comparison studies, patients have been very successful with the breath-actuated inhalers. They are not recommended for children under 8 years old.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Such devices include Rotahaler, Spinhaler, Turbohaler, Clickhaler, Easyhaler, Diskhaler, Discus, Twisthaler, Spiros, and others. DPIs are as effective as the older devices, and generally have a better taste and are easier to manage. They may differ, however, in their ability to deliver drugs into the airways. In one study, for example, the Turbohaler was easier to use than the Diskhaler, and it achieved better delivery.\nHumidity or extreme temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.\nOther Hand-Held Inhalers. Respimat delivers a fine-mist spray that is created by forcing the liquid medication through nozzles. It does not use any propellant.\nNebulizers. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects.\nChildren who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. The misuse of home nebulizers may be an important factor in asthma deaths in children and young adults. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable at home.\n"}, {"score": 933.47375, "uuid": "eadc84e9-48d4-5093-a983-87b0b108adef", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-17-15908", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/DiseasesandConditions/item/Asthma+in+children+and+adolescents", "page_rank": 1.1793515e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Asthma <em>in</em> <em>children</em> and adolescents Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) <em>in</em> the nasal passages.

Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nWheezing is nearly always present during an attack.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in patients with asthma.\nCoughing. In some people, the first symptom of asthma is a nonproductive cough. The cough may be worse at night.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAny of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nThe following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly to a serious condition, but at times a fatal or near-fatal attack may develop within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious.\nEarly symptoms or lack thereof do not always reflect the ultimate severity of an attack. Some studies even suggest that people at high risk for fatal or near-fatal asthma attacks are those with poor awareness of their own reduced ability to breathe and who are slow in seeking help. Monitoring peak flow rates is an important management component since it provides a more accurate assessment of lung function than symptoms alone.\nExercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People who have only EIA do not appear to need long-term maintenance therapy.\nClick the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of patients with the condition. Attacks often occur between 2 - 4 a.m. Some experts believe that nocturnal asthma may actually be a unique form of asthma, with its own specific biologic mechanisms occuring only at night and reducing natural steroid hormones (which block inflammation).\nBack to Top\nCauses\nAsthma occurs in about 5 million American children. Each year about 200,000 of them are hospitalized. It is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.\nGeneral Causes of Asthma\nThe mechanisms that cause asthma are complex and vary among population groups and even individuals. For example, asthma in children is highly associated with allergies. However, only a minority of children with allergies have asthma, and allergic response cannot explain all cases of asthma. Other factors, such as genetics or environmental conditions, are probably involved in the development of asthma. Most likely, several genes combine to make a child susceptible to environmental triggers, not only allergens but also possibly infections, dietary patterns, or air pollution. Physical factors, particularly having smaller lungs, affect the chances for later asthma.\nThe Allergic Response\nAsthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also at greater risk for developing asthma as adults.\nThe allergic process, called atopy, and its connection to asthma are not completely understood. The process involves various airborne allergens or other triggers that set off a cascade of events in the immune system, leading to inflammation and hyperreactivity in the airways. Here is an example of the allergic process::\nThe conductor in an orchestra of immune factors that contribute to allergies and asthma appears to be a category of white blood cells known as helper T cells, in particular a subgroup called Th2 cells.\nTh2 cells overproduce interleukins (ILs), immune factors that stimulate the production and release of antibody groups known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). (People with both asthma and allergies appear to have a genetic predisposition for overproducing IgE.)\nDuring an allergic attack, these IgE antibodies can bind to special cells in the immune system called mast cells, which are generally concentrated in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes. This bond triggers the release of a number of active chemicals, importantly potent molecules known as leukotrienes. These chemicals cause airway spasms, overproduce mucus, and activate nerve endings in the airway lining.\nOne specific interleukin attracts white blood cells known as eosinophils. These cells accumulate and remain in the airways after the first attack. They persist for weeks and mediate the release of other damaging particles that remain in the airways.\nOver the course of years the repetition of the inflammatory events involved in asthma can cause irreversible structural and functional changes in the airways, a process called remodeling. The remodeled airways are persistently narrow and can cause chronic asthma. Researchers are trying to determine how this process occurs.\nEnvironmental Factors\nAn asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants or allergens include the following:\nSmoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases their babie's risks for asthma\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.\nAnimal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on. When children are exposed to more than one dog or cat during their first year, they have a much lower risk for allergies and asthma.\nMolds.\nCockroaches. Cockroaches are major asthma triggers and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nPollen. An asthma attack from an allergic response to pollen is more likely to occur during extreme air changes, such as thunderstorms. Major weather changes, such as El Nino, can affect the timing of allergy seasons because they cause seasonal changes (and pollen) to start earlier.\nFood allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies. These children also appear to have a high risk for very serious reactions to such foods. In infants and toddlers, allergy to eggs appears to be a predictor of asthma.\nFossil Fuels. Certain chemicals may trigger allergic rhinitis. Some experts believe that refined fossil fuels, such as diesel fuel and particularly kerosene, may be important triggers for allergic rhinitis. In people who already have allergies or asthma, exposure to such fossil fuels may worsen symptoms.\nGenetic Factors\nAbout one-third of all persons with asthma share this condition with another member of their immediate family. Asthma may be more likely to be passed to children from the mother than from the father. Both allergies and asthma are strongly associated with hereditary factors, sharing certain genetic markers, but they are not always inherited together.\nResearch on the genetics of these conditions is confusing. While candidate genes have been identified, no specific genetic variant enhances the risk for asthma across all populations. Multiple genetic variants probably exist and play a role in the incidence of asthma and its response to different treatments. Expression of this genetic trait, however, varies across different populations.\nThe Complex Role of Early Infections\nThe role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.\nEarly Respiratory Infections as Causes of Asthma. Studies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has been implicated in the development of asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.\nCommon respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. A 2007 study suggested that children who have a wheezing rhinovirus during infancy are at increased risk for developing asthma by age 6. Even if these viruses do not directly cause asthma, they can worsen asthma in children who already have it. Rhinovirus has been reported to be the most common infection associated with asthma attacks. In one study, it was associated with 61% of asthma worsening in children. Some research suggests that colds promote inflammation in patients with existing asthma and increase the intensity of airway responsiveness for weeks.\nThe Hygiene Theory: Early Infections as Protection Against Asthma. This theory associates the increased incidence in asthma with a reduction in childhood infections that have occurred with modern hygiene and antibiotic use. The basic theory rests on the idea that infections that occur early in life stimulate production of specific immune factors called Th1 cells. As these cells build up, they replace other immune factors called Th2 cells, which react to allergens -- a less serious threat to the body. Without infections to stimulate the production of the Th1 infection fighters, the Th2 allergen fighters are not replaced, and they persist at high levels, making the growing child more susceptible to allergies and asthma.\nSome studies suggest that being part of a large family or attending day care increases the risk for early respiratory infections but reduces the risk of childhood asthma. The occasional cold, then, may be protective.\nThe standard vaccinations against serious childhood infections, according to several important studies, pose no risk for asthma. No one should stop giving their children vaccinations against childhood killers.\nBack to Top\nPrognosis\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma is rarely fatal in children, with only 187 asthma deaths reported in 2002 in children under age 18. In fact, a 2006 study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that asthma death rates for children have steadily declined since 1999. (During the same time, the number of doctor visits for asthma treatment more than doubled.) Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma\nTwo or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the past year\nUsing two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral or psychosocial problems\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat\nAfrican-American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk.\nLong-Term Outlook\nIn a study published in 2003, researchers followed people with asthma for more than 30 years. About a third of children had outgrown their asthma in adulthood. In general, the more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will persist. For example, only 23% of children who experienced wheezy bronchitis (wheezing during respiratory infections) suffered from frequent or persistent asthma in adulthood.\nThere is evidence that severe asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest, however, when asthma strikes children in the first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nPsychologic Factors\nStudies are mixed over the effects of emotional disorders on the severity of asthma. One study indicated that parents of children with asthma may suffer greater psychological stress than their children. A 2000 study reported that mild-to-moderate asthma does not significantly affect the psychological well-being of most children ages 5 - 12. Teenagers and preteens may have particular difficulty coping with what they perceive as the social stigma of asthma. Parents and older children should not hesitate to seek help from support groups, doctors, friends, or family members. Support programs may help children to better manage their asthma and even reduce hospitalization.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAsthma affects about 5 million American children ages of 5 - 14. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. From 1980 - 1994, asthma increased 160% in American children younger than 4 years and. Experts are puzzling over the cause of this phenomenon.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it may be more common in girls.\nSocioeconomic Factors\nUrban Life. Urban life is strongly associated with a higher risk. Although poverty plays a significant role, urban life has been associated with a higher risk for asthma in any income group and among both children and adults. In some urban areas, as many as 25% of children have asthma or show signs of wheezing. In fact, it may be greatly underdiagnosed in city children.\nEthnicity. Since 1980, asthma rates have risen the most dramatically among African-American children, and they have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children.\nSome studies indicate that the difference in risk exists simply because African-Americans and other minority groups are more likely to live in urban areas. Poverty and lack of access to health care also play a role. However, Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma, and rural African-American children do not.\nUrban life and socioeconomic factors, however, may not fully explain the ethnic disparity.\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nA variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies include:\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. Children born in the winter may have a greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nVitamin D. Pregnant women who have a higher intake of vitamin D may be less likely to give birth to children who develop asthma.\nBreastfeeding. Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 3 months of life can help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for the child's first 6 months.\nComplications of Pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nIn both adults and children, the incidence of obesity and asthma has been increasing over recent years. Studies report a strong association between the two conditions. Some experts suggest that excess weight pressing on the lungs may trigger the hyperreactive response in the airways typical of asthma. Others believe that asthma leads to obesity by inhibiting physical activity, although several studies have found no difference in activity levels between people with or without asthma. Some studies suggest that many obese people may be misdiagnosed as having asthma when they are simply short of breath, possibly because of the increased effort required for breathing.\nIn any case, there is evidence that losing weight can relieve asthma symptoms. Some evidence also suggests that people who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath reduces airway obstruction and improves lung function. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #53: Weight control and diet .].\nOther Risk Factors\nGERD. At least half of patients with asthma also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors.\nGERD is sometimes hard to detect and might be suspected as a contributor in the following patients:\nThose who do not respond to asthma treatments\nThose whose asthma attacks follow episodes of heartburn\nThose whose attacks are worse after eating or exercise\nThose whose coughs follow episodes of acid reflux. (One study found that GERD was associated with about half of the episodes of coughs and wheezes in patients with asthma.)\n[For more information, see In-Depth Report #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease .]\nSinusitis. Almost half of children and adults with allergic asthma have sinus abnormalities, and in various studies, 17 - 30% of patients with asthma develop true sinusitis. The presence of sinusitis, however, does not appear to increase the severity of asthma.\nClick the icon to see an image of sinusitis.\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. About 10% of adults and some fewer children have aspirin-induced asthma (AIA). With this condition, asthma gets worse when patients take aspirin. Aspirin is one of the drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although aspirin is used to reduce inflammation in other disorders, it appears to have the opposite effect in some asthma cases. It is not wholly known why this occurs. AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition and is associated with up to 25% of asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nPatients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and most likely NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).\nDiagnosis\nPulmonary Function Tests\nIf symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor will usually perform tests known as pulmonary function tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:\nVital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or exhaled.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.\nForced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 second.\nIf the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on the results, the doctor will take the following steps:\nIf measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a bronchodilator. This drug is used in asthma to open the air passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma is strongly suspected.\nIf measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is still suspected, the doctor may perform a challenge test. It involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests may be the best predictive test for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOther Tests\nTests that either rule out other diseases or obtain more information about the causes of asthma include:\nA complete blood count\nChest and sinus x-rays\nComputed tomography (CT) scans. CT scans may be helpful in certain cases, such as for determining wall thickness in airways in patients who are difficult to treat, which could signify a higher risk for lung damage.\nExamination of the patient's sputum for eosinophils (white blood cells that in high levels are associated with severe allergic asthma).\nResearchers are investigating measurements of certain chemicals in sputum or exhaled air that indicate airway inflammation. Such chemical markers include nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide.\nTreatment\nGeneral Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma\nWhile medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, appropriate management of asthma involves much more:\nIdentifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers\nFollowing appropriate drug treatments\nHome monitoring performed by either patient or family\nGood communication between the doctor and patient\nNeeded psychosocial support\nTreatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)\nThe severity of asthma has now been classified into four groupings: Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:\nSymptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout the day\nNighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly\nShort-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or fewer days per week to several times per day\nInterference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited\nLung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary function testing at the doctor's office\nNumber of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.\nOnce patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age groupings:\n4 years old or younger\n5 - 11 years old\nTreating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease\nMedications for asthma fall into two categories:\nRescue (Quick-Relief) Medications. Medications that open the airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.\nLong-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications. Long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For adults and children over age 5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, experts now recommend inhaled corticosteroids with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.\nThe goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children's asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time. Unfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.\nThese are the signs of well-controlled asthma:\nAsthma symptoms occur twice a week or less\nRescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less\nSymptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening\nSymptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities\nPeak flow meter readings are normal or the patient's personal best\nBoth the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled\nSteps for Treating Asthma\nA stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on severity of patients' asthma and their age, there are specific recommendations regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations based on a specific patient.\nIn choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks to assess response.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger include:\nLong-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.\nNebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer medications to children this age.\nOnly certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are recommended for these children.\nClose follow-up is recommended\nAvoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:\nParticipation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged.\nSchools, child care, and camps. should all have a copy of the asthma action plan.\nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies that are usually used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.\nAvoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.\nThe variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.\nDevices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), breath-actuated inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering any asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.\nThe spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient additional time to inhale. They vary, however, in their effectiveness. It should be noted that MDIs can continue to deliver propellant even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing a metered dose inhaler.\nBreath-Actuated Inhalers. Breath-actuated rotary inhalers (Easi-Breathe and Autohaler) deliver the drug directly to the back of the throat as the user inhales. Their primary advantage over the MDI is their ease of use. They also do not use CFCs as propellants. In comparison studies, patients have been very successful with the breath-actuated inhalers. They are not recommended for children under 8 years old.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Such devices include Rotahaler, Spinhaler, Turbohaler, Clickhaler, Easyhaler, Diskhaler, Discus, Twisthaler, Spiros, and others. DPIs are as effective as the older devices, and generally have a better taste and are easier to manage. They may differ, however, in their ability to deliver drugs into the airways. In one study, for example, the Turbohaler was easier to use than the Diskhaler, and it achieved better delivery.\nHumidity or extreme temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.\nOther Hand-Held Inhalers. Respimat delivers a fine-mist spray that is created by forcing the liquid medication through nozzles. It does not use any propellant.\nNebulizers. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects.\nChildren who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. The misuse of home nebulizers may be an important factor in asthma deaths in children and young adults. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable at home.\n"}, {"score": 933.43835, "uuid": "38b9f05a-f0a9-5a3c-8d77-7df211678bc7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0208wb-84-25521", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/Asthma+in+children+and+adolescents", "page_rank": 1.1834616e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Asthma <em>in</em> <em>children</em> and adolescents Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) <em>in</em> the nasal passages.

Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nWheezing is nearly always present during an attack.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in patients with asthma.\nCoughing. In some people, the first symptom of asthma is a nonproductive cough. The cough may be worse at night.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAny of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nThe following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly to a serious condition, but at times a fatal or near-fatal attack may develop within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious.\nEarly symptoms or lack thereof do not always reflect the ultimate severity of an attack. Some studies even suggest that people at high risk for fatal or near-fatal asthma attacks are those with poor awareness of their own reduced ability to breathe and who are slow in seeking help. Monitoring peak flow rates is an important management component since it provides a more accurate assessment of lung function than symptoms alone.\nExercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People who have only EIA do not appear to need long-term maintenance therapy.\nClick the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of patients with the condition. Attacks often occur between 2 - 4 a.m. Some experts believe that nocturnal asthma may actually be a unique form of asthma, with its own specific biologic mechanisms occuring only at night and reducing natural steroid hormones (which block inflammation).\nBack to Top\nCauses\nAsthma occurs in about 5 million American children. Each year about 200,000 of them are hospitalized. It is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.\nGeneral Causes of Asthma\nThe mechanisms that cause asthma are complex and vary among population groups and even individuals. For example, asthma in children is highly associated with allergies. However, only a minority of children with allergies have asthma, and allergic response cannot explain all cases of asthma. Other factors, such as genetics or environmental conditions, are probably involved in the development of asthma. Most likely, several genes combine to make a child susceptible to environmental triggers, not only allergens but also possibly infections, dietary patterns, or air pollution. Physical factors, particularly having smaller lungs, affect the chances for later asthma.\nThe Allergic Response\nAsthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also at greater risk for developing asthma as adults.\nThe allergic process, called atopy, and its connection to asthma are not completely understood. The process involves various airborne allergens or other triggers that set off a cascade of events in the immune system, leading to inflammation and hyperreactivity in the airways. Here is an example of the allergic process::\nThe conductor in an orchestra of immune factors that contribute to allergies and asthma appears to be a category of white blood cells known as helper T cells, in particular a subgroup called Th2 cells.\nTh2 cells overproduce interleukins (ILs), immune factors that stimulate the production and release of antibody groups known as immunoglobulin E (IgE). (People with both asthma and allergies appear to have a genetic predisposition for overproducing IgE.)\nDuring an allergic attack, these IgE antibodies can bind to special cells in the immune system called mast cells, which are generally concentrated in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes. This bond triggers the release of a number of active chemicals, importantly potent molecules known as leukotrienes. These chemicals cause airway spasms, overproduce mucus, and activate nerve endings in the airway lining.\nOne specific interleukin attracts white blood cells known as eosinophils. These cells accumulate and remain in the airways after the first attack. They persist for weeks and mediate the release of other damaging particles that remain in the airways.\nOver the course of years the repetition of the inflammatory events involved in asthma can cause irreversible structural and functional changes in the airways, a process called remodeling. The remodeled airways are persistently narrow and can cause chronic asthma. Researchers are trying to determine how this process occurs.\nEnvironmental Factors\nAn asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants or allergens include the following:\nSmoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases their babie's risks for asthma\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.\nAnimal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on. When children are exposed to more than one dog or cat during their first year, they have a much lower risk for allergies and asthma.\nMolds.\nCockroaches. Cockroaches are major asthma triggers and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nPollen. An asthma attack from an allergic response to pollen is more likely to occur during extreme air changes, such as thunderstorms. Major weather changes, such as El Nino, can affect the timing of allergy seasons because they cause seasonal changes (and pollen) to start earlier.\nFood allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies. These children also appear to have a high risk for very serious reactions to such foods. In infants and toddlers, allergy to eggs appears to be a predictor of asthma.\nFossil Fuels. Certain chemicals may trigger allergic rhinitis. Some experts believe that refined fossil fuels, such as diesel fuel and particularly kerosene, may be important triggers for allergic rhinitis. In people who already have allergies or asthma, exposure to such fossil fuels may worsen symptoms.\nGenetic Factors\nAbout one-third of all persons with asthma share this condition with another member of their immediate family. Asthma may be more likely to be passed to children from the mother than from the father. Both allergies and asthma are strongly associated with hereditary factors, sharing certain genetic markers, but they are not always inherited together.\nResearch on the genetics of these conditions is confusing. While candidate genes have been identified, no specific genetic variant enhances the risk for asthma across all populations. Multiple genetic variants probably exist and play a role in the incidence of asthma and its response to different treatments. Expression of this genetic trait, however, varies across different populations.\nThe Complex Role of Early Infections\nThe role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.\nEarly Respiratory Infections as Causes of Asthma. Studies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has been implicated in the development of asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.\nCommon respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. A 2007 study suggested that children who have a wheezing rhinovirus during infancy are at increased risk for developing asthma by age 6. Even if these viruses do not directly cause asthma, they can worsen asthma in children who already have it. Rhinovirus has been reported to be the most common infection associated with asthma attacks. In one study, it was associated with 61% of asthma worsening in children. Some research suggests that colds promote inflammation in patients with existing asthma and increase the intensity of airway responsiveness for weeks.\nThe Hygiene Theory: Early Infections as Protection Against Asthma. This theory associates the increased incidence in asthma with a reduction in childhood infections that have occurred with modern hygiene and antibiotic use. The basic theory rests on the idea that infections that occur early in life stimulate production of specific immune factors called Th1 cells. As these cells build up, they replace other immune factors called Th2 cells, which react to allergens -- a less serious threat to the body. Without infections to stimulate the production of the Th1 infection fighters, the Th2 allergen fighters are not replaced, and they persist at high levels, making the growing child more susceptible to allergies and asthma.\nSome studies suggest that being part of a large family or attending day care increases the risk for early respiratory infections but reduces the risk of childhood asthma. The occasional cold, then, may be protective.\nThe standard vaccinations against serious childhood infections, according to several important studies, pose no risk for asthma. No one should stop giving their children vaccinations against childhood killers.\nBack to Top\nPrognosis\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma is rarely fatal in children, with only 187 asthma deaths reported in 2002 in children under age 18. In fact, a 2006 study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that asthma death rates for children have steadily declined since 1999. (During the same time, the number of doctor visits for asthma treatment more than doubled.) Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma\nTwo or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the past year\nUsing two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral or psychosocial problems\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat\nAfrican-American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk.\nLong-Term Outlook\nIn a study published in 2003, researchers followed people with asthma for more than 30 years. About a third of children had outgrown their asthma in adulthood. In general, the more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will persist. For example, only 23% of children who experienced wheezy bronchitis (wheezing during respiratory infections) suffered from frequent or persistent asthma in adulthood.\nThere is evidence that severe asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest, however, when asthma strikes children in the first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nPsychologic Factors\nStudies are mixed over the effects of emotional disorders on the severity of asthma. One study indicated that parents of children with asthma may suffer greater psychological stress than their children. A 2000 study reported that mild-to-moderate asthma does not significantly affect the psychological well-being of most children ages 5 - 12. Teenagers and preteens may have particular difficulty coping with what they perceive as the social stigma of asthma. Parents and older children should not hesitate to seek help from support groups, doctors, friends, or family members. Support programs may help children to better manage their asthma and even reduce hospitalization.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAsthma affects about 5 million American children ages of 5 - 14. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. From 1980 - 1994, asthma increased 160% in American children younger than 4 years and. Experts are puzzling over the cause of this phenomenon.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it may be more common in girls.\nSocioeconomic Factors\nUrban Life. Urban life is strongly associated with a higher risk. Although poverty plays a significant role, urban life has been associated with a higher risk for asthma in any income group and among both children and adults. In some urban areas, as many as 25% of children have asthma or show signs of wheezing. In fact, it may be greatly underdiagnosed in city children.\nEthnicity. Since 1980, asthma rates have risen the most dramatically among African-American children, and they have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children.\nSome studies indicate that the difference in risk exists simply because African-Americans and other minority groups are more likely to live in urban areas. Poverty and lack of access to health care also play a role. However, Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma, and rural African-American children do not.\nUrban life and socioeconomic factors, however, may not fully explain the ethnic disparity.\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nA variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies include:\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. Children born in the winter may have a greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nVitamin D. Pregnant women who have a higher intake of vitamin D may be less likely to give birth to children who develop asthma.\nBreastfeeding. Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 3 months of life can help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for the child's first 6 months.\nComplications of Pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nIn both adults and children, the incidence of obesity and asthma has been increasing over recent years. Studies report a strong association between the two conditions. Some experts suggest that excess weight pressing on the lungs may trigger the hyperreactive response in the airways typical of asthma. Others believe that asthma leads to obesity by inhibiting physical activity, although several studies have found no difference in activity levels between people with or without asthma. Some studies suggest that many obese people may be misdiagnosed as having asthma when they are simply short of breath, possibly because of the increased effort required for breathing.\nIn any case, there is evidence that losing weight can relieve asthma symptoms. Some evidence also suggests that people who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath reduces airway obstruction and improves lung function. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #53: Weight control and diet .].\nOther Risk Factors\nGERD. At least half of patients with asthma also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors.\nGERD is sometimes hard to detect and might be suspected as a contributor in the following patients:\nThose who do not respond to asthma treatments\nThose whose asthma attacks follow episodes of heartburn\nThose whose attacks are worse after eating or exercise\nThose whose coughs follow episodes of acid reflux. (One study found that GERD was associated with about half of the episodes of coughs and wheezes in patients with asthma.)\n[For more information, see In-Depth Report #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease .]\nSinusitis. Almost half of children and adults with allergic asthma have sinus abnormalities, and in various studies, 17 - 30% of patients with asthma develop true sinusitis. The presence of sinusitis, however, does not appear to increase the severity of asthma.\nClick the icon to see an image of sinusitis.\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. About 10% of adults and some fewer children have aspirin-induced asthma (AIA). With this condition, asthma gets worse when patients take aspirin. Aspirin is one of the drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although aspirin is used to reduce inflammation in other disorders, it appears to have the opposite effect in some asthma cases. It is not wholly known why this occurs. AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition and is associated with up to 25% of asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nPatients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and most likely NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).\nDiagnosis\nPulmonary Function Tests\nIf symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor will usually perform tests known as pulmonary function tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:\nVital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or exhaled.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.\nForced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 second.\nIf the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on the results, the doctor will take the following steps:\nIf measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a bronchodilator. This drug is used in asthma to open the air passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma is strongly suspected.\nIf measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is still suspected, the doctor may perform a challenge test. It involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests may be the best predictive test for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOther Tests\nTests that either rule out other diseases or obtain more information about the causes of asthma include:\nA complete blood count\nChest and sinus x-rays\nComputed tomography (CT) scans. CT scans may be helpful in certain cases, such as for determining wall thickness in airways in patients who are difficult to treat, which could signify a higher risk for lung damage.\nExamination of the patient's sputum for eosinophils (white blood cells that in high levels are associated with severe allergic asthma).\nResearchers are investigating measurements of certain chemicals in sputum or exhaled air that indicate airway inflammation. Such chemical markers include nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide.\nTreatment\nGeneral Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma\nWhile medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, appropriate management of asthma involves much more:\nIdentifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers\nFollowing appropriate drug treatments\nHome monitoring performed by either patient or family\nGood communication between the doctor and patient\nNeeded psychosocial support\nTreatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)\nThe severity of asthma has now been classified into four groupings: Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:\nSymptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout the day\nNighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly\nShort-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or fewer days per week to several times per day\nInterference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited\nLung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary function testing at the doctor's office\nNumber of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.\nOnce patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age groupings:\n4 years old or younger\n5 - 11 years old\nTreating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease\nMedications for asthma fall into two categories:\nRescue (Quick-Relief) Medications. Medications that open the airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.\nLong-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications. Long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For adults and children over age 5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, experts now recommend inhaled corticosteroids with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.\nThe goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children's asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time. Unfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.\nThese are the signs of well-controlled asthma:\nAsthma symptoms occur twice a week or less\nRescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less\nSymptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening\nSymptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities\nPeak flow meter readings are normal or the patient's personal best\nBoth the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled\nSteps for Treating Asthma\nA stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on severity of patients' asthma and their age, there are specific recommendations regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations based on a specific patient.\nIn choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks to assess response.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger include:\nLong-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.\nNebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer medications to children this age.\nOnly certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are recommended for these children.\nClose follow-up is recommended\nAvoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:\nParticipation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged.\nSchools, child care, and camps. should all have a copy of the asthma action plan.\nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies that are usually used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.\nAvoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.\nThe variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.\nDevices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), breath-actuated inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering any asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.\nThe spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient additional time to inhale. They vary, however, in their effectiveness. It should be noted that MDIs can continue to deliver propellant even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing a metered dose inhaler.\nBreath-Actuated Inhalers. Breath-actuated rotary inhalers (Easi-Breathe and Autohaler) deliver the drug directly to the back of the throat as the user inhales. Their primary advantage over the MDI is their ease of use. They also do not use CFCs as propellants. In comparison studies, patients have been very successful with the breath-actuated inhalers. They are not recommended for children under 8 years old.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Such devices include Rotahaler, Spinhaler, Turbohaler, Clickhaler, Easyhaler, Diskhaler, Discus, Twisthaler, Spiros, and others. DPIs are as effective as the older devices, and generally have a better taste and are easier to manage. They may differ, however, in their ability to deliver drugs into the airways. In one study, for example, the Turbohaler was easier to use than the Diskhaler, and it achieved better delivery.\nHumidity or extreme temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.\nOther Hand-Held Inhalers. Respimat delivers a fine-mist spray that is created by forcing the liquid medication through nozzles. It does not use any propellant.\nNebulizers. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects.\nChildren who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. The misuse of home nebulizers may be an important factor in asthma deaths in children and young adults. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable at home.\n"}, {"score": 899.436, "uuid": "608ee456-82f1-5cf9-9c72-419e84d72806", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0010wb-30-15319", "target_hostname": "preventdisease.com", "target_uri": "http://preventdisease.com/diseases/asthma_children.shtml", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Asthma <em>in</em> <em>Children</em> and Adolescents", "snippet": "history of asthma <em>or</em> allergic disorders, such as eczema, hives, <em>or</em> hay <em>fever</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Email Address\nASTHMA IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\n* Please note that most treatment modalities listed below are based on conventional medicine. PreventDisease.com does not advocate the use of any pharmaceutical drug treatments. Long-term drug therapy is very detrimental to human health. All drug information is for your reference only and readers are strongly encouraged to research healthier alternatives to any drug therapies listed.\nWHAT IS ASTHMA?\nThe word asthma originates from an ancient Greek word meaning panting. Essentially, asthma is an inability to breathe properly. When any person inhales, the air travels through the following structures:\nAir passes into the lungs and flows through progressively smaller airways called bronchioles. The lungs contain millions of these airways.\nAll bronchioles lead to alveoli, which are microscopic sacs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.\nAsthma is a chronic condition in which these airways undergo changes when stimulated by allergens or other environmental triggers. Such changes appear to be two specific responses:\nThe hyperreactive response (also called hyperresponsiveness).\nThe inflammatory response.\nThese actions in the airway cause patients to cough, wheeze, and experience shortness of breath (dyspnea), the classic symptoms of asthma.\nHyperreactive Response\nIn the hyperreactive response, smooth muscles in the airways constrict and narrow excessively in response to inhaled allergens or other irritants. It should be noted that the airways in everyone's lungs respond by constricting when exposed to allergens or irritants. There are major differences, however, in the hyperreactive response the occurs in people with asthma:\nWhen people without asthma breathe in and out deeply, the airways relax and open in order to rid the lungs of the irritant.\nWhen people with asthma try to take those same deep breaths, their airways do not relax but instead narrow and the patients pant for breath. Smooth muscles in the airways of people with asthma may have a defect, perhaps a deficiency in a critical chemical that prevents the muscles from relaxing.\nInflammatory Response\nThe hyperreactive stage is followed by the inflammatory response, which generally contributes to asthma in the following way:\nThe immune system responds to allergens or other environmental triggers by delivering white blood cells and other immune factors to the airways.\nThese so-called inflammatory factors cause the airways to swell, to fill with fluid, and to produce a thick sticky mucus.\nThis combination of events results in wheezing, breathlessness, inability to exhale properly, and a phlegm-producing cough.\nInflammation appears to be present in the lungs of all patients with asthma, even those with mild cases, and plays a key role in all forms of the disease.\nWHAT CAUSES ASTHMA IN CHILDREN?\nFactors Contributing to the Worldwide Increase of Asthma\nAsthma is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10 and about 80% develop symptoms before age five. It has dramatically risen worldwide over the past decades, and experts are puzzling over the cause of this phenomenon.\nThe mechanisms that cause asthma are complex and vary among population groups and even individuals. Among the causes and factors that are suspects in asthma in children are the following:\nAsthma in children is highly associated with allergies. Not all children with allergies have asthma, however, and not all cases of asthma can be explained by allergic response.\nA family history of asthma also plays a major role in childhood asthma, although probably several genes are involved that make a child susceptible to environmental triggers, such as infections, dietary patterns, air pollution, and allergens.\nEarly lung development, particularly having smaller lungs, affects the chances for later asthma.\nOne 2000 study suggested that Western dietary habits (which commonly include more fast foods and less fruits, vegetables, fiber, minerals, and other nutrients) may contribute to the development of childhood asthma.\nSome experts observe that children are spending more time indoors watching television, playing video games, or using the computer and are therefore overexposed to indoor allergens.\nThe trend of making homes more energy-efficient may result in dust mites being trapped inside them.\nImmunizations that prevent many childhood diseases may actually cause changes in immune factors that make people more susceptible to the allergic response.\nSurvival rates are now higher in low-birth-weight babies, who may be more susceptible to asthma.\nDeclining rates in nursing may be contributor. Breast milk contains important anti-inflammatory agents, such as omega-3 fatty acids, which might protect against asthma.\nSome experts suggest that part of the dramatic rise in childhood asthma is not due to an increase in actual cases but to higher parental awareness of the disease and differences in diagnostic criteria. Nonetheless, related disorders (e.g., allergies, sinusitis, and ear infections) are also on the rise. This suggests that airborne or other environmental factors are at work, and, in fact, many experts believe asthma is actually underdiagnosed.\nThe Allergic Response\nThe allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. (Its significance in adult-onset asthma is less clear.) About 75% to 80% of children with asthma have allergies, and studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Asthma and nonseasonal or seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever or rose fever caused by pollen allergies) often coexist. However, although most people with asthma have a history of allergic rhinitis, only 1% to 20% of children with allergic rhinitis actually develop asthma. About 8% to 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies; these children also appear to have a high risk for very serious reactions to such foods. In infants and toddlers, allergy to eggs appears to be a major predictor of asthma.\nThe allergic process, called atopy, and its connection to asthma is not completely understood. It involves various airborne allergens or other triggers that set off a cascade of events in the immune system leading to inflammation and hyperreactivity in the airways. One description is as follows:\nThe conductor in an orchestra of immune factors that contribute to allergies and asthma appears to be a category of white blood cells known as helper T-cells , in particular a subgroup called TH2-cells .\nTH2-cells overproduce interleukins (ILs), immune factors that are molecular members of a family called cytokines, powerful agents of the inflammatory process.\nInterleukins 4, 9, and 13, for example, may be responsible for a first-phase asthma attack. These interleukins stimulate the production and release of antibody groups known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) . (People with both asthma and allergies appear to have a genetic predisposition for overproducing IgE.)\nDuring an allergic attack, these IgE antibodies can bind to special cells in the immune system called mast cells , which are generally concentrated in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes. This bond triggers the release of a number of active chemicals, importantly potent molecules known as leukotrienes. These chemicals cause airway spasms, over-produce mucus, and activate nerve endings in the airway lining.\nAnother cytokine, interleukin 5, appears to contribute to a late-phase inflammatory response. This interleukin attracts white blood cells known as eosinophils. These cells accumulate and remain in the airways after the first attack. They persist for weeks and mediate the release of other damaging particles that remain in the airways.\nRemodeling and Causes of Persistent Asthma\nOver the course of years the repetition of the inflammatory events involved in asthma can cause irreversible structural and functional changes in the airways, a process called remodeling. The remodeled airways are persistently narrow and can cause chronic asthma. Researchers are trying to determine how these process occurs:\nInterleukins. Some researchers are looking at potent immune factors, including interleukins 11 and 13. They have been linked to a number of processes possibly involved in remodeling, including, overgrowth of cells in the smooth muscles that line the airways and scarring in the airways.\nGrowth Factors. Compounds known as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been observed in the airways of asthma patients. VEGF is a powerful promoter of cell growth in blood vessel linings and some researchers believe they may be major factor in remodeling.\nGenetic Factors\nAbout one-third of all persons with asthma share this condition with another member of their immediate family. Asthma may be more likely to be passed to children from the mother than from the father.\nBoth allergies and asthma are strongly associated with hereditary factors and they share certain genetic markers, but they are not always inherited together. Research, then, on the genetics of these conditions is confusing and difficult.\nThe Complex Role of Early Respiratory Infections\nEarly respiratory infections, particularly those caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the adenovirus, and the organisms Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been investigated for their role in asthma. Theories exist that suggest respiratory infections may play causal, worsening, or protective roles, depending on specific conditions.\nProtective Role of Early Respiratory Infections. An important theory blames the dramatic increase in asthma on the elimination of childhood infections since immunization has become widespread. The basic theory is as follows:\nIn the past, when unvaccinated (note: vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines . Please review all the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.) children developed these infections, the immune system released helper T-1 (TH1) white blood cells that stimulate the body's infection-fighters.\nAt the same time, it also suppresses production of the helper T-2 (TH2) cells, which are believed to be major contributors to the allergic response. [ See The Allergic Response above.]\nIn genetically susceptible children who are vaccinated (note: vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines . Please review all the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.), the TH2 cells become active (instead of the TH1 cells) and trigger the inflammatory events leading to asthma.\nOf some support for this theory are studies reporting that being part of a large family or attending day care increases the risk for early infections but reduces the risk of childhood asthma.\nIt should strongly be pointed out that infections killed thousands of children every year before immunization became widespread. Asthma, although serious, is rarely fatal in children. No one should stop giving their children vaccinations against childhood killers. Having a cold every now and then, however, may be protective.\nEvidence now weighs against a significant causal role in asthma in children, except in certain cases. (Respiratory infections, however, may play an important role in adult-onset asthma). It should be noted, too, that even if respiratory viruses do not cause asthma in children, they can worsen asthma in children who have it. Rhinovirus, or the common cold virus, for example, has been reported to be the most common infectious agent associated with asthma attacks. In one study, it was associated with 61% of asthma exacerbations in children. Some research suggests that colds promote allergic inflammation and increase the intensity of airway responsiveness for weeks.\nOther Contributing Medical Conditions\nGERD. At least half of asthmatic patients also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors.\nSome theories for the causal connection between GERD and asthma are as follows:\nAcid leaking from the lower esophagus in GERD stimulates the vagus nerves , which run through the gastrointestinal tract. These stimulated nerves in turn trigger the nearby airways in the lung to constrict, which causes asthma symptoms.\nAcid back-up that reaches the mouth may be inhaled into the airways ( aspirated). Here, the acid triggers a reaction in the airways that cause asthma symptoms.\nGERD is sometimes hard to detect and might be suspected as a contributor in the following asthmatic patients:\nThose who do not respond to asthma treatments.\nThose whose asthma attacks follow episodes of heartburn.\nThose whose attacks are worse after eating or exercise.\nThose whose coughs follow episodes of acid reflux. (One study found that GERD was associated with about half of the episodes of coughs and wheezes in asthmatic patients.)\nTreating GERD symptoms with anti-acid agents resolves asthma in some (but not all) patients who share both conditions. [ See , Report #85, Heartburn and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. ]\nSinusitis. Almost half of children and adults with allergic asthma have sinus abnormalities, and in various studies, between 17% and 30% of asthmatic patients develop true sinusitis. The presence of sinusitis, however, does not appear to increase the severity of asthma.\nParental Migraines and Childhood Asthma. Some studies have reported a link between childhood asthma and parental migraines, with one small 2000 study suggesting that children are about five times more likely to develop asthma if their parents have a history of migraines.\nExercise-Induced Asthma\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. [ See Box Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA) ]\nNSAIDs and Acetaminophen.\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. About 10% of asthmatic adults and some fewer children have aspirin-induced asthma (AIA). With this condition, asthma gets worse when patients take aspirin. Although aspirin is used to reduce inflammation in other disorders, it appears to have the opposite effect in many asthma cases. It is not wholly known why this occurs. AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition and is associated with up to 25% of asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nAlternative Agents. Patients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and most likely other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). Acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) has been the traditional alternative for relief of minor pain. Unfortunately, recent evidence has muddied these recommendations. Some evidence has linked asthmatic responses to high consumption of acetaminophen-called paracetamol in Europe among adults. And a study of children with asthma reported that those who took ibuprofen were less likely to be hospitalized for asthma than those taking acetaminophen. Whether these results apply to people, including adults, who are aspirin sensitive is unknown, however. This is of particular concern, since acetaminophen is the pain reliever of choice in small children.\nExperts hope that the new NSAIDs COX-2 inhibitors, which include celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx), may be safe for AIA. To date, studies are promising, although more research is needed to confirm their safety in people with this condition.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (called nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of asthma patients. Attacks often occur between 2 and 4 AM. Factors that might play role in nocturnal asthma may include one or more of the following:\nChemical and temperature changes in the body during the night that increase inflammation and narrowing of the airways.\nDelayed allergic responses from exposure to allergens during the day.\nThe wearing off of inhaled medications toward the early morning.\nAn increase in acid reflux (back up of stomach acid) that causes airways to narrow.\nPostnasal drip that occurs during sleep.\nConditions relating to sleep, such as sleep apnea or sleeping on one's back, which may worsen any asthma attack that occurs at night.\nSome experts believe that nocturnal asthma may actually be a unique form of asthma with its own specific biologic mechanisms that occur only at night and which reduce natural steroid hormones (which block inflammation).\nEXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA (EIA)\nDescription of EIA\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising and then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (It should be noted that some people have both forms of asthma.) People who only have EIA do not appear to require long-term maintenance therapy. A study of military recruits with EIA also reported that the condition does not hinder a person's overall physical performance.\nMedications\nCromolyn, a mild anti-inflammatory agent, or short-acting beta2 agonists have been the treatments of choice for preventing EIA. Newer approaches for people who work out regularly include pretreatment with long-acting beta2 agonists, such as salmeterol (Serevent) or the regular use of inhaled corticosteroids.\nHints for Reducing EIA\nEIA occurs only after exercise and is more likely to occur with regular paced activities in cold, dry air. The following are some suggestions for reducing its impact:\nWarm-up and cool-down periods are important.\nPatients with EIA might do better with activities that involve short bursts of exercise (tennis, football) than with exercises involving long-duration regular pacing (cycling, soccer, and distance running).\nBreathing through a scarf or through the nose helps warm up the airways.\nSome interesting evidence suggests that restricting dietary salt might help reduce EIA.\nHOW SERIOUS IS ASTHMA IN CHILDREN?\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than five, because their airways are very narrow.\nDegree of Severity\nThe severity of asthma is graded using the following categories: mild intermittent and mild, moderate, and severe persistent. [See Table National Asthma Education and Prevention Program: Classification of Asthma Severity.] It should be noted that a patient in any of these categories, even mild intermittent, can still experience a severe and even life-threatening attack. In fact, according to one report, 30% of asthma deaths occur in patients with mild asthma.\nNational Asthma Education and Prevention Program Classification of Asthma Severity\nClassification\nSymptoms occur twice a week or less.\nNo symptoms and normal lung function between attacks.\nAttacks are brief (from a few hours to a few days) and may vary in intensity.\nSymptoms occur twice a month or less.\nFEV 1 or PEF is 80% or more than predicted.\nPEF variability is less than 20%.\nMild Persistent\nSymptoms occur more than twice a week but less than once a day.\nAsthma attacks may be severe enough to affect activity.\nMore than twice a month.\nFEV 1 or PEF is 80% or more than predicted,\nPEF variability is between 20% and 30%.\nModerate Persistent\nDaily symptoms and use of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists.\nSymptoms twice a week or more and may last for days.\nAsthma attacks twice a week or more and may be severe enough to affect activity.\nMore than once a week.\nFEV 1 or PEF is between 60% and 80% of predicted,\nPEF variability is more than 30%.\nSevere Persistent\nFEV 1 or PEF is 60% or less than predicted,\nPEF variability is more than 30%.\nNOTE: The presence of one of the features of severity is sufficient to place a patient in that category. An individual should be assigned to the most severe grade in which any feature occurs. The characteristics noted in this figure are general and may overlap because asthma is highly variable. It should be noted that many life-threatening situations have started in patients categorized with mild asthma. An individual's classification may also change over time. Patients at any level of severity can have mild, moderate, or severe asthma attacks. Some patients with intermittent asthma experience severe and life-threatening exacerbations separated by long periods of normal lung function and no symptoms.\nAdapted from National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) Second Expert Panel on the Management of Asthma. Expert panel reports 2: guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma. Bethesda, Md.: National Institutes of Health, 1997; publication no. 97-4051.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma is rarely fatal in children, with only 176 asthma deaths reported in 1999 in children under age 15. (About 444 fatalities occurred in people between ages 15 and 34.) But even these low numbers are unacceptable, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include the following:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma.\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral problems.\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat. Unfortunately, one study of children found that nearly 40% of them were unaware of asthmatic symptoms when they occurred.\nAfrican American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasian-Americans in the age groups of four and under and 15 to 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk. A 2002 study suggested that these children tend to be given inferior treatments compared to Caucasian children.\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nfollowing signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking sufficient oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly to a serious condition or may develop to a fatal or near-fatal attack within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious. It should be noted that early symptoms or lack of them do not always reflect the ultimate severity of an attack. In fact, some studies suggest that people at high risk for fatal or near-fatal asthma attacks are those with poor awareness of their own reduced ability to breathe and who are therefore slow in seeking help. Monitoring peak flow rates is, therefore, an important management component, since it provides a more accurate assessment of lung function than symptoms alone.\nLong-Term Outlook\nHalf of asthmatic children achieve remission after age 16. In half of these, however, asthma flares up again in middle age and remains a problem. Children whose condition is serious enough to require steroids are less likely to outgrow their asthma than others.\nThere is now some evidence that severe asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring. Many experts urge introduction of anti-inflammatory medications early on in children with severe conditions. Children adapt well to living with asthma, however, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nPsychologic Factors\nStudies are mixed over the effects of emotional disorders on the severity of asthma. In fact, one indicated that parents of asthmatic children may suffer greater psychological stress than their children do. A 2000 study, in fact, reported that having mild to moderate asthma does not significantly affect the psychological well being of most children aged 5 to 12. Teenagers and preteens have particular difficulty coping with what they perceive as the social stigma of asthma. Often they will deny their condition and refuse to comply with their drug regimen. Parents and older children should not hesitate to seek help from support groups, physicians, friends, or family members. Supporting programs in camp and school may help children to better manage their asthma and may even reduce hospitalization.\nEffect on School and Work\nAlthough there have been few studies on the effects of asthma on schooling, a 2000 study reported that nocturnal (nighttime) asthma affected school attendance and performance in children and work attendance in their parents.\nWHAT CHILDREN GET ASTHMA?\nAt this time, asthma affects about 5.3 million American children between the ages of five and 14, and some experts believe that about half of American children may be undiagnosed. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. The prevalence of asthma increased by 60% in America, since the early 80s, and in Europe it has doubled. The incidence increased most rapidly in children under age four. There is a wide variation in asthma incidence, however, ranging from over 50% among children in the Caroline Islands to virtually 0% in Papua New Guinea. The reasons for this wide variation are not yet known.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it may be more common in girls.\nSocioeconomic Factors\nUrban Life. Urban life is strongly associated with a higher risk. Although poverty plays a significant role, urban life, in fact, has been associated with a higher risk for asthma in any income group and among both children and adults. In some urban areas, as many as 25% of children have asthma or show signs of wheezing. In fact, it may be greatly underdiagnosed in city children. A 1999 Chicago study reported almost a third of children in inner-city kindergartens had asthma symptoms without a diagnosis of the disorder; 10% had actually been diagnosed with asthma, mainly because their symptoms were severe.\nEthnicity. Since 1980, asthma rates have risen the most dramatically among African American children, and they have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children.\nSome studies indicate that the difference in risk exists simply because African Americans and other minority groups are more likely to live in urban areas. Poverty and lack of access to health care may also play a role. However, Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma, and rural African-American children do not.\nUrban life and socioeconomic factors, however, may not fully explain the ethnic disparity. For example, a 2000 study found that African American children may have significantly higher levels of IgE than Caucasian children, suggesting a genetic susceptibility. (IgE are immune factors that play a critical role in asthma.)\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. One study suggests that children born in the winter are at greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nBreast Feeding. Reports on breast feeding are mixed. Although a 2001 study suggested breast feeding may increaseslightly the risk for asthma, other studies, including a major 2001 analysis, report protection. More research is warranted. It should be noted that breast feeding has many benefits for the child and this study should not discourage any mother from nursing her infant.\nComplications of Pregnancy. According to a 2000 study, complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Another 2000 study also reported that delivery procedures such as Cesarean section, the use of vacuum extraction or forceps also raised the risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nIn both adults and children, the incidence of obesity and asthma has been increasing in parallel over recent years. Studies report a strong association between the two conditions. Some experts suggest that excess weight pressing on the lungs may trigger the hyperreactive response in the airways typical of asthma. Others believe that asthma leads to obesity by inhibiting physical activity, although studies in 2000 and 2001 found no difference in activity levels between people with or without asthma. One 2000 study suggested that many obese people may be misdiagnosed as having asthma when in fact they are simply short of breath, possibly because of the increased effort required for breathing.\nIn any case, there is some evidence that losing weight can relieve asthma symptoms. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath reduces airway obstruction and improves lung function. [See the Report on Weight Control and Diet.]\nOther Risk Factors\nDamp Homes. Studies from different parts of the world reported that children who live in damp homes have a much higher risk for asthma.\nParental Migraines and Childhood Asthma. Some studies have reported a link between childhood asthma and parental migraines, with one small 2000 study suggesting that children are about five times more likely to develop asthma if their parents have a history of migraines.\nMental Health. Research indicates that poor mental health of parents and children are significant predictors of more severe symptoms in childhood asthma. A 2000 study, in fact, suggested that high stress levels can predict the onset and severity of asthma in children genetically at risk for asthma.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN?\nIn children with asthmatic symptoms, it is particularly important to first consider as a possible cause inhaled foreign objects such as peanuts, viral infections such as croup, and bacterial infections, which may be accompanied by high fever and progress rapidly. Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack are the following:\nWheezing when breathing out is nearly always present during an attack. Usually the attack begins with wheezing and rapid breathing, and, as it becomes more severe, all breathing muscles become visibly active.\nShortness of breath ( dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in asthma patients, although severe dyspnea does not always reflect a serious attack or reduced lung function. In fact, some patients, particularly elderly patients, may not experience significant dyspnea but still have very poor lung function.\nCoughing. In some people the first symptom of asthma is a nonproductive cough. In fact, in a 2001 survey, 12% of asthma patients reported coughing as a significant problem. Patients surveyed tended to feel that daytime cough was even more distressing than wheezing or sleep disturbances.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nThe neck muscles may tighten, and talking may become difficult or impossible.\nRapid heart rate.\nSweating.\nChest pain occurs in about three-quarters of patients; it can be very severe, although its intensity is not necessarily related to the severity of the asthma attack itself.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces a thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nWHAT TESTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO DIAGNOSE ASTHMA?\nMedical History\nThe doctor will seriously consider a diagnosis of asthma if the child has a history of periodic attacks of shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing, perhaps accompanied by tightness in the chest. The parent should describe the pattern of symptoms and possible precipitating factors, including the following:\nWhether symptoms are more frequent during the spring or fall (allergy seasons).\nWhether exercise, a respiratory infection, or exposure to cold air has ever triggered an attack.\nAny family history of asthma or allergic disorders, such as eczema, hives, or hay fever.\nRuling Out Other Diseases\nA number of disorders may cause some or all of the symptoms of asthma: Panic disorder can coincide with asthma or be confused with it. Other diseases that must be considered during diagnosis are pneumonia, bronchitis, severe allergic reactions, psychosomatic illnesses, and certain rare disorders (such as tapeworm and trichomoniasis).\nWhether symptoms are more frequent during the spring or fall (allergy seasons).\nWhether exercise, a respiratory infection, or exposure to cold air has ever triggered an attack.\nAny family history of asthma or allergic disorders, such as eczema, hives, or hay fever.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may be given skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen or occupational agent is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests may be the best predictive test for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOther Tests\nTests that either rule out other diseases or obtain more information about the causes of asthma include the following:\nA complete blood count.\nChest and sinus x-rays.\nExamination of the patients sputum for eosinophils (white blood cells that in high levels are associated with severe allergic asthma).\nInvestigative measurements of markers of airway inflammation, either in sputum or in exhaled air. Markers include nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. (It is not clear yet whether they will be useful in assessing.)\nWHAT ARE THE GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR TREATING ASTHMA?\nEmergency Treatment for an Acute Attack\nTreating an Acute Attack in the Hospital. An acute attack may require hospitalization. Laboratory tests, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a chest x-ray are performed to determine lung function, oxygen levels, and other indications of severity or rule out other causes. Depending on the results, the following treatments may be given:\nBeta2-agonists are the standard therapy. They may be administered with a nebulizer (a device that administers the drug in a fine spray) or inhaled hourly.\nA corticosteroid (commonly called a steroid) is usually given if the patient does not respond to beta2-agonist treatments. They may be given intravenously or orally. Unfortunately, according to one study, almost one in four adolescents who are hospitalized due to uncontrollable asthma do not respond to steroid treatment. Of some promise are reports intravenous immunoglobulin may be effective in such patients.\nAntibiotics may be given if sinusitis, pneumonia, or bronchitis is suspected or present.\nOxygen is usually administered, and can be life saving in severe cases. Some studies report that a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) may be beneficial. A major 2001 analysis of current data, however, found no strong evidence to support its role in initial treatment. In a 2002 study, for example, it was no better than air in improving lung function tests. Nevertheless, patients reported significantly less breathlessness with the heliox.\nInfusions of magnesium sulfate may be effective in treating severe attacks in children and although some studies report no clear advantage.\nIn life-threatening situations, the patient may require mechanical ventilation.\nDischarge and Relapse After Hospitalization. It typically takes about three to four hours to determine if a patient can be safely sent home or if they need to stay. Patients are generally discharged under the following circumstances:\nWhen symptoms are gone or minimal, and\nThe peak expiratory flow rate is 70% or more of the predicted rate.\nDischarged patients generally take oral corticosteroids for five to seven days. Despite reasonable precautions, about 20% of patients relapse within two weeks, although the risk is very low if they keep taking their medication after they leave.\nGuidelines for Treating Asthma at Home\nAvoiding allergens, following appropriate drug treatments, and home monitoring are key elements in preventing dangerous asthma attacks and hospitalization. A combination of medications is important and effective for both treating and preventing asthma attacks. In addition, good communication between the physician and patients is a key factor in a successful management program.\nUnderstanding the Difference between Treating Symptoms and Controlling the Disease\nParents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children's asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time. According to a few studies, most parents do not discriminate between medications that provide rapid short term relief and long term symptom control.\nMedications for asthma are categorized by their ability to achieve either of the following:\nDrugs used to relieve acute asthma symptoms. Anyone experiencing a moderate or severe asthma attack should promptly be given medications that open the airways. Generally, these are bronchodilator called short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Others sometimes used in special cases include theophylline, and certain anticholinergic agents. None of these agents have any effect on the disease process itself. They are only useful for treating symptoms.\nDrugs used to control long-term persistent inflammation and prevent lung injury. For long-term control of the disease, patients with moderate to severe asthma require medications to control inflammation. Typically, these are patients who are taking the short-acting beta2 agonists more than twice a week. The standard agents for maintenance treatments are inhaled corticosteroids (commonly called steroids). Others include leukotriene-antagonists, and cromolyn. Combinations of steroids and other medications (such as long-acting beta2 agonists or leukotriene-antagonists) are proving to be effective for both treating and preventing asthma attacks in patients with moderate to severe asthma.\nSimply coping with asthma symptoms without also controlling the inflammation is a common and serious error. Unfortunately, studies are finding that a significant number of moderate or severely asthmatic patients overuse their inhaled beta-agonists and underuse their corticosteroid medications. Asthma flare-ups are much more common in children who do not comply with the prescribed treatment. Unfortunately, on average, less than half of children adhere to their drug regimens, and the situation is far worse in inner city children with asthma, a group at high risk for severe complication.\nAdministering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled agents must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although some are easier to use than others. In one study, only 29% of children used the dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) correctly, while 67% of children used the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) appropriately. Newer easier-to-use inhalers, both DPIs and MDIs, can improve these rates considerably.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering asthma medication has been the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. Until recently, MDIs have used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as their propellants, which are damaging to the environment.\nMany devices now use propellants (e.g., hydrofluoroalkane) that are equally effective to CFCs and are environmentally safe. They also do not chill the device as CFCs do. Some of the non-CFC inhalers (such as Respimat, which uses a soft-mist spray) may be more effective at delivering medications than even the new dry-powder inhalers [ see below ].\nIn other comparison studies, patients have been very successful with the breath-actuated inhalers (Easi-Breathe and Autohaler).\nThe holding chambers for the MDIs also vary in their ability to deliver medication. For example, in one study the AiroChamber-Plus was more effective than the EasiVent in delivering an inhaled steroid.\nMDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them; others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation. Often, the devices continue to deliver propellant after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of medications directly into the lungs and do not threaten the environment. Such devices include Rotahaler, Spinhaler, Turbohaler, Clickhaler, Easyhaler, Diskhaler, Discus, Twisthaler, Spiros, and others. DPIs are as effective as the older devices, and generally have a better taste and are easier to manage. They may differ among themselves, however, in their ability to deliver drugs into the airways. In one study, for example, the Turbohaler was easier to use than the Diskhaler and so achieved better delivery. The Discus is another effective DPI; it has a dose counter and protects against exhalation effects. More research is needed.\nHumidity or extreme temperatures can effect their performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (e.g., bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (e.g., glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion and children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after taking the drug and to brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.\nNebulizers. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than three years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. It takes five to 10 minutes to administer any medication using a nebulizer. And, because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects. Nebulizers should not be used by children who can manage an inhaler. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. Of note: if children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways.\nMonitoring\nChildren with asthma who are monitored daily for peak air flow and whose medications are adjusted accordingly tend to have fewer hospitalizations and a better quality of life than those who rely on the occasional physician or emergency room visit to control symptoms. For children who are too young for peak flow meters, parents should keep a diary of all their children's respiratory complaints and any incident or allergen that might have triggered them.\nMonitoring typically involves the following steps:\nA peak flow meter is the standard monitoring device for measuring peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).\nParents of children with severe asthma should take PEFR readings two or three times a day. The overall goal should be to achieve less than a 20% (and ideally only 10%) variation in readings between evening and morning rates. For mild to moderate asthma, a single determination each morning usually suffices, but patients should check with their physicians.\nIt is important to use the meter at the same times each day and to stand or sit in the same position in order to keep an accurate record.\nParents should keep an ongoing record of their child's peak flow readings to help detect worsening of their condition.\nParents should also record attacks, the child's exposure to any allergens or triggers, and medications taken.\nAfter about two months, parents and physicians can use the data recorded for administering medications effectively and to recognize problems before they become serious.\nNon-Medical Management Strategies\nAsthma triggers a vicious emotional-physical cycle:\nBreathlessness and wheezing incite a fear of suffocation and death, even in very small children.\nThis anxiety produces further constriction on the muscles surrounding the airways, which makes breathing even more difficult.\nCaregivers must first focus on alleviating their own anxiety, which can heighten a child's own fears. The next step is to help the child relax. One method for this is as follows:\nThe child sits comfortably, bending slight forward with the eyes closed.\nThe hands are placed gently over the navel.\nThe child is then told to pretend the stomach is a balloon.\nThe \"balloon\" must be \"blown up\" by inhalation, not exhalation. The child can tell if this working because the hands will move slightly apart.\nWhen the child breathes out, the \"balloon\" will be made flat.\nThis exercise both relaxes the child and discourages shallow, oxygen-poor breathing. Massaging the child in gentle circles on the chest is relaxing and may also loosen mucus.\nOther recommendations include the following:\nA child may also find relief by lying stomach-down on several pillows so that the head is slightly lower than the chest while the caregiver gently pats the back between the shoulder blades.\nGiving the child warm liquids, such as soup or hot cider, is effective in loosening mucus and may also relax bronchial muscles. Cold fluids, like cold air, should be avoided.\nOverhydration, too much liquid, can be harmful, however, so these drinks should not be forced on the child.\nWarm, moist air from vaporizers can greatly ease and moderate asthma attacks.\nDaily massages and breathing and relaxation techniques to reduce stress can be very helpful.\nWHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC DRUGS USED TO TREAT SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE ASTHMA ATTACKS?\nShort-Acting Beta2-Agonists\nBeta2-agonists do not reduce inflammation or airway responsiveness but serve as bronchodilators, relaxing and opening constricted airways during an acute asthma attack. A short-acting inhaled beta2-agonist, taken as needed, is often the only medication used by children with chronic mild asthma.\nSpecific short-acting beta2-agonists include the following:\nAlbuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), called salbutamol outside the US, is the standard short-acting beta2-agonist in America. Other similar beta2-agonists are isoproterenol (Isuprel, Norisodrine, Medihaler-Iso), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, Brethaire, Bricanyl), and bitolterol (Tornalate). Isoetharine (Bronkometer, Bronkosol is available in nebulizers.\nNewer beta2-agonists, including levalbuterol (Xopenex), have more specific actions than the standard agents. Studies have indicated that levalbuterol is as effective as albuterol with fewer side effects. Xopenex is administered with a nebulizer and is available without preservatives. (It is very expensive, however.)\nShort-acting bronchodilators are generally administered through inhalation and are effective for three to six hours. They relieve the symptoms of acute attacks, but they do not control the underlying inflammation. If asthma continues to worsen with the use of these\nSide Effects of Beta2-Agonists. Side effects of all beta2-agonists include the following:\nAnxiety.\nRestlessness.\nHeadache.\nPatients may experience fast and irregular heartbeats. A physician should be notified immediately if such side effects occur.\nThese drugs should be taken with caution by children with diabetes or a history of seizures.\nBeta2-agonists have serious interactions with certain drugs and parents should tell the physician about any other medications their child is taking.\nLoss of Effectiveness and Overdose. There has been some concern that both short-acting beta2-agonists become less effective when taken regularly over time, increasing the risk for overuse. Over time some patients may become tolerant to many effects of short-acting beta2-agonists. The degree to which this affects the airways is uncertain. In some studies, the duration of action has declined but the peak effect appears to be preserved, making these drugs still useful for acute attacks. Regular use of long-acting beta 2 agonists may increase the chances of a reduced effect from the short-acting forms.\nOther Bronchodilators\nTheophylline. Theophylline (Theo-Dur, Theolair, Slo-Phyllin, Slo-bid, Constant-T, Respbid) is a mild to moderate bronchodilator that has been used to treat childhood asthma for more than 30 years. It is useful for treating nocturnal asthma and may also have anti-inflammatory qualities even in low doses.\nAvailable in tablet, liquid, and injectable forms, some theophylline sustained-release tablets and capsules have a long duration of action and can therefore be taken once or twice a day with good results.\nIt does have some problems, however. Side effects include changes in behavior, mood, and memory. If theophylline is not taken exactly as prescribed, an overdose can easily occur. Toxicity causes the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, headache, insomnia, and, in rare cases, disturbances in heart rhythm and convulsions. A physician should be contacted immediately if any of these side effects occur.\nThe risks for these adverse effects are small if the drug is taken exactly as prescribed but the following precautions should be noted:\nInfants tend to metabolize the drug extremely slowly and therefore should receive very low doses.\nBy the time asthmatic children reach one year old, however, they metabolize the drug faster than adults. There is a risk, therefore, of toxic effects.\nFever and certain antibiotics may slow down the rate at which theophylline is eliminated from the body; in such cases, the doctor may want to reduce the dosage of theophylline.\nIf a child is taking theophylline on an on-going basis, the doctor should monitor the drug level at the start of therapy and at regular intervals thereafter.\nAnticholinergic Agents. Inhaled ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) acts as a bronchodilator over time. Ipratropium bromide alone is only modestly beneficial for acute asthma attacks. In fact, the drug is not approved specifically for asthma. Some parents report benefit for treating wheezing in infants. It is also sometimes used in the emergency room to treat children with severe asthma, although it does not appear to offer any advantage over the use of intravenous beta2 agonists. (This agent has no benefits in any case if it is used alone in this situation.)\nWHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC DRUGS USED TO PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS AND REDUCE AIRWAY INFLAMMATION?\nCromolyn and Similar Drugs\nCromolyn sodium (Intal) serves as both an anti-inflammatory drug and has antihistamine properties that block asthma triggers such as allergens, cold, or exercise. Because of its proven safety record, cromolyn has been the anti-inflammatory agent of choice for prevention of asthma attacks in children over four with chronic moderate asthma. It is not a corticosteroid, so does not inhibit growth in children. Studies indicate that it also may reduce hospitalization rates almost as well as corticosteroids do, and that up to 70% of children who need asthma maintenance therapy would do well on cromolyn. (It may not provide any real benefit for children under four.)\nA cromolyn nasal spray called Nasalcrom has been approved for over-the-counter purchase, but only to relieve nasal congestion caused by allergies. Asthmatic patients should not use it for self-medication without the advice of a physician. Nedocromil (Tilade) is similar to cromolyn and also prevents asthmatic reactions to cold and exercise. Ketotifen, a similar drug, may be useful in preventing allergic asthma, but may not be as effective as cromolyn.\nSide Effects. Side effects of cromolyn include nasal congestion, coughing, sneezing, wheezing, nausea, nosebleeds, and dry throat. Nedocromil has an unpleasant taste and some people have complained of nausea, headache, and spasms in the airways, but no serious side effects have been reported.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids, also called glucocorticoids or steroids, are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs. Steroids are not bronchodilators (that is, they do not relax the airways) and have little effect on symptoms. Instead, they work over time to reduce inflammation and prevent permanent injury in the lungs. Many studies have now shown that the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe asthma significantly reduce the rate of rehospitalizations and deaths from asthma. Nevertheless, they are still significantly underprescribed in the patients who need them most.\nInhaled Corticosteroids. Inhalation of corticosteroids makes it possible to provide effective local anti-inflammatory activity in the lungs with minimal systemic effects. (Oral steroids have considerable side effects.) They are currently recommended as the primary therapy under the following circumstances:\nFor any asthmatic condition more serious than occasional episodes of mild asthma. (Low-doses of inhaled steroids may even be safe and effective for some people with mild asthma, particularly those who find themselves using beta2-agonists daily.)\nWhen treatment with bronchodilators is not effective.\nExamples of inhaled corticosteroids are the following (not all are available to children):\nThe most recent generation of inhaled steroids include (in order of potency) fluticasone (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), triamcinolone (Azmacort and others), and flunisolide (AeroBid). In general, the newer agents, are more powerful than the older generation of inhaled agents. Experts have some concern, then, that these potent agents, particularly fluticasone, may produce major side effects similar to oral agents. Studies are now suggesting, however, that the same benefits can be achieved with low doses of fluticasone as with high ones, thus reducing risks for serious side effects. (Of note, budesonide appears to be safe during pregnancy.)\nThe older corticosteroid inhalants are beclomethasone (Beclovent, Vanceril) and dexamethasone (Decadron Phosphate Respihaler and others). They are less powerful than the newer steroids when delivered with standard inhalers. New inhaler systems for, however, such as QVAR, which uses extra fine formulations of beclomethasone to allow deep delivery into the lungs may prove to be as effective as the newer, more potent steroids.\nBudesonide (Pulmicort Respules) is available in a jet nebulizer for children from 12 months to 8 years. It is, in fact, the first such medication to be approved for children in this age group.\nInhalers that combine both long-acting beta2-agonists and corticosteroids are now available. [ See Combinations of Corticosteroids and Long-Acting Beta2 Agonists.]\nEvidence strongly suggests that early treatment is important for children with severe asthma to prevent deterioration in lung function. In addition, a major 2000 study reported that inhaled steroids may be beneficial and safe even for children with mild to moderate asthma. In the study, inhaled budesonide was more effective than nedocromil in controlling asthma and any effect on growth was slight and temporary.\nUnfortunately an estimated 10% of children do not respond to inhaled steroids, and one 1998 study has reported that as many as 25% of adolescents may be insensitive to the drug. Of some promise is a report that the added use of intravenous immunoglobulin may be effective in such patients and reduce the need for steroids.\nSide effects of inhaled steroids are the following:\nThe most common side effects are throat irritation, hoarseness, and dry mouth. These effects can be minimized or prevented by using a spacer device and rinsing the mouth after each treatment.\nRashes, wheezing, facial swelling (edema), fungal infections (thrush) in the mouth and throat, and bruising are also possible but are not common with inhalators.\nSome children experience changes in mood, memory, and behavior, but they are not permanent.\nSome studies have suggested a higher risk for gum inflammation.\nIt is well known that oral steroids reduce bone density and much research has focused on the effects of inhaled steroids on growth in children. Of some comfort are two major 2000 studies confirming previous ones that reported only a slight (about half an inch) and temporary effect on children's growth. It is not yet known, however, whether inhaled steroids effect lung growth in very young children. Steroids administered using nebulizers are of particular concern. At this time, then, experts caution against them for infants and toddlers with mild asthma and urge close monitoring especially for children under five with severe asthma who are receiving high doses. Calcium supplements appear to help prevent bone loss due to inhaled steroids.\nThere is also some concern that the more potent agents, particularly fluticasone, suppress the adrenal system (which secretes natural steroids) to a greater degree than other steroid inhalants. (This is a serious side effect of oral steroids.)\nOral Corticosteroid s. Oral agents are usually the last drugs to be added to an asthma treatment program and the first to be removed. Common oral corticosteroids include prednisone/prednisolone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and hydrocortisone. They reduce inflammation very effectively, but children generally take them only for five days after hospitalization for an acute attack. Compliance among children can be low, however, since these agents have a bitter taste and can cause vomiting. Taking oral dexamethasone for two days may be as effective and more tolerable than the standard a five-day regimen of prednisone/prednisolone. Prolonged use of oral steroids has widespread effects, and so they are not generally give to children for longer than a few days.\nLong-Acting Beta2-Agonists and Corticosteroid Combinations\nLong-acting beta2-agonists, including salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil), are used for preventing an asthma attack (not for treating symptoms). The effects of one dose of a long-acting beta2 agonist last for about 12 hours, so they are particularly effective during the night. These agents also may be used for prevention of exercise-induced asthma in people and to protect against aspirin-induced asthma.\nAs with short-acting beta2-agonists, the long-acting forms have no effect on inflammation, and they should not be used alone on any regular on basis. Evidence suggests that such use may reduce the effectiveness of the short-acting beta2 agonists, which are the mainstays for treating acute attacks. In patients with moderate to severe asthma, the long-acting beta2 agonists are best used in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs. Adding these agents to a steroid regimen, in fact, may help prevent the need for higher doses of steroids.\nThe long-acting drugs used most are salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil). In comparison studies, they appear to be equally beneficial, although Formoterol has a much faster action and may achieve better control of nighttime asthma. Formoterol, in fact, works almost as fast as the short-acting albuterol and is sometimes used to treat asthma symptoms. Studies indicate that these are safe for children and may, in fact, be particularly effective for them. In one year-long study of children with mild to moderate asthma, salmeterol was not as effective as the corticosteroid beclomethasone, but it did reduce asthma symptoms without retarding growth.\nA single inhaler (Advair Diskus) that combines both long-acting beta2-agonists and corticosteroids is now available for children over age 12. This inhaler appears to be safe and possibly more effective that either agent used alone for patients who do not respond well to other treatments.\nSide Effects. Side effects of long-acting beta2 agonists are similar to the short-acting agents. [S ee Short-Acting Beta2 Agonists under What Are the Specific Drugs Used to Treat Symptoms of Acute Asthma Attacks?]\nLeukotriene-Antagonists\nLeukotriene-antagonists are oral medications that block leukotrienes, powerful immune system factors that, in excess, produce a battery of damaging chemicals that can cause inflammation and spasms in the airways of people with asthma. As with other anti-inflammatory agents, leukotrienes are not used for treating acute asthma attacks.\nThe leukotriene-antagonists include zafirlukast (Accolate), montelukast (Singulair), zileuton (Ziflo), and pranlukast (Ultair, Onon). These agents are proving to be effective for long-term prevention of asthma, including exercise-induced asthma and aspirin (or NSAID)-induced asthma. Many studies to date, however, are not finding any advantages compared to the more potent inhaled corticosteroids. Their anti-inflammatory actions are different from those of steroids, and a combination of the two agents is proving to be particularly effective, although it is not yet clear when such combinations would be useful.\nNevertheless, studies suggest that montelukast, which comes in a chewable tablet, may be particularly useful for managing asthma in small children (ages two to five) with asthma, since they have trouble with inhaled steroids. As suggested by another 2000 study on the effects of zafirlukast, they may also reduce the severity of cat allergies, regardless of whether or not asthma is also present.\nSide Effects and Complications. Gastrointestinal distress is the most common side effect of leukotriene-antagonists. Very few other side effects have been reported. In general, these agents appear to be safe and well tolerated.\nOf some concern are reports of Churg-Strauss syndrome in a few people taking zafirlukast or montelukast. Churg-Strauss syndrome is very rare, but it causes blood vessel inflammation in the lungs and can be life threatening. Oral steroids quickly resolve the problem. In fact, usually the syndrome has occurred in patients who were tapering off steroids and changing over to the leukotrienes-antagonists. Some experts believe that, in such cases, the steroids may simply have masked the presence of the disorder, which then developed when the steroid drugs were withdrawn. Symptoms include severe sinusitis, flu-like symptoms, rash, and numbness in the hands and feet.\nOther concerns are indications of liver injury in patients taking zileuton and zafirlukast when taken at higher than standard doses. No adverse effects on the liver have been reported to date with montelukast.\nWHAT ARE THE EXPERIMENTAL AND OTHER TREATMENTS USED FOR ASTHMA?\nMonoclonal Antibodies\nMonoclonal antibodies (MAb) are genetically-developed agents that are designed to target and attack very specific factors. The following are under investigation.\nA Mab known as omalizumab (Xolair) prevents the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) from triggering the inflammatory events that lead to asthmatic attacks. Studies are very promising for all age groups. Because IgE may play a greater role in causing childhood asthma, however, omalizumab be even more helpful for children than adults.\nKeliximab is another monoclonal antibody under investigation that attacks white blood cells called CD4 lymphocytes, which may be critical in the asthmatic inflammatory process.\nInterleukins\nOther immune agents under investigation are interleukins, a subgroup of immune factors called cytokines, which are important in the inflammatory process. Interleukins serve many functions in the asthma process, some protective and some destructive.\nOf particular promise is an agent called soluble IL-4 receptor that blocks interleukin 4 (IL-4), which regulates many of the events in the allergic response.\nOn other hand, researchers are investigating ways of employing other interleukins (as IL-10 and IL-12) that may actually be helpful, because they have anti-allergenic effects.\nTreatment of Disorders that Might Cause Asthma\nTreatments for GERD. Treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with drugs that reduce acid may reduce symptoms of both conditions in some patients who also have asthma. Not all such patients report improved asthma symptoms with GERD treatments, and they do not appear to have much effect, in any case, on actual lung function. But studies suggest this approach works in only certain patients, with one study suggesting that such asthmatic individuals tended to be overweight and to have severe GERD in the lower esophagus. [ 85, Heartburn and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. ]\nManaging Hormonal-Related Asthma. Women who suspect that menstrual-related changes may influence asthma severity should keep a diary recording their menstrual dates and times of asthma attacks. In some cases, adjusting medications in anticipation of asthma events may help prevent attacks. Some small studies have suggested that hormonal agents called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues may help women with severe premenstrual asthma. Such drugs reduce or suppress estrogen levels, however, and can have severe side effects. More research is needed to determine if the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.\nAntibiotics\nCertain antibiotics, such as Clarithromycin (Biaxin), are being studied for the ability to increase the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids.\nAlternative Treatments\nAccording to some studies, alternative therapies such as acupuncture, hypnosis, and breathing relaxation techniques are being widely used by both children and adults with asthma with some good results. Research also suggests that meditation practices are very effective companion therapies for asthma patients.\nThe Buteyko Breathing Method. The Buteyko breathing method is an experimental approach designed to increase levels of carbon dioxide in the body. To do this, patients are trained to reduce their volume of breath and to avoid hyperventilation (over-breathing). Some studies are reporting that patients use this method reduce their use of medications and improve their quality of life. The system originated in Australia and is not yet widely available in the US.\nHerbal Remedies. Herbal remedies have been used with apparent success in Eastern nations, but few have been studied rigorously in the United States. It should be noted that even when natural remedies appear to be effective in trials, there are no standards or regulations in the US to guarantee their quality, effectiveness, or safety. Of great concern are their growing use and the possibilities of serious drug interactions. Patients who try alternative treatments must be sure to inform their physician.\nWHAT ARE WAYS TO MANAGE ASTHMA AND REDUCE THE ALLERGIC RESPONSE?\nGeneral Guidelines\nThe more allergies a child has, the more severe the asthma. An asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Important irritants or allergens included the following:\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home. (In one study, allergies to dust mites did not appear to have any affect on hospitalization, although they are capable of triggering asthma attacks.)\nAnimal dander.\nMolds.\nFungi.\nCockroaches. Cockroaches are major asthma triggers and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nOf some concern are studies reporting no change in asthmatic symptoms after controlling cat or dust mite allergens. More research is needed to identify the reasons for this.\nOf particular interest are studies reporting that exposure to common allergens, such as dust mites, cats, and dogs in the first year of life may actually prevent later development of allergies and asthma. It should be stressed, however, that for children or adults with existing allergic asthma, exposure to common allergens worsens the condition.\nIndoor Protection\nSome experts believe that reducing the risk factors for asthma in the home could reduce asthma in children by 40%.\nControlling Pets. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on. In fact, early intense exposure to pets in small children may help protect them against allergies and asthma.\nNevertheless in children who have a history of an allergic reach to a pet one study reported that they had 24 times the risk for development asthma as those without an allergy. In such cases, pets should be given away or kept outside. If this isn't possible, they should at least be confined to carpet-free areas outside the bedroom. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually present fewer problems. Washing animals once a week can reduce allergens. Dry shampoos, such as Allerpet, are now available for both cats and dogs that remove allergens from skin and fur and are easier to administer than wet shampoos.\nFor small children, stuffed animals might serve as a comforting replacement, although they might harbor dust mites. Putting stuffed animals in the freezer for 24 hours before washing them kills the dust mites. For best effect, this process should be done weekly.\nPreventing Exposure to Cigarette Smoke. Parents who smoke are strongly urged to make strenuous efforts to quit. Studies are finding that exposure to second-hand smoke in the home increases the risk for asthma and asthma-related emergency room visits in children. When added to other potential allergens such as cats or dampness in the home, passive smoke multiplies the risk of children developing asthma.\nParental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first two to 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. Such mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases babies' risks for asthma.\nSadly, the more heavily parents smoke, the less likely they are to seek treatment for their asthmatic children, according to a 2000 study. The authors of this study speculate that either the parents may have reduced awareness of their children's symptoms, or else they may not want to be told to quit smoking by their children's doctors. [For help in quitting, see the Report # 41, Smoking.]\nRemoving Allergens from the Air and Carpets. Air cleaners, filters for air conditioners, and vacuum cleaners with HEPA filters can help remove particles and small allergens found indoors. Neither vacuuming nor the use of anti-mite carpet shampoo is effective in removing mites. In fact, vacuuming stirs up both mites and cat allergens.\nCarpets and rugs are major sources of allergens in any case and should be avoided if possible. HEPA vacuum cleaners appear to be effective in reducing levels of second-hand smoke and preventing cat allergens from being released into the air. Neither vacuuming nor the use of anti-mite carpet shampoo is effective in removing mites. In fact, vacuuming, even with a HEPA filter, stirs up both mites and cat allergens.\nHouse dust itself, however, can be a reservoir for pollen, so keeping a house dust-free is still helpful. A 2002 study reported that spray furniture polishing is very effective for reducing both dust and allergens.\nBedding and Curtains. Using semipermeable coverings to fully encase mattresses and pillows is the most proven effective step in reducing dust mite levels. (Vinyl mattress covers limit airflow and may also exacerbate, or even cause, asthma in children. Synthetic pillows may pose a significantly higher risk for severe asthma attacks in children than feather or no pillows.) Curtains should be replaced with shades or blinds and bedding washed using the highest temperature setting.\nOne 1999 study found that children sleeping in bottom bunk beds are significantly more likely to develop asthma than siblings occupying the upper bunks. Families with asthmatic children should avoid bunk beds or be sure that children with asthma sleep in the top bunk. Even with standard beds, it may be useful to have them sleep as high off the floor as possible.\nReducing Humidity in the House. Although warm, moist air from vaporizers can greatly ease and moderate asthma attacks, living in a damp house is counter productive. Dust mites thrive in humidity and damp houses increase the risk for mold. On-going humidifiers, then, can be counterproductive. If they are used, humidity levels should not exceed 40% and they should be cleaned daily with a vinegar solution.\nDisposable Diapers. Of concern was a 1999 study that reported lung irritation in mice exposed to chemical emissions from several brands of disposable diapers. Researchers in this study recommend that children with asthma or other respiratory diseases should use cloth diapers and avoid disposable diapers until more research has been conducted.\nExterminating Cockroaches and House Mice. Cockroaches should be eliminated by professional exterminators, although a study reported that ridding a home of cockroaches and cleaning the house using standard housecleaning techniques failed to eliminate the cockroach allergens themselves. Mice should be eliminated, and attempts should be made to remove all dust, which might contain mouse urine and dander.\nOutdoor Protection\nAvoiding Outdoor Allergens. The following are some recommendations for avoiding allergens outside:\nCamping and hiking trips should not be scheduled during times of high pollen count (in the Northern states, May and June for grass pollen and mid-August to October for ragweed).\nPatients should avoid strenuous activity when ozone levels are highest, which usually occur in early afternoon, particularly on hot hazy summer days. Levels are lowest in early morning and at dusk.\nAsthma attacks are often higher during thunderstorms. It is not clear why. Some evidence points to a build-up of ozone that accompanies such storms. One study suggested that changing airflow patterns bring a sudden downdraft of air containing concentrations of pollens, small particles and allergens.\nPatients who are allergic to mold should avoid barns, hay, raking leaves, and mowing grass. Exposure to automobile fumes may worsen asthma. Fungi in car air conditioners can also be a problem.\nReducing Exposure to Air Pollution. A number of studies have linked air pollution to asthma. Children breathe faster than adults, taking in more pollutants, and therefore appear to be particularly susceptible to soot and other small particles in the air. A 2001 study found an association between higher rates of asthma and other health problems in children who were exposed to high levels of specific pollutants (particularly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide). Diesel fuel exhaust has also been associated with worsened asthma in children.\nSome experts point out that asthma rates in North America have increased over recent years while the prevalence of many common air pollutants have declined. So pollution is unlikely to be a primary cause of asthma. Regardless of whether pollution is an important cause of asthma, evidence strongly suggests that it can worsen existing asthma.\nThe effects of specific pollutants are unclear and conflicting. For example, some research indicates that nitrogen dioxide increases hospitalization in childhood asthma by precipitating upper respiratory infections. There are conflicting reports on the effects of ozone, however. Some studies indicate that high levels do not increase the risk for hospitalization from asthma attacks, although other studies indicate that such findings may apply to children.\nAntihistamines\nA 2002 study reported that infants with allergies who were given the antihistamine cetirizine (Zyrtec) were much less likely to develop asthma later on. This encouraging research warrants more work.\nAllergy Shots\nAllergy shots (immunotherapy) are proving to be highly effective in reducing allergic asthma symptoms in both adults and children. Immunotherapy can also prevent the development of new allergies, the worsening of allergic symptoms, and the onset of asthma in susceptible people.\nDietary Factors\nWeight Loss. Children who are both asthmatic and overweight may reduce asthma symptoms simply with weight loss.\nAntioxidant Foods and Supplements. Some evidence indicates that having low dietary intake of antioxidant nutrients (vitamins A, C, and E, selenium and other food chemicals) could increase the risk for lung damage. Taking supplements does not appear to have any effective. Such nutrients are best obtained from fresh, deep green and yellow-orange fruits and vegetables, which contain other chemicals that might be lung protective. In one study, people who consumed selenium-rich foods (fish, red meat, grains, eggs, chicken, liver, and garlic) had a lower risk for asthma. In the same study, eating apples was also associated with protection. (Apples contain important food chemicals called flavonoids.)\nFats. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in cold water oily fish and in supplements (usually DHA-EPA) have anti-inflammatory effects and may be helpful for asthma. On the other hand, some data indicate that omega-6 fatty acids (found in margarine and most vegetable oils) may increase inflammation. High intake may have some negative impact.\nFood Allergies. Although 67% of asthmatics believe their symptoms are aggravated by food allergies, studies indicate that this belief may be true in only 5% of cases. If young children show signs of or test positive for food allergies, however, parents should be extra cautious in preventing exposure to any asthma trigger. Some physicians now counsel all children with asthma to avoid nuts entirely, and, of course, children who experience reactions to any foods should avoid them. Chemicals that may pose some risk for an allergic reaction are monosodium glutamate, or MSG (found in some canned soups, cheese, and certain vegetables), and sulfites (preservatives in foods, such as frozen potatoes and tuna). Contrary to what many believe, dairy products do not appear to exacerbate asthma symptoms in people who are not already allergic to them.\nExercise\nAsthmatic children should be encouraged to swim and play sports, such as baseball, that will present less difficulty for them. Intense activities lasting less than two minutes, such as sprinting or competitive swimming, are less problematic than longer exercises.\nIt should be noted that asthma is no reason to avoid exercise. Historically, about 10% of US athletes who participated in the Olympics have been asthmatic. Some studies are indicating that long-term exercise may even help control asthma and reduce hospitalization.\nYoung people who enjoy running should probably choose an indoor track to avoid pollutants. Swimming is excellent for people with asthma. Yoga practice, which uses both stretching, breathing, and meditation techniques may have particular benefits. One study reported that two thirds of patients who practiced yoga regularly were able to reduce or stop taking their asthma medications.\nPatients should consult their physicians before embarking on any exercise program. Exercise-induced asthma is a limited that has specific recommendations. [ See Box Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA) ]\nPreventing and Treating Respiratory Infections\nPeople with asthma should try to minimize their risk for respiratory tract infections. Washing hands is a very simple but effective preventive measure.\nThere has been some question concerning influenza vaccinations because of some reports that vaccines may worsen asthma. Recent and major studies have been reporting, however, that the vaccination is safe for adults and children. It is also very important for patients to reduce their risk for respiratory diseases. Still, 90% of asthma patients remain unvaccinated (note: vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines . Please review all the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.).\nAsthma patients should ask their physicians about the flu vaccine and also whether they should receive the vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia.\nZanamivir, a new drug used for treating influenza, is now considered safe for asthma patients 12 years of age or older. And, in one study, asthma patients treated with zanamivir experienced fewer flu symptoms and their lung function improved. [ 94, Colds, Flus, Sore Throats, and Acute Bronchitis .]\nReducing Stress and Negative Moods\nPeople with asthma have no higher rate of anxiety or depression than the general population. However, such emotions interact with the effects of asthma and its treatments in important ways:\nNegative emotions can discourage compliance with medication and the ability to cope.\nPoor control of asthma symptoms, in turn, increases the risk for negative emotions.\nStress and depression have been associated with more severe symptoms and even an increased risk of fatal asthma attacks.\nOn the other hand, a positive attitude and relaxation techniques may be very helpful in the long-term management of asthma.

It is a common practice to treat even low-grade fevers of 101\u00b0 to 102\u00b0F with antipyretics. Home use of antipyretics upon the first signs of fever is also common. These behaviors have lead to the ubiquitous use of aspirin, acetaminophen, nimesulide, and ibuprofen which control temperature by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus.\u201d 1\nParacetamol (or, acetaminophen, or Tylenol to Americans) was first used in medicine in 1893, but only became a commonly used drug in 1949. 2 Until 1971, no one had a clue how it worked, but that didn\u2019t matter. Doctors didn\u2019t seem to think that was important. Fever was \u201cdangerous\u201d so you stamped it out at all costs. Since 1972, scientists have been gradually starting to unravel some of the ways paracetamol suppresses various pathways in the brain and in the body, but as of 2008, their knowledge is incomplete, and part of the reason for that is that these same researchers still don\u2019t understand all the gears the body goes through to produce a fever, or why each gear is important, or the reason for the body getting into immune-system cruise as a result of fever. Most of these researchers just don\u2019t understand that fever is there as a beneficial adaptive response. When you don\u2019t know something as basic as that, but are intent on simply suppressing it because it can be done, you can be sure you are asking for trouble somewhere down the line.\nIn the late 1990s I was invited to participate in an afternoon\u2019s presentation at an Auckland medical education facility, ostensibly to speak about vaccination. My talk was sandwiched in between those of two other speakers, so to reduce any disruption of student concentration I was invited to attend the whole afternoon. The room had chairs and tables in a horseshoe shape, and I was seated near the rounded top of the ? hump, so to speak. The tutor was next to a whiteboard, by the two \u201cheels\u201d. Within 15 minutes I decided I wasn\u2019t going to speak about vaccination only, because as the tutor\u2019s presentation progressed, I got angrier and angrier. How could paediatric staff be taught unscientific opinion?!\nCome my turn, I said that I had some grave concerns about the accuracy of some of the \u201copinions\u201d expressed by the previous speaker. The word opinion was used since I saw no references or \u201cfacts\u201d put up on the whiteboard. This person was purely talking off the top of their head. Without sparing anyone\u2019s feelings or reputation, I launched into a literary review of the FACTS indicating that FEVER has a crucial role in fi ghting infections, and then into another literary review, showing paracetamol to be dangerous when suppressing a temperature. The article I started with was a 1995 medical article,3 the conclusion of which says:\nThere is little evidence to support the use of paracetamol to treat fever in patients without heart or lung disease, or to prevent febrile convulsions. Indeed, paracetamol may decrease the antibody response to infection, and increase morbidity and mortality in severe infection. It should be explained to parents that fever is usually a helpful response to infection, and that paracetamol should be used to reduce discomfort, but not to treat fever.\nThe whiteboard rapidly filled with facts from this article, and other articles, showing that the use of paracetamol as an infection temperature reducer was not only unscientific, but highly dangerous, because, as intensive care unit specialist, Dr Shann, said:\nImmunity: Too many parents and health workers think that infection is bad, infection causes fever, and that therefore fever is bad. In fact, fever is often a benefi cial host response to infection, and moderate fever improves immunity.\nShann had discussed mammalian studies which showed increased death rates for both virus and bacterial infections, increased viral shedding in flu patients, and reduced antibody levels when antipyretics were used. He then said that:\nTherefore, it may not be a good idea to give drugs that reduce temperature to patients with severe infection. This evidence suggests that aspirin and paracetamol increase mortality in severe infection, and that they may prolong the infection and reduce the antibody response in mild disease.\nBy the time I\u2019d finished, the board was covered with medical references, but as I looked around the room, it seemed as if the audience had shut off, in some mindnumbing, glazed-eyes \u201cdefault\u201d mode, which presumably said, \u201cListen to the teacher, not to some numbskull mother.\u201d So I quickly asked for questions. The first one was, \u201cWhat medical school did you go to?\u201d My reply was instant. \u201cWhich medical articles on fever and infection have you read?\u201d\nLooking through my 2007 telephone logbook, I have had about 12 conversations with people during the year, who were in hospital, and who were treated like scum by staff who thought they were criminally negligent because they didn\u2019t want their children treated with paracetamol for fever.\nI had one conversation with an overseas mother whose child had been exposed to chickenpox and was taken to the doctor with a fever. The doctor thought it would be chickenpox, given the known exposure and time frame, and told the mother to treat with paracetamol. The doctor then had a brainwave, and gave this child an MMR shot because it would \u201csave\u201d the mother coming back in three weeks\u2019 time. The mother did as told, and for several days, the child\u2019s fever was treated as specified by the doctor. Not only did the child get chickenpox, but got measles as well, had seizures, and died.\nIn the child\u2019s post-mortem, neither the role of paracetamol, nor of MMR was considered relevant to the cause of death, which was specified as \u201cchickenpox\u201d. I believe the role of both paracetamol and the MMR were very relevant as factors in this child\u2019s death, and that such a post mortem reveals the ignorance and contempt that many doctors have to this day, to the immunosuppressive role of fever reducers, or to any suggestion that a sick child should never be vaccinated.\nWhen I settled down to read a 2007 article in Pediatrics, 4 these two parts of sentences leapt off the page:\n\u201cUnderstanding the role of fever, if any \u2026\u201d and later, \u201c\u2026 the functional significance of fever remains uncertain.\u201d\nIn 2007, no one in the department of Neurology and Developmental Medicine in Maryland, or any of the people in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Pennsylvania, had a clue about the role of fever in infection? Why is that? Okay, they were looking at it in the context of autistic children. This study was undertaken because, \u201cIn the past few decades, parents and clinicians have reported that behaviors of children with ASD5s tend to improve, sometimes dramatically, during febrile episodes.\u201d The children\u2019s improvement subsided afterwards, but the question remains to be answered, \u201cWHY?\u201d\nHere again, we have a wonderful example of what \u201cproof\u201d is. Proof is whatever the doctor says it is, until they are proven incorrect. When a parent says, \u201cMy autistic child improved dramatically during fever\u201d, it is anecdote. Even when clinicians agree, that knowledge is still \u201canecdote\u201d, and it takes decades before a study of individuals is done, to confirm what parents have known for a very long time.\nWhen the same parent says, \u201cMy child had absolutely no problems before any vaccines, had this reaction, was never the same again, and here\u2019s the proof,\u201d the eyes of the medical profession glaze over.\nThe only useful response from this study was that, \u201cmore research is needed to prove conclusively fever-specific effects and elucidate their underlying biological mechanisms \u2026\u201d\nHowever, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s more to the 2007 article than meets the eye.\nThe premise of another autism study, 6 conducted in 2003, was that: \u201cThe blockage of fever with antipyretics interferes with normal immunological development in the brain, leading to neurodevelopment disorders such as autism in certain genetically and immunologically disposed individuals.\u201d\nThe article then goes on to say that \u201cThe effects may occur in utero or at a very young age when the immune system is rapidly developing.\u201d Antipyretics might lead to neurodevelopment disorders if given when the immune system is rapidly developing? What about vaccines?\nSuch statements allow blame to be placed back on the mother to take the focus off all the talk about autism and vaccines. What these studies should show people, is how little doctors actually know.\nThere is another interesting point in the discussion, and that\u2019s the fact that for once, someone has taken \u201canecdote\u201d seriously, albeit just about a generation after the anecdotes were first told. Let me tell you some \u201canecdotes\u201d from the days when parents were not paranoid about measles, and when some young wives and mothers knew how to dose measles with vitamin A, vitamin C and other treatments which doctors said didn\u2019t exist. We knew that contrary to vaccination-spin pamphlets, complications and deaths were very unlikely in healthy children treated correctly.\nLike-minded parents used to get together and comment how, after measles, or even moderate fevers from other infections, children would make developmental milestone leaps, and it was not trickery of the imagination. This happened twice in our house. I have a habit of writing everything down, during and after infections, because I know it won\u2019t be remembered in days or years to come. Also, I liked Plunket nurses 7 and doctors to know what I\u2019d written before they filled in the next gap, even if they did sigh and roll their eyes before writing in their own words of wisdom!\nAfter our older son\u2019s bout of measles, he made leaps and bounds in language.\nHis already good vocabulary suddenly increased in both numbers of words, and the fl uency with which he strung them together. With our younger son, his development improvement was in a totally different area. He had been very clumsy and used to fall forwards a lot. After measles, not only did he stop falling over at all, but his overall co-ordination, including eye-hand co-ordination, was a lot less \u201crandom\u201d.\nOur friends noticed similar things, but all of them shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s just normal. All kids make strides of some sort after measles.\u201d\nOur GP, on hearing this, laughed somewhat like a donkey\u2019s bray. Ten years later, I listened with interest, as an anthroposophical doctor talked about this phenomenon, and noted articles from anthroposophical medical journals on his table.\nIs there something valid to these anecdotes from parents who saw their children\u2019s overall health improve after a decent fever?\nWhat say it\u2019s not \u201cjust\u201d autistic children who show temporary improvement during a fever? What if fever is a very powerful, positive neurodevelopmental tool required for all young children, which is needed to burn out (for the lack of a better term) \u201cglitches\u201d in the cranial system, or perhaps unknown epigenetic influences?\nWhat say depriving children of infectious diseases, by using vaccines and using paracetamol for every other fever, is doing exactly the opposite to what the body needs, and is designed to do?\nWhy do doctors and hospitals make parents treat fever as if it\u2019s something bad, to be brought down immediately, and to be feared?\nLooking through clear fi les full of medical articles on (ab)use of paracetamol for infectious fever, I am amazed to see the number of times, and in such a broad variety of clinical situations, 8 that this phrase comes up:\n\u201cRoutine antipyretic therapy in children with infectious diseases has long been the source of controversy.\u201d\nControversy? Where? I know of no mother who frequents a doctor\u2019s surgery who realizes there is any controversy around the use of paracetamol for infection. For decades now, a few medical people have had doubts, and made rumbling noises, but does their discontent achieve anything in reality? Is anyone researching what fever does in the body, not just in terms of infection outcome, but in the context of the overall health of children?\nNo. So, why is paracetamol even suggested?\nThe answer lies in some of the advertisements we have seen, and still see. Forinstance, the McNell Motrin advertisement used in American Newsweek in 2000, 9 told us that Motrin \u201cnever surrenders\u201d and is \u201cFor Moms who don\u2019t fool around with fever.\u201d\nIn other words, to do nothing is fooling around, and fooling around equates to being a bad parent.\nA recent advertisement 10 in New Zealand for paracetamol is a lot more subtle and takes the \u201cintellectual pride\u201d route. It says:\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put just anything in my body. That\u2019s why I always think twice about what I do. Some decisions are hard to make. But in the end, you\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right for you. Panadol. It\u2019s my choice.\u201d\nWhich tells you nothing about Panadol\u00ae, but is pitched to make you think that if clever people who think twice, make the \u201cchoice\u201d to take Panadol\u00ae, that would be the right thing for you to do as well. It\u2019s the old \u2018go with the (alleged) crowd\u2019 trick. Do readers think about the fact that they aren\u2019t told what those supposedly clever people even thought about in the fi rst place?\nStudies conducted overseas 11 and in New Zealand12 have shown that children who were given paracetamol early in life have a 25% higher risk 13 , of having asthma symptoms. Antibiotic use in infancy has been found to have the same association.\nIt would seem logical to assume that both paracetamol and antibiotics have a negative impact on the immune system in the long term. What does paracetamol do in the immune system, during fever, or to the immune system afterwards? I can\u2019t find any answers in the medical literature.\nIt\u2019s vital that the fever/paracetamol/immune system issues are resolved, for the sake of both parents\u2019 and children\u2019s health.\nNo doubt until then, I will continue to be sent stories like this one from an overseas blogger who had finished reading Chapter 39 in our first book, 14 Just a\nLittle Prick, and felt compelled to tell their story. He gave permission for me to publish their experience with fever.\nOne morning when Savannah was barely one, while playing around with us in bed, she suddenly went slack and inert. Controlled panic ensued. I drove, in pyjamas and stockinged feet, at breakneck speed to get her to the hospital, about 8 minutes away. Several white-clad professionals immediately went to work on her. She was given some kind of fever reducing injection (I probably don\u2019t want to know what it was). I think her fever had spiked to 105 oF or so. When I asked if this might cause brain damage, I was told that only an EEG could tell. So we subjected Savannah to the machine, with wires stuck to her scalp. She \u201cturned out\u201d to be just fine, for which \u201cintelligence\u201d we had to fork out aplenty. We were advised to bathe Savannah in water as cold as she could stand. We did. Next day, we took her to a pediatrician someone recommended.\nHe diagnosed Roseola.\nHe became visibly angry when we told him what we had been sprung for the EEG. Then he told us the truth. \u201cChildren are capable of withstanding temperature spikes like that with no damage. My hardest job is to convince parents to DO NOTHING when their children develop high fevers. They can handle it.\u201d\nHow many doctors do you know, who would have told the parents that children can handle fever?\nNotes\n1 Torres, A.R. 2003 \u201cIs fever suppression involved in the etiology of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders?\u201d BMC Pediatr, 3: 9, September 2.

Doctors should use multiple measures to determine a patient\u2019s current condition and future risk for worsening of condition. Even patients who show few daily effects of asthma may be in danger of sudden worsening of symptoms.\nPatient Education. Patients should be taught skills to self-monitor and manage asthma. Doctors should give patients a written asthma action plan, which includes information on daily treatment and ways to recognize worsening asthma.\nControl of Environmental Factors and Other Asthma Triggers. The guidelines outline new approaches for reducing exposure to allergens. They also address how treating co-existing chronic conditions (such as rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity) can help improve asthma control.\nMedications. The NAEPP specifies different treatment plans for children based on three age groups: 0 - 4 years, 5 - 11 years, and 12 years and older. A stepwise approach is recommended where medication types and doses are increased or decreased based on the level of asthma control.\nAsthma Symptoms\nChest tightness\nIntroduction\nThe word asthma originates from an ancient Greek word meaning panting. Essentially, asthma is an inflammatory lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe properly.\nWhen any people inhale, the air travels through the following structures:\nAir passes into the lungs and flows through progressively smaller airways called bronchi and then bronchioles. The lungs contain millions of these airways.\nAll bronchioles lead to alveoli, which are microscopic sacs where oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is expelled.\nThe major features of the lungs include the bronchi, the bronchioles, and the alveoli. The alveoli are the microscopic sacs lined by tiny blood vessels that take in oxygen and give up carbon dioxide.\nAsthma is a chronic condition in which these airways undergo changes when stimulated by allergens or other environmental triggers. Such changes appear to be two specific responses:\nThe hyperreactive response (also called hyperresponsiveness)\nThe inflammatory response\nThese actions in the airway cause coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath (dyspnea), the classic symptoms of asthma.\nHyperreactive Response\nIn the hyperreactive response, smooth muscles in the airways constrict and narrow excessively in response to inhaled allergens or other irritants. Airways in everyone's lungs respond by constricting when exposed to allergens or irritants, but there are major differences in the hyperreactive response that occurs in people with asthma:\nWhen people without asthma breathe in and out deeply, the airways relax and open in order to rid the lungs of the irritant.\nWhen people with asthma try to take those same deep breaths, their airways do not relax but instead narrow, causing the patients to pant for breath. Smooth muscles in the airways of people with asthma may have a defect, perhaps a deficiency in a critical chemical that prevents the muscles from relaxing. And, during an asthma attack the airways narrow, making breathing difficult.\nInflammatory Response\nThe hyperreactive stage is followed by the inflammatory response, which generally contributes to asthma in the following way:\nThe immune system responds to allergens or other environmental triggers by delivering white blood cells and other immune factors to the airways.\nThese so-called inflammatory factors cause the airways to swell, fill with fluid, and produce a thick sticky mucus.\nThis combination results in wheezing, breathlessness, an inability to exhale properly, and a phlegm-producing cough.\nClick the icon to see an image of a normal versus asthmatic bronchiole.\nInflammation appears to be present in the lungs of all patients with asthma, even those with mild cases, and plays a key role in all forms of the disease.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of asthma is unknown. Asthma is most likely caused by a combination of genetic (inherited) factors and environmental triggers (such as allergens and infections). Asthma tends to run in families, so children whose parents have asthma are more likely to develop it themselves.\nThe Allergic Response (Allergens)\nAsthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also at greater risk for developing asthma as adults. However, only a minority of children with allergies have asthma.\nIn people with allergies, the immune system overreacts to exposure to allergens. Allergic asthma is triggered by inhaling certain substances (allergens) such as:\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.\nAnimal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on.\nMolds.\nCockroaches. Cockroach dust is a major trigger and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nPollen, from plants.\nEnvironmental Factors (Irritants)\nAn asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants include:\nSmoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases their baby's risks for asthma\nFood allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies. Some research suggests that peanut and milk allergies may increase asthma severity.\nIndoor chemicals. Chemicals used in household cleaning products and furniture materials can be asthma triggers.\nAir pollution. Fossil fuels and chemicals that contribute to air pollution may worsen asthma symptoms.\nInfections\nThe role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.\nStudies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is associated with the development of asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.\nCommon respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. More likely, these viruses do not directly cause asthma, but worsen asthma in children who already have it. Rhinovirus is the most common infection associated with asthma attacks.\nResearch indicates that children who have viral-induced wheezing during infancy may be at increased risk for later development of asthma. However, many children outgrow attacks of intermittent wheezing.\nRisk Factors\nAsthma affects about 7 million American children. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it is more common in girls.\nRace and Ethnicity\nAfrican-American children have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children. Ethnicity and genetics, however, are less likely to play a role in these differences than socioeconomic differences, such as having less access to optimal health care and a greater likelihood of living in an urban area. Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma.\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nA variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies include:\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. Children born in the winter may have a greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nBreastfeeding. Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby\u2019s first 3 months of life may help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 6 months.\nComplications of Pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nThere is a strong association between obesity and asthma. People who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) also have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath helps reduce airway obstruction and improve lung function. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #53: Weight control and diet .].\nOther Risk Factors\nGERD. At least half of patients with asthma also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors. Treating GERD does not appear to improve asthma control. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease .]\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is a condition in which asthma gets worse after taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition, associated with many asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nPatients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil and other brands, generic) and naproxen (Aleve, generic).\nPrognosis\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma death rates have steadily declined, and asthma is now only rarely fatal in children. Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma\nTwo or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the past year\nUsing two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral or psychosocial problems\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat\nAfrican-American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk.\nLong-Term Outlook\nAsthma generally improves as children get older, although most school-age children with persistent asthma will still experience symptoms through adolescence. Some children outgrow their asthma by adulthood. In general, the more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will persist.\nSevere asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest when asthma strikes children in their first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nSymptoms\nIn children with asthmatic symptoms, it is important to first consider as a possible cause inhaled foreign objects such as peanuts; viral infections such as croup; and bacterial infections, which may be accompanied by high fever and progress rapidly. Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nWheezing is nearly always present during an attack. Wheezing is a whistling sound caused by the narrowed airways.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in patients with asthma.\nCoughing. In some people, the first (or only) symptom of asthma is a dry cough. The cough may be worse at night.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAny of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation lasts for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nThe following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly but it may sometimes develop to a fatal or near-fatal attack within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious.\nExercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People who have only EIA do not need long-term maintenance therapy.\nClick the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of patients with asthma. Attacks often occur between 2 and 4 a.m. Nighttime attacks may indicate poor asthma control.\nDiagnosis\nPulmonary Function Tests\nIf symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor will usually perform tests called pulmonary function tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:\nVital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or exhaled.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.\nForced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 second.\nIf the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on the results, the doctor will take the following steps:\nIf measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a bronchodilator medication. This drug is used in asthma to open the air passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma is strongly suspected.\nIf measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is still suspected, the doctor may perform a challenge test. It involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests help diagnose for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOne of the most common methods of allergy testing is the scratch test or skin prick test. The test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substance (allergen) on the skin (usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back), then scratching or pricking the skin so that the allergen is introduced under the skin surface. The skin is observed closely for signs of a reaction, which usually includes swelling and redness of the site. With this test, several suspected allergens can be tested at the same time, and results are usually available within about 20 minutes.\nTreatment\nGeneral Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma\nWhile medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, appropriate management of asthma involves much more:\nIdentifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers\nFollowing appropriate drug treatments\nHome monitoring performed by either patient or family\nGood communication between doctor and patient\nNeeded psychosocial support\nTreatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)\nThe severity of asthma is classified into four groups: Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:\nSymptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout the day\nNighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly\nShort-acting beta2-agonist used for symptom control, ranging from 2 or fewer days per week to several times per day\nInterference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited\nLung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary function testing at the doctor's office\nNumber of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.\nOnce patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age groupings:\n4 years old or younger\n5 - 11 years old\nTreating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease\nMedications for asthma fall into two categories:\nRescue (Quick-Relief) Medications. Medications that open the airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.\nLong-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications. Long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For children over age 5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, doctors recommend inhaled corticosteroids, with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.\nThe goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children\u2019s asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time.\nUnfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.\nThese are the signs of well-controlled asthma:\nAsthma symptoms occur twice a week or less\nRescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less\nSymptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening\nSymptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities\nPeak flow meter readings are normal or the patient\u2019s personal best\nBoth the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled\nSteps for Treating Asthma\nA stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on a patient\u2019s age and asthma severity, there are specific recommendations regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations based on a specific patient.\nIn choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks of starting therapy to assess response.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger include:\nLong-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four or more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.\nNebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer medications to children this age.\nOnly certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are recommended for these children.\nClose follow-up is recommended\nAvoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:\nParticipation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged.\nSchools, child care, and camps should all have a copy of the asthma action plan.\nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies that may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.\nAvoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.\nThe variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.\nDevices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering any asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.\nThe spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient additional time to inhale. In addition, MDIs can continue to deliver propellant even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing a metered dose inhaler.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Some patients find that they are easier to manage than MDIs. Humidity or extreme temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.\nNebulizers. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects.\nChildren who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable at home.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing the use of a nebulizer.\nNon-Medical Treatment Strategies\nAsthma can trigger a difficult emotional-physical cycle:\nBreathlessness and wheezing incite a fear of suffocation and death, even in very small children.\nThis anxiety produces further constriction on the muscles surrounding the airways, which makes breathing even more difficult.\nCaregivers must first focus on reducing their own anxiety, which can heighten a child's own fears. The next step is to help the child relax. One method for this is as follows:\nThe child sits comfortably, bending slight forward with the eyes closed.\nThe hands are placed gently over the navel.\nThe child is then told to pretend the stomach is a balloon.\nThe \"balloon\" must be \"blown up\" by inhalation, not exhalation. The child can tell if this working because the hands will move slightly apart.\nWhen the child breathes out, the \"balloon\" will be made flat.\nThis exercise both relaxes the child and discourages shallow, oxygen-poor breathing. Massaging the child in gentle circles on the chest is relaxing and may also loosen mucus.\nOther recommendations include:\nA child may find relief by lying stomach-down on several pillows so that the head is slightly lower than the chest while the caregiver gently pats the back between the shoulder blades.\nWarm liquids, such as soup or hot cider, are effective in loosening mucus and may also relax bronchial muscles. Cold fluids, like cold air, should be avoided.\nOverhydration (too much liquid) can be harmful, however, so these drinks should not be forced on the child.\nWarm, moist air from vaporizers can greatly ease and moderate asthma attacks.\nVisits by home health care nurses or social workers may help if the family is having trouble managing the asthma and following prescribed treatments. Often, having the home evaluated for triggers can be very helpful.\nQuick-Relief Medications\nThese medications quickly control acute asthma attacks.\nShort-Acting Beta2-Agonists\nBeta2-agonists serve as bronchodilators, relaxing and opening constricted airways during an acute asthma attack. A short-acting inhaled beta2-agonist, taken as needed, is often the only medication used by children with chronic mild asthma.\nAlbuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), called salbutamol outside the U.S., is the standard short-acting beta2-agonist in America. Other similar beta2-agonists are isoproterenol (Isuprel, Norisodrine, and Medihaler-Iso), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, Brethaire, and Bricanyl), levalbuterol (Xopenex), and bitolterol (Tornalate).\nShort-acting bronchodilators are generally administered through inhalation and are effective for 3 - 6 hours. They relieve the symptoms of acute attacks, but they do not control the underlying inflammation. If asthma continues to worsen with the use of these drugs, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs to treat underlying inflammation.\nSide Effects of Beta2-Agonists. Side effects of all beta2-agonists may include:\nAnxiety\n"}, {"score": 845.2673, "uuid": "dd2f070b-d815-5987-8681-6fa11f193dc1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-50-23680", "target_hostname": "www.stthomasmorehosp.org", "target_uri": "http://www.stthomasmorehosp.org/body.cfm?id=147&action=detail&aearticleid=000005&aeproductid=adam2004%5f5010", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Asthma <em>in</em> <em>Children</em> and Adolescents, Health Information", "snippet": "Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) <em>in</em> the nasal passages.

If you experience any of these symptoms, your doctor may recommend discontinuing the drug.\nLong-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are medications used for preventing an asthma attack (not for treating symptoms). The FDA advises that they should only be used in combination with an asthma controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol-budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination products. These medications should be used for the shortest time possible, and should only be used by patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled by other medications.\nThe FDA is reviewing whether omalizumab (Xolair) may be associated with increased risk for heart and vascular problems (ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and blood clots).\nAsthma Guidelines\nThe U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma recommend:\nAssessment and Monitoring. Doctors should use multiple measures to determine a patient\u2019s current condition and future risk for worsening of condition. Even patients who show few daily effects of asthma may be in danger of sudden worsening of symptoms.\nPatient Education. Patients should be taught skills to self-monitor and manage asthma. Doctors should give patients a written asthma action plan, which includes information on daily treatment and ways to recognize worsening asthma.\nControl of Environmental Factors and Other Asthma Triggers. The guidelines outline new approaches for reducing exposure to allergens. They also address how treating co-existing chronic conditions (rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity) can help improve asthma control.\nMedications. The NAEPP specifies different treatment plans for children based on three age groups: 0 - 4 years, 5 - 11 years, and 12 years and older. A stepwise approach is recommended where medication types and doses are increased or decreased based on the level of asthma control.\nIntroduction\nThe word asthma originates from an ancient Greek word meaning panting. Essentially, asthma is an inflammatory lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe properly.\nWhen any people inhale, the air travels through the following structures:\nAir passes into the lungs and flows through progressively smaller airways called bronchi and then bronchioles. The lungs contain millions of these airways.\nAll bronchioles lead to alveoli, which are microscopic sacs where oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is expelled.\nThe major features of the lungs include the bronchi, the bronchioles, and the alveoli. The alveoli are the microscopic sacs lined by tiny blood vessels that take in oxygen and give up carbon dioxide.\nAsthma is a chronic condition in which these airways undergo changes when stimulated by allergens or other environmental triggers. Such changes appear to be two specific responses:\nThe hyperreactive response (also called hyperresponsiveness)\nThe inflammatory response\nThese actions in the airway cause coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath (dyspnea), the classic symptoms of asthma.\nHyperreactive Response\nIn the hyperreactive response, smooth muscles in the airways constrict and narrow excessively in response to inhaled allergens or other irritants. Airways in everyone's lungs respond by constricting when exposed to allergens or irritants but there are major differences in the hyperreactive response that occurs in people with asthma:\nWhen people without asthma breathe in and out deeply, the airways relax and open in order to rid the lungs of the irritant.\nWhen people with asthma try to take those same deep breaths, their airways do not relax but instead narrow, causing the patients to pant for breath. Smooth muscles in the airways of people with asthma may have a defect, perhaps a deficiency in a critical chemical that prevents the muscles from relaxing. And, during an asthma attack the airways narrow, making breathing difficult.\nInflammatory Response\nThe hyperreactive stage is followed by the inflammatory response, which generally contributes to asthma in the following way:\nThe immune system responds to allergens or other environmental triggers by delivering white blood cells and other immune factors to the airways.\nThese so-called inflammatory factors cause the airways to swell, fill with fluid, and produce a thick sticky mucus.\nThis combination results in wheezing, breathlessness, an inability to exhale properly, and a phlegm-producing cough.\nClick the icon to see an image of a normal versus asthmatic bronchiole.\nInflammation appears to be present in the lungs of all patients with asthma, even those with mild cases, and plays a key role in all forms of the disease.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of asthma is unknown. Asthma is most likely caused by a combination of genetic (inherited) factors and environmental triggers (such as allergens and infections). Asthma tends to run in families, so children whose parents have asthma are more likely to develop it themselves.\nThe Allergic Response (Allergens)\nAsthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also at greater risk for developing asthma as adults. However, only a minority of children with allergies have asthma.\nIn people with allergies, the immune system overreacts to exposure to allergens. Allergic asthma is triggered by inhaling certain substances (allergens) such as:\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.\nAnimal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on.\nMolds.\nCockroaches. Cockroach dust is a major trigger and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nPollen, from plants.\nEnvironmental Factors (Irritants)\nAn asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants include:\nSmoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases their baby's risks for asthma\nFood allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies. Some research suggests that peanut and milk allergies may increase asthma severity.\nIndoor chemicals. Chemicals used in household cleaning products and furniture materials can be asthma triggers.\nAir pollution. Fossil fuels and chemicals that contribute to air pollution may worsen asthma symptoms.\nInfections\nThe role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.\nStudies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is associated with the development of asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.\nCommon respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. More likely, these viruses do not directly cause asthma, but worsen asthma in children who already have it. Rhinovirus is the most common infection associated with asthma attacks.\nResearch indicates that children who have viral-induced wheezing during infancy may be at increased risk for later development of asthma. However, many children outgrow attacks of intermittent wheezing.\nRisk Factors\nAsthma affects about 7 million American children ages of 5 - 14. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it is more common in girls.\nRace and Ethnicity\nAfrican-American children have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children. Ethnicity and genetics, however, are less likely to play a role in these differences than socioeconomic differences, such as having less access to optimal health care, and greater likelihood of living in an urban area. Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma.\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nA variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies include:\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. Children born in the winter may have a greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nBreastfeeding. Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby\u2019s first 3 months of life may help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 6 months.\nComplications of Pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nThere is a strong association between obesity and asthma. People who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) also have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath helps reduce airway obstruction and improve lung function. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #53: Weight control and diet .].\nOther Risk Factors\nGERD. At least half of patients with asthma also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors. Treating GERD does not appear to improve asthma control. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease .]\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is a condition in which asthma gets worse after taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition, associated with many asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nPatients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).\nPrognosis\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma death rates have steadily declined and asthma is now only rarely fatal in children Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma\nTwo or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the past year\nUsing two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral or psychosocial problems\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat\nAfrican-American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk.\nLong-Term Outlook\nAsthma generally improves as children get older, although most school-age children with persistent asthma will still experience symptoms through adolescence. Some children outgrow their asthma by adulthood. In general, the more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will persist.\nSevere asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest when asthma strikes children in their first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nSymptoms\nIn children with asthmatic symptoms, it is important to first consider as a possible cause inhaled foreign objects such as peanuts; viral infections such as croup; and bacterial infections, which may be accompanied by high fever and progress rapidly. Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nWheezing is nearly always present during an attack. Wheezing is a whistling sound caused by the narrowed airways.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in patients with asthma.\nCoughing. In some people, the first (or only) symptom of asthma is a dry cough. The cough may be worse at night.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAny of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nThe following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly but it may sometimes develop to a fatal or near-fatal attack within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious.\nExercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People who have only EIA do not need long-term maintenance therapy.\nClick the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of patients with asthma. Attacks often occur between 2 and 4 a.m. Nighttime attacks may indicate poor asthma control.\nDiagnosis\nPulmonary Function Tests\nIf symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor will usually perform tests known as pulmonary function tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:\nVital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or exhaled.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.\nForced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 second.\nIf the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on the results, the doctor will take the following steps:\nIf measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a bronchodilator medication. This drug is used in asthma to open the air passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma is strongly suspected.\nIf measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is still suspected, the doctor may perform a challenge test. It involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests help diagnose for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOne of the most common methods of allergy testing is the scratch test or skin prick test. The test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substance (allergen) on the skin (usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back), then scratching or pricking the skin so that the allergen is introduced under the skin surface. The skin is observed closely for signs of a reaction, which usually includes swelling and redness of the site. With this test, several suspected allergens can be tested at the same time, and results are usually available within about 20 minutes.\nTreatment\nGeneral Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma\nWhile medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, appropriate management of asthma involves much more:\nIdentifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers\nFollowing appropriate drug treatments\nHome monitoring performed by either patient or family\nGood communication between the doctor and patient\nNeeded psychosocial support\nTreatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)\nThe severity of asthma is classified into four groups: Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:\nSymptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout the day\nNighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly\nShort-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or fewer days per week to several times per day\nInterference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited\nLung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary function testing at the doctor's office\nNumber of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.\nOnce patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age groupings:\n4 years old or younger\n5 - 11 years old\nTreating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease\nMedications for asthma fall into two categories:\nRescue (Quick-Relief) Medications. Medications that open the airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.\nLong-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications. Long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For children over age 5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, doctors recommend inhaled corticosteroids, with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.\nThe goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children\u2019s asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time.\nUnfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.\nThese are the signs of well-controlled asthma:\nAsthma symptoms occur twice a week or less\nRescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less\nSymptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening\nSymptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities\nPeak flow meter readings are normal or the patient\u2019s personal best\nBoth the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled\nSteps for Treating Asthma\nA stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on a patient\u2019s age and asthma severity, there are specific recommendations regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations based on a specific patient.\nIn choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks of starting therapy to assess response.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger include:\nLong-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four or more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.\nNebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer medications to children this age.\nOnly certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are recommended for these children.\nClose follow-up is recommended\nAvoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:\nParticipation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged.\nSchools, child care, and camps should all have a copy of the asthma action plan.\nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies that may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.\nAvoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.\nThe variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.\nDevices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering any asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.\nThe spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient additional time to inhale. In addition, MDIs can continue to deliver propellant even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing a metered dose inhaler.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Some patients find that they are easier to manage than MDIs. Humidity or extreme temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.\nNebulizers. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects.\nChildren who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable at home.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing the use of a nebulizer.\nNon-Medical Treatment Strategies\nAsthma can trigger a difficult emotional-physical cycle:\nBreathlessness and wheezing incite a fear of suffocation and death, even in very small children.\nThis anxiety produces further constriction on the muscles surrounding the airways, which makes breathing even more difficult.\nCaregivers must first focus on reducing their own anxiety, which can heighten a child's own fears. The next step is to help the child relax. One method for this is as follows:\nThe child sits comfortably, bending slight forward with the eyes closed.\nThe hands are placed gently over the navel.\nThe child is then told to pretend the stomach is a balloon.\nThe \"balloon\" must be \"blown up\" by inhalation, not exhalation. The child can tell if this working because the hands will move slightly apart.\nWhen the child breathes out, the \"balloon\" will be made flat.\nThis exercise both relaxes the child and discourages shallow, oxygen-poor breathing. Massaging the child in gentle circles on the chest is relaxing and may also loosen mucus.\nOther recommendations include:\nA child may find relief by lying stomach-down on several pillows so that the head is slightly lower than the chest while the caregiver gently pats the back between the shoulder blades.\nWarm liquids, such as soup or hot cider, are effective in loosening mucus and may also relax bronchial muscles. Cold fluids, like cold air, should be avoided.\nOverhydration (too much liquid) can be harmful, however, so these drinks should not be forced on the child.\nWarm, moist air from vaporizers can greatly ease and moderate asthma attacks.\nVisits by home health care nurses or social workers may help if the family is having trouble managing the asthma and following prescribed treatments. Often, having the home evaluated for triggers can be very helpful.\nQuick-Relief Medications\nThese medications quickly control acute asthma attacks.\nShort-Acting Beta2-Agonists\nBeta2-agonists serve as bronchodilators, relaxing and opening constricted airways during an acute asthma attack. A short-acting inhaled beta2-agonist, taken as needed, is often the only medication used by children with chronic mild asthma.\nAlbuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), called salbutamol outside the U.S., is the standard short-acting beta2-agonist in America. Other similar beta2-agonists are isoproterenol (Isuprel, Norisodrine, and Medihaler-Iso), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, Brethaire, and Bricanyl), levalbuterol (Xopenex), and bitolterol (Tornalate).\nShort-acting bronchodilators are generally administered through inhalation and are effective for 3 - 6 hours. They relieve the symptoms of acute attacks, but they do not control the underlying inflammation. If asthma continues to worsen with the use of these drugs, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs to treat underlying inflammation.\nSide Effects of Beta2-Agonists. Side effects of all beta2-agonists may include:\nAnxiety\n"}, {"score": 844.6282, "uuid": "3f4a3cf1-d87f-5230-bdec-e122407c3d34", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-53-17340", "target_hostname": "www.stthomasmorehosp.org", "target_uri": "http://www.stthomasmorehosp.org/body.cfm?id=147&action=detail&AEProductID=Adam2004%5F5010&AEArticleID=000005&AEArticleType=default", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "Asthma <em>in</em> <em>Children</em> and Adolescents, Health Information", "snippet": "Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) <em>in</em> the nasal passages.

If you experience any of these symptoms, your doctor may recommend discontinuing the drug.\nLong-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs) are medications used for preventing an asthma attack (not for treating symptoms). The FDA advises that they should only be used in combination with an asthma controller medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Salmeterol-fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol-budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination products. These medications should be used for the shortest time possible, and should only be used by patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled by other medications.\nThe FDA is reviewing whether omalizumab (Xolair) may be associated with increased risk for heart and vascular problems (ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and blood clots).\nAsthma Guidelines\nThe U.S. National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma recommend:\nAssessment and Monitoring. Doctors should use multiple measures to determine a patient\u2019s current condition and future risk for worsening of condition. Even patients who show few daily effects of asthma may be in danger of sudden worsening of symptoms.\nPatient Education. Patients should be taught skills to self-monitor and manage asthma. Doctors should give patients a written asthma action plan, which includes information on daily treatment and ways to recognize worsening asthma.\nControl of Environmental Factors and Other Asthma Triggers. The guidelines outline new approaches for reducing exposure to allergens. They also address how treating co-existing chronic conditions (rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and obesity) can help improve asthma control.\nMedications. The NAEPP specifies different treatment plans for children based on three age groups: 0 - 4 years, 5 - 11 years, and 12 years and older. A stepwise approach is recommended where medication types and doses are increased or decreased based on the level of asthma control.\nIntroduction\nThe word asthma originates from an ancient Greek word meaning panting. Essentially, asthma is an inflammatory lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe properly.\nWhen any people inhale, the air travels through the following structures:\nAir passes into the lungs and flows through progressively smaller airways called bronchi and then bronchioles. The lungs contain millions of these airways.\nAll bronchioles lead to alveoli, which are microscopic sacs where oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is expelled.\nThe major features of the lungs include the bronchi, the bronchioles, and the alveoli. The alveoli are the microscopic sacs lined by tiny blood vessels that take in oxygen and give up carbon dioxide.\nAsthma is a chronic condition in which these airways undergo changes when stimulated by allergens or other environmental triggers. Such changes appear to be two specific responses:\nThe hyperreactive response (also called hyperresponsiveness)\nThe inflammatory response\nThese actions in the airway cause coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath (dyspnea), the classic symptoms of asthma.\nHyperreactive Response\nIn the hyperreactive response, smooth muscles in the airways constrict and narrow excessively in response to inhaled allergens or other irritants. Airways in everyone's lungs respond by constricting when exposed to allergens or irritants but there are major differences in the hyperreactive response that occurs in people with asthma:\nWhen people without asthma breathe in and out deeply, the airways relax and open in order to rid the lungs of the irritant.\nWhen people with asthma try to take those same deep breaths, their airways do not relax but instead narrow, causing the patients to pant for breath. Smooth muscles in the airways of people with asthma may have a defect, perhaps a deficiency in a critical chemical that prevents the muscles from relaxing. And, during an asthma attack the airways narrow, making breathing difficult.\nInflammatory Response\nThe hyperreactive stage is followed by the inflammatory response, which generally contributes to asthma in the following way:\nThe immune system responds to allergens or other environmental triggers by delivering white blood cells and other immune factors to the airways.\nThese so-called inflammatory factors cause the airways to swell, fill with fluid, and produce a thick sticky mucus.\nThis combination results in wheezing, breathlessness, an inability to exhale properly, and a phlegm-producing cough.\nClick the icon to see an image of a normal versus asthmatic bronchiole.\nInflammation appears to be present in the lungs of all patients with asthma, even those with mild cases, and plays a key role in all forms of the disease.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of asthma is unknown. Asthma is most likely caused by a combination of genetic (inherited) factors and environmental triggers (such as allergens and infections). Asthma tends to run in families, so children whose parents have asthma are more likely to develop it themselves.\nThe Allergic Response (Allergens)\nAsthma and allergies often coexist, and the allergic response plays a strong role in childhood asthma. About 70 - 85% of children with asthma also have allergies. Some studies suggest that children who have allergies are also at greater risk for developing asthma as adults. However, only a minority of children with allergies have asthma.\nIn people with allergies, the immune system overreacts to exposure to allergens. Allergic asthma is triggered by inhaling certain substances (allergens) such as:\nDust mites, specifically mite feces, which are coated with enzymes that contain a powerful allergen. These are the primary allergens in the home.\nAnimal dander. Cats harbor significant allergens, which can even be carried on clothing; dogs usually cause fewer problems. People with asthma who already have pets and are not allergic to them probably have a low risk for developing such allergies later on.\nMolds.\nCockroaches. Cockroach dust is a major trigger and may reduce lung function even in people without a history of asthma.\nPollen, from plants.\nEnvironmental Factors (Irritants)\nAn asthma attack can be induced or aggravated by direct irritants to the lungs. Studies indicate that the more indoor allergens a child is allergic to, the higher the risk for severe asthma. Important irritants include:\nSmoking: Parental smoking has been shown to increase the airway responsiveness of infants as early as the first 2 - 10 weeks of life. This extends even to the fetus of pregnant women who smoke. These mothers tend to have babies born at a low birth weight, which affects lung function and increases their baby's risks for asthma\nFood allergies. About 8 - 10% of children with asthma also have food allergies. Some research suggests that peanut and milk allergies may increase asthma severity.\nIndoor chemicals. Chemicals used in household cleaning products and furniture materials can be asthma triggers.\nAir pollution. Fossil fuels and chemicals that contribute to air pollution may worsen asthma symptoms.\nInfections\nThe role of early childhood respiratory and intestinal infections is very complex. Viral respiratory infections certainly worsen existing asthma, but the most common ones are unlikely to cause childhood asthma. In fact, early respiratory and intestinal infections may offer some protection against asthma.\nStudies suggest that most respiratory infections are not important causes of asthma in children, except in certain cases. An important exception is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is associated with the development of asthma. RSV is the major viral cause of infant pneumonia. Studies also indicate that infants who have reduced lung function within a few days after birth are at increased risk of developing asthma by the time they are 10 years old.\nCommon respiratory infection viruses that cause colds (such as the rhinovirus) may be associated with the development of asthma in some people. More likely, these viruses do not directly cause asthma, but worsen asthma in children who already have it. Rhinovirus is the most common infection associated with asthma attacks.\nResearch indicates that children who have viral-induced wheezing during infancy may be at increased risk for later development of asthma. However, many children outgrow attacks of intermittent wheezing.\nRisk Factors\nAsthma affects about 7 million American children ages of 5 - 14. Asthma has dramatically increased worldwide over the last few decades, in both developed and developing countries. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness. About half of all cases of asthma develop before the age of 10, and about 80% of patients develop symptoms before they are 5 years old.\nGender\nAmong younger children, asthma develops twice as frequently in boys as in girls, but after puberty it is more common in girls.\nRace and Ethnicity\nAfrican-American children have significantly higher rates of asthma than Caucasian children. Hispanic children are also at higher risk. Both groups of minority children are more likely to have fatal asthma than Caucasian children. Ethnicity and genetics, however, are less likely to play a role in these differences than socioeconomic differences, such as having less access to optimal health care, and greater likelihood of living in an urban area. Caucasian children who live in cities also face a high risk for asthma.\nIssues Surrounding Birth\nA variety of pregnancy and perinatal factors have been associated with risk for asthma, although none are very well studied or proven. Results from studies include:\nLow Birth Weight. Infants of low birth weight are at higher risk for lung problems and asthma.\nWinter Birth. Children born in the winter may have a greater risk for asthmatic allergies to cockroaches than children born at other times of the year.\nBreastfeeding. Exclusively breastfeeding for a baby\u2019s first 3 months of life may help reduce the risk for wheezing and asthma during their early. However, it is unclear whether the protection will last into later childhood. Breastfeeding has many other benefits for the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusively breastfeeding for a baby's first 6 months.\nComplications of Pregnancy. Complications of pregnancy, specifically those involving the mother's uterus (such as post-birth hemorrhage, pre-term contractions, insufficient placenta, and restricted growth of the uterus), are associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.\nObesity\nThere is a strong association between obesity and asthma. People who are overweight (body mass index greater than 25) also have more difficulty getting their asthma under control. Weight loss in anyone who is obese and has asthma or shortness of breath helps reduce airway obstruction and improve lung function. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #53: Weight control and diet .].\nOther Risk Factors\nGERD. At least half of patients with asthma also have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the cause of heartburn. It is not entirely clear which condition causes the other or whether they are both due to common factors. Treating GERD does not appear to improve asthma control. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #85: Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease .]\nAspirin-Induced Asthma. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is a condition in which asthma gets worse after taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). AIA often develops after a viral infection. It is a particularly severe asthmatic condition, associated with many asthma-related hospitalizations. In about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion. Such patients also often have polyps (small benign growths) in the nasal passages.\nPatients with aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) should avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve).\nPrognosis\nAsthma is the third major cause of hospitalization in children under age 15. The condition can be very serious in children, particularly those younger than age 5, because their airways are very narrow.\nRisk Factors for Life-Threatening Asthma\nAsthma death rates have steadily declined and asthma is now only rarely fatal in children Even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.\nFactors associated with an increased risk of death from asthma in children include:\nPrevious life-threatening episodes of asthma\nTwo or more hospitalizations or more than three emergency visits in the past year\nUsing two or more short-acting beta2-agonist inhalers per month\nLack of adequate and ongoing health care. (Most likely the reason for the higher fatalities rates in minority children.)\nSignificant behavioral or psychosocial problems\nUnderestimating the severity of an acute attack poses the greatest threat\nAfrican-American children have more than six times the death rate of Caucasians in the age groups of 4 years and younger and 15 - 24 years. Hispanic children also have a higher risk.\nLong-Term Outlook\nAsthma generally improves as children get older, although most school-age children with persistent asthma will still experience symptoms through adolescence. Some children outgrow their asthma by adulthood. In general, the more severe the childhood asthma, the greater the likelihood that it will persist.\nSevere asthma can cause long-lasting damage and possibly permanent scarring in some patients. The risk for such injury is highest when asthma strikes children in their first 3 - 5 years. There does not appear to be any significant risk for long-term lung damage for children who develop mild-to-moderate persistent asthma between ages 5 - 12. Children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.\nSymptoms\nIn children with asthmatic symptoms, it is important to first consider as a possible cause inhaled foreign objects such as peanuts; viral infections such as croup; and bacterial infections, which may be accompanied by high fever and progress rapidly. Any child who has frequent coughing or respiratory infections should be checked for asthma.\nTypical Asthma Symptoms\nThe classic symptoms of an asthma attack include:\nWheezing is nearly always present during an attack. Wheezing is a whistling sound caused by the narrowed airways.\nShortness of breath (dyspnea). Shortness of breath is a major source of distress in patients with asthma.\nCoughing. In some people, the first (or only) symptom of asthma is a dry cough. The cough may be worse at night.\nChest tightness or pain. Initial chest tightness without any other symptoms may be an early indicator of a serious attack.\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAny of these symptoms may worsen with exercise, viral infections, exposure to irritants, stress, or changes in weather.\nThe end of an attack is often marked by a cough that produces thick, stringy mucus. After an initial acute attack, inflammation persists for days to weeks, often without symptoms. (The inflammation itself must still be treated, however, because it usually causes relapse.)\nSymptoms of a Life-Threatening Attack\nThe following signs and symptoms may indicate a life-threatening situation:\nAs the chest labors to bring enough air into the lungs, breathing often becomes shallow.\nLacking enough oxygen, the skin becomes bluish.\nThe flesh around the ribs of the chest appears to be sucked in.\nThe patient may begin to lose consciousness.\nAsthma often progresses very slowly but it may sometimes develop to a fatal or near-fatal attack within a few minutes. It is very difficult to predict when an attack will become very serious.\nExercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)\nExercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a limited form of asthma in which exercise triggers coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. This condition generally occurs in children and young adults, most often during intense exercise in cold dry air. Symptoms are generally most intense about 10 minutes after exercising, then gradually resolve.\nEIA is triggered only by exercise and is distinct from ordinary allergic asthma in that it does not produce a long duration of airway activity, as allergic asthma does. (However, some people have both forms of asthma.) People who have only EIA do not need long-term maintenance therapy.\nClick the icon to see an image of exercise-induced asthma.\nNocturnal Asthma\nAsthma occurs primarily at night (nocturnal asthma) in as many as 75% of patients with asthma. Attacks often occur between 2 and 4 a.m. Nighttime attacks may indicate poor asthma control.\nDiagnosis\nPulmonary Function Tests\nIf symptoms and a patient's history strongly suggest asthma, the doctor will usually perform tests known as pulmonary function tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the disease.\nUsing a spirometer, an instrument that measures the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the doctor will determine several values:\nVital capacity (VC), the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled or exhaled.\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), commonly called the peak flow rate, the maximum flow rate that can be generated during a forced exhalation.\nForced expiratory volume (FEV1), the maximum volume of air expired in 1 second.\nIf the airways are obstructed, these measurements will fall. Depending on the results, the doctor will take the following steps:\nIf measurements fall, the doctor typically asks the patient to inhale a bronchodilator medication. This drug is used in asthma to open the air passages. The measurements are taken again. If the measurements are more normal, the drug has most likely cleared the airways, and a diagnosis of asthma is strongly suspected.\nIf measurement results fail to show airway obstruction, but asthma is still suspected, the doctor may perform a challenge test. It involves administering a specific drug (histamine or methacholine) that usually increases airway resistance only when asthma is present.\nAllergy Tests\nThe patient may receive skin or blood allergy tests, particularly if a specific allergen is suspected and available for testing. Allergy skin tests help diagnose for allergic asthma, although they are not recommended for people with year-round asthma.\nOne of the most common methods of allergy testing is the scratch test or skin prick test. The test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substance (allergen) on the skin (usually the forearm, upper arm, or the back), then scratching or pricking the skin so that the allergen is introduced under the skin surface. The skin is observed closely for signs of a reaction, which usually includes swelling and redness of the site. With this test, several suspected allergens can be tested at the same time, and results are usually available within about 20 minutes.\nTreatment\nGeneral Approach for Treating and Managing Asthma\nWhile medications play an essential role in the management of asthma, appropriate management of asthma involves much more:\nIdentifying and avoiding allergens and other asthma triggers\nFollowing appropriate drug treatments\nHome monitoring performed by either patient or family\nGood communication between the doctor and patient\nNeeded psychosocial support\nTreatment of asthma in all environments (school, work, exercise)\nThe severity of asthma is classified into four groups: Intermittent, Mild Persistent, Moderate Persistent, and Severe Persistent. Six specific components of severity are used to classify patients. These components are:\nSymptom frequency, ranging from fewer than 2 days per week to throughout the day\nNighttime awakenings, ranging from none to nightly\nShort-acting beta2-agonist use for symptom control, ranging from 2 or fewer days per week to several times per day\nInterference with normal activity, ranging from none to extremely limited\nLung function as measured by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, measured with pulmonary function testing at the doctor's office\nNumber of exacerbations (sudden worsening) requiring oral corticosteroids, ranging from none to two or more in the last 6 months.\nOnce patients are placed into a certain severity grouping, there is a recommended treatment approach, which also takes into consideration three age groupings:\n4 years old or younger\n5 - 11 years old\nTreating Symptoms Versus Controlling the Disease\nMedications for asthma fall into two categories:\nRescue (Quick-Relief) Medications. Medications that open the airways (bronchodilators or inhalers) are used to quickly relieve any moderate or severe asthma attack. These drugs are usually short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (beta2-agonists). Other drugs used in special cases include corticosteroids taken by mouth and anticholinergic drugs. Beta2-agonists and anticholinergics do not have any effect on the disease process itself. They are useful only for treating symptoms. Frequent need for these medications indicates that the asthma is not well-controlled overall.\nLong-Term Control (Maintenance) Medications. Long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma. For children over age 5 with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, doctors recommend inhaled corticosteroids, with the addition of long-acting beta2-agonists if necessary.\nThe goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Parents can greatly reduce the frequency and severity of their children\u2019s asthma attacks by understanding the difference between coping with asthma attacks and controlling the disease over time.\nUnfortunately, many patients do not understand the difference between medications that provide rapid, short-term relief and those that are used for long-term symptom control. Many patients with moderate or severe asthma overuse their short-term medications and underuse their corticosteroid medications. The overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.\nThese are the signs of well-controlled asthma:\nAsthma symptoms occur twice a week or less\nRescue bronchodilator medication is used twice a week or less\nSymptoms do not cause nighttime or early morning awakening\nSymptoms do not limit work, school, or exercise activities\nPeak flow meter readings are normal or the patient\u2019s personal best\nBoth the doctor and the patient consider the asthma to be well controlled\nSteps for Treating Asthma\nA stepwise approach is recommended for treating asthma. Medications and dosages are increased when needed, and decreased when possible. Based on a patient\u2019s age and asthma severity, there are specific recommendations regarding whether to use long-term control medications and which ones to use. Patient education, environmental control measures, and management of any other conditions are also included. Doctors may always adjust these recommendations based on a specific patient.\nIn choosing therapy, doctors must also consider the risk an individual patient has for more severe exacerbations. Factors that may contribute to this include parental history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and known sensitivity to different allergens or foods. Patients should be reevaluated within 2 - 6 weeks of starting therapy to assess response.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 4 years old and younger include:\nLong-term control therapy is recommended for children who have had four or more episodes lasting longer than 1 day over the previous year and who have some of the risk factors described earlier in this section. It may also be considered for other children who are experiencing impairment from their asthma.\nNebulizers and certain other devices are available to help administer medications to children this age.\nOnly certain inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists are recommended for these children.\nClose follow-up is recommended\nAvoidance or management of environmental triggers is always important.\nKey points regarding recommendations for children 5 years and older include:\nParticipation in physical activities and sports should be encouraged.\nSchools, child care, and camps should all have a copy of the asthma action plan.\nInhaled corticosteroids are the preferred long-term control therapy. Long-acting beta2 agonists and leukotriene antagonists are additional therapies that may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids.\nAvoiding or controlling environmental triggers is always important.\nThe variation between age groups consists mostly of which medications are recommended and how soon to start various medications and treatments.\nDevices Used for Administering Inhaled Drugs\nMost asthma drugs are inhaled using various forms of inhalers or nebulizers. Inhaled drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Studies suggest that many children fail to use the devices properly, although newer devices are easier to use than others. The basic devices are the metered-dose inhaler (MDI), dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers.\nMetered-Dose Inhaler. The standard device for administering any asthma medication is the metered-dose inhaler (MDI). This device, particularly when used with a spacer, allows precise doses to be delivered directly to the lungs. (The spacer is a tube that is attached to the inhaler. It serves as a holding chamber for the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler.) MDI-delivered drugs must be used regularly as prescribed and the patient carefully trained in their use in order for them to be effective and safe. Some patients hold the MDI too close to their mouths, or even inside them. Others may exhale too forcefully before inhalation.\nThe spacer helps improve medication delivery by allowing the patient additional time to inhale. In addition, MDIs can continue to deliver propellant even after the drug has been used up. Patients should track their medicine and throw the device away when the last dose has been administered.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing a metered dose inhaler.\nDry Powder Inhalers. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver a powdered form of beta2-agonists or corticosteroids directly into the lungs. Some patients find that they are easier to manage than MDIs. Humidity or extreme temperatures can affect DPIs' performance, so they should not be stored in humid places (bathroom cabinets) or locations subject to high temperatures (glove compartments during summer months).\nDry-powder may cause tooth erosion. Children are advised to rinse their mouths out right after using these inhalers and to brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste.\nNebulizers. A nebulizer is a machine that delivers a fine spray of medication-containing liquid. Nebulizers are often used for children younger than 3 years and sometimes for older children who have difficulty using the MDI. It takes 5 - 10 minutes to administer medication using a nebulizer. Because the spray is less targeted than with the inhaler, it must deliver large amounts of the drug. This increases the risk for toxicity and severe side effects.\nChildren who can manage an inhaler should not use nebulizers. Their use has been associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations and longer duration of symptoms than inhalers. If children must use an albuterol nebulizer, parents should be sure that it does not contain the preservative benzalkonium, which actually narrows the airways. Recent studies suggest spacers may be better than nebulizers for children, and they shorten the time spent in emergency rooms. Studies also indicate that with the use of a face mask and a spacer, the MDI works well even for infants in the emergency room and may prove to be useable at home.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing the use of a nebulizer.\nNon-Medical Treatment Strategies\nAsthma can trigger a difficult emotional-physical cycle:\nBreathlessness and wheezing incite a fear of suffocation and death, even in very small children.\nThis anxiety produces further constriction on the muscles surrounding the airways, which makes breathing even more difficult.\nCaregivers must first focus on reducing their own anxiety, which can heighten a child's own fears. The next step is to help the child relax. One method for this is as follows:\nThe child sits comfortably, bending slight forward with the eyes closed.\nThe hands are placed gently over the navel.\nThe child is then told to pretend the stomach is a balloon.\nThe \"balloon\" must be \"blown up\" by inhalation, not exhalation. The child can tell if this working because the hands will move slightly apart.\nWhen the child breathes out, the \"balloon\" will be made flat.\nThis exercise both relaxes the child and discourages shallow, oxygen-poor breathing. Massaging the child in gentle circles on the chest is relaxing and may also loosen mucus.\nOther recommendations include:\nA child may find relief by lying stomach-down on several pillows so that the head is slightly lower than the chest while the caregiver gently pats the back between the shoulder blades.\nWarm liquids, such as soup or hot cider, are effective in loosening mucus and may also relax bronchial muscles. Cold fluids, like cold air, should be avoided.\nOverhydration (too much liquid) can be harmful, however, so these drinks should not be forced on the child.\nWarm, moist air from vaporizers can greatly ease and moderate asthma attacks.\nVisits by home health care nurses or social workers may help if the family is having trouble managing the asthma and following prescribed treatments. Often, having the home evaluated for triggers can be very helpful.\nQuick-Relief Medications\nThese medications quickly control acute asthma attacks.\nShort-Acting Beta2-Agonists\nBeta2-agonists serve as bronchodilators, relaxing and opening constricted airways during an acute asthma attack. A short-acting inhaled beta2-agonist, taken as needed, is often the only medication used by children with chronic mild asthma.\nAlbuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), called salbutamol outside the U.S., is the standard short-acting beta2-agonist in America. Other similar beta2-agonists are isoproterenol (Isuprel, Norisodrine, and Medihaler-Iso), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, Brethaire, and Bricanyl), levalbuterol (Xopenex), and bitolterol (Tornalate).\nShort-acting bronchodilators are generally administered through inhalation and are effective for 3 - 6 hours.

However, while it gives quick results, it needs to be placed correctly in your child's ear to be accurate. Too much earwax can cause the reading to be incorrect.\nWhile other methods for taking your child's temperature are available, they are not recommended at this time. Ask your child's doctor for advice.\nMercury thermometers should not be used. The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages parents to remove mercury thermometers from their homes to prevent accidental exposure to this toxin.\nHow to use a digital thermometer\nIf your child is younger than 3 years, taking a rectal temperature gives the best reading. The following is how to take a rectal temperature:\nClean the end of the thermometer with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Rinse it with cool water. Do not rinse it with hot water.\nPut a small amount of lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, on the end.\nPlace your child belly down across your lap or on a firm surface. Hold him by placing your palm against his lower back, just above his bottom. Or place your child face up and bend his legs to his chest. Rest your free hand against the back of the thighs.\nWith the other hand, turn the thermometer on and insert it 1/2 inch to 1 inch into the anal opening. Do not insert it too far. Hold the thermometer in place loosely with 2 fingers, keeping your hand cupped around your child's bottom. Keep it there for about 1 minute, until you hear the \"beep.\" Then remove and check the digital reading.\nBe sure to label the rectal thermometer so it's not accidentally used in the mouth.\nOnce your child is 4 or 5 years of age, you can take his temperature by mouth. The following is how to take an oral temperature:\nClean the thermometer with lukewarm soapy water or rubbing alcohol. Rinse with cool water.\nTurn the thermometer on and place the tip under his tongue toward the back of his mouth. Hold in place for about 1 minute, until you hear the \"beep.\" Check the digital reading.\nFor a correct reading, wait at least 15 minutes after your child has had a hot or cold drink before putting the thermometer in his mouth.\nAlthough not as accurate, if your child is older than 3 months, you can take his underarm temperature to see if he has a fever. The following is how to take an axillary temperature:\nPlace the tip of a digital thermometer in your child's armpit.\nHold his arm tightly against his chest for about 1 minute, until you hear the \"beep.\" Check the digital reading.\nWhat if my child has a febrile seizure?\nIn some young children, fever can trigger seizures. While this can be frightening, seizures are usually harmless. During a seizure your child may look strange for a few minutes; shake; then stiffen, twitch, and roll his eyes. If this happens,\nPlace him on the floor or bed, away from any hard or sharp objects.\nTurn his head to the side so that any saliva or vomit can drain from his mouth.\nDo not put anything into his mouth, not even a finger.\nCall your child's doctor.\nYour child's doctor will want to check your child, especially if it is his first seizure. It is important to look for the cause of the febrile seizure.\nHow to reduce a fever with medicine\nAcetaminophen and ibuprofen are safe and effective medicines for reducing fevers. They do not need a prescription and are available at grocery stores and drugstores. However, keep the following in mind:\nIbuprofen should only be used for children older than 6 months. It should not be given to children who are vomiting constantly or are dehydrated.\nDo not use aspirin to treat your child's fever. Aspirin has been linked with side effects such as an upset stomach, intestinal bleeding and, most seriously, Reye syndrome.\nIf your child is vomiting and cannot take anything by mouth, a rectal suppository may be needed. Acetaminophen comes in suppository form and can help reduce a fever in a vomiting child.\nBefore giving your child any medicine, read the label to make sure that you are giving the right dose for his age and weight. Also, if your child is taking other medicines check the ingredients. If they include acetaminophen or ibruprofen, let your child's doctor know. To be safe, talk with your child's doctor before giving your child any medicine to treat a fever if he is younger than 2 years.\nHow to reduce a fever with sponging\nYour child's doctor may recommend that you try sponging your child to reduce a fever if\nYour child's temperature is above 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C).\nYour child is vomiting and unable to take any medicine.\nUse lukewarm water, not cold water. Cold water can cause shivering and increase the temperature. Never add rubbing alcohol to the water. Rubbing alcohol can be absorbed into the skin or inhaled, causing serious problems such as a coma.\nUsually 5 to 10 minutes in the tub is enough time for a child's fever to start dropping. If your child becomes upset during the sponging, simply let her play in the water. If she is still bothered by the bath, it is better to take her out even if she has not been in long enough to reduce the fever. Also remove her from the bath if she continues to shiver because shivering can raise her temperature.\nDo not try to reduce a fever too quickly. This could cause it to rebound higher.\nBe sure to call your child's doctor if your child still \"acts sick\" once her fever is brought down, or if you feel that your child is very sick. Also call if the fever persists for\nMore than 24 hours in a child younger than 2 years\nMore than 3 days in a child 2 years of age or older\nDigital thermometer drawings by Anthony Alex LeTourneau\nCopyright \u00a9 2007\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Updated 9/07\nThe information contained in this publication should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Like a drum, it vibrates to the incoming sound waves, converting them into mechanical energy.\nThis energy resonates through the middle ear, a complex structure filled with air and composed of tiny bones that vibrate to the rhythm of the ear drum and pass the sound waves on to the inner ear.\nThe inner ear is filled with fluid. Here, hair-like structures stimulate nerves to convert the mechanical waves to electrochemical impulses that are carried by a network of nerve cells to the brain, which senses these impulses as sounds.\nThe inner ear also contains three semi-circular canals that function as the body's gyroscope, regulating balance.\nAn important structure in the ear is the Eustachian tube, which runs from the middle ear to the passages behind the nose and the upper part of the throat. This tube ventilates the ear and equalizes the air pressure in the middle ear to the outside air pressure. (Problems with this tube's function are primary factors in most cases of ear infection.)\nEar Infections (Otitis Media) in Children\nEar infections are often defined by whether they are acute (acute otitis media) or chronic (otitis media with effusion).\nAcute Otitis Media (AOM). Acute otitis media (AOM) is an infection in the middle ear that causes an inflammation behind the tympanic membrane.\nOften it develops during or after a cold or a flu.\nMiddle ear infections are extremely common in children but are infrequent in adults.\nIn children, ear infections often recur, particularly if they first develop in early infancy.\nOtitis Media with Effusion (OME) . Otitis media with effusion (OME) occurs when an effusion (fluid) builds up in one or both middle ears. When this is chronic and severe the fluid is very sticky and is commonly called \"glue ear.\";\nIt is not painful and the only clue that it is present is a feeling of stuffiness in the ears, which can feel like \"being under water.\";\nChildren who are susceptible to OME can have frequent episodes for more than half of their first three years of life.\nThe episodes can last from weeks to months.\nWHAT CAUSES MIDDLE EAR INFECTIONS (OTITIS MEDIA) IN CHILDREN?\nOtitis media (middle ear infection) is most often the result of a combination of factors that increase susceptibility to infections by specific organisms in the middle ear.\nConditions that Predispose a Person to Ear Infections\nProblems in the Eustachian Tube. Many bacteria thrive in the passages of the nose and throat. Most are benign and some are even important in preventing harmful bacteria from getting out of control. In addition, the body has a number of defenses that prevent the harmful bacteria from replicating and infecting deeper passages, such as those in the ear.\nHowever, various factors can impair these defenses. Such factors may include, but are not limited to the following:\nViral infection.\nSmoke particles.\nAllergies, such as hay fever, that affect the nasal passages (allergic rhinitis).\nIn general, these or other irritants can produce the following conditions that lead to ear infection:\nIrritation from viruses, smoke particles, or allergies can cause the membranes along the walls of the inner passages to become inflamed, swell, and obstruct the airways.\nIf this inflammation blocks the narrow Eustachian tube so that it can not drain the middle ear properly, fluid builds up.\nThis fluid can then become a reservoir and breeding ground for bacteria and subsequent infection.\nThe Eustachian tubes in all children are shorter and smaller than in adults and therefore more vulnerable to obstruction. Children with shorter-than-normal and relatively horizontal Eustachian tubes are at particular risk for recurrent infections.\nGenetic Factors. Several studies suggest that multiple genetic factors may play a role in making a child susceptible to otitis media.\nFor example, genetic susceptibility to certain bacteria may result in development of persistent and recurrent otitis media.\nAbnormalities in genes that affect the defense systems (cilia and mucus production) and the anatomy of the skull and passages would also increase the risk for ear infections.\nResearchers are hoping that these findings may encourage primary care physicians to closely monitor children who are offspring or siblings of individuals with a history of unusually frequent or severe upper respiratory tract infections.\nInfecting Agents\nBacteria. Certain bacteria are the primary causes of acute otitis media (AOM) and are detected in about 60% of cases. The bacteria most commonly causing ear infections are:\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (also called the pneumococcus) is the most common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, causing about 50% to 80% of cases.\nHaemophilus influenzae is the next most common culprit and is responsible for 20% to 30% of acute infections.\nMoraxella catarrhalis is also a common infectious agent, responsible for 10% to 15% of infections.\nLess common bacteria are Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus .\nOf note, about 15% of these bacteria are now believed to be resistant to the first-choice antibiotics.\nViruses. Studies have reported the presence of viruses in the middle ear fluid in about 40% of children with ear infections. While viruses are not usually a direct cause of otitis media, they may play an important role by causing inflammation in the nasal passages and impairing defense systems, such as cilia, in the ear.\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common virus responsible for upper and lower respiratory infections, and influenza viruses (\"Flu\";) are prime suspects in this process.\nRhinovirus, a cause of the common cold, has been found in between 1% and 8% of otitis media cases, and, in one study 74% of patients with rhinovirus caused colds had middle-ear pressure abnormalities.\nCauses of Otitis Media with Effusion (OME)\nIn some cases, otitis media with effusion develops after an acute otitis media attack, although often the direct cause of OME is unknown.\nIt is not clear, for example, what role bacteria or other infectious agents play. Standard tests do not detect bacteria in 40% to 60% of cultures taken from fluid in OME-affected ears. (In one study, a sophisticated test found genetic evidence of Haemophilus influenza bacteria in about a third of specimens in which no bacteria were detected by standard culture techniques.)\nSusceptibility to OME is almost always due to an abnormal or malfunctioning Eustachian tube that causes a negative pressure in the middle ear, which, in turn, allows fluid to leak in through capillaries.\nProblems in the Eustachian tube can be due to viral infections, second-hand smoke, injury, or birth defects, such as cleft palate.\nRare genetic conditions, such as Kartagener's syndrome, in which the cilia (hair-like structures) in the ear are immobile and cause fluid build up, can contribute to OME.\nWHO GETS EAR INFECTIONS?\nGeneral Risk Factors for Ear Infections\nAcute ear infections are the most common reason for childhood visits to the doctor. About 62% of children can expect to have a least one attack of acute otitis media (AOM) in their first year and 80% will have had an infection by age three. And, the incidence of AOM has been rising over the past decades. One study reported a 44% increase in prevalence between 1981 and 1988, with infants particularly affected. In American children, otitis media is second in prevalence only to the common cold.\nGender and Age. Boys are more apt to have infections than girls are, and the risk is higher the younger the child:\nAbout 17% of all children under two have recurrent ear infections (i.e., three or more episodes within a six-month period). The earlier a child has a first ear infection the more susceptible he or she is to recurrent episodes. The peak incidence occurs between seven and nine months of age.\nAs children grow, however, the structures in their ears enlarge and their immune systems become stronger. By 16 months the risk for recurrent infections is rapidly declining. Still, about two thirds of children have had at least one acute ear infection by the time they are three years old.\nHalf of the cases of otitis media with effusion (OME) appear to develop within the first year of life. In one study, 18% of healthy children between birth and age three had frequent recurrences of OME in one or both ears. (Because OME has fewer symptoms than acute otitis media, however, its prevalence among very young children is unclear.)\nAfter age five, most children have outgrown their susceptibility to any ear infections.\nOther General Risk Factors. The following children also have higher risks for ear infections.\nChildren with a family history of ear infections.\nChildren from lower socioeconomic groups.\nIncreased Co-Incidence in Other Airway Infections and Disorders\nIncreased diagnosis of other disorders and infections of the upper and lower airways, such as asthma, allergies, and sinusitis, have paralleled the rise in ear infections. For example, the same bacteria are often responsible for both ear infections and sinusitis. In one study, 38% of children with ear infections also had sinusitis, and other studies have reported that nearly half of children with OME have concurrent sinusitis. These studies may have overestimated the extent of clinically important sinus disease, but none the less, the association is significant. Researchers are looking for common risk factors:\nDay Care Center Attendance. Although ear infections themselves are not contagious, the respiratory infections that precipitate them can pose a risk for children with close and frequent exposure to other children. Some experts believe, then, that the increase in ear and other infections may be due to the higher attendance of very small children, including infants, in day care centers beginning in the 1970s. For children who had the condition for a long time, however, neither day care attendance nor any other risk factor, including a history of upper respiratory tract infections or family history of OME, appeared to be relevant. Attendance in day care centers, then, may explain part, but not all, of the current increase in ear infections and other upper airway disorders.\nIncrease in Allergies. Some experts believe that the increase in allergies is also partially responsible for the higher number of ear infections, which is unlikely to be related to day care attendance. Studies indicate that 40% to 50% of children over three years old who have chronic otitis media also have allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Allergies are also associated with asthma and sinusitis.\nThe rise in the rate of otitis media, then, is probably due to a combination of factors that are also responsible for the increase in these other airway problems.\nOther Medical Problems that Increase Risk\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disorder. Gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), in which acid backs up into the esophagus, is a common cause of heartburn in adults. In infants, GERD may occur when muscles in the upper part of the stomach are still immature and force acid back up, causing persistent vomiting. Some research also suggests that GERD in infants may contribute to sinusitis and ear infections by triggering inflammation in these upper passages.\nOther Medical Disorders. Other medical disorders, including Down's syndrome, cleft palate, and immunosuppressive disorders, such as HIV, increase the risk for ear infections.\nParental Behavior\nThe behavior of parents can increase a child's risk for otitis media.\nParents who smoke pose a significant risk for both otitis media with effusion (OME) and recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) in their children.\nPregnant women who drink alcohol put their babies at risk for birth defects that can cause a number of problems, among them hearing loss and OME.\nBabies who are bottle-fed may have a higher risk for otitis media than do breast-fed babies because the mother's milk provides immune factors that help protect the child from infections. Researchers have reported that oligosaccarides, sugar compounds found in milk, may have properties that help fight otitis media by preventing S. pneumonia bacteria from binding to the cells lining the respiratory tract. Also, to be breast fed, infants are held in a position that allows the Eustachian tubes to function well. To improve protection for bottle-fed babies, mothers should not lay babies down with their bottle; they should hold the infants in the same way they would to breast-feed them.\nSeveral studies have found that the use of pacifiers place children at even higher risk for ear infections. Sucking increases production of saliva, which is a vehicle for bacteria that can travel up the Eustachian tubes to the middle ear.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN?\nSymptoms of Acute Otitis Media\nSymptoms of acute otitis media usually develop suddenly and can include:\nPain or discomfort in the ear. (It is difficult to determine if a preverbal child or infant has an ear infection. Some children may indicate pain if they have trouble swallowing food and rejecting it. Some parents believe that tugging on the ear indicates an infection, but this gesture is more likely to indicate pain from teething.)\nCoughing.\nVomiting.\nPus in the ear may cause hearing loss in some children.\nIf the ear infection is severe, the tympanic membrane may rupture causing the parent to notice pus draining from the ear. (This usually brings relief from pain.)\nFevers and colds often make children irritable and fussy, so it is difficult to determine if otitis media is present as well. In about a third of children with acute middle ear infection, symptoms are not apparent.\nSymptoms of Otitis Media with Effusion\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) often has no symptoms at all. Some hearing loss may occur, but it is often fluctuating and hard to detect even by observant parents. The only signal to a parent that the condition exists may be when a child complains of \"plugged up\" hearing. There are some indications that older children with OME may have difficulty targeting specific sounds in a noisy room. (In such cases, some parents or teachers may attribute their behavior to lack of attention or even to an attention deficit disorder.) OME is often diagnosed only during a regular pediatric visit.\nHOW SERIOUS ARE EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN?\nAcute Otitis Media in Infancy\nAny infant under three months old who shows signs of ear infection should be seen by a physician promptly, since acute otitis media in babies can sometimes be a sign of a more wide-spread infection, sometimes including meningitis.\nHearing Loss and Delayed Development\nEvidence strongly suggests that severe cases of recurrent acute otitis media and persistent otitis media with effusion (OME) impair hearing. The effect of long-term hearing problems can have the following effects:\nLearning Delays . Hearing loss in children slows down language development and reading skills. Children with even mild hearing loss may miss spoken words and have trouble making sense out of a conversation or a lesson in school.\nBehavioral and Social Problems. Children with impaired hearing may appear to be distracted, inattentive, unintelligent, and may even be inaccurately diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nImpaired Balance. Some studies have indicated that children with chronic OME have problems with motor development and balance.\nSpeech Problems. A few small studies have found speech problems in some young children with OME, but in one study the effect was limited to a group of Native American children.\nIt is not clear how significant the long-term effects of OME-related hearing loss are on learning in children. Some studies have suggested a weak association between mild to moderate hearing impairment and later learning and verbal problems. Many of these studies suggest that the effect on learning is not significant, however. In addition, some indicate that the lower learning scores may actually be due to the fact that children with ear infections tend to be in lower socioeconomic groups and so have less home attention.\nConsidering the increased usage of medications for attention deficit disorder, the costs of special education, and the social burdens carried by children diagnosed with emotional and learning disabilities, more research is essential for clarifying the long-term effects of hearing loss from recurrent or chronic ear infections.\nPhysical and Structural Injury in the Face and Ears\nSerious complications or permanent physical injuries from ear infections are very uncommon but may include the following:\nVery rarely, a child may develop facial paralysis, which is temporary and relieved by drainage surgery.\nIn severe or recurrent otitis media, certain children may be at risk for structural damage in the ear.\nCysts in the ear known as cholesteatomas are an uncommon complication of recurrent or severe ear infections.\nIn rare cases, even after a mild infection, certain children, possibly because of immune abnormalities, develop calcification and hardening in the middle and, occasionally, in the inner ear.\nMastoiditis\nBefore the introduction of antibiotics, mastoiditis, an infection in the bones located in the skull, was a major and serious complication of otitis media. This condition is difficult to treat and requires intravenous antibiotics and drainage procedures. Surgery may be required. If pain and fever persist in spite of antibiotic treatment of otitis media, the physician should check for mastoiditis. Even without antibiotics this is a rare complication.\nHOW ARE EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN DIAGNOSED?\nMany experts believe that ear infections in children are overdiagnosed and overtreated with antibiotics. Parents should question their physician closely if they recommend antibiotics and feel comfortable if antibiotics are not diagnosed.\nMedical History\nThe physician should be sure to ask the parent for a history of any recent cold, flu, or other respiratory infections. If the child complains of pain or has other symptoms of otitis media, such as redness and inflammation, the physician should be sure to rule out any other causes of such symptoms. They may include, but are not limited to the following:\nDental problems (such as teething).\nInfection in the outer ear. Symptoms include pain, redness, itching, and discharge. Infection in the outer ear, however, can be confirmed by wiggling the ears, which will produce pain. (This movement will have no significant effect if the infection is in the middle ear.)\nForeign objects in the ear. This can be dangerous and a physician should always check for this first when a small child indicates pain or problems in the ear.\nViral infection can produce redness and inflammation. Such infections, however, are not treatable with antibiotics and resolve on their own.\nA parent's or child's attempts to remove earwax.\nIntense crying can cause redness and inflammation in the ear.\nPhysical Examination\nAn ear examination should be part of any routine physical examination in children, particularly because the problem is so common and many children have no symptoms.\nThe physician first removes any ear wax (called cerumen) in order to get a clear view of the middle ear.\nThe physician employs a small flashlight-like instrument called an otoscope to view the ear directly. This is the most important diagnostic step. This instrument will reveal signs of acute otitis media, bulging eardrum, and blisters. The physician will also check color.\nTo determine ear infection the physician should always use a pneumatic otoscope. This device detects any reduction in eardrum motion. It has a rubber bulb attachment that the physician presses to push air into the ear. Pressing the bulb and observing the action of the air against the eardrum allows the physician to gauge the eardrum's mobility.\nSome physicians may use tympanometry to evaluate the ear. In this case a small probe is held to the entrance of the ear canal and forms an airtight seal. While the air pressure is varied, a sound with a fixed tone is directed at the eardrum and its energy is measured. This device can detect fluid in the middle air and also obstruction in the Eustachian tube.\nA procedure similar to tympanometry, called reflectometry, also measures reflected sound to detect fluid and obstruction but does not require an airtight seal at the canal.\nIt should be noted that neither tympanometry nor reflectometry are substitutes for the pneumatic otoscope, which allows a direct view of the middle ear. The physician will then assess the results of this examination to determine a diagnosis.\nA normal eardrum is grayish-pink and translucent. An eardrum with acute otitis media is opaque and can be red, white, or yellowish. It is also less mobile.\nIf the eardrum is red and inflamed but mobile, the cause is more likely to be irritation rather than a bacterial infection.\nIf the eardrum is clear and translucent but is not mobile and if fluid is present, then otitis media with effusion (OME) is likely to be present.\nA scarred, thick, or opaque eardrum may make it difficult for the physician to distinguish between acute otitis media and OME.\nTympanocentesis\nOn rare occasions the physician may need to draw fluid from the ear using a needle for identifying specific bacteria, a procedure called tympanocentesis. This procedure can also relieve severe ear pain. This is most often performed by ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists, and usually only in severe or recurrent cases. In most cases tympanocentesis is not necessary in order to obtain an accurate enough diagnosis for effective treatment.\nDetermining Hearing Problems\nHearing tests performed by an audiologist are usually recommended for children with persistent otitis media with effusion. A hearing loss below 20 decibels usually indicates problems.\nDetermining Impaired Hearing in Infants and Small Children. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to test children under two years old for hearing problems. One way to determine hearing problems in infants is to gauge the baby's language development:\nAt 4 four to 6 weeks most babies with normal hearing are making cooing sounds.\nBy around 5 months the child should be laughing out loud and making one-syllable sounds with both a vowel and consonant.\nBetween 6 and 8 months, the infants should be able to make word-like sounds with more than one syllable.\nUsually starting around 7 months the baby babbles (makes many word-like noises) and should be doing this by 10 months.\nAround 10 months, the baby is able to identify and use some term for the parent, dada, baba, or mama.\nThe baby speaks his or her first word usually by the end of the first year.\nIf a child's progress is significantly delayed beyond these times, a parent should suspect possible hearing problems.\nDetermining Impaired Hearing in Older Children. Hearing loss in older children may be detected by the following behaviors:\nThey may not respond to speech spoken beyond three feet away.\nThey may have difficulty following directions.\nTheir vocabulary may be limited.\nThey may have social and behavioral problems.\nWHAT ARE THE MEASURES FOR PREVENTING A FIRST EAR INFECTION?\nBreast-feeding\nBreastfeeding offers protection against many early infections. If possible, new mothers should breast feed their infants for at least six months.\nPacifier Use\nThere is some evidence to suggest that use of pacifiers may increase risk of otitis media in children under three years old. Nevertheless, some physicians believe any association is exaggerated and that the comfort a child derives from sucking (either thumb, breast, or pacifier) is more important any presumed increase risk for ear infection.\nPreventing and Treating Colds and Flus\nThe best way to prevent otitis media is to prevent a cold and influenza from developing in the first place and to treat them effectively when they do develop. Simple precautions for prevention of colds are eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, getting enough rest, and washing hands frequently.\nGood Hygiene. Adults and children should wash their hands frequently. New antibacterial soaps add little protection and ordinary soap is sufficient. In fact, a recent study suggests that common liquid dishwashing soaps are up to 100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is known to cause pneumonia. Flus and colds are not spread by touching inanimate objects, such as subway poles or toilet seats. Bacteria do not thrive on such objects and of the organisms that do survive on inanimate objects, most are harmless.\nDietary Factors. One analysis of studies found that large doses of vitamin C reduced the duration of colds by 21%. Infants and children, however, should not take large doses of vitamins. Fresh, dark-colored fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants and other important food chemicals, and daily diets containing such foods are important and sufficient for nearly everyone.\nReducing Stress. Interestingly, giving children affection and helping them relax could help prevent colds. One study found that the more social interactions a person has the less likely they are to have a cold, possibly because stress hormones, which suppress the immune system, are reduced.\nAlternative Cold Remedies. Alternative agents, such as zinc and echinacea, are sold as remedies for prevention or reduction of cold symptoms. There is no strong evidence to support the claims for either of these substances and their side effects are also not fully known. [For more information 94, Colds and Influenza (the Flu) .]\nAvoiding Exposure to Cigarette Smoke\nParents or others should not smoke around children. Several studies have found that children who live with smokers have a significant risk for ear infections. One study even suggested that the more the mother smoked the higher the risk.\nWHAT ARE THE HOME REMEDIES USED FOR EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN?\nTreatments for ear infections cost the country between three and four billion dollars each year, and evidence is mounting that many of these treatments, particularly heavy antibiotic use and surgical procedures, may be unnecessary.\nWatchful Waiting\nCareful monitoring of the child's condition (watchful waiting) along with home remedies and common over the counter cold medicines may be a viable alternative to antibiotic treatment for many children with a first episode of acute otitis media.\nIn one 2000 study, 240 children under age 2 who were diagnosed with acute otitis media were treated with watchful waiting. After four days, only 3% of the children required treatment with antibiotics, while the infection cleared in the other 97%.\nChildren, however, must be monitored carefully.\nHigh fever, severe pain, or other signs of complications should warrant immediate attention by a medical professional.\nParents of infants should contact their doctor immediately if they have any fever, regardless other symptoms.\nNatural Remedies\nBefore antibiotics, parents used home remedies to treat the pain of ear infections. Now, with current concern over antibiotic overuse, many of these remedies are back in favor.\nDepending on regional cultures, parents may have pressed a warm water bottle or warm bag of salt against the ear. Such old-fashioned remedies may still help to ease ear pain.\nDrops of tea tree oil may be beneficial. This herbal treatment has mild anti-bacterial properties, but it may irritate the skin.\nValsalva's Maneuver. A simple technique called the Valsalva's maneuver is useful in opening the Eustachian tubes and providing occasional relief from the chronic stuffy feeling accompanying otitis media with effusion. It may also be useful for unplugging ears during air travel descent as well. It works as follows:\nThe child takes a deep breath and closes the mouth.\nHe or she then blows the nose gently while, at the same time, pinching it firmly shut.\nThe parent should be sure to instruct the child not to blow too hard or the ear drum could be harmed.\nThis technique should not be used if an infection is present.\nPain-Relievers\nA number of pain relievers are available to help relieve symptoms.\nEither acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol) or ibuprofen (eg, Advil) is the pain-reliever of choice in children.\nOlder children may be able to take prescription pain relievers that contain codeine if the pain is severe.\nEardrops containing benzocaine, glycerin, and antipyrine (Auralgan) are also available by prescription. In one study Auralgan provided effective short-acting pain relief and helped children endure ear discomfort until an oral pain reliever took effect. Parents should check with a physician before using them. Eardrops could cause damage in children who have a ruptured eardrum. This might be indicated by fluid drainage from the ear canal.\nNote: Aspirin and aspirin-containing products are not recommended for children or adolescents. Reports of Reye's Syndrome, a very serious condition, have been associated with aspirin use in children who have chicken pox or flu.\nCold and Allergy Remedies\nMany non-prescription products are available that combine antihistamines, decongestants, and other ingredients, and some are advertised as cold remedies for children. Researchers have found little or no benefits for acute otitis media or for otitis media with effusion using decongestants, antihistamines, or combination products, which include Dimetapp, Sudafed Severe Cold Formula, Vicks DayQuil, and Triaminic, among many others. Experts strongly recommend that in any case children not be given any of these remedies unless under a physician's direction.\nPrecautions when Swimming\nSwimming can pose specific risks for children with current ear infections or previous surgery. Water pollutants or chemicals may exacerbate the infection, and underwater swimming causes pressure changes that can cause pain. The following precautions should be taken:\nChildren with ruptured acute otitis media (drainage from ear canal) should not go swimming until their infections are completely cured.\nChildren with AOM that is not ruptured should not dive or swim underwater.\nChildren with implanted ear tubes should use earplugs or cotton balls coated in petroleum jelly when swimming to prevent infection.\nWHEN AND HOW ARE ANTIBIOTICS OR OTHER DRUGS USED IN ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA?\nControversy over the Use of Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Media\nAntibiotics have been the mainstay treatments of acute otitis media. Prescriptions for this condition doubled between 1980 and 1992 from 12 million to 24 million. In one region of the US more than 70% of children received antibiotics before they were seven months old, and the most common reason for these medications was otitis media. Of major concern is a worldwide increase of common bacterial strains that have become resistant to many standard antibiotics. [ See Box Warnings on Antibiotic Over-Use and Resistant Bacteria .]\nMany American physicians feel pressured by patients and families into prescribing antibiotics when the patients do not really need them. Data indicate, however, that far fewer children diagnosed with acute otitis media and prescribed antibiotics actually need them:\nOne Dutch study reported that only one in seven children under two years old with a first episode of acute otitis media derived significant benefits from antibiotic treatment. In the study, although antibiotics reduced fever faster in the children, it did not reduce the duration of pain or crying.\nA review of 27 studies found that antibiotics benefited only 11% of children with otitis media and 17% of those with otitis media with effusion.\nAccording to a major 2000 analysis, about two-thirds of children with uncomplicated ear infections recover in a day. And, 80% of children are cured within a week without antibiotics. (Antibiotics cure up to 95% of infections during the first week.)\nIn many Northern European countries, the antibiotic prescription rate for ear infection is much lower than in the US, and reports indicate that children with ear infections there do as well as their American counterparts.\nOne study conducted in the Netherlands, where fewer antibiotics are prescribed, did find a higher rate of mastoiditis (3.8/100,000 people per year) compared to the rate in many countries with high-prescription rates (1.2 to 2.0/100 000). (Mastoiditis, a bone infection in the skull, is a serious complication of otitis media.) However, the incidence of this complication was still very small in the Netherlands. Furthermore, in Norway and Denmark (where prescription rates are high) the incidence of mastoiditis was nearly the same as in the Netherlands.\nRecommendations for Choosing Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Media\nUnfortunately, there are no objective tests available to determine specifically which children with acute otitis media would benefit from antibiotics and which would not. Older children seem to do better without them than younger ones. Some experts recommend the following:\nParents should monitor the child for three days, using mild pain relievers and home remedies. (One physician expert said that he prescribes antibiotics during that time only if the child is in obvious, severe pain and the eardrum is red and bulging.)\nIf symptoms resolve, no antibiotics are necessary.\nIf symptoms persist, antibiotics should be taken.\nOne British study reported that only 24% of children who followed these guidelines needed antibiotics. And, compared to other groups who were all given immediate antibiotics, there were no differences in missed school days or child distress. The antibiotic group also had much higher rates of diarrhea. Unfortunately, given even a remote possibility of serious complications, including mastoiditis and negative effects on learning from hearing loss due to recurrent infections, most physicians and parents are very reluctant to abandon the standard use of antibiotics.\nStill many experts believe that ear infections in children are overdiagnosed and overtreated with antibiotics. The bottom line is that parents should question their physician closely if they recommend antibiotics and feel comfortable if antibiotics are not diagnosed.\nAntibiotic Courses for Single-Episodes of AOM\nA number of antibiotics are available for treating ear infections. [ See Box Antibiotic Choices for Treating Otitis Media .]\nIf a child needs antibiotics the following are some recommendations for duration of regimens.\nA full ten to fourteen day course of antibiotics is typically used for very young children and for those with complications such as a perforated ear drum, facial abnormalities, or impaired immune systems.\nAn oral antibiotic may be given for five to seven days in children over two years old who start to improve within 72 hours and who have no risk factors for complications.\nParents should be sure their child completes the drug regimen. Not completing it is a major factor in the growth of bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics.\nEffectiveness and Follow up Procedures\nEaraches usually resolve within 8 to 24 hours after taking an antibiotic, although about 10% of children who are treated do not respond. Failure may be due to the following or other causes:\nIn many cases in which the response to an antibiotic is incomplete, a virus is often present.\nIn other cases, the bacteria may be resistant to the antibiotic.\nIn some children, fluid will remain in the middle ear for weeks or months, even after the infection has resolved. During that period, children may have some hearing problems, but eventually the fluid almost always drains away.\nFollow-up may involve the following steps:\nIf the infection clears up with a single regimen in children less than 15 months old or in children with risk factors for reinfection, an examination should be scheduled two to three weeks after therapy.\nIf the infection clears up with a single regimen in older children with no specific risk factors, they should be reexamined three to six weeks after treatment.\nIf signs of infection are still present (eg, pus is still present in the ear) within 48 hours of taking the last antibiotic dose, the child should be re-examined. (Parents are excellent judges of whether their child's condition has cleared up.)\nIn cases where complications are suspected, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (an otolaryngologist) may perform a tympanocentesis or myringotomy, procedures in which fluid is drawn from the ear and examined for specific organisms. But this is reserved for severe cases and is usually preformed by a specialist.\nTreatment of Persistent or Recurrent Acute Otitis Media\nFor persistent or recurrent acute otitis media a number of options are available.\nWatchful waiting.\nSecond-line and other powerful antibiotics. [ See Box Antibiotic Choices for Treating Otitis Media .]\nTympanostomy. This is a surgical procedure that implants tubes to drain fluid and prevent build-up and infection [ see What Are the Surgical Procedures for Ear Infections?].\nANTIBIOTIC CHOICES FOR TREATING ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA\nStandard Antibiotics for Acute Otitis Media (AOM)\nWhile many different antibiotics may be used to effectively treat otitis media, the physician needs to balance effectiveness, safety, and convenience, as well as try to minimize the emergence of resistance. To this end the CDC has made very clear recommendations about first and second line treatments\nFirst Line of Therapy. . Of note, about 15% of the bacteria that cause ear infections are now believed to be resistant to the first-choice antibiotics. This means that only about half of children will respond to a given antibiotic.\nThe most widely prescribed antibiotic for acute otitis media is amoxicillin (Amoxil, Polymox, Trimox, Wymox, or any generic formulation). This oral penicillin is both inexpensive and highly effective against the S. pneumoniae bacteria. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to amoxicillin has increased significantly. A 2000 study, in fact, reported that 24% of S. pneumonia strains in the US were resistant to penicillin. And resistant infections reached 32% in children under five. Amoxicillin is also not as effective against H. influenzae . In areas where bacterial-resistance to antibiotics is high, some physicians recommend high-dose amoxicillin.\nOfloxacin (Floxin), an antibiotic available in ear drops is now recommended as first-line therapy for children with AOM who also have perforated ear drums or implanted tympanostomy tubes. Ofloxacin is known as a fluoroquinolone (also simply called quinolone) and is proving to be very effective and safe for these children. (It should be noted that drops are effective only in these cases.) Another quinolone, ciprofloxacin, is also available in eardrop form outside the US.\nSecond-Line Therapy. If treatment fails after 72 hours, for recurrent or persistent acute otitis media, or if the patient has had other antibiotics within the past month then the following are recommended:\nAmoxicillin/clavulanate combination (Augmentin). This agent is known as an augmented penicillin, which works against a wide spectrum of bacteria.\nCertain second- or third-generation oral cephalosporin antibiotics may also be good second-line options. Of these Cefuroxime (Ceftin) and cefpodoxime (Vantin) has the best record to date among the cephalosporins for coverage against bacteria that infect the upper respiratory tract. (Their safety and effectiveness in infants under six months old are not proven.)\nCeftriaxone (Rocephin), an injectable cephalosporin, is also an option. Administering it in a single injection may be sufficient for some children, although a 2001 study reported that a three-day regimen was more effective for children with non-responsive otitis media.\nAntibiotics for Other Circumstances\nMore powerful and expensive antibiotics are available for other circumstances, including the following:\nFor children who are allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins, of both. (These antibiotics belong to a class beta lactam antibiotics. A person who is allergic to penicillin has a 5% to 14% chance of being allergic to a cephalosporin.)\nFor children who do not respond to these agents other options are available For children with persistent or recurrent episodes of acute otitis media.\nThese antibiotics are usually very expensive, however, and are not commonly used. They include the following:\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Cotrim, Septra) or a combination of erythromycin and sulfisoxazole (Eryzole, Pediazole) are useful for people allergic to penicillin. It should not be used in patients whose infections occurred after dental work or in patients allergic to sulfa drugs. Allergic reactions can be very serious. Bacterial resistance to these agents has increased dramatically, however, and failure rates are high in certain regions. An oral solution (Primsol) uses trimethoprim alone. It poses less risk for an allergic reaction than the combination and yet is still effective.\nMacrolides are other agents sometimes used as an alternative. They include erythromycin, azithromycin (Zithromax), clarithromycin (Biaxin), and roxithromycin (Rulid). These antibiotics are effective against S. pneumoniae and M catarrhalis , but there is increasing bacterial resistance to these agents. They are not effective against H. influenzae . Azithromycin only needs to be taken for five days. Shorter regimens are being investigated. In one study comparing Zithromax to Augmentin, the five day regimen of azithromycin (Zithromax) was less effective than Augmentin. In another study, however, a one dose regimen was as effective as Augmentin. More research is needed.\nSide Effects of Antibiotics\nThe most common side effects of nearly all antibiotics are gastrointestinal problems, including cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nAllergic reactions can also occur with all antibiotics but are most common with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa. These reactions can range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe, even life-threatening anaphylactic shock.\nSome drugs, including certain over-the-counter medications, interact with antibiotics; patients should report to the physician all medications they are taking.\nWarnings on Antibiotic Over-Use and Resistant Bacteria\nOver-prescription of Antibiotics for Colds and Flus. Each year in the United States, 160 million prescriptions are written for antibiotics, equal to about 25,000 tons of these drugs. About half are used for patients and half animal, fish, and other agricultural uses.\nVirtually no antibiotics for colds are necessary, even with persistent cough and thick, green mucus, unless there is evidence of an accompanying infection. In one disturbing study, antibiotics were prescribed for nearly half of children who went to the doctor for a common cold. And experts estimate that, outside the hospital setting, only half of the antibiotics currently being prescribed for sore throat and 20% of prescriptions for persistent coughing are necessary.\nAntibiotics may be required for upper respiratory tract infections only under certain situations, such as the following:\nIn patients, particularly small children or the elderly, who have medical conditions that put them at high risk for complications from such infections.\nIn strep throat (which is caused by the Streptococcal bacteria). (Strep throat makes up only about 12% of all sore throat cases.)\nIn some cases of an accompanying sinusitis, ear, or other bacterial infection. [See the Reports Ear Infections (Otitis Media) in Children and Sinusitis.]\nResistant Bacterial. Prescribing antibiotics to so many people who do not require antibiotics is raising great concern among health professionals because of emerging strains of bacteria that are no longer eliminated using many standard antibiotics. Although new powerful antibiotics continue to be designed, they are expensive and are also prone to resistance eventually.\nHigh-Risk Areas. The prevalence of such antibiotic-resistant bacteria has dramatically increased worldwide. A 2000 study reported that 24% of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are resistant to penicillin in the US. In general, regions and institutions with the highest rate of resistance are those in which antibiotics are heavily prescribed. In America, for instance, Georgia and Tennessee have the highest resistance to penicillin. 1\nAt-Risk Patients. As of yet, the average person is not endangered by this problem. Patients at greater risk for developing an infection resistant to common antibiotics are those with following conditions:\nBeing very old or very young.\nBeing exposed to patients with drug-resistant infection.\nHospitalization in intensive care.\nHaving had an invasive procedure.\nHaving had a hospital stay.\nHaving had prior and prolonged antibiotic therapy, particularly within the past four to six weeks.\nThe presence of a wound.\nHaving intravenous lines, catheters, or tubes down the throat.\nBeing immunosuppressed.\nPositive News. There are some signs of hope:\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reporting a decline in antibiotic prescriptions since the early 1990s. And, countries that have reduced their dependence on penicillin are reporting a parallel decline in bacteria resistant to the antibiotic.\nInnovative approaches are being investigated. One involves creating antibiotics that have the capacity to either self-destruct or regenerate themselves.\nGreater emphasis is being placed on development of vaccines and expanding immunization programs to prevent infections in the first place.\nWhat Patients and Parents Can Do.\nFor colds and mild flu, use remedies to relieve symptoms. Realize that antibiotics will not shorten the course of a viral infection.\nDon't pressure a physicians into prescribing an antibiotic if it is clearly inappropriate. The physician very often will give in. It is important for patients and parents to understand that although antibiotics may bring a sense of security, they provide no significant benefit for a person with viral infection, and overuse can contribute to the growing problem of resistant bacteria.\nIf an antibiotic is prescribed, take the full course.\nWHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR TREATING OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION (OME)\nExpert guidelines for children ages one to three with otitis media with effusion (OME) are the following:\nWatchful Waiting during the First Three Months\nThe child is typically monitored for the first three months and not given an antibiotic. Some studies have reported that OME resolved without any treatment during this period in the following:\nAbout two thirds of all children whose OME developed without a previous ear infection.\nIn 90% of children whose OME had immediately followed an episode of acute otitis media.\nDrugs that thin the mucus, known as mucolytics, may have some benefit. Some of these agents contain guaifenesin and are commonly available (Robitussin, Scot-Tussin Expectorant). More research is needed to confirm whether they are helpful for OME.\nAntibiotics at the End of Three Months\nAntibiotics (usually given for 14 to 21 days) are prescribed after or during the three months under the following circumstances:\nThe condition persists after three months.\nThe child is suffering.\nHearing loss occurs. (A hearing test should be conducted if the condition persists for over three months, whether antibiotics have been given or not.)\nTreatment Failure at Six Weeks\nIf OME persists for six weeks in spite of antibiotic therapies, the following options may be considered:\nAntibiotics are continued and stopped when the condition has cleared.\nAntibiotics are continued long-term even after the condition has cleared in high-risk children to prevent a recurrence of OME. (A number of studies indicate that antibiotic treatment is not very effective in preventing relapse, however. In fact, one study found no difference at all in persistent OME between treated and untreated children, and some experts believe that antibiotics are not useful at all for this condition.)\nA combination of corticosteroids (commonly called steroids) and antibiotics may be more effective than antibiotics alone. The steroid's contribution is to reduce inflammation, which may improve fluid clearance in the middle ear. Corticosteroids have no effect on infection and, in fact, suppress the immune system, so antibiotics are also used. At this time expert groups still do not recommend oral corticosteroids at all for OME because of potentially severe side effects. They can be particularly dangerous for children who have not yet had chicken pox, particularly if they have been exposed within the month.\nSurgery (tube insertion) is usually recommended if OME is still present and there is evidence of hearing loss of over 20 decibels. As with antibiotics, however, some experts believe it is overused for otitis media. [ See What Are the Surgical Procedures for Ear Infections?]\nWHAT ARE THE SURGICAL PROCEDURES FOR EAR INFECTIONS?\nMyringotomy and Standard Tympanostomy\nGeneral Guidelines. Surgery to drain the ear drum ( myringotomy) with or without implanted ventilation tubes to drain the fluid ( tympanostomy) is the basic surgical procedure for otitis media. It is the second most frequently performed procedure for children under two (circumcision is first). In 1996 tubes were placed in the ears of one out of every 110 American children. And, an estimated 280,000 children younger than three years of age underwent the operation. It is usually performed in children with recurrent acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion (OME) under they following circumstances:\nThey have not responded to aggressive antibiotic treatment or antibiotic treatment is not warranted.\nThey have evidence of fluid in the ear for more than four months and have experienced hearing difficulties.\nControversies Concerning Surgery. Surgery is as controversial as antibiotic treatment, however.\nArguments supporting tubal procedures are based on the following observations, among others:\nHearing is almost always restored following tympanostomy.\nOne 2000 study indicated that the operation significantly improves many aspects of a child's quality of life, including emotional distress, impaired hearing and speech, and limitations in activity.\nThe following are studies suggesting that surgery offers few benefits for many children on whom it is performed:\nA 1994 study indicated that a quarter of all tube insertion procedures was not appropriate, and in 30% of procedures the risks were as great as the benefits. The study was done, however, to assess medical procedures for insurance reimbursement and a number of surgeons have questioned it.\nImportant studies in 2000 and 2001 suggested that the procedures in very young children (one and two years old) who had persistent otitis media offered no advantages for language development by the time the child reached the age of three.\nMyringotomy. Myringotomy is used to drain the fluid. It may be used as a single procedure in unresponsive acute otitis media or used in combination with tympanostomy. It involves the following steps.\nThe surgeon makes a very small incision in the eardrum.\nFluid is sucked out using a vacuum-like device.\nThe fluid is usually examined for identifying specific bacteria\nThe eardrum heals in about a week.\nMyringotomy and Tympanostomy. If otitis media with effusion persists in spite of drug therapy or if it is caused by structural or inborn problems, a tympanostomy is also performed. It involves the following:\nA general anesthetic is required but children typically recover completely within a few hours.\nMyringotomy is performed.\nAfter myringotomy, the physician inserts a tube to allow continuous drainage of the fluid from the middle ear.\nIt is a simple procedure, and the child almost never has to spend the night in the hospital.\nSome children report almost no discomfort after surgery and find acetaminophen (Tylenol) sufficient for any pain. About half of children, however, require codeine or more powerful pain relievers. One study found that lidocaine eardrops were effective in relieving pain and stress after the procedure.\nComplications. Complications of the operation are very uncommon:\nGeneral anesthetic poses risks, although rare, for allergic reactions or other side effects.\nPersistent ear drum perforation is the most common serious complication, but it too is rare.\nScarring can also occur, particularly in children who require more than one procedure, but it almost never affects hearing.\nSmall keratin (skin cell) containing cysts called cholesteatomas develop around the tube site in over 1% of patients. This raises some concern about the long-term safety of the procedure, although other studies have indicated that this complication is rare. More studies are needed.\nSometimes the tubes become blocked from sticky secretions or clotted blood after the operation. If the secretions are purulent (pus-filled) from infection, treatment with antibiotic ear drops, such as ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin, may be very effective.\nSuccess Rates. Hearing is almost always restored following tympanostomy. Failure to achieve normal or near-normal hearing is usually due to complicated conditions, such as preexisting ear problems or persistent OME in children who have had previous multiple tympanostomies. In one ten year study, hearing loss was still present in 12.5% of people who had had surgery, although in half of these individuals, hearing loss was very mild (loss was below 20 decibels). Persistent fluid was the main reason for continued impaired hearing. Only 1.9% of hearing loss cases could be attributed to complications of the operation itself.\nPrecautions. While the tubes are in place, children may take the following precautions:\nMany doctors feel that children should use earplugs when swimming as long as the tubes are in place in order to prevent infection. (Cotton balls coated with petroleum jelly are effective alternatives to ear plugs.)\nChildren may shower without earplugs.\nSome physicians feel that as long as the child does not dive or swim underwater, earplugs may not be necessary, but parents should consult their own child's doctor on this subject.\nFollow-Up. After surgery, the children may experience the following course.\nEventually, the tubes fall out as the hole in the eardrum closes. This may happen between several months to over a year. This is painless and the patient and parents may not even be aware that the tubes are out.\nThe operation may need to be repeated, occasionally several times, if, after the tubes fall out, the effusion and hearing loss still persist.\nAntibiotics are often prescribed after surgery to prevent such recurrence.\nLaser Tympanostomy\nA new tympanostomy technique uses a laser, which creates a tiny hole and allows the fluid to drain immediately. No tubes are inserted and the child does not need general anesthesia. One 1999 study reported that within one week of laser-assisted surgery, 100% of children with acute otitis media were symptom free. After three months, only 8% had repeat infections (compared to an average of 47% when treated with antibiotics). Of those children with OME, 65% were fluid-free after three months.\nAdenoidectomy\nAdenoids are collections of spongy lymph tissue in the back of the throat. Removal of the adenoids, called adenoidectomy, is sometimes considered if they are overly enlarged and interfere with Eustachian tube function. In such cases, the procedure might follow myringotomy and tympanostomy. Removing tonsils at the same time as adenoids ( adenotonsillectomy) does not appear to add any value to the procedure, and it increases the chance of bleeding (which ranges from 0.5% to 4%). One 2001 study did report that either adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy at the time of tympanostomy substantially reduced hospitalizations related to otitis media among children two years of age or older. It is commonly held, however, that, except for special circumstances, adenoidectomy should not be conducted on children under four. More research is needed to confirm any benefits in this group.\nFunctional Jaw Orthopedics\nFunctional jaw orthopedics are experimental dental treatments that use appliances to stimulate muscles in the tongue, lips, and cheek. The devices are not supported by the teeth, but directly by the soft tissues in the mouth in order to make changes in bone and teeth. Some experts hope that this experimental approach may benefit a number of conditions now treated medically, including otitis media.\nWHAT ARE THE GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTING RECURRENT ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotics have been used for prevention of acute otitis media in children under the following circumstances:\nIf the child has had three or more separate ear infections every six months.\nIf the child has had four or more ear infections within a year.\nAlmost all physicians are moving away from this practice, however, because of concerns about resistance and questions on their value. The following are some observations on this issue:\nMost recurring ear infections stop completely in children older than 16 months whether or not they were given preventive antibiotics. For this reason, some experts recommend that preventive therapy is not warranted at all in children over 16 months.\nAlthough one large study reported that preventive antibiotics decreased the frequency of new episodes of acute otitis media by 44%, some experts believe that this figure does not represent a significant drop in the actual number of episodes.\nOne study reported that amoxicillin was no more effective in preventing recurrent ear infections than a placebo (so-called sugar pills).\nIn Finland, where very few children are treated with antibiotics for otitis media, a long term study found that after an initial diagnosis of recurrent acute otitis media, only 12% had three or more episodes afterward and only 4% developed otitis media with effusion. All the other children had only two or less attacks after the diagnosis.\nSpecific Antibiotic Choices. When preventive antibiotics are prescribed, the following may be used:\nOne or two daily doses of amoxicillin or sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin).\nAzithromycin (Zithromax) may be an effective alternative for children who are allergic to penicillin, who live in regions with high rates of bacteria resistant to penicillin, or who have family conditions in which complying to a daily regimen is difficult. A single weekly dose may be sufficient.\nTiming and Duration. Physician opinion varies as to the best timing and duration for taking preventive antibiotics. The following are some options:\nPrescribed for a consistent three- to six-month period following the last acute episode.\nPrescribed only in winter and spring when the risk for respiratory infections is high.\nPrescribed at the onset of any respiratory infection.\nVaccines\nChildren who are susceptible to recurrent ear infections should probably be given vaccinations against influenza viruses and pneumococci.\nViral Influenza Vaccines. Vaccines are designed to recognize foreign agents (called antigens) in the body and to attack them. Vaccines against influenza currently employ inactivated (not live) viruses to produce an immune response that will then attack the active virus. Vaccines are given by injection in the fall, usually between October and December. A live but weakened intranasal vaccine (FluMist) should be available soon. It is engineered to grow only in the cooler temperatures of the nasal passages, not in the warmer lungs and lower airways. The vaccine boosts the specific immune factors in the mucous membranes of the nose that fight off the actual viral infections. It is employed using a nasal spray and in one study provided protection against the flu in up to 93% of children.\nThe following children over six months should be vaccinated (note: vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines . Please review all the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.) against influenza:\nAny child with a condition that requires regular medical care.\nAny child who has been hospitalized for a serious illness (particularly lung, kidney, diabetes, sickle-cell, or immune deficiencies.)\nChildren who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy should also be immunized against the flu because they are at higher risk for Reye's syndrome, a life-threatening disease, if they get the flu.\nPossible negative responses include the following:\nNewer vaccines contain very little egg protein, but an allergic reaction still may occur in people with strong allergies to eggs.\nAlmost a third of people who receive the influenza vaccine develop redness or soreness at the injection site for one or two days afterward.\nOther side effects include mild fatigue and muscle aches and pains; they tend to occur between six and 12 hours after the vaccination and last up to two days. It should be noted that these symptoms are not influenza itself but an immune response to the virus proteins in the vaccine. Anyone with a fever, however, should not be vaccinated (note: vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines . Please review all the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.) until the ailment has subsided.\nSome studies have reported more severe asthma symptoms in children with the lung condition. A 2000 study of asthmatic children, however, reported no increased risk. In fact, there was some indication that the vaccination helped reduce asthma attacks over time. More research is needed to confirm or refute these results.\nPneumococcal Vaccines. A recently approved pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar or PCV7) could potentially prevent over a million cases of ear infections each year as well as serious infections, such as pneumonia, in American children. The vaccine is now recommended for all children up to age two and certain high-risk children up to age five, such as those at risk for meningitis or widespread infection. It should be noted that protection is not 100%, but the vaccine is still effective in many children. Protection lasts for over six years in most people. In one study, a similar vaccine under investigation protected not only children in day care from serious respiratory infections, but their younger unvaccinated (note: vaccines can cause irreversible health damage to the brain/body, and risks largely exceed any benefits. See SPECIAL REPORTS on vaccines . Please review all the evidence on vaccines before deciding to vaccinate yourself or your children.) siblings had fewer infections as well.\nExperimental Agents\nInterfering Bacteria. Researchers have observed that the noses and throats of children who are prone to ear infections harbor smaller numbers of the \"friendly\" bacteria that help prevent overproduction of the harmful bacteria, than children without frequent infection. An interesting study in Sweden employed a nasal spray containing harmless bacteria called alpha-streptococcal, which are normally found in the throat and competes for space with harmful bacteria. In the study, the bacteria helped to protect against recurrent otitis media in susceptible children. This is very promising because it could significantly reduce antibiotic use; more research is warranted.\nAntiviral Agents. In one study, when the anti-viral drug, zanamivir (Relenza), was administered in the nasal passages of adults with influenza, middle-ear abnormalities were reduced from 73% to 32%. This drug is available for children greater than seven years old for treatment of influenza, but no research has determined it value for preventing or treating otitis media in children.\nXylitol. Studies are reporting that children who chew gum or swallow a syrup containing xylitol, a sugar alcohol, experience significantly fewer ear infections. Chewing gum was more effective than the syrup. Xylitol is produced naturally in birch, strawberries, and raspberries. It has properties that fight Streptococcal pneumonia bacteria. Although in one study, xylitol did not reduce bacteria in the nose and throat, it did prevent ear infection. Some health providers report that even children one and a half years old can learn to chew and not swallow gum. The gum is not widely available in the US, however, and studies have not tested children between six and 18 months, the highest-risk age group for otitis media. This is an area for further research.\nWHERE ELSE CAN HELP BE FOUND FOR EAR INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN?\nAmerican College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 85 West Algonquin Road, Suite 550, Arlington Heights, IL 60005.

Studies have found that 40 - 85% of patients with the common cold show signs of inflamed sinuses on x-rays or CT scans. A cold, however, unlike sinusitis, typically clears up without treatment within a week. (Only about 0.5 - 2% of adults with viral colds or flus actually develop bacterial infections.)\nAllergies. Symptoms of both sinusitis and allergic rhinitis include nasal obstruction and congestion. The conditions often occur together. People with allergies and no sinus infection may have:\nThin, clear, and runny nasal discharge\nItchy nose, eyes, or throat (do not occur with bacterial sinusitis)\nRecurrent sneezing\nSymptoms of allergies appear only during exposure to allergens\nMigraine and Other Headaches. Many primary headaches, particularly migraine or cluster, may closely resemble sinus headache. Migraine and sinus headaches may even coexist in many cases. Sinus headaches are usually more generalized than migraines, but it is often difficult to tell them apart, particularly if headache is the only symptom of sinusitis.\nTrigeminal Neuralgia. In some cases, headache that persists after successful treatment of chronic sinusitis may be due to neuralgia (nerve-related pain) in the face. This condition requires specific drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants or carbamazepine. Trials using such drugs may identify patients with neuralgia and help avoid unnecessary invasive treatments for chronic sinusitis.\nOther Conditions. A number of other conditions can mimic sinusitis. They include:\nDental problems\nA foreign object in the nasal passage\nTemporal arteritis (headache caused by inflamed arteries in the head)\nPersistent upper respiratory tract infections\nTemporomandibular disorders (problems in the joints and muscles of the jaw hinges)\nVasomotor rhinitis, a condition in which the nasal passages become congested in response to irritants or stress. It often occurs in pregnant women.\nBack to Top\nComplications\nBacterial sinusitis is nearly always harmless (although uncomfortable and sometimes even very painful). If an episode becomes severe, antibiotics generally eliminate further problems. In rare cases, however, sinusitis can be very serious.\nOsteomyelitis. Adolescent males with acute frontal sinusitis are at particular risk for severe problems. One important complication is infection of the bones (osteomyelitis) of the forehead and other facial bones. In such cases, the patient usually experiences headache, fever, and a soft swelling over the bone known as Pott's puffy tumor.\nInfection of the Eye Socket. Infection of the eye socket, or orbital infection, which causes swelling and subsequent drooping of the eyelid, is a rare but serious complication of ethmoid sinusitis. In these cases, the patient loses movement in the eye, and pressure on the optic nerve can lead to vision loss, which is sometimes permanent. Fever and severe illness are usually present.\nBlood Clot. Another danger, although rare, from ethmoid or frontal sinusitis are blood clots. If a blood clot forms in the sinus area around the front and top of the face, symptoms are similar to orbital infection. In addition, the pupil may be fixed and dilated. Although symptoms usually begin on one side of the head, the process usually spreads to both sides.\nBrain Infection. The most dangerous complication of sinusitis, particularly frontal and sphenoid sinusitis, is the spread of infection by anaerobic bacteria to the brain, either through the bones or blood vessels. Abscesses, meningitis, and other life-threatening conditions may result. In such cases, the patient may experience mild personality changes, headache, altered consciousness, visual problems, and, finally, seizures, coma, and death.\nIncreased Asthma Severity\nThe relationship between sinusitis and asthma is unclear. A number of theories have been proposed for a causal or shared association between sinusitis and asthma. Successful treatment of both allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis in children who also have asthma may reduce symptoms of asthma. It is particularly important to treat any coexisting bacterial sinusitis in people with asthma. They might not respond to asthma treatments unless the infection is cleared up first.\nEffects on Quality of Life\nPain, fatigue, and other symptoms of chronic sinusitis can have significant effects on the quality of life. This condition can cause emotional distress, impair normal activity, and reduce attendance at work or school. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, the average patient with sinusitis misses about 4 work days a year, and sinusitis is one of the top 10 medical conditions that most adversely affect American employers.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nPatients should see a doctor if they have sinusitis symptoms that do not clear up within a few days, are severe, or are accompanied by high fever or acute illness. However, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with such symptoms actually have sinusitis. Some experts complain that too many patients are diagnosed with true sinusitis and given unnecessary antibiotics when their symptoms would actually resolve easily in days with over-the-counter medications or no drugs at all. Others believe that true sinusitis is often mistakenly diagnosed as an allergy and not treated, which could lead to serious illness.\nThe first goal in diagnosing sinusitis is to rule out other possible causes of symptoms, and then determine:\nThe site where the infection has occurred\nWhether the condition is acute or chronic\nThe organism causing the infection (if possible)\nDiagnostic Approach to Acute Sinusitis\nMedical History. The patient should describe all symptoms such as nasal discharge and specific pain in the face and head, including eye and tooth pain.\nAfter assessing symptoms, the doctor should take a thorough medical history of the patient:\nAny history of allergies or headaches\nRecent upper respiratory infection (colds, flus, infection)\nHistory of sinusitis episodes that is unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. (In such cases, the doctor will usually diagnose chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and refer the patient to a specialist for more advanced testing.)\nExposure to cigarette smoke or other environmental pollutants\nRecent travel\nRecent dental procedures, particularly if there is pain toward the back of the mouth\nMedications being taken (particularly decongestants)\nAny known structural abnormalities in the nose and face\nInjury to the head or face\nHistory of medical conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia, which can produce tender areas in the face or sinus regions and nonspecific symptoms of ill health\nAny family history of allergies, immune disorders, cystic fibrosis, or immotile cilia syndrome\nIn small children with sinusitis, whether they attend a day care center or nursery school\nPhysical Examination\nThe doctor will press the forehead and cheekbones to check for tenderness and check for other signs of sinusitis, including yellow to yellow-green nasal discharge. The doctor will also check the inside of the nasal passages using a device with a bright light to check the mucus and look for any structural abnormalities.\nLaboratory Tests\nIn some cases, tests may be used to detect that presence of immune factors in sinus tissues that would suggest persistent inflammation. Such findings would strongly suggest a chronic or allergic condition. In 2005, a new laboratory test became available for diagnosing chronic sinusitis. The CRS Fungal Profile tests mucus samples for eosinophil major basic protein (a protein involved in allergic and inflammatory reactions) and a type of fungi. However, more research is necessary before results from this test, and related tests, can be used to start treatment with antifungal medications.\nNasal Endoscopy (Rhinoscopy)\nNasal endoscopy, or rhinoscopy, is now used for diagnosing chronic and recurrent acute sinusitis and for differentiating between allergies and true acute sinusitis. It involves the insertion of a flexible tube into the nasal passage and the use of a fiberoptic light that enables the doctor to see inside the sinuses. Endoscopy allows detection of even very small abnormalities in the sinuses. It can determine whether surgery is necessary and if medications are having any effect. Bacterial cultures can also be taken from samples removed using endoscopy. (Endoscopy is also used for treating sinusitis.)\nImaging Techniques\nComputer Tomography. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the best method for viewing the paranasal sinuses. There is little relationship, however, between symptoms in most patients and findings of abnormalities on a CT scan. CT scans are recommended for acute sinusitis only if there is a severe infection, complications, or a high risk for complications. CT scans are useful for diagnosing chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and for surgeons as a guide during surgery. They show inflammation and swelling and the extent of the infection, including in deeply hidden air chambers missed by x-rays and nasal endoscopy. Often, they can detect the presence of fungal infections.\nX-Rays. Until the availability of endoscopy and CT scans, x-rays were commonly used. They are not as accurate, however, in identifying abnormalities in the sinuses. For example, more than one x-ray is needed for diagnosing frontal and sphenoid sinusitis. X-rays do not detect ethmoid sinusitis at all. This area can be the primary site of an infection that has spread to the maxillary or frontal sinuses.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not as effective as CT in defining the paranasal anatomy and therefore is not typically used to image the sinuses for suspected sinusitis. MRI is also more expensive than CT. However, it can help rule out fungal sinusitis and may help differentiate between inflammatory disease, malignant tumors, and complications within the skull. It may also be useful for showing soft tissue involvement.\nSinus Puncture and Bacterial Culture\nSinus puncture with bacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosing a bacterial sinus infection. It is invasive, however, and is performed only when antibiotics have not worked. Sinus puncture involves using a needle to withdraw a small amount of fluid from the sinuses. It requires a local anesthetic and is performed by a specialist. The fluid is then cultured to determine what type of bacteria is causing sinusitis.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent sinusitis is to avoid colds and influenza. If you are unable to avoid them, the next best way to prevent sinusitis is to effectively treat colds and influenza.\nGood Hygiene and Preventing Transmission\nColds and flu are spread primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes near someone else. A very common method for transmitting a cold is by shaking hands. Everyone should always wash their hands before eating and after going outside. Ordinary soap is sufficient. Waterless hand cleaners that contain an alcohol-based gel are also effective for every day use and may even kill cold viruses. (They are less effective, however, if extreme hygiene is required. In such cases, alcohol-based rinses are needed.) Antibacterial soaps add little protection, particularly against viruses. In fact, one study suggests that common liquid dish washing soaps are up to 100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is known to cause pneumonia. Wiping surfaces with a solution that contains one part bleach to 10 parts water is very effective in killing viruses.\nVaccines\nInfluenza Vaccine. Vaccines against influenza use inactivated (not live) viruses. Because influenza viruses change from year to year, influenza vaccines are redesigned annually to match the anticipated viral strains. Experts recommend that people receive annual influenza vaccinations in October or November. People who should definitely be vaccinated include: all adults 65 years or older; children age 6 months to 5 years; other adults or children who are at high risk for developing serious medical complications from influenza; health care workers and others who care for individuals who are at high risk for influenza complications. However, annual influenza vaccination is safe and appropriate for all children older than 6 months and adults. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #94: Colds and influenza .]\nPneumococcal Vaccines. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against S. pneumoniae (also called pneumococcal) bacteria, the most common bacterial cause of respiratory infections. There are two effective vaccines available, one called a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax, Pnu-Immune) for adults and a 7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) for infants and young children. Experts are now recommending that more people, including healthy elderly people, be given the pneumococcal vaccine, particularly in light of the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #90: Immunizations .]\nTreatment\nGeneral Treatment Approaches\nThe primary objectives for treatment of sinusitis are reduction of swelling, eradication of infection, draining of the sinuses, and ensuring that the sinuses remain open. Fewer than half of patients reporting symptoms of sinusitis need aggressive treatment. Home remedies can be very useful.\nTreatment of Acute Sinusitis.\nSupport treatment with only saline nasal irrigation, decongestants, antihistamines, and expectorants are appropriate for a minimum of 7 - 10 days for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, and may be used for longer.\nAntibiotics are not helpful for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, so they should not be prescribed for at least the first 7 days.\nTreatment of Chronic Sinusitis.\nA broad-spectrum antibiotic (one that can eliminate a wide range of bacteria) may be helpful. Some patients benefit from prolonged therapy.\nA corticosteroid nasal spray. Some doctors also recommend oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone) for patients who do not respond to nasal corticosteroids or for those patients who have nasal polyps. Prednisone is also used for patients who have allergic fungal sinusitis.\nSaline nasal irrigation is often needed on an ongoing basis.\nIf the condition dramatically improves after 1 - 2 months, antibiotics are stopped. The patient should continue with both the steroid and saline nasal solutions. If there is no improvement after this time, surgery may be considered. For some people with chronic sinusitis, however, the condition is not curable, and the goal of treatment is to improve the quality of life.\nA thorough diagnostic work-up should be performed to rule out any underlying conditions, including but not limited to allergies, asthma, any immune problems, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, and structural problems in the nasal passages. If a primary trigger for chronic sinusitis can be identified, it should be treated or controlled if possible.\nHydration\nHome remedies that open and hydrate sinuses may, indeed, be the only treatment necessary for mild sinusitis that is not accompanied by signs of acute infection.\nDrinking plenty of fluids and getting lots of rest when needed is still the best bit of advice to ease the discomforts of the common cold. Water is the best fluid and helps lubricate the mucous membranes. (There is NO evidence that drinking milk will increase or worsen mucus, although milk is a food and should not serve as fluid replacement.)\nChicken soup does, indeed, help congestion and aches. The hot steam from the soup may be its chief advantage, although laboratory studies have actually reported that ingredients in the soup may have anti-inflammatory effects. In fact, any hot beverage may have similar soothing effects from steam. Ginger tea, fruit juice, and hot tea with honey and lemon may all be helpful.\nSpicy foods that contain hot peppers or horseradish may help clear sinuses.\nInhaling steam 2 - 4 times a day is extremely helpful, costs nothing, and requires no expensive equipment. The patient should sit comfortably and lean over a bowl of boiling hot water (no one should ever inhale steam from water as it boils) while covering the head and the bowl with a towel so the steam remains under the cloth. The steam should be inhaled continuously for 10 minutes. A mentholated or other aromatic preparation may be added to the water. Long, steamy showers, vaporizers, and facial saunas are alternatives.\nNasal Wash\nA nasal wash can be helpful for removing mucus from the nose. A saline solution can be purchased at a drug store or made at home. (Mix 1 teaspoon of table salt with a pinch of baking soda in 2 cups of warm water.) Perform the nasal wash several times a day. Researchers have reported that daily irrigation of the nasal passages with a hypertonic saline solution relieves sinusitis symptoms and also reduces antibiotic use and the occurrence of acute exacerbations. Patients in the study had 72% fewer sinus infections, a 69% improvement in breathing, and they reduced medication usage by more than half.\nA simple method for administering a nasal wash is:\nLean over the sink head down.\nPour some solution into the palm of the hand and inhale it through the nose, one nostril at a time.\nSpit out the remaining solution.\nGently blow the nose.\nThe solution may also be inserted into the nose using a large rubber ear syringe, available at a pharmacy. In this case the process is:\nLean over the sink head down.\nInsert only the tip of the syringe into one nostril.\nGently squeeze the bulb several times to wash the nasal passage.\nThen press the bulb firmly enough so that the solution passes into the mouth.\nThe process should be repeated in the other nostril.\nAntibiotic Use in the Treatment of Sinusitis\nOverview on Antibiotics and Their Overuse. Sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for antibiotic prescriptions. And, there is much evidence that antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed for many patients:\nMost acute sinusitis cases clear up on their own.\nAntibiotics generally help only a very small number of children with persistent nasal discharge for at least 20 days. Even when antibiotics are helpful, benefits are modest in reducing duration of the infection.\nThe intense and widespread use of antibiotics (not only for sinusitis but also for ear infections and other upper respiratory tract infections) has led to a serious global problem, which is bacterial resistance to common antibiotics.\nWhen to Use Antibiotics. Because up to 70% of sinusitis cases resolve on their own, doctors generally wait 7 - 14 days before prescribing antibiotics. However, antibiotics may be prescribed sooner if severe symptoms develop. These symptoms include:\nFever greater than 39\u00b0 C (102.2\u00b0 F)\nFacial pain or headache\nSevere swelling around the eyes\nChronic sinusitis is often the result of damage to the mucous membrane from a past, untreated acute sinus infection. The aerobic and anaerobic bacteria present in chronic sinusitis are often different from those that cause the acute form. The role of antibiotic treatment for chronic sinusitis is controversial. Special types of antibiotics may be used, and treatment may be needed for a longer time.\nSome patients with chronic sinusitis may need intravenous antibiotic therapy, particularly those with underlying medical disorders that can worsen their condition. This therapy is typically given 2 weeks before surgery and continued for about a month afterwards.\nAntibiotic Regimens.\nThe standard first-line antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis is a 10 - 14 day course of amoxicillin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an alternative choice.\nFor more complicated illnesses (chronic illness, chronic sinusitis, symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, children in day care or younger than 2 years old, smokers, recent antibiotic use, or unresponsiveness to initial antibiotic course), the doctor may prescribe a different type of antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporin, or a macrolide.\nIf the patient does not respond after 21 - 28 days, the doctor may switch to another broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime. Other choices include clarithromycin or azithromycin (macrolides) or levofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone).\nSide Effects of Antibiotics. Most antibiotics have the following side effects (although specific antibiotics may have other side effects or fewer of the standard ones):\nThe most common side effect for nearly all antibiotics is gastrointestinal distress.\nAntibiotics double the risk for vaginal infections in women. Taking supplements of acidophilus or eating yogurt with active cultures may help restore healthy bacteria that offset the risk for such infections.\nAllergic reactions can also occur with all antibiotics but are most common with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa. These reactions can range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe, even life-threatening, anaphylactic shock.\nCertain drugs, including some over-the-counter medications, interact with antibiotics; patients should inform the doctor of all medications they are taking and of any drug allergies.\nManaging Sinusitis in Patients with Allergies\nPatients often have various combinations of allergies, sinusitis, and asthma. Treating each condition is important for improving them all. In addition to decongestants, pain relievers, and expectorants, other remedies are available for people who suffer from nonbacterial sinusitis during allergy season.\nAnti-Inflammatory Drugs. Nasal spray corticosteroids (commonly called steroids) are important for reducing the inflammatory response in the nasal passages and airways. They are important in the treatment of asthma and are now considered to be the most effective measure for preventing allergy attacks. Leukotriene-antagonists are also useful for sinusitis symptoms.\nAntihistamines. Antihistamine tablets relieve sneezing and itching and can prevent nasal congestion before an allergy attack. Many brands are available by prescription and over the counter. Because they thicken mucus and make it harder to drain out from the sinuses, they should not be used for sinusitis.\nImmunotherapy. Immunotherapy, commonly referred to as allergy shots, may be considered for patients with severe seasonal allergies that do not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy is the only treatment that affects the cause of allergies. In one year-long study using immunotherapy, over half of young patients participating experienced improvement in overall sinusitis symptoms, and nearly all felt better in general. Immunotherapy also may prevent asthma and the development of new allergies in children. Newer immunotherapeutic approaches using specially designed antibodies and vaccines are also showing promise.\nAll drug treatments have side effects, some very unpleasant and, rarely, serious. Patients may need to try different drugs until they find one that relieves symptoms without producing excessively distressing side effects.\nEmergency Treatment\nPatients who show signs that infection has spread beyond the nasal sinuses into the bone, brain, or other parts of the skull need emergency care. High dose antibiotics are administered intravenously, and emergency surgery is almost always necessary in such cases.\nSevere Fungal Sinusitis. Sinusitis caused by severe fungal infections is a medical emergency. Treatment is aggressive surgery, and high-dose antifungal chemotherapy with a drug such as amphotericin B can be life saving. The use of high-pressure oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen) is showing promise as additional therapy for potentially deadly fungal infections.\nMedications\nMedications for Mild Pain and Fever Reduction\nMany people take medications to reduce mild pain and fever. Adults most often choose aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).\nThe following are recommendations for children:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (usually Advil or Motrin) is the pain reliever of choice in children. Most pediatricians advise such medications for children who run fevers over 101\u00b0 F.\nAspirin and aspirin-containing products are virtually never recommended for children or adolescents. Reye syndrome, a very serious condition, has been associated with aspirin use in children who have flu symptoms or chicken pox.\nDecongestants\nDecongestants are drugs that help reduce nasal congestion. They are available in both pill and nasal forms. However, decongestants will not cure sinusitis. Nasal decongestants may actually worsen sinusitis by increasing sinus inflammation. Due to the lack of evidence for the benefit of nasal decongestants in treating sinusitis, the FDA ruled ordered manufacturers of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant products to remove from their labeling all references to sinusitis.\nYour doctor may still recommend that you take either an OTC or prescription nasal decongestant to help relieve blockage symptoms associated with sinusitis. If you think you have sinusitis, check with your doctor before taking a decongestant. Do not try to treat sinusitis by yourself.\nNasal Decongestants. Nasal decongestants come in both long-acting and short-acting forms. The effects of short-acting decongestants last about 4 hours; long-acting decongestants last 6 - 12 hours. The active ingredients in nasal decongestants include oxymetazoline, xylometazoline, and phenylephrine.\nTips for Use. The following precautions are important for people taking nasal decongestants:\nWhen using a nasal spray, spray each nostril once. Wait a minute to allow absorption into the mucosal tissues, and then spray again.\nDo not share droppers and inhalers with other people.\nDiscard sprayers, inhalers, or other decongestant delivery devices when the medication is no longer needed. Over time, these devices can become reservoirs for bacteria.\nDiscard the medicine if it becomes cloudy or unclear.\nOral Decongestants. Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are the only decongestants taken by mouth that are currently available over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States. It decreases the volume of mucus in the nose, as well as within the Eustachian tubes. Many brands of OTC oral decongestants are available. A common brand is Sudafed. Oral decongestants such as Sudafed can also be helpful for relieving cough associated with postnasal drip.\nSide Effects of Decongestants. Decongestants have certain adverse effects, which are more apt to occur in oral than nasal decongestants, including:\nAgitation and nervousness\nDrowsiness (particularly with decongestants taken by mouth and in combination with alcohol)\nChanges in heart rate and blood pressure\nAvoid combinations of oral decongestants with alcohol or certain drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and sedatives\nSlow urination in men with enlarged prostate glands.\nIndividuals at Risk for Complications from Decongestants. People who may be at higher risk for complications are those with certain medical conditions, including disorders that make blood vessels highly susceptible to contraction. Such conditions include:\nHeart disease\n"}, {"score": 552.45215, "uuid": "a67a9362-8696-5c50-8142-2268e918bb14", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700wb-90-12515", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Sinusitis", "page_rank": 1.1784381e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Sinusitis Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Adults most often choose <em>aspirin</em>, <em>ibuprofen</em> (Advil), <em>or</em> acetaminophen (Tylenol). * Acetaminophen (Tylenol) <em>or</em> <em>ibuprofen</em> (usually Advil <em>or</em> Motrin) <em>is</em> the pain reliever of choice <em>in</em> <em>children</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Recurrent acute and chronic sinusitis tend to take the following course:\nAny of the sinusitis symptoms listed previously may be present\nSymptoms are more vague and generalized than acute sinusitis\nFever may be absent or just low grade\nSymptoms of sinusitis last 12 weeks or longer\nSymptoms occur throughout the year, even during nonallergy seasons\nSite-Specific Symptoms\nSpecific symptoms may indicate which sinus is involved.\nFrontal sinusitis causes:\nPain across the lower forehead.\nSymptoms are worse when lying on the back\nMaxillary sinusitis causes:\nPain over the cheeks that may travel to the teeth\nHard palate in the mouth sometimes becomes swollen\nSymptoms are worse when head is upright\nEthmoid sinusitis causes:\nPain behind the eyes and sometimes redness and tenderness in the area across the top of the nose\nSymptoms are worse when coughing, straining, or lying on the back\nSphenoid sinusitis:\nRarely occurs by itself; when it does, the pain may be felt behind the eyes, across the forehead, or in the face\nSymptoms are worse when lying on the back or bending forward\nOther Causes of Sinusitis Symptoms\nIt is often difficult to tell when a viral infection converts to a bacterial infection. Studies have found that 40 - 85% of patients with the common cold show signs of inflamed sinuses on x-rays or CT scans. A cold, however, unlike sinusitis, typically clears up without treatment within a week. (Only about 0.5 - 2% of adults with viral colds or flus actually develop bacterial infections.)\nAllergies. Symptoms of both sinusitis and allergic rhinitis include nasal obstruction and congestion. The conditions often occur together. People with allergies and no sinus infection may have:\nThin, clear, and runny nasal discharge\nItchy nose, eyes, or throat (do not occur with bacterial sinusitis)\nRecurrent sneezing\nSymptoms of allergies appear only during exposure to allergens\nMigraine and Other Headaches. Many primary headaches, particularly migraine or cluster, may closely resemble sinus headache. Migraine and sinus headaches may even coexist in many cases. Sinus headaches are usually more generalized than migraines, but it is often difficult to tell them apart, particularly if headache is the only symptom of sinusitis.\nTrigeminal Neuralgia. In some cases, headache that persists after successful treatment of chronic sinusitis may be due to neuralgia (nerve-related pain) in the face. This condition requires specific drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants or carbamazepine. Trials using such drugs may identify patients with neuralgia and help avoid unnecessary invasive treatments for chronic sinusitis.\nOther Conditions. A number of other conditions can mimic sinusitis. They include:\nDental problems\nA foreign object in the nasal passage\nTemporal arteritis (headache caused by inflamed arteries in the head)\nPersistent upper respiratory tract infections\nTemporomandibular disorders (problems in the joints and muscles of the jaw hinges)\nVasomotor rhinitis, a condition in which the nasal passages become congested in response to irritants or stress. It often occurs in pregnant women.\nBack to Top\nComplications\nBacterial sinusitis is nearly always harmless (although uncomfortable and sometimes even very painful). If an episode becomes severe, antibiotics generally eliminate further problems. In rare cases, however, sinusitis can be very serious.\nOsteomyelitis. Adolescent males with acute frontal sinusitis are at particular risk for severe problems. One important complication is infection of the bones (osteomyelitis) of the forehead and other facial bones. In such cases, the patient usually experiences headache, fever, and a soft swelling over the bone known as Pott's puffy tumor.\nInfection of the Eye Socket. Infection of the eye socket, or orbital infection, which causes swelling and subsequent drooping of the eyelid, is a rare but serious complication of ethmoid sinusitis. In these cases, the patient loses movement in the eye, and pressure on the optic nerve can lead to vision loss, which is sometimes permanent. Fever and severe illness are usually present.\nBlood Clot. Another danger, although rare, from ethmoid or frontal sinusitis are blood clots. If a blood clot forms in the sinus area around the front and top of the face, symptoms are similar to orbital infection. In addition, the pupil may be fixed and dilated. Although symptoms usually begin on one side of the head, the process usually spreads to both sides.\nBrain Infection. The most dangerous complication of sinusitis, particularly frontal and sphenoid sinusitis, is the spread of infection by anaerobic bacteria to the brain, either through the bones or blood vessels. Abscesses, meningitis, and other life-threatening conditions may result. In such cases, the patient may experience mild personality changes, headache, altered consciousness, visual problems, and, finally, seizures, coma, and death.\nIncreased Asthma Severity\nThe relationship between sinusitis and asthma is unclear. A number of theories have been proposed for a causal or shared association between sinusitis and asthma. Successful treatment of both allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis in children who also have asthma may reduce symptoms of asthma. It is particularly important to treat any coexisting bacterial sinusitis in people with asthma. They might not respond to asthma treatments unless the infection is cleared up first.\nEffects on Quality of Life\nPain, fatigue, and other symptoms of chronic sinusitis can have significant effects on the quality of life. This condition can cause emotional distress, impair normal activity, and reduce attendance at work or school. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, the average patient with sinusitis misses about 4 work days a year, and sinusitis is one of the top 10 medical conditions that most adversely affect American employers.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nPatients should see a doctor if they have sinusitis symptoms that do not clear up within a few days, are severe, or are accompanied by high fever or acute illness. However, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with such symptoms actually have sinusitis. Some experts complain that too many patients are diagnosed with true sinusitis and given unnecessary antibiotics when their symptoms would actually resolve easily in days with over-the-counter medications or no drugs at all. Others believe that true sinusitis is often mistakenly diagnosed as an allergy and not treated, which could lead to serious illness.\nThe first goal in diagnosing sinusitis is to rule out other possible causes of symptoms, and then determine:\nThe site where the infection has occurred\nWhether the condition is acute or chronic\nThe organism causing the infection (if possible)\nDiagnostic Approach to Acute Sinusitis\nMedical History. The patient should describe all symptoms such as nasal discharge and specific pain in the face and head, including eye and tooth pain.\nAfter assessing symptoms, the doctor should take a thorough medical history of the patient:\nAny history of allergies or headaches\nRecent upper respiratory infection (colds, flus, infection)\nHistory of sinusitis episodes that is unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. (In such cases, the doctor will usually diagnose chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and refer the patient to a specialist for more advanced testing.)\nExposure to cigarette smoke or other environmental pollutants\nRecent travel\nRecent dental procedures, particularly if there is pain toward the back of the mouth\nMedications being taken (particularly decongestants)\nAny known structural abnormalities in the nose and face\nInjury to the head or face\nHistory of medical conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia, which can produce tender areas in the face or sinus regions and nonspecific symptoms of ill health\nAny family history of allergies, immune disorders, cystic fibrosis, or immotile cilia syndrome\nIn small children with sinusitis, whether they attend a day care center or nursery school\nPhysical Examination\nThe doctor will press the forehead and cheekbones to check for tenderness and check for other signs of sinusitis, including yellow to yellow-green nasal discharge. The doctor will also check the inside of the nasal passages using a device with a bright light to check the mucus and look for any structural abnormalities.\nLaboratory Tests\nIn some cases, tests may be used to detect that presence of immune factors in sinus tissues that would suggest persistent inflammation. Such findings would strongly suggest a chronic or allergic condition. In 2005, a new laboratory test became available for diagnosing chronic sinusitis. The CRS Fungal Profile tests mucus samples for eosinophil major basic protein (a protein involved in allergic and inflammatory reactions) and a type of fungi. However, more research is necessary before results from this test, and related tests, can be used to start treatment with antifungal medications.\nNasal Endoscopy (Rhinoscopy)\nNasal endoscopy, or rhinoscopy, is now used for diagnosing chronic and recurrent acute sinusitis and for differentiating between allergies and true acute sinusitis. It involves the insertion of a flexible tube into the nasal passage and the use of a fiberoptic light that enables the doctor to see inside the sinuses. Endoscopy allows detection of even very small abnormalities in the sinuses. It can determine whether surgery is necessary and if medications are having any effect. Bacterial cultures can also be taken from samples removed using endoscopy. (Endoscopy is also used for treating sinusitis.)\nImaging Techniques\nComputer Tomography. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the best method for viewing the paranasal sinuses. There is little relationship, however, between symptoms in most patients and findings of abnormalities on a CT scan. CT scans are recommended for acute sinusitis only if there is a severe infection, complications, or a high risk for complications. CT scans are useful for diagnosing chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and for surgeons as a guide during surgery. They show inflammation and swelling and the extent of the infection, including in deeply hidden air chambers missed by x-rays and nasal endoscopy. Often, they can detect the presence of fungal infections.\nX-Rays. Until the availability of endoscopy and CT scans, x-rays were commonly used. They are not as accurate, however, in identifying abnormalities in the sinuses. For example, more than one x-ray is needed for diagnosing frontal and sphenoid sinusitis. X-rays do not detect ethmoid sinusitis at all. This area can be the primary site of an infection that has spread to the maxillary or frontal sinuses.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not as effective as CT in defining the paranasal anatomy and therefore is not typically used to image the sinuses for suspected sinusitis. MRI is also more expensive than CT. However, it can help rule out fungal sinusitis and may help differentiate between inflammatory disease, malignant tumors, and complications within the skull. It may also be useful for showing soft tissue involvement.\nSinus Puncture and Bacterial Culture\nSinus puncture with bacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosing a bacterial sinus infection. It is invasive, however, and is performed only when antibiotics have not worked. Sinus puncture involves using a needle to withdraw a small amount of fluid from the sinuses. It requires a local anesthetic and is performed by a specialist. The fluid is then cultured to determine what type of bacteria is causing sinusitis.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent sinusitis is to avoid colds and influenza. If you are unable to avoid them, the next best way to prevent sinusitis is to effectively treat colds and influenza.\nGood Hygiene and Preventing Transmission\nColds and flu are spread primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes near someone else. A very common method for transmitting a cold is by shaking hands. Everyone should always wash their hands before eating and after going outside. Ordinary soap is sufficient. Waterless hand cleaners that contain an alcohol-based gel are also effective for every day use and may even kill cold viruses. (They are less effective, however, if extreme hygiene is required. In such cases, alcohol-based rinses are needed.) Antibacterial soaps add little protection, particularly against viruses. In fact, one study suggests that common liquid dish washing soaps are up to 100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is known to cause pneumonia. Wiping surfaces with a solution that contains one part bleach to 10 parts water is very effective in killing viruses.\nVaccines\nInfluenza Vaccine.

Even when antibiotics are helpful, benefits are modest in reducing duration of the infection.\nThe intense and widespread use of antibiotics (not only for sinusitis but also for ear infections and other upper respiratory tract infections) has led to a serious global problem, which is bacterial resistance to common antibiotics.\nWhen to Use Antibiotics. Because up to 70% of sinusitis cases resolve on their own, doctors generally wait 7 - 14 days before prescribing antibiotics. However, antibiotics may be prescribed sooner if severe symptoms develop. These symptoms include:\nFever greater than 39\u00b0 C (102.2\u00b0 F)\nFacial pain or headache\nSevere swelling around the eyes\nChronic sinusitis is often the result of damage to the mucous membrane from a past, untreated acute sinus infection. The aerobic and anaerobic bacteria present in chronic sinusitis are often different from those that cause the acute form. The role of antibiotic treatment for chronic sinusitis is controversial. Special types of antibiotics may be used, and treatment may be needed for a longer time.\nSome patients with chronic sinusitis may need intravenous antibiotic therapy, particularly those with underlying medical disorders that can worsen their condition. This therapy is typically given 2 weeks before surgery and continued for about a month afterwards.\nAntibiotic Regimens.\nThe standard first-line antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis is a 10 - 14 day course of amoxicillin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an alternative choice.\nFor more complicated illnesses (chronic illness, chronic sinusitis, symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, children in day care or younger than 2 years old, smokers, recent antibiotic use, or unresponsiveness to initial antibiotic course), the doctor may prescribe a different type of antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporin, or a macrolide.\nIf the patient does not respond after 21 - 28 days, the doctor may switch to another broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime. Other choices include clarithromycin or azithromycin (macrolides) or levofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone).\nSide Effects of Antibiotics. Most antibiotics have the following side effects (although specific antibiotics may have other side effects or fewer of the standard ones):\nThe most common side effect for nearly all antibiotics is gastrointestinal distress.\nAntibiotics double the risk for vaginal infections in women. Taking supplements of acidophilus or eating yogurt with active cultures may help restore healthy bacteria that offset the risk for such infections.\nAllergic reactions can also occur with all antibiotics but are most common with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa. These reactions can range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe, even life-threatening, anaphylactic shock.\nCertain drugs, including some over-the-counter medications, interact with antibiotics; patients should inform the doctor of all medications they are taking and of any drug allergies.\nManaging Sinusitis in Patients with Allergies\nPatients often have various combinations of allergies, sinusitis, and asthma. Treating each condition is important for improving them all. In addition to decongestants, pain relievers, and expectorants, other remedies are available for people who suffer from nonbacterial sinusitis during allergy season.\nAnti-Inflammatory Drugs. Nasal spray corticosteroids (commonly called steroids) are important for reducing the inflammatory response in the nasal passages and airways. They are important in the treatment of asthma and are now considered to be the most effective measure for preventing allergy attacks. Leukotriene-antagonists are also useful for sinusitis symptoms.\nAntihistamines. Antihistamine tablets relieve sneezing and itching and can prevent nasal congestion before an allergy attack. Many brands are available by prescription and over the counter. Because they thicken mucus and make it harder to drain out from the sinuses, they should not be used for sinusitis.\nImmunotherapy. Immunotherapy, commonly referred to as allergy shots, may be considered for patients with severe seasonal allergies that do not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy is the only treatment that affects the cause of allergies. In one year-long study using immunotherapy, over half of young patients participating experienced improvement in overall sinusitis symptoms, and nearly all felt better in general. Immunotherapy also may prevent asthma and the development of new allergies in children. Newer immunotherapeutic approaches using specially designed antibodies and vaccines are also showing promise.\nAll drug treatments have side effects, some very unpleasant and, rarely, serious. Patients may need to try different drugs until they find one that relieves symptoms without producing excessively distressing side effects.\nEmergency Treatment\nPatients who show signs that infection has spread beyond the nasal sinuses into the bone, brain, or other parts of the skull need emergency care. High dose antibiotics are administered intravenously, and emergency surgery is almost always necessary in such cases.\nSevere Fungal Sinusitis. Sinusitis caused by severe fungal infections is a medical emergency. Treatment is aggressive surgery, and high-dose antifungal chemotherapy with a drug such as amphotericin B can be life saving. The use of high-pressure oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen) is showing promise as additional therapy for potentially deadly fungal infections.\nMedications\nMedications for Mild Pain and Fever Reduction\nMany people take medications to reduce mild pain and fever. Adults most often choose aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).\nThe following are recommendations for children:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (usually Advil or Motrin) is the pain reliever of choice in children. Most pediatricians advise such medications for children who run fevers over 101\u00b0 F.\nAspirin and aspirin-containing products are virtually never recommended for children or adolescents. Reye syndrome, a very serious condition, has been associated with aspirin use in children who have flu symptoms or chicken pox.\nDecongestants\nDecongestants are drugs that help reduce nasal congestion. They are available in both pill and nasal forms. However, decongestants will not cure sinusitis. Nasal decongestants may actually worsen sinusitis by increasing sinus inflammation. Due to the lack of evidence for the benefit of nasal decongestants in treating sinusitis, the FDA ruled ordered manufacturers of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant products to remove from their labeling all references to sinusitis.\nYour doctor may still recommend that you take either an OTC or prescription nasal decongestant to help relieve blockage symptoms associated with sinusitis. If you think you have sinusitis, check with your doctor before taking a decongestant. Do not try to treat sinusitis by yourself.\nNasal Decongestants. Nasal decongestants come in both long-acting and short-acting forms. The effects of short-acting decongestants last about 4 hours; long-acting decongestants last 6 - 12 hours. The active ingredients in nasal decongestants include oxymetazoline, xylometazoline, and phenylephrine.\nTips for Use. The following precautions are important for people taking nasal decongestants:\nWhen using a nasal spray, spray each nostril once. Wait a minute to allow absorption into the mucosal tissues, and then spray again.\nDo not share droppers and inhalers with other people.\nDiscard sprayers, inhalers, or other decongestant delivery devices when the medication is no longer needed. Over time, these devices can become reservoirs for bacteria.\nDiscard the medicine if it becomes cloudy or unclear.\nOral Decongestants. Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are the only decongestants taken by mouth that are currently available over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States. It decreases the volume of mucus in the nose, as well as within the Eustachian tubes. Many brands of OTC oral decongestants are available. A common brand is Sudafed. Oral decongestants such as Sudafed can also be helpful for relieving cough associated with postnasal drip.\nSide Effects of Decongestants. Decongestants have certain adverse effects, which are more apt to occur in oral than nasal decongestants, including:\nAgitation and nervousness\nDrowsiness (particularly with decongestants taken by mouth and in combination with alcohol)\nChanges in heart rate and blood pressure\nAvoid combinations of oral decongestants with alcohol or certain drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and sedatives\nSlow urination in men with enlarged prostate glands.\nIndividuals at Risk for Complications from Decongestants. People who may be at higher risk for complications are those with certain medical conditions, including disorders that make blood vessels highly susceptible to contraction. Such conditions include:\nHeart disease\n"}, {"score": 706.8659, "uuid": "1b3b1f08-9317-54c8-9b7b-37b12687be7a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1715wb-90-08662", "target_hostname": "www.localhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.localhealth.com/article/erythema-nodosum-1/treatments", "page_rank": 1.1814318e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Erythema Nodosum - Treatments - <em>Better</em> Medicine", "snippet": "May not be reproduced <em>or</em> reprinted without permission from Health Grades, Inc.

Nevertheless, it can sometimes recur. Following your treatment plan for any existing underlying disorder can help reduce your chances of experiencing a recurrence of erythema nodosum. In the meantime, pain-relieving medication can help ease symptoms.\nMost common symptomatic relief agents\nA common choice for pain management is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). However, NSAIDs should be avoided if you also have Crohn\u2019s disease, because the NSAID can trigger a flare-up or make the Crohn\u2019s disease worse. Some common symptomatic relief agents include:\nNSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) or naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn)\nSalicylic acids, such as aspirin (Ascriptin, Bayer, Ecotrin), diflunisal (Dolobid), or salsalate (Disalcid, Salflex)\nAdditional symptomatic relief agents\nDepending on the primary cause of your erythema nodosum, additional agents or alternatives to NSAIDs might include:\nPotassium iodide, taken as a solution for four weeks, may provide relief by reducing the nodules if it is started as soon as possible after the onset of erythema nodosum\nSystemic steroids such as oral prednisone (Deltasone, Liquid Pred) are a safe option as long as malignancy, underlying infection, and risk of sepsis have been ruled out\nWhat you can do to improve your erythema nodosum\nIn addition to taking pain medications as directed and following your treatment plan for any existing primary cause, you may also find additional pain relief by:\nApplying hot or cold compresses\nAvoiding activities that aggravate your pain until symptoms subside\nWhat are the potential complications of erythema nodosum?\nThere are no known complications of erythema nodosum itself. The condition usually resolves on its own within six weeks. However, delaying or avoiding treatment of any identified cause or primary disorder may result in complications specific to that disorder. You can help minimize your risk of serious complications by following the treatment plan you and your health care professional design specifically for you.\nReferences:\nErythema nodosum.

Over the course of a few days, they may turn a purplish color and then fade over the next several weeks. They usually appear on the shins but may also occur on other parts of your body, such as your arms, legs and buttocks. Many people experience painful joints, unexplained weight loss, low-grade fever , and a general feeling of malaise or lethargy as early as one to three weeks...

This article focuses on the more challenging complaints in babies and young children, who are the most difficult to assess. This is not an exhaustive list of presenting complaints or examination techniques, but it will give a starting point.\nGeneral principles\nWhen your patient is a young child:\nDo the best you can, and start treatment or refer the child as quickly as possible. The earlier the treatment starts, the better a child\u2019s vision is likely to be after treatment. Even if there is no treatment, a blind baby or child still needs help to develop as normally as possible and should also be referred.\nBelieve the parents. Most things parents notice and mention to you are real and relevant. Parents are usually right! They spend a great deal of time with their children, and will observe how children behave and what their eyes look like.\nListen more than you speak. Usually the parent will help you towards the diagnosis.\nDon\u2019t take any chances - play it safe. If in doubt, ask a colleague or refer the child to a specialist.\nBe patient. It takes time to let the parents tell their story and to examine a child properly, especially one who cannot or will not cooperate.\nPlan ahead. If you have a busy clinic, see any young children first. If you don\u2019t, they may get tired and irritable, which will cause stress for their parents or carers; it also makes children difficult to examine.\nAlways believe the mother. TANZANIA.\nPhoto: CCBRT/Dieter Telemans\nCommunication with parents\nGood communication with parents is essential:\nSpeak in ways that parents can understand. Speak in simple, everyday terms and use diagrams or drawings to support your explanations.\nBe as honest as you can. This could include saying that you are uncertain of what exactly is wrong.\nBe kind. Parents want what is best for their children, but because of lack of education or resources they may not always make the best choices. Do not blame parents for what they have done, or what they have not done. This may make them less likely to seek further help. With careful explanation, you can help them to make the best decision for their child\u2019s eyes and vision.\nReferral\nWhen you refer a child, it is very useful to write a referral letter. Give the letter to the parents to take with them and keep a copy for your records. In the letter, state:\nwhat the mother complained of or noticed\nwhat you found when you examined the child\nwhat you have done, if anything (e.g., started antibiotics).\nIt is important to encourage parents to take up a referral.\nExplain why you might refer the child. If a child needs to be referred, it is very important to convince the parents that specialist testing and treatment will help their child.\nHelp parents to understand the urgency of seeking further help. Tell them how important it is to get the advice. However, don\u2019t alarm parents unnecessarily. Explain that the quicker a child gets treatment, the better the outcome will be.\nBe supportive. Advise parents about what support is available to help them take up the referral, such as transport, subsidies, and so on. If you can, tell them what to expect at the hospital and what they should bring with them (such as the referral letter, clothes, or food).\nAlways refer children with the following eye problems urgently:\nOne or both eyes are abnormally small or large (Figure 1)\nOne or both eyes stick out (Figure 2)\nThere is a red mark on the eyelid (Figure 3)\nOne or both eyes are obviously abnormal; for example, white all over (Figure 4).\nFigure 1. Both eyes of this child are enlarged and the corneas are cloudy. The child should be referred for urgent investigation.\nPhoto: David Taylor\nFigure 2. The left eye of this child is protruding and displaced downwards. The child should be referred for urgent investigation.\nPhoto: David Taylor\nFigure 3. A red mark on the eyelid may be a haemangioma, which can cause amblyopia (lazy eye). The child should be referred for urgent investigation.\nPhoto: David Taylor\nFigure 4. Both eyes are obviously small and white. The child should be referred for urgent investigation.\nPhoto: David Taylor\nDownload picture from Flickr\nAssessing vision in a baby (0-1 year)\nDon\u2019t be anxious about examining a baby. If the baby is awake and attentive, there is a lot you can find out by asking the parents and simply observing the baby\u2019s reactions.\nFirst ask the parents what they think about their baby\u2019s vision.\nNotice how the baby looks at things in the room, such as the window or any lights.\nWatch for eye contact between the baby and parents.\nDoes the baby look when someone comes into the room?\nDoes the baby respond to silent smiles or to raised eyebrows?\nDo you get eye contact?\nYou should have realistic expectations about what a baby should be able to do by a certain age. Table 1 shows when a baby is too young to show a visual response, when the response is likely to develop, and at what age you should be worried if a baby does NOT show the expected response. You can ask the mother or check the baby\u2019s responses yourself.\nFor example, if a baby of about three weeks old does not turn to a diffuse light, such as light coming from a window, you would not necessarily be worried - although you would still believe the parents if they are concerned. On the other hand, if a baby is eight weeks old and does not eventually turn to a diffuse light, then there may be a problem and you should investigate further.\nBear in mind that there can be a lot of variation in babies\u2019 development; however, this table should be a helpful guide.\nTable 1. Normal visual functioning for a baby\nView\nTips for examining a baby\nTry to carry out as much of the examination as possible without touching the baby. Children often resist having their eyes held open, for example.\nHave many toys available (Figure 7). For each new toy, the baby will momentarily hold their eyes steady, allowing a quick examination. If available, use toys which are bright and can flash on and off. A good rule to remember is one toy, one look.\nDon\u2019t be embarrassed about making funny noises! These help to attract the baby\u2019s attention and to keep them interested and calm.\nIn order to be able to do a more detailed examination in an infant, examine the child while he or she is being bottle fed or breast fed.\nIf you are struggling, ask the parent\u2019s permission to wrap the baby. Place the baby on a blanket or sheet, hold the arms to the side and the legs straight, and wrap the blanket around the body and arms (Figure 8). Ask the parent to hold the baby. Either the parent or a helper can then carefully open one eye at a time for the examination (without putting pressure on the eye - see Figure 2 on page 17). Remember that this may be very stressful for both the baby and the parent.\nFigure 5.

A lot of toys are needed to attract children\u2019s attention and to make examination fun!.\nPhoto: Clare Gilbert\nFigure 8. Wrapping a baby for an eye examination.\nPhoto: Sue Stevens\nDownload picture from Flickr\nAssessing vision in a young child (1-5 years)\nChildren in this age group should have steady eyes, no squint, no history of sight difficulties and, if in a good mood, show interest in colourful or interesting objects in the room. They should respond to silent smiles, eyebrow raising, and winking.\nChildren in this age group should also be able to see objects presented in their peripheral visual field by a colleague while you draw their attention to your face, perhaps by making a funny noise. Cover one eye at a time if the child will allow it and ask them to identify different sized objects or, with older children, letters - make it a game.\n\u2018Observe children when they don\u2019t know they are being observed, for example while you are talking to the mother or taking a history\u2019\nMany children can accurately name colours by the age of three years but many cannot until they are older; it is reassuring if they can.\nAfter the age of three, most children can participate in accurate visual acuity, visual field, and colour vision testing by someone trained and with age-appropriate equipment.\nIf you do not have that equipment or have not been trained to use it, you can still test a child\u2019s functional vision using everyday objects as described above.\nTips for examining a young child\nThe tips for examining a baby (above) apply equally well to young children.\nIn addition:\nBe playful and make a game of the examination (Figure 9). For example, shine a light into the mother\u2019s eye first, or pretend you are playing \u2018hide and seek\u2019 or \u2018peekaboo\u2019 when covering one eye.\nObserve children when they don\u2019t know they are being observed, for example while you are talking to the mother or taking a history.\nThe tip about wrapping up a baby will work for a younger child, but may be more difficult in an older child. Ask the parents what they think would be appropriate or would work best. For example, parents may prefer to hold their child\u2019s arms gently.\nFigure 9.

If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and wait until your next regularly scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.\nWhat happens if I overdose?\nSeek emergency medical attention if you think you have used too much of this medicine.\nOverdose symptoms may include ringing in your ears, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, rapid breathing, fever, seizure (convulsions), or coma.\nWhat should I avoid while taking aspirin?\nDo not use any other over-the-counter medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Aspirin is contained in many medicines available over the counter. If you take certain products together you may accidentally take too much aspirin. Read the label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains aspirin.\nAvoid taking an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) while you are taking aspirin. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), diclofenac (Voltaren), diflunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), indomethacin (Indocin), ketoprofen (Orudis), ketorolac (Toradol), mefenamic acid (Ponstel), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), piroxicam (Feldene), and others.\nAvoid drinking alcohol while you are taking aspirin. Alcohol may increase your risk of stomach bleeding.\nAvoid taking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) if you are taking aspirin to prevent stroke or heart attack. Ibuprofen can make aspirin less effective in protecting your heart and blood vessels. If you must use both medications, take the ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after you take the aspirin (non-enteric coated form).\nWhat are the possible side effects of aspirin?\nGet emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.\nStop using this medication and call your doctor at once if you have any of these serious side effects:\nblack, bloody, or tarry stools;\ncoughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds;\nsevere nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain;\nfever lasting longer than 3 days;\nswelling, or pain lasting longer than 10 days; or\nhearing problems, ringing in your ears.\nLess serious side effects may include:\nupset stomach, heartburn;\ndrowsiness; or\nheadache.\nThis is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.

In the pharmacy there are over 75 products for cough and cold, and the aches and pains that go with them. But do our patients need all the different ones? Marisa Boos, Pharm D Candidate, University of Florida, has put together a complete chart to help you help your patients.\nAdvertisement\nChicken Soup for the COUGH & COLD: What OTC Product Should I use?\nMarisa Boos, Pharm D Candidate 2009.\nUniversity of Florida: College of Pharmacy\nIt\u2019s that time of the year again: the flu season. Approximately 1 billion persons per year will be sick; subsequently, the flu is no walk in the park and most try to treat the accompanying bothersome symptoms: nasal congestion, runny noses, cough, fever and last be not least, the body aches and pains.\u00a0 Along with wanting to choose the best product to relieve symptoms, one must also consider cost.\u00a0 There exists a multitude of other-the-counter combination product. The wide variety of products and variances in prices make what should be an easy decision, overwhelming and frustrating. Most OTC cough and cold products contain the same and/or similar active ingredients. Understanding the purpose of each ingredient helps to choose a product that will manage specific symptoms. To help minimize costs, one should purchase a product which targets his/her most bothersome symptom; if two products are being purchased avoid products with the same ingredients. Often times combination products are unnecessary and costly. The following is a brief review of the purpose of the ingredients used in cough and cold medications and what is available.\nWHAT DO I NEED?\nFirst, understand which drug class (i.e decongestants versus anti-histamines) treat what symptom and then the differences within that class (i.e phenylephrine versus pseudoephedrine, both examples of decongestants). Keep in mind most drug classes treat more than one symptom, explaining why two products with the same ingredients may be labeled to help with two different conditions.\nSYMPTOM\n1st Generation: chlorpehniramine, diphenydramine and doxylamine\n2nd Generation: loratidine, cetirizine, fexofenadine\nCough\nAspirin, acetaminophen, and/or ibuprofen.\nDecongestants\nPseudoephedrine is only available as tablet (oral) form and not as a nasal spray. Phenylepherine is available as both and the rest are nasal spray only. Generally speaking, pseudoephedrine is preferable over phenylepherine when taken orally; pseudoephedrine is better absorbed into the body and also last longer than phenylepherine.\nNasal decongestants work faster compared to oral, however they cannot be used past 3-5days: patients\u2019 run the risk of developing rebound congestion as the body gets used to the nasal decongestants. Oral decongestants last longer, can be used for a longer duration of time but take slightly longer to see an effect. Nasal decongestants also require the ability of the user to breath in air through his/her nose sufficiently enough to distribute the medication within the nose. Of the OTC nasal decongestants available, oxymetazoline is longer acting.\nAnti-Histamines\n1st generation anti-histamines are used in cough and cold products predominately for its sedative effects and benefits on reducing coughing and sneezing- which 2nd generation anti-histamines do not possess. Most 2nd generation have very low \u201canti-cholinergic effect\u201d a property which allows anti-histamines to help with coughing and sneezing. The sedative properties of anti-histamines are due to its ability to cross over into the brain. 2nd generation do not penetrate into the brain as well as 1st generation, thereby they cause less sedation, if any at all.\u00a0 Most 2nd generations are used in allergy products. One important consideration is the ability of anti-histamines to help with runny noses.\u00a0 Anti-histamines are of minimal use in OTC cough and cold products \u2013 despite the plethora of products which they are in. Anti-histamines help with runny noses that are brought on as a result of HISTAMINE RELEASE \u2013 as in the incidence of allergies. With respect to the flu, a runny nose is predominantly caused by the VIRUS and NOT histamine release. The antihistamines do block mucus fluid produced in the nose \u2013 however this fluid production is beneficial in the case of a common cold; the nasal secretions acts as part of the body\u2019s mechanisms to clear the virus via the nasal mucus. The same concept holds true for antihistamines ability to manage sneezing due to a cold.\nAntitussive\nDextromethrophan is the only OTC cough product available which helps to suppress. 1st generation anti-histamines, specifically diphenhydramine, also act as antitussives, however they are not considered first line. Products with DM in the name typically contain dextromethrophan.\nExpectorants (Protussives)\nGuaifenesin relieves coughs with mucus production. The combination of an expectorant and amble amounts of water will help to clear lungs of mucus.\nSore Throat\nLozenges typically contain one of two products, or combine both to sooth an irritated throat. The first one is an anesthetic (i.e benzocaine) which numbs the throat. The other is an antibacterial (i.e phenol) to protect against infection.\u00a0 Lozenges provide short term relief. Another simple remedy is to gargle with luke warm salt water.\nFever/Aches/Pains\nIn general all antipyretics and analgesics will help provide relief from these symptoms. Examples include aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. One product may be preferred based on patients medical history (i.e history of liver failure, hypertension) or prior experience. Typically aspirin is not recommended to children for fevers due to risk of Reye\u2019s Syndrom. To treat children with fever consider using acetaminophen.\nWHAT OTC COUGH & COLD PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE?\nMEDICATIONS\n"}], [{"score": 552.45215, "uuid": "2b237429-4d4e-56bf-ac2b-33b9323a8f26", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1315wb-74-28343", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/Sinusitis", "page_rank": 1.1789629e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Sinusitis Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Adults most often choose <em>aspirin</em>, <em>ibuprofen</em> (Advil), <em>or</em> acetaminophen (Tylenol). * Acetaminophen (Tylenol) <em>or</em> <em>ibuprofen</em> (usually Advil <em>or</em> Motrin) <em>is</em> the pain reliever of choice <em>in</em> <em>children</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Recurrent acute and chronic sinusitis tend to take the following course:\nAny of the sinusitis symptoms listed previously may be present\nSymptoms are more vague and generalized than acute sinusitis\nFever may be absent or just low grade\nSymptoms of sinusitis last 12 weeks or longer\nSymptoms occur throughout the year, even during nonallergy seasons\nSite-Specific Symptoms\nSpecific symptoms may indicate which sinus is involved.\nFrontal sinusitis causes:\nPain across the lower forehead.\nSymptoms are worse when lying on the back\nMaxillary sinusitis causes:\nPain over the cheeks that may travel to the teeth\nHard palate in the mouth sometimes becomes swollen\nSymptoms are worse when head is upright\nEthmoid sinusitis causes:\nPain behind the eyes and sometimes redness and tenderness in the area across the top of the nose\nSymptoms are worse when coughing, straining, or lying on the back\nSphenoid sinusitis:\nRarely occurs by itself; when it does, the pain may be felt behind the eyes, across the forehead, or in the face\nSymptoms are worse when lying on the back or bending forward\nOther Causes of Sinusitis Symptoms\nIt is often difficult to tell when a viral infection converts to a bacterial infection. Studies have found that 40 - 85% of patients with the common cold show signs of inflamed sinuses on x-rays or CT scans. A cold, however, unlike sinusitis, typically clears up without treatment within a week. (Only about 0.5 - 2% of adults with viral colds or flus actually develop bacterial infections.)\nAllergies. Symptoms of both sinusitis and allergic rhinitis include nasal obstruction and congestion. The conditions often occur together. People with allergies and no sinus infection may have:\nThin, clear, and runny nasal discharge\nItchy nose, eyes, or throat (do not occur with bacterial sinusitis)\nRecurrent sneezing\nSymptoms of allergies appear only during exposure to allergens\nMigraine and Other Headaches. Many primary headaches, particularly migraine or cluster, may closely resemble sinus headache. Migraine and sinus headaches may even coexist in many cases. Sinus headaches are usually more generalized than migraines, but it is often difficult to tell them apart, particularly if headache is the only symptom of sinusitis.\nTrigeminal Neuralgia. In some cases, headache that persists after successful treatment of chronic sinusitis may be due to neuralgia (nerve-related pain) in the face. This condition requires specific drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants or carbamazepine. Trials using such drugs may identify patients with neuralgia and help avoid unnecessary invasive treatments for chronic sinusitis.\nOther Conditions. A number of other conditions can mimic sinusitis. They include:\nDental problems\nA foreign object in the nasal passage\nTemporal arteritis (headache caused by inflamed arteries in the head)\nPersistent upper respiratory tract infections\nTemporomandibular disorders (problems in the joints and muscles of the jaw hinges)\nVasomotor rhinitis, a condition in which the nasal passages become congested in response to irritants or stress. It often occurs in pregnant women.\nBack to Top\nComplications\nBacterial sinusitis is nearly always harmless (although uncomfortable and sometimes even very painful). If an episode becomes severe, antibiotics generally eliminate further problems. In rare cases, however, sinusitis can be very serious.\nOsteomyelitis. Adolescent males with acute frontal sinusitis are at particular risk for severe problems. One important complication is infection of the bones (osteomyelitis) of the forehead and other facial bones. In such cases, the patient usually experiences headache, fever, and a soft swelling over the bone known as Pott's puffy tumor.\nInfection of the Eye Socket. Infection of the eye socket, or orbital infection, which causes swelling and subsequent drooping of the eyelid, is a rare but serious complication of ethmoid sinusitis. In these cases, the patient loses movement in the eye, and pressure on the optic nerve can lead to vision loss, which is sometimes permanent. Fever and severe illness are usually present.\nBlood Clot. Another danger, although rare, from ethmoid or frontal sinusitis are blood clots. If a blood clot forms in the sinus area around the front and top of the face, symptoms are similar to orbital infection. In addition, the pupil may be fixed and dilated. Although symptoms usually begin on one side of the head, the process usually spreads to both sides.\nBrain Infection. The most dangerous complication of sinusitis, particularly frontal and sphenoid sinusitis, is the spread of infection by anaerobic bacteria to the brain, either through the bones or blood vessels. Abscesses, meningitis, and other life-threatening conditions may result. In such cases, the patient may experience mild personality changes, headache, altered consciousness, visual problems, and, finally, seizures, coma, and death.\nIncreased Asthma Severity\nThe relationship between sinusitis and asthma is unclear. A number of theories have been proposed for a causal or shared association between sinusitis and asthma. Successful treatment of both allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis in children who also have asthma may reduce symptoms of asthma. It is particularly important to treat any coexisting bacterial sinusitis in people with asthma. They might not respond to asthma treatments unless the infection is cleared up first.\nEffects on Quality of Life\nPain, fatigue, and other symptoms of chronic sinusitis can have significant effects on the quality of life. This condition can cause emotional distress, impair normal activity, and reduce attendance at work or school. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, the average patient with sinusitis misses about 4 work days a year, and sinusitis is one of the top 10 medical conditions that most adversely affect American employers.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nPatients should see a doctor if they have sinusitis symptoms that do not clear up within a few days, are severe, or are accompanied by high fever or acute illness. However, only one-half to two-thirds of patients with such symptoms actually have sinusitis. Some experts complain that too many patients are diagnosed with true sinusitis and given unnecessary antibiotics when their symptoms would actually resolve easily in days with over-the-counter medications or no drugs at all. Others believe that true sinusitis is often mistakenly diagnosed as an allergy and not treated, which could lead to serious illness.\nThe first goal in diagnosing sinusitis is to rule out other possible causes of symptoms, and then determine:\nThe site where the infection has occurred\nWhether the condition is acute or chronic\nThe organism causing the infection (if possible)\nDiagnostic Approach to Acute Sinusitis\nMedical History. The patient should describe all symptoms such as nasal discharge and specific pain in the face and head, including eye and tooth pain.\nAfter assessing symptoms, the doctor should take a thorough medical history of the patient:\nAny history of allergies or headaches\nRecent upper respiratory infection (colds, flus, infection)\nHistory of sinusitis episodes that is unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. (In such cases, the doctor will usually diagnose chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and refer the patient to a specialist for more advanced testing.)\nExposure to cigarette smoke or other environmental pollutants\nRecent travel\nRecent dental procedures, particularly if there is pain toward the back of the mouth\nMedications being taken (particularly decongestants)\nAny known structural abnormalities in the nose and face\nInjury to the head or face\nHistory of medical conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia, which can produce tender areas in the face or sinus regions and nonspecific symptoms of ill health\nAny family history of allergies, immune disorders, cystic fibrosis, or immotile cilia syndrome\nIn small children with sinusitis, whether they attend a day care center or nursery school\nPhysical Examination\nThe doctor will press the forehead and cheekbones to check for tenderness and check for other signs of sinusitis, including yellow to yellow-green nasal discharge. The doctor will also check the inside of the nasal passages using a device with a bright light to check the mucus and look for any structural abnormalities.\nLaboratory Tests\nIn some cases, tests may be used to detect that presence of immune factors in sinus tissues that would suggest persistent inflammation. Such findings would strongly suggest a chronic or allergic condition. In 2005, a new laboratory test became available for diagnosing chronic sinusitis. The CRS Fungal Profile tests mucus samples for eosinophil major basic protein (a protein involved in allergic and inflammatory reactions) and a type of fungi. However, more research is necessary before results from this test, and related tests, can be used to start treatment with antifungal medications.\nNasal Endoscopy (Rhinoscopy)\nNasal endoscopy, or rhinoscopy, is now used for diagnosing chronic and recurrent acute sinusitis and for differentiating between allergies and true acute sinusitis. It involves the insertion of a flexible tube into the nasal passage and the use of a fiberoptic light that enables the doctor to see inside the sinuses. Endoscopy allows detection of even very small abnormalities in the sinuses. It can determine whether surgery is necessary and if medications are having any effect. Bacterial cultures can also be taken from samples removed using endoscopy. (Endoscopy is also used for treating sinusitis.)\nImaging Techniques\nComputer Tomography. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the best method for viewing the paranasal sinuses. There is little relationship, however, between symptoms in most patients and findings of abnormalities on a CT scan. CT scans are recommended for acute sinusitis only if there is a severe infection, complications, or a high risk for complications. CT scans are useful for diagnosing chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and for surgeons as a guide during surgery. They show inflammation and swelling and the extent of the infection, including in deeply hidden air chambers missed by x-rays and nasal endoscopy. Often, they can detect the presence of fungal infections.\nX-Rays. Until the availability of endoscopy and CT scans, x-rays were commonly used. They are not as accurate, however, in identifying abnormalities in the sinuses. For example, more than one x-ray is needed for diagnosing frontal and sphenoid sinusitis. X-rays do not detect ethmoid sinusitis at all. This area can be the primary site of an infection that has spread to the maxillary or frontal sinuses.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not as effective as CT in defining the paranasal anatomy and therefore is not typically used to image the sinuses for suspected sinusitis. MRI is also more expensive than CT. However, it can help rule out fungal sinusitis and may help differentiate between inflammatory disease, malignant tumors, and complications within the skull. It may also be useful for showing soft tissue involvement.\nSinus Puncture and Bacterial Culture\nSinus puncture with bacterial culture is the gold standard for diagnosing a bacterial sinus infection. It is invasive, however, and is performed only when antibiotics have not worked. Sinus puncture involves using a needle to withdraw a small amount of fluid from the sinuses. It requires a local anesthetic and is performed by a specialist. The fluid is then cultured to determine what type of bacteria is causing sinusitis.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent sinusitis is to avoid colds and influenza. If you are unable to avoid them, the next best way to prevent sinusitis is to effectively treat colds and influenza.\nGood Hygiene and Preventing Transmission\nColds and flu are spread primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes near someone else. A very common method for transmitting a cold is by shaking hands. Everyone should always wash their hands before eating and after going outside. Ordinary soap is sufficient. Waterless hand cleaners that contain an alcohol-based gel are also effective for every day use and may even kill cold viruses. (They are less effective, however, if extreme hygiene is required. In such cases, alcohol-based rinses are needed.) Antibacterial soaps add little protection, particularly against viruses. In fact, one study suggests that common liquid dish washing soaps are up to 100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is known to cause pneumonia. Wiping surfaces with a solution that contains one part bleach to 10 parts water is very effective in killing viruses.\nVaccines\nInfluenza Vaccine. Vaccines against influenza use inactivated (not live) viruses. Because influenza viruses change from year to year, influenza vaccines are redesigned annually to match the anticipated viral strains. Experts recommend that people receive annual influenza vaccinations in October or November. People who should definitely be vaccinated include: all adults 65 years or older; children age 6 months to 5 years; other adults or children who are at high risk for developing serious medical complications from influenza; health care workers and others who care for individuals who are at high risk for influenza complications. However, annual influenza vaccination is safe and appropriate for all children older than 6 months and adults. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #94: Colds and influenza .]\nPneumococcal Vaccines. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against S. pneumoniae (also called pneumococcal) bacteria, the most common bacterial cause of respiratory infections. There are two effective vaccines available, one called a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax, Pnu-Immune) for adults and a 7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) for infants and young children. Experts are now recommending that more people, including healthy elderly people, be given the pneumococcal vaccine, particularly in light of the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #90: Immunizations .]\nTreatment\nGeneral Treatment Approaches\nThe primary objectives for treatment of sinusitis are reduction of swelling, eradication of infection, draining of the sinuses, and ensuring that the sinuses remain open. Fewer than half of patients reporting symptoms of sinusitis need aggressive treatment. Home remedies can be very useful.\nTreatment of Acute Sinusitis.\nSupport treatment with only saline nasal irrigation, decongestants, antihistamines, and expectorants are appropriate for a minimum of 7 - 10 days for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, and may be used for longer.\nAntibiotics are not helpful for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, so they should not be prescribed for at least the first 7 days.\nTreatment of Chronic Sinusitis.\nA broad-spectrum antibiotic (one that can eliminate a wide range of bacteria) may be helpful. Some patients benefit from prolonged therapy.\nA corticosteroid nasal spray. Some doctors also recommend oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone) for patients who do not respond to nasal corticosteroids or for those patients who have nasal polyps. Prednisone is also used for patients who have allergic fungal sinusitis.\nSaline nasal irrigation is often needed on an ongoing basis.\nIf the condition dramatically improves after 1 - 2 months, antibiotics are stopped. The patient should continue with both the steroid and saline nasal solutions. If there is no improvement after this time, surgery may be considered. For some people with chronic sinusitis, however, the condition is not curable, and the goal of treatment is to improve the quality of life.\nA thorough diagnostic work-up should be performed to rule out any underlying conditions, including but not limited to allergies, asthma, any immune problems, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, and structural problems in the nasal passages. If a primary trigger for chronic sinusitis can be identified, it should be treated or controlled if possible.\nHydration\nHome remedies that open and hydrate sinuses may, indeed, be the only treatment necessary for mild sinusitis that is not accompanied by signs of acute infection.\nDrinking plenty of fluids and getting lots of rest when needed is still the best bit of advice to ease the discomforts of the common cold. Water is the best fluid and helps lubricate the mucous membranes. (There is NO evidence that drinking milk will increase or worsen mucus, although milk is a food and should not serve as fluid replacement.)\nChicken soup does, indeed, help congestion and aches. The hot steam from the soup may be its chief advantage, although laboratory studies have actually reported that ingredients in the soup may have anti-inflammatory effects. In fact, any hot beverage may have similar soothing effects from steam. Ginger tea, fruit juice, and hot tea with honey and lemon may all be helpful.\nSpicy foods that contain hot peppers or horseradish may help clear sinuses.\nInhaling steam 2 - 4 times a day is extremely helpful, costs nothing, and requires no expensive equipment. The patient should sit comfortably and lean over a bowl of boiling hot water (no one should ever inhale steam from water as it boils) while covering the head and the bowl with a towel so the steam remains under the cloth. The steam should be inhaled continuously for 10 minutes. A mentholated or other aromatic preparation may be added to the water. Long, steamy showers, vaporizers, and facial saunas are alternatives.\nNasal Wash\nA nasal wash can be helpful for removing mucus from the nose. A saline solution can be purchased at a drug store or made at home. (Mix 1 teaspoon of table salt with a pinch of baking soda in 2 cups of warm water.) Perform the nasal wash several times a day. Researchers have reported that daily irrigation of the nasal passages with a hypertonic saline solution relieves sinusitis symptoms and also reduces antibiotic use and the occurrence of acute exacerbations. Patients in the study had 72% fewer sinus infections, a 69% improvement in breathing, and they reduced medication usage by more than half.\nA simple method for administering a nasal wash is:\nLean over the sink head down.\nPour some solution into the palm of the hand and inhale it through the nose, one nostril at a time.\nSpit out the remaining solution.\nGently blow the nose.\nThe solution may also be inserted into the nose using a large rubber ear syringe, available at a pharmacy. In this case the process is:\nLean over the sink head down.\nInsert only the tip of the syringe into one nostril.\nGently squeeze the bulb several times to wash the nasal passage.\nThen press the bulb firmly enough so that the solution passes into the mouth.\nThe process should be repeated in the other nostril.\nAntibiotic Use in the Treatment of Sinusitis\nOverview on Antibiotics and Their Overuse. Sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for antibiotic prescriptions. And, there is much evidence that antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed for many patients:\nMost acute sinusitis cases clear up on their own.\nAntibiotics generally help only a very small number of children with persistent nasal discharge for at least 20 days. Even when antibiotics are helpful, benefits are modest in reducing duration of the infection.\nThe intense and widespread use of antibiotics (not only for sinusitis but also for ear infections and other upper respiratory tract infections) has led to a serious global problem, which is bacterial resistance to common antibiotics.\nWhen to Use Antibiotics. Because up to 70% of sinusitis cases resolve on their own, doctors generally wait 7 - 14 days before prescribing antibiotics. However, antibiotics may be prescribed sooner if severe symptoms develop. These symptoms include:\nFever greater than 39\u00b0 C (102.2\u00b0 F)\nFacial pain or headache\nSevere swelling around the eyes\nChronic sinusitis is often the result of damage to the mucous membrane from a past, untreated acute sinus infection. The aerobic and anaerobic bacteria present in chronic sinusitis are often different from those that cause the acute form. The role of antibiotic treatment for chronic sinusitis is controversial. Special types of antibiotics may be used, and treatment may be needed for a longer time.\nSome patients with chronic sinusitis may need intravenous antibiotic therapy, particularly those with underlying medical disorders that can worsen their condition. This therapy is typically given 2 weeks before surgery and continued for about a month afterwards.\nAntibiotic Regimens.\nThe standard first-line antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis is a 10 - 14 day course of amoxicillin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an alternative choice.\nFor more complicated illnesses (chronic illness, chronic sinusitis, symptoms lasting longer than 30 days, children in day care or younger than 2 years old, smokers, recent antibiotic use, or unresponsiveness to initial antibiotic course), the doctor may prescribe a different type of antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporin, or a macrolide.\nIf the patient does not respond after 21 - 28 days, the doctor may switch to another broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime. Other choices include clarithromycin or azithromycin (macrolides) or levofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone).\nSide Effects of Antibiotics. Most antibiotics have the following side effects (although specific antibiotics may have other side effects or fewer of the standard ones):\nThe most common side effect for nearly all antibiotics is gastrointestinal distress.\nAntibiotics double the risk for vaginal infections in women. Taking supplements of acidophilus or eating yogurt with active cultures may help restore healthy bacteria that offset the risk for such infections.\nAllergic reactions can also occur with all antibiotics but are most common with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa. These reactions can range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe, even life-threatening, anaphylactic shock.\nCertain drugs, including some over-the-counter medications, interact with antibiotics; patients should inform the doctor of all medications they are taking and of any drug allergies.\nManaging Sinusitis in Patients with Allergies\nPatients often have various combinations of allergies, sinusitis, and asthma. Treating each condition is important for improving them all. In addition to decongestants, pain relievers, and expectorants, other remedies are available for people who suffer from nonbacterial sinusitis during allergy season.\nAnti-Inflammatory Drugs. Nasal spray corticosteroids (commonly called steroids) are important for reducing the inflammatory response in the nasal passages and airways. They are important in the treatment of asthma and are now considered to be the most effective measure for preventing allergy attacks. Leukotriene-antagonists are also useful for sinusitis symptoms.\nAntihistamines. Antihistamine tablets relieve sneezing and itching and can prevent nasal congestion before an allergy attack. Many brands are available by prescription and over the counter. Because they thicken mucus and make it harder to drain out from the sinuses, they should not be used for sinusitis.\nImmunotherapy. Immunotherapy, commonly referred to as allergy shots, may be considered for patients with severe seasonal allergies that do not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy is the only treatment that affects the cause of allergies. In one year-long study using immunotherapy, over half of young patients participating experienced improvement in overall sinusitis symptoms, and nearly all felt better in general. Immunotherapy also may prevent asthma and the development of new allergies in children. Newer immunotherapeutic approaches using specially designed antibodies and vaccines are also showing promise.\nAll drug treatments have side effects, some very unpleasant and, rarely, serious. Patients may need to try different drugs until they find one that relieves symptoms without producing excessively distressing side effects.\nEmergency Treatment\nPatients who show signs that infection has spread beyond the nasal sinuses into the bone, brain, or other parts of the skull need emergency care. High dose antibiotics are administered intravenously, and emergency surgery is almost always necessary in such cases.\nSevere Fungal Sinusitis. Sinusitis caused by severe fungal infections is a medical emergency. Treatment is aggressive surgery, and high-dose antifungal chemotherapy with a drug such as amphotericin B can be life saving. The use of high-pressure oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen) is showing promise as additional therapy for potentially deadly fungal infections.\nMedications\nMedications for Mild Pain and Fever Reduction\nMany people take medications to reduce mild pain and fever. Adults most often choose aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or acetaminophen (Tylenol).\nThe following are recommendations for children:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (usually Advil or Motrin) is the pain reliever of choice in children. Most pediatricians advise such medications for children who run fevers over 101\u00b0 F.\nAspirin and aspirin-containing products are virtually never recommended for children or adolescents. Reye syndrome, a very serious condition, has been associated with aspirin use in children who have flu symptoms or chicken pox.\nDecongestants\nDecongestants are drugs that help reduce nasal congestion. They are available in both pill and nasal forms. However, decongestants will not cure sinusitis. Nasal decongestants may actually worsen sinusitis by increasing sinus inflammation. Due to the lack of evidence for the benefit of nasal decongestants in treating sinusitis, the FDA ruled ordered manufacturers of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant products to remove from their labeling all references to sinusitis.\nYour doctor may still recommend that you take either an OTC or prescription nasal decongestant to help relieve blockage symptoms associated with sinusitis. If you think you have sinusitis, check with your doctor before taking a decongestant. Do not try to treat sinusitis by yourself.\nNasal Decongestants. Nasal decongestants come in both long-acting and short-acting forms. The effects of short-acting decongestants last about 4 hours; long-acting decongestants last 6 - 12 hours. The active ingredients in nasal decongestants include oxymetazoline, xylometazoline, and phenylephrine.\nTips for Use. The following precautions are important for people taking nasal decongestants:\nWhen using a nasal spray, spray each nostril once. Wait a minute to allow absorption into the mucosal tissues, and then spray again.\nDo not share droppers and inhalers with other people.\nDiscard sprayers, inhalers, or other decongestant delivery devices when the medication is no longer needed. Over time, these devices can become reservoirs for bacteria.\nDiscard the medicine if it becomes cloudy or unclear.\nOral Decongestants. Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are the only decongestants taken by mouth that are currently available over-the-counter (OTC) in the United States. It decreases the volume of mucus in the nose, as well as within the Eustachian tubes. Many brands of OTC oral decongestants are available. A common brand is Sudafed. Oral decongestants such as Sudafed can also be helpful for relieving cough associated with postnasal drip.\nSide Effects of Decongestants. Decongestants have certain adverse effects, which are more apt to occur in oral than nasal decongestants, including:\nAgitation and nervousness\nDrowsiness (particularly with decongestants taken by mouth and in combination with alcohol)\nChanges in heart rate and blood pressure\nAvoid combinations of oral decongestants with alcohol or certain drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and sedatives\nSlow urination in men with enlarged prostate glands.\nIndividuals at Risk for Complications from Decongestants. People who may be at higher risk for complications are those with certain medical conditions, including disorders that make blood vessels highly susceptible to contraction. Such conditions include:\nHeart disease\n"}, {"score": 493.99472, "uuid": "2605a0e6-3a51-5caa-b6b4-038d3721933d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300wb-07-10340", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/DiseasesandConditions/item/Gout", "page_rank": 1.191709e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Gout Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "<em>aspirin</em>, cyclosporine, <em>or</em> levodopa o Walking <em>or</em> even the weight of bed sheets may be unbearable o Attacks often begin late <em>at</em> night <em>or</em> early <em>in</em> the morning and may wake you up * Red, shiny, tense skin over the affected area, which may peel after a few days * Chills and mild <em>fever</em>, loss of appetite,", "explanation": null, "document": "Confusion or bizarre sensation (in some higher-potency NSAIDs, notably indomethacin)\nKidney damage\nNSAIDs can cause kidney problems, especially in the elderly and those with kidney disease. When caught early enough, these problems generally resolve if the drugs are stopped. Any sudden weight gain or swelling should be reported to a physician. Anyone with kidney disease should avoid these drugs.\nPatients with diabetes who take hypoglycemics by mouth may need to adjust their medication dosage if they also take NSAIDs, because of possible harmful interactions between these classes of drugs.\nNSAID-Induced Ulcers and Gastrointestinal Bleeding\nLong-term use of NSAIDs is a common cause of ulcers. NSAID-related bleeding and stomach problems may be responsible for over 100,000 hospital admissions and over 15,000 deaths each year. Because there are usually no gastrointestinal symptoms from NSAIDs until bleeding begins, health care providers cannot predict which patients taking these drugs will develop bleeding.\nThose at high risk for NSAID-related bleeding include the elderly, anyone with a history of an ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, patients with serious heart conditions, those who drink too much alcohol, and persons on certain medications, such anticoagulants (blood thinners), corticosteroids, or bisphosphonates (drugs used for osteoporosis).\nPreventing NSAID-Related Ulcers. Switching to alternative pain relievers is the first step in preventing or healing ulcers caused by NSAIDs. If people cannot change drugs, they should use the lowest NSAID dose possible.\nIn addition, medications are available that may help prevent ulcers in people who need to take NSAIDs. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the first drug of choice for preventing ulcers in high-risk individuals. They have been shown to reduce NSAID-ulcer rates by as much as 80% compared with no treatment. Types of these drugs include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (AcipHex ), and pantoprazole (Protonix). Prevacid is the first proton-pump inhibitor specifically approved for protecting against ulcers in chronic NSAID users.\nArthrotec is a combination of an ulcer-protective drug called misoprostol and the NSAID diclofenac. It too may reduce the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. The drug can cause miscarriages, however, and should not be taken by women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.\nColchicine\nColchicine is a derivative of the autumn crocus (also called the meadow saffron). It has been used against gout attacks for centuries. It is highly effective, although it is no longer the first drug of choice because of its frequent, unpleasant, and sometimes very serious side effects.\nColchicine may be given to a healthy adult within 48 hours of an attack. It should not be used by elderly patients or those with kidney, liver, or bone marrow disorders. It can also affect fertility and should not be used during pregnancy. The drug can cause gastrointestinal side effects at high dose, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Low doses do not pose as high a risk for gastrointestinal symptoms, and can prevent further attacks, including attacks in patients who are starting anti-hyperuricemic therapies.\nColchicine may be taken by mouth or given by an intravenous line. Those who take it by mouth need doses every hour until either symptoms improve or side effects develop. Improvement should be seen by the tenth dose. It usually eliminates the pain of an acute attack within 48 hours. The intravenous route has some serious side effects, however, and poses an increased risk for injury to the kidney, liver, central nervous system, and bone marrow.\nThe antibiotic erythromycin, or H2 blockers such as famotidine (Pepcid AC), cimetidine (Tagamet), or ranitidine (Zantac) may intensify the gastrointestinal side effects of colchicine.\nWarning Note: Overdose of colchicine can be dangerous, and there have even been reports of death. The drug may also suppress blood cell production and cause nerve and muscular injury in certain people, sometimes even in those not taking high doses.\nCorticosteroids\nCorticosteroids may be used in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs and they may be particularly beneficial for elderly patients. Injections into an affected joint provide effective relief for many patients, but this is not useful for patients who have multiple affected joints. Steroids taken by mouth may be used for patients who cannot take NSAIDs or colchicine and who have gout in more than one joint. Corticosteroids include triamcinolone and prednisone.\nTreatment: Preventing Attacks\nDuring Intercritical Gout\nAfter an acute attack some patients remain at high risk for another attack for several weeks during the intercritical period. Such patients include those with kidney insufficiency or those with congestive heart failure who are on diuretics. Low doses of colchicine or NSAIDs may be used to during this period for prevention of another attack. They should be taken in low doses for 1 - 2 months after an attack, or for longer periods in patients who have experienced frequent attacks.\nAntihyperuricemic Medicines for Chronic Gout\nAntihyperuricemic medications reduce levels of uric acid in the body. The decision whether to use an antihyperuricemic medicine and at what point is not entirely clear. Some health care providers do not prescribe them if hyperuricemia is mild, or until a patient has had two gout attacks. Others prescribe them immediately after a single attack. Most of the time, antihyperuricemic therapy means taking a drug routinely throughout life, which many people find difficult.\nTreatment for hyperuricemia that causes no symptoms is not recommended. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia often does not lead to gout or other health problems. In addition, the drugs used to treat it are expensive and carry certain risks. In unusual circumstances treatment may be justified, for example in patients with very high uric acid levels that threaten the kidney or those with a personal or strong family history of gout, kidney stones, or kidney damage.\nBefore treatment, some experts recommend a 24-hour urine collection sample in patients with frequent gout attacks to determine whether they are over-producers or under-excreters of uric acid. Also, before starting one of these drugs, any previous acute attack should be completely controlled and the joints should not be inflamed. Some health care providers prefer to wait about a month after an attack.\nLow doses of NSAIDs or colchicine are used during several months after introducing anti-hyperuricemic therapies to prevent gout attacks. It should be noted that NSAIDs, particularly aspirin and similar drugs, reduce the effectiveness of uricosurics. These are drugs given to under-excreters of uric acid (see below). Patients taking uricosurics should avoid NSAIDs, if possible.\nLong-term treatment of hyperuricemia may be recommended for people who have:\nA risk for tophaceous gout\nHad more than two or three acute attacks of gout in the past\nUnusually severe attacks, or attacks that affect more than one joint\nJoint damage from gout, as shown on x-rays\nHyperuricemia caused by an identifiable inborn metabolic deficiency\nUricosurics. These drugs prevent the kidney from reabsorbing uric acid, and therefore increase the amount excreted in the urine. They are appropriate when gout is caused by under-excretion of uric acid, which occurs in about 80% of gout cases. They are not used for patients with reduced kidney function or those with tophaceous gout. Uricosurics are usually the choice for preventing gout in the following patients:\nThose under 60 years of age\nThose with normal diets\nThose who have normal kidney function\nThose who have no risk of kidney stones\nUricosuric drug candidates should produce no more than 700 - 800 mg of uric acid in the urine over a 24-hour period.\nProbenecid (Benemid, Probalan) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane) are the standard uricosurics. A more potent uricosuric, benzbromarone, may work for people with severe tophaceous gout and kidney impairment when other drugs do not. In some studies, benzbromarone was equal to or even more effective than allopurinol, another type of antihyperuricemic drug. Because benzbromarone can cause liver failure in some patients, it is available in the U.S. only with special authorization. A uricosuric combined with allopurinol may be beneficial in some cases.\nProbenecid is taken two to three times a day, and sulfinpyrazone begins at twice a day and increases to three or four times daily. The initial doses should be low and gradually increased. Probenecid combined with colchicine is more effective than probenecid alone, but everyone responds differently, so the dose should be carefully individualized.\nThe possible side effects of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone include skin rashes, gastrointestinal problems, anemia, and kidney stone formation. To help reduce acidity and the risk for kidney stones, patients should drink plenty of fluids (ideally water, not caffeinated beverages). Sodium bicarbonate supplemented by acetazolamide can also reduce acidity and the risk for stones.\nNSAIDs, particularly aspirin, as well as other salicylate drugs, interfere with uricosuric drugs and reduce effectiveness. Patients who require minor pain relief should instead take acetaminophen (Tylenol). Uricosurics interact with many other drugs, and a patient should be sure to inform their health care provider of all medications they are taking.\nPeople who take these drugs should have normal kidney function. This therapy may not be as beneficial in many elderly patients, who often have some kidney insufficiency.\nAllopurinol (Lopurin, Zyloprim). Allopurinol blocks uric acid production. It is the drug most often used in long-term gout treatment for older patients and those who overproduce uric acid.\nAllopurinol is taken by mouth once a day in doses of 100 - 600 mg, depending on the patient's response to treatment. When it is first used, allopurinol can trigger further attacks of gout. Therefore, during the first months (or longer) of therapy, the patient also takes an NSAID or colchicine to reduce that possibility.\nAllopurinol has positive effects on \"bad\" cholesterol levels, so it may be better than other drugs for patients with both gout and coronary artery disease.\nSide effects, which can be severe, include:\nRash\n"}, {"score": 486.47598, "uuid": "511901ab-5229-5d7a-8069-cb7323b2eb6e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-25-31129", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/DiseasesandConditions/item/cc8115f059259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____", "page_rank": 1.232188e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Anemia Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Up to 20% of American <em>children</em> and 80% of <em>children</em> <em>in</em> developing countries become anemic <em>at</em> some point during their childhood and adolescence.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)\nIrritability and other mood disturbances\nPale skin (however, healthy-looking skin color does not rule out anemia if a patient has risk factors and other symptoms of anemia)\nMental confusion\nLoss of sexual drive\nUnusual Symptoms\nPica. One odd symptom, which in some cases is also a cause of iron deficiency, is pica. This is the habit of eating unusual substances, such as ice (called pagophagia), clay, cardboard, foods that crunch (such as raw potatoes, carrots, or celery), or raw starch. The pica often stops, particularly in children, when iron supplements are given. Pica is difficult to detect because patients are often ashamed to admit to such cravings.\nFrequent Breath Holding. Children who hold their breath frequently when angry or upset, even to the point of fainting, may be iron-deficient.\nSymptoms of Megaloblastic Anemia and its Causes\nSymptoms of Megaloblastic Anemia. The symptoms of megaloblastic anemia from vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiencies include not only standard anemic symptoms but also:\nInflammation of the mouth (stomatitis)\nInflammation of the tongue (glossitis), which involves shrinkage at the surface and edges of the tongue\nOver time, psychiatric and neurologic problems develop. Vitamin B12 deficiencies cause neurologic symptoms (numbness and tingling, depression, memory loss, and irritability), and folate deficiency may result in depression and dementia (in severe cases).\nSymptoms of Pernicious Anemia. Early neurologic symptoms of pernicious anemia are due to B12 deficiency. They include numbness and tingling, depression, memory loss, and irritability. Advanced nerve damage can cause loss of balance and staggering, confusion, dementia, spasticity, loss of bladder control, and erectile dysfunction. Folic acid deficiency does not cause neurologic damage, although people with this deficiency can be irritable, forgetful, and experience personality changes.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nThe first step in any diagnosis is a physical examination to determine if the patient has symptoms of anemia and any complications. Because anemia may be the first symptom of a serious illness, determining its cause is very important. This may be difficult, particularly in the elderly, malnourished, or people with chronic diseases, whose anemia may be caused by one or more factors. A detailed medical, personal, and dietary history should report:\nAny family or personal history of anemia\nA history of gallbladder disease, jaundice, or enlarged spleen\nHeavy menstrual bleeding in women\nAny occurrence of blood in the stool or other signs of internal bleeding. (Even if the patient has not observed any bleeding, nonvisible blood may be present, so a rectal exam and stool test are essential.)\nAny dietary history, particularly in people who are elderly, poor, or both\nThe doctor should examine the patient carefully, especially checking for swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged spleen, and pale skin and nail color.\nA complete blood count (CBC) blood test is performed to determine the presence of anemia. Other iron status blood tests are also used.\nComplete Blood Count (CBC)\nA complete blood count (CBC) is a panel of tests that measures red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. For diagnosis of anemia, the CBC provides critical information on the size, volume, and shape of red blood cells (erythrocytes). CBC results include measurements of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume.\nHemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-bearing and oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. The normal value for hemoglobin varies by age and gender. Anemia is generally considered when hemoglobin concentrations fall below 11 g/dL for pregnant women, 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women, and 13 g/dL for men.\nThe severity of anemia is categorized by the following hemoglobin concentration ranges:\nMild anemia is considered when hemoglobin is between 9.5 - 13.0 g/dL\nModerate anemia is considered when hemoglobin is between 8.0 - 9.5 g/dL\nSevere anemia is considered for hemoglobin concentrations below 8.0 g/dL\nHematocrit. Hematocrit is the percentage of blood composed of red blood cells. People with a high volume of plasma (the liquid portion of blood) may be anemic even if their blood count is normal because the blood cells have become diluted. Like hemoglobin, a normal hematocrit percentage depends on age and gender. Anemic ranges for hematocrit generally fall below:\nChildren ages 6 months - 5 years: Below 33%\nChildren ages 5 years - 12 years: Below 35%\nChildren ages 12 years - 15 years: Below 36%\nAdult men: Below 39%\nAdult non-pregnant women: Below 36%\nAdult pregnant women: Below 33%\nOther hemoglobin measurements such as mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) may also be calculated.\nMean Corpuscular Volume. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of red blood cells. The MCV increases when red blood cells are larger than normal (macrocytic) and decreases when red blood cells are smaller than normal (microcytic). Macrocytic cells can be a sign of anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, while microcytic cells are a sign of iron-deficiency anemia or thalassemias.\nOther Iron Status Blood Tests\nSerum Ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and helps to store iron in the body. Low levels typically mean reduced iron stores. Normal values are generally 12 - 300 ng/mL for men and 12 - 150 ng/mL for women. Lower than normal levels of ferritin are a sign of iron-deficiency anemia, while higher than normal levels may indicate hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, or anemia of chronic disease.\nSerum Iron. Serum iron measures the amount of iron in the blood. A normal serum iron is 60 - 170 mcg/dL. Lower levels may indicate iron-deficiency anemia or anemia of chronic disease, while higher levels may indicate hemolytic anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency.\nTotal Iron Binding Capacity. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) measures the level of transferrin in the blood. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. TIBC calculates how much or how little the transferrin in the body is carrying iron. A higher than normal TIBC is a sign of iron-deficiency anemia. A lower than normal level may indicate anemia of chronic disease, sickle cell, pernicious anemia, or hemolytic anemia.\nReticulocyte Count. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells, and their count reflects the rate of red blood cell production. The upper normal limit is about 100,000/mL. A low count, when bleeding isn't the cause, suggests problems in production in the bone marrow. An abnormally high count indicates that the red blood cells are being destroyed in high numbers and indicates hemolytic anemia. Recent research suggests that the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) test may be more accurate than a standard hemoglobin test for detecting iron deficiency in infants.\nVitamin Deficiencies. Tests for vitamin B12 and folate levels.\nOther Diagnostic Tests\nIf internal bleeding is suspected as the cause of anemia, the gastrointestinal tract is usually the first suspect as the source. A diagnosis in these cases can often be made if the patient has noticed blood in the stools, which can be black and tarry or red-streaked. Often, however, bleeding may be present but not visible. If so, stool tests for this hidden (occult) blood are required. Additional tests may then be needed to diagnose the precipitating condition. Endoscopy, in which a fiber optic tube is used to view into the gastrointestinal tract, is helpful in many patients, particularly when the source of bleeding is unclear. A colonoscopy may also be recommended to rule out colorectal cancer.\nIf the patient's diet suggests low iron intake and other causes cannot be established using inexpensive or noninvasive techniques, then the patient may simply be given a monthly trial of iron supplements. If the patient fails to respond, further evaluation is needed.\nDietary Factors\nIron found in foods is either in the form of heme or non-heme iron:\nHeme Iron. Foods containing heme iron are the best sources for increasing or maintaining healthy iron levels. Such foods include (in decreasing order of iron-richness) clams, oysters, organ meats, beef, pork, poultry, and fish.\nNon-Heme Iron. Non-heme iron is less well-absorbed. About 60% of the iron in meat is non-heme (although meat itself helps absorb non-heme iron). Eggs, dairy products, and iron-containing vegetables have only the non-heme form. Such vegetable products include dried beans and peas, iron-fortified cereals, bread, and pasta products, dark green leafy vegetables (chard, spinach, mustard greens, kale), dried fruits, nuts, and seeds.\nThe absorption of non-heme iron often depends on the food balances in meals. The following foods and cooking methods can enhance absorption of iron:\nMeat and fish not only contain heme iron -- the best form for maintaining stores -- but they also help absorb non-heme iron.\nIncreasing intake of vitamin-C rich foods, such as orange juice, may enhance absorption of non-heme iron, although it is not clear if it improves iron stores in iron-deficient people. In any case, vitamin-C rich foods are healthy and include broccoli, cabbage, citrus fruits, melon, tomatoes, and strawberries.\nRiboflavin (vitamin B2) may help enhance the response of hemoglobin to iron. Food sources include dairy products, liver, and dried fortified cereals.\nCooking methods can enhance iron stores. Cooking in cast iron pans and skillets can help increase the iron content of food.\nVitamins B12 and folate are important for prevention of megaloblastic anemia and for good health in general. The only natural dietary sources of B12 are animal products, such as meats, dairy products, eggs, and fish (clams and oily fish are very high in B12). As is the case with other B vitamins, however, B12 is added to commercial dried cereals. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 2.4 mcg a day. Deficiencies are rare in young people, although the elderly may have trouble absorbing natural vitamin B12 and require synthetic forms from supplements and fortified foods.\nClick the icon to see an image of sources of vitamin B12.\nFolate is best found in avocado, bananas, orange juice, cold cereal, asparagus, fruits, green, leafy vegetables, dried beans and peas, and yeast. The synthetic form, folic acid, is now added to commercial grain products. Vitamins are usually made from folic acid, which is about twice as potent as folate. The recommended daily amount of folic acid or folate for teenagers and adults is 400 mcg. Women who are pregnant need 600 mcg per day and women who are breastfeeding need 500 mcg daily.\nClick the icon to see an image of sources of folate.\nRecommended Daily Allowance for Iron\nThe Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of iron for people who are not iron deficient varies by age group and other risk factors. (Iron supplements are rarely recommended in people without evidence of iron deficiency or anemia.) The RDA recommends these daily amounts of iron:\nChildren 1 - 3 years old: 10 mg\nTeenage boys: 12 mg\nTeenage girls and premenopausal women: 15 mg\nPregnant or nursing women: 30 mg\nAdult men (up to age 50): 10 mg\nOlder men and women (over age 50): 10 mg\nPreventing Anemia in Infants and Small Children\nThe main source of iron for an infant from birth to 1 year of age is in milk, from breast milk, iron-fortified infant formula, or cereal. The best methods for preventing iron deficiency during infancy are:\nBreast-feeding and Iron-Supplemented Formulas. Mothers should be encouraged to breast-feed their babies for their first year. Up to half of the iron in breast milk is absorbed by the baby and is sufficient to prevent anemia for the first 4 - 6 months, assuming that the mother had adequate iron stores during pregnancy. Breast milk itself is low in iron, but if the mother's diet is healthy, vitamin C and lactose in the breast milk may enhance iron absorption. Breast-fed babies should have iron supplements after 4 - 6 weeks, even if they are still nursing.\nInfants who are not breast-fed should start with iron-fortified formulas (7-12 mg/L). Most doctors strongly discourage the use of low-iron formulas (less than 4.0 mg/L). Parents should discuss the best formula with their doctor. Children given iron supplements may have a slightly higher risk for diarrhea. Experts advise against cow's milk for the first year of life. When cereals are begun, they should be iron fortified.\nRecommendations for Toddlers. Toddlers who did not have iron supplements during infancy should be checked for iron deficiency. After the first year, children should be given a varied diet that is rich in sources of iron, B vitamins, and vitamin C. Milk does not contain enough iron and can decrease children's appetite for iron-rich foods. Toddlers older than 1 year should not drink more than 2 cups of milk a day. A preference for apple juice over vitamin-C rich orange juice does not reduce iron absorption in children with any otherwise healthy diet.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nOral iron supplements are the best way to restore iron levels for people who are iron deficient, but they should be used only when dietary measures have failed. However, iron supplements cannot correct anemias that are not due to iron deficiency.\nIron replacement therapy can cause gastrointestinal problems, sometimes severe ones. Excess iron may also contribute to heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Doctors generally advise against iron supplements in anyone with a healthy diet and no indications of iron deficiency anemia.\nTreatment of Anemia of Chronic Disease. In general, the best treatment for anemia of chronic diseases is treating the disease itself. In some cases, iron deficiency accompanies the condition and requires iron replacement. Erythropoietin, most often administered with intravenous iron, is used for some patients.\nOral Iron Supplements\nSupplement Forms. There are two forms of supplemental iron: ferrous and ferric. Ferrous iron is better absorbed and is the preferred form of iron tablets. Ferrous iron is available in three forms: ferrous fumarate, ferrous sulfate, and ferrous gluconate.\nThe label of an iron supplement contains information both on the tablet size (which is typically 325 mg) and the amount of elemental iron contained in the tablet (the amount of iron that is available for absorption by the body.) When selecting an iron supplement, it is important to look at the amount of elemental iron.\nA 325 mg iron supplement contains the following amounts of elemental iron depending on the type of iron:\nFerrous fumarate. 108 mg of elemental iron\nFerrous sulfate. 65 mg of elemental iron\nFerrous gluconate. 35 mg of elemental iron\nDosage. Depending on the severity of your anemia, as well as your age and weight, your doctor will recommend a dosage of 60 - 200 mg of elemental iron per day. This means taking one iron pill 2 - 3 time during the day. Make sure your doctor explains to you how many pills you should take in a day and when you should take them. Never take a double dose of iron.\nSide Effects and Safety. Common side effects of iron supplements include:\nConstipation and diarrhea are very common. They are rarely severe, although iron tablets can aggravate existing gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers and ulcerative colitis.\nNausea and vomiting may occur with high doses, but can be controlled by taking smaller amounts. Switching to ferrous gluconate may help some people with severe gastrointestinal problems.\nBlack stools are normal when taking iron tablets. In fact, if they do not turn black, the tablets may not be working effectively. This tends to be a more common problem with coated or long-acting iron tablets.\nIf the stools are tarry looking as well as black, if they have red streaks, or if cramps, sharp pains, or soreness in the stomach occur, gastrointestinal bleeding may be causing the iron deficiency and the patient should call the doctor promptly.\nAcute iron poisoning is rare in adults but can be fatal in children who take adult-strength tablets. Keep iron supplements out of the reach of children. If your child swallows an iron pill, immediately contact a poison control center.\nOther Tips for Safety and Effectiveness. Other tips for taking iron are as follows:\nFor best absorption, iron should be taken between meals. Iron may cause stomach and intestinal disturbances, however. Low doses of ferrous sulfate can be taken with food and are still absorbed but with fewer side effects.)\nDrink a full 8 ounces of fluid with an iron pill. Taking orange juice with an iron pill can help increase iron absorption. (Some doctors also recommend taking a vitamin C supplement with the iron pill.)\nIf constipation becomes a problem, take a stool softener such as docusate sodium (Colace).\nCertain medications, including antacids, can reduce iron absorption. Iron tablets may also reduce the effectiveness of other drugs, including the antibiotics tetracycline, penicillamine, and ciprofloxacin and the Parkinson's disease drugs methyldopa, levodopa, and carbidopa. At least 2 hours should elapse between doses of these drugs and iron supplements.\nAvoid taking milk, caffeine, antacids, or calcium supplements at the same time as an iron pill as they can interfere with iron absorption.\nTablets should be kept in a cool place. (Bathroom medicine cabinets may be too warm and humid, which may cause the pills to disintegrate.)\nFull recovery takes 6 - 8 weeks. Recovery will take longer in people with internal bleeding that is not under control. Iron replacement therapy must continue for about 6 months, even if anemia has been reversed. Treatment must be continued indefinitely for people with chronic bleeding; in such cases, iron levels should be closely monitored.\nIntravenous or Injected Iron\nIn some cases, iron is administered through muscular injections or intravenously. Intravenous iron has the advantage of causing less gastrointestinal discomfort and inconvenience. It may be in the form of iron dextran (Dexferrum, InFed), sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose (Ferrlecit), or iron sucrose (Venofer). Ferrlecit or Venofer are proving to be at least equally effective and safer than iron dextran.\nCandidates. The injected or intravenous forms should be limited to the following patients with iron deficiency:\nPeople with iron deficiency anemia in whom oral therapy has clearly failed.\nPatients with bleeding disorders in which blood loss continues to exceed the rate at which oral iron is absorbed.\nIn emergencies, when people need red blood cells but transfusion is not appropriate or available.\nIn people with serious gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, who cannot take iron therapy by mouth.\nPeople undergoing hemodialysis who receive supplemental erythropoietin therapy. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose (Ferrlecit) or iron sucrose (Venofer) is specifically approved as first-line therapy for these patients.\nCertain patients, even if they meet these qualifications, may not be appropriate candidates or should be monitored closely for complications. They include:\nPatients with any underlying autoimmune disease.\nMalnourished patients who also have an underlying infection.\nPatients who are at risk for iron overload.\nSide Effects. Some side effects differ depending on how the iron is administered and include the following:\nMuscular injections include pain at the site.\nIntravenous administration can cause pain in the vein, flushing, and metallic taste, all of which are brief.\nFor both methods, side effects and serious complications can include:\nBlood clots\n"}, {"score": 524.32654, "uuid": "94948413-7881-5dc5-9970-fdbe3bd97ec4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0711wb-89-04708", "target_hostname": "www.wddty.com", "target_uri": "http://www.wddty.com/colds-and-flu-keeping-well-in-the-winter-season.html", "page_rank": 1.2053023e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "Colds and flu: keeping well <em>in</em> the winter season | <em>What</em> Doctors Don&#x27;t Tell", "snippet": "So <em>reducing</em> <em>fever</em> with NSAIDs may simply prolong the agony of a cold <em>or</em> flu.", "explanation": null, "document": "email to friend Printer friendly\nMost of the magic bullets to treat colds and flu - from antibiotics to zinc lozenges - are shots in the dark and not as effective as tried-and-tested traditional remedies.\nVirtually everyone has a theory about colds and flu and, given the glut of information, it may be hard to separate the facts from plain fiction. Yet, there are data that show what makes us vulnerable to these infections, and how to stay well when the weather turns cold.\nSusceptibility and stress\nCatching the flu is not a random event. Bugs may be getting nastier (see box below), and our poorly ventilated, sometimes crowded, environments may encourage the spread of virulent viruses. But if exposure were the only factor, all of us would get sick every time we were exposed.\nIn truth, many people in a room may be exposed to a cold or flu virus, but only some become infected. Susceptibility, not exposure, is the key and is likely to be influenced by a number of things.\nPeople who have heart complaints, asthma, chronic kidney disease or diabetes, or who are taking medications (for instance, steroids) are more susceptible to colds and flu. Smokers are also more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; Am J Public Health, 1993; 83: 1277-83).\nBut predicting susceptibility in an otherwise healthy population is less straightforward. Nutritional status and exercise play a role (see boxes, pp 2 and 3) but, recently, a great deal of study has focused on the role of stress.\nThe ability of stress to alter immune function, and precipitate and aggravate infectious diseases has long been recognised (J Fla Med Assoc, 1993; 80: 409-11). Today, there is strong evidence that the single biggest risk factor that puts otherwise healthy people at risk of catching a cold may be stress.\nIn one study, after determining their stress levels by questionnaire, 394 subjects were exposed to common rhinoviruses (the virus causing the common cold). Only 27 per cent of the low-stress group showed clinical symptoms compared with 47 per cent of those at the high end of the scale (N Engl J Med, 1991; 325: 606-12).\nIn another study, 276 subjects, who had been carefully evaluated for their level of involvement in one or more of a dozen types of social ties - for example, with a spouse or partner, sibling, parent, close friend or fellow worker - were given nasal drops containing rhinoviruses.\nSusceptibility to colds was reduced as social support increased. Of those with three or less relationships, 62 per cent came down with a cold compared with only 35 per cent in those with six or more types of social support (J Am Med Assoc, 1997; 277: 1940-4).\nA repeat of that study (Health Psychol, 1998; 17: 214-23) evaluated stress more precisely (long term vs short term) as well as the severity of illness, and also measured blood levels of natural-killer (NK) cells, the immune system cells that combat infectious agents. Those stressed for more than a month had lower NK-cell activity and were 2.2 times more likely to develop colds. The biggest risk came with increased job stress.\nStressed children have a greater susceptibility to URTI and show measurable decreases in mucosal immunity (J Psychosom Res, 1997; 43: 271-8). Depression is also strongly related to catching a cold (Epidemiology, 2001; 12: 345-9).\nPrescription drugs, like antibiotics, can also increase colds/ flu susceptibility. A substantial number of GPs still prescribe antibiotics for colds/flu, even though these drugs don\u2019t work against viruses (J Am Med Assoc, 1997; 278: 901-4; J Am Med Assoc, 1998; 279: 875-7).\nAustralian doctors report that flucloxacillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, can cause cholestatic jaundice (Med J Aust, 1989; 151: 701-5), though its relation to the drug may go unrecognised because of a delayed onset (Lancet, 1992; 339: 679). Older patients and those receiving flucloxacillin for more than two weeks are particularly at risk (BMJ, 1993; 306: 233-5).\nNewer combination antibiotics such as Septrin - trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole, or co-trimoxazole - have been linked with skin rashes and blisters (Ind J Derm, 1982; 48: 207-8; Br J Dermatol, 1987; 116: 241-2; Dermatology, 1986; 172: 230-1), and a host of HIV-like symptoms, including anaemia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, numbness, convulsions, chills, fever, swollen glands, and ulcers in the mouth, eyes and urethra.\nOveruse of antibiotics also contributes to the emergence of \u2018superbugs\u2019, and can deplete the friendly gut bacteria needed to maintain good health and immunity. Clearly, when you take antibiotics, you are risking a trade-off of symptoms which may leave you more unhealthy than you were before.\nOver-the-counter madness\nIf you do succumb to a cold or flu, there are literally hundreds of over-the-counter (OTC) remedies that claim to relieve cold symptoms, but most have been proven useless (J Am Med Assoc, 1993; 269: 2258-63). The most popular varieties use a scattergun approach, mixing several different types of ingredients, often resulting in a variety of side-effects.\nFor instance:\n*Nasal sprays containing phenylephrine hydrochloride, oxymetazoline hydrochloride or xylometazoline hydrochloride may clear the nose initially but, after a few days, their continued use can cause a rebound effect, producing worse nasal congestion than before.\n* Oral decongestants stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and can increase blood pressure and pulse - risky for those with hypertension. They can cause heart rhythm disturbances, anxiety and a rebound effect. Perhaps the worst offender is phenylpropanolamine (PPA). In one study, this chemical increased the risk of stroke in women more than threefold (N Engl J Med, 2000; 343: 1826-32). This was the last straw in more than a decade of studies of PPA. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked drug companies to stop marketing products containing PPA but, in the UK, it is still widely found in cold remedies.\n* Antihistamines may reduce a runny nose and sneezing, but have a minimal effect on other symptoms. They can have a sedating effect and are often added to multisymptom cold remedies because of their ability to counteract the stimulant effect of decongestants.\n* Cough suppressants such as guaifenesin (Robitussin) and dextromethorphan (NyQuil or Night Nurse) show no efficacy in suppressing coughs. The latter has been associated with liver damage and is used by teenagers to get a 'poor man\u2019s high'. Codeine also doesn\u2019t suppress coughs, but can result in constipation.\n* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen may in fact increase nasal symptoms. There is also evidence that aspirin decreases the antibody response in rhinovirus infections (J Am Med Assoc, 1975; 231: 1248-51; J Infect Dis, 1990; 162: 1277-82). Furthermore, the influenza virus grows best at 34-35\u00ba C, but poorly - if at all - at temperatures greater than 37\u00ba C. So reducing fever with NSAIDs may simply prolong the agony of a cold or flu.\nTo jab or not to jab?\nPredicting a flu epidemic is not an exact science, as was elegantly illustrated in 1976 when US officials, spurred on by illness among soldiers at Fort Dix, New Jersey, predicted a swine flu epidemic as lethal as the great flu pandemic of 1918. In the event, rates of flu and pneumonia-related deaths in 1976 were at their lowest in years (MMWR, 1976; 25: 391-2), much to the chagrin of the government, which had spent millions preparing a vaccine.\nAs flu can be caused by any of hundreds of strains of myxovirus, which mutate more or less constantly, vaccination amounts to a kind of biological Russian roulette. Even if the vaccine is for the right strain of myxovirus, for reasons not yet fully understood, you may not respond by producing anti-bodies to it. One study found that 30-40 per cent of elderly people do not respond to vaccination (Hum Immunol, 1994; 40: 202-9), and even if an immune response occurs, there is doubt as to whether this reduces the incidence of influenza (Vaccine, 1994; 12: 1185-9).\nStudies into the efficacy of the flu vaccine show mixed results (Gerontology, 1995; 41: 3-10), and questions remain as to whether the inactivated virus used in the vaccine can truly provide complete protection (Int Arch Allergy Immunol, 1995; 108: 318-20).\nThen there are the side-effects. While authorities say these are rare, this is cold comfort if you are among those affected. The ill-fated swine flu vaccine resulted in a rise of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a type of paralysis (Am J Epidemiol, 1979; 110: 105-23). In one UK study, around one in 12 patients said the flu vaccine was a trigger for asthma attacks (Lancet, 1998; 351: 326-31). Optic neuritis and permanent blindness, vasculitis and joint problems, reversible paralysis and myelopathy have also been reported (Am J Ophthalmol, 1997; 124: 703-4; J Rheumatol, 1997; 24: 1198-202; Ned Tijd Geneeskunde, 1995; 139: 2152-4; Muscle Nerve, 1995; 18: 1199-201).\nReviews of the benefits of vaccines in healthy adults have shown that these are negligible, sucessfully reducing the number of virus carriers (as shown by blood tests), but not of those who actually develop the flu (Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2000; [2]: CD001269; Vaccine, 2000; 18: 957-1030).\nVitamin C, zinc and Echinacea\nResearch shows that most of us treat colds and flu at home (J Fam Pract, 1998; 47: 366-9). Decades of research have gone into vitamin supplementation and immunity, and many nutrients have proved to be important in shoring up our immune defences (see box below).\nThe most popular of these are vitamin C and zinc, although opinion varies regarding their true effectiveness. In the 1970s, Linus Pauling\u2019s review of the evidence concluded that large doses of vitamin C prevented colds and alleviated symptoms (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1971; 68: 2678-81).\nSince that time, however, the efficacy of vitamin C has been hotly debated. A 1975 analysis by Thomas Chalmers concluded that the case for vitamin C had \u201cquestionable validity\u201d (Am J Med, 1975; 58: 532-6), but a recent analysis of the report suggests that his analysis was seriously flawed (J Am Coll Nutr, 1995; 14; 116-23).\nIt is now generally accepted that a dose of 1-8 g of vitamin C daily can decrease the severity of cold symptoms by an average of 23 per cent and reduce the duration of illness by nearly half (Scand J Infect Dis, 1994; 26: 1-6; Br J Nutr, 1992; 67: 3-16).\nMore recent reviews of the evidence say that, while vitamin C can alleviate cold symptoms, taking large doses is not preventative (Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2000; [2]: CD000980). However, some groups may benefit from regular supplementation, such as athletes under heavy physical stress (Int J Sport Med, 1996; 17: 379-83). One review suggests a reduction in cold incidence of up to 50 per cent with regular vitamin C use (Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, 1999; 3: 756-61).\nZinc has long been promoted as a remedy and preventative for colds and flu. In one study, a nasal gel containing zinc significantly shortened the duration of a cold if taken within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms (Ear Nose Throat J, 2000; 79: 778-80, 782).\nHowever, taken as a whole, the evidence for the efficacy of zinc lozenges is inconclusive (Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 2000 [2]: CD001364; J Nutr, 2000; 130 [5S Suppl]: 1512S-5S). The first study of zinc lozenges found a seven-day reduction in colds duration with zinc (Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 1984; 25: 20-4). Such results piqued drug company interest and, by the end of the1980s, five more studies had been carried out. However, only one of these showed zinc to have any effect. But then, in 1996, another study suggested that zinc lozenges were effective against cold symptoms (Ann Intern Med, 1996; 125: 81-8), thus launching zinc back on the road to popularity.\nOne trial of zinc lozenges (12.8 mg) found that patients taking one every two to three hours early in the course of a cold reduced the duration and severity of their symptoms, especially cough (Ann Intern Med, 2000; 133: 245-52).\nBut another randomised double-blind trial of 249 children (total daily dose of 50-60 mg) found no difference between zinc lozenges and placebo (J Am Med Assoc, 1998; 279: 1962-7). More recently, a trial of both zinc gluconate and zinc acetate concluded that neither had much effect on cold symptoms (Clin Infect Dis, 2000; 31: 1202-8).\nSo far, at least 10 double-blind trials have evaluated zinc lozenges for treating the common cold. Half have shown efficacy and half have not, results which may be due to methodological differences. Trials that began therapy shortly after onset of symptoms, used zinc gluconate or glycine-sweetened zinc gluconate and gave multiple daily zinc doses of 13-23 mg per dose found zinc to be effective. Most of the negative trials, on the other hand, varied from this protocol in one way or another.\nEchinacea, one of the best-selling OTC herbals, has also shown mixed efficacy. German researchers gave the liquid root extract of either E. purpurea or E. angustifolia, two of the most popular types, or placebo to 302 healthy volunteers in a double-blind randomised trial. Results showed that both types of Echinacea were only slightly more effective than the placebo in preventing colds over a 12-week period, although participants taking the herb reported feeling better than those taking placebo. The authors concluded that, at best, Echinacea may reduce the risk of catching a cold by about 10-20 per cent (Arch Fam Med, 1998; 7: 541-5).\nOther studies, however, have shown that Echinacea can relieve symptoms, reducing both the severity and duration of a cold (Arzneim Forsch, 2001; 51: 563-8; Arch Fam Med, 1998; 7: 541-5). One trial in Sweden looked at 246 healthy adults who caught a cold and took an E. purpurea preparation or placebo. The subjects took two tablets three times a day for seven days or until they felt better. The Echinacea preparations were significantly more effective than the placebo (Phytomedicine, 1999; 6: 1-6).\nThe key to these and other remedies may be to treat at the first signs of cold or flu. A recent review of 13 trials of Echinacea in the treatment and prevention of colds concluded that, while it may not prevent colds, early treatment could be beneficial for relieving symptoms (J Fam Pract, 1999; 48: 628-35).

Today, consumers looking for temporary relief from such garden-variety ills have their pick of what can be a bewildering array of \"regular,\" \"extra-strength,\" and \"maximum relief\" tablets, caplets and gel caps on the drugstore shelf. Though this cornucopia can seem confusing, the products' relieving ingredients fall into just four categories: aspirin (and other salicylates), acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium.\nFor the most part, these over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic ingredients are equally effective. However, some may be more effective for certain types of ailments, and some people may prefer one type to another because of their varying side effects. \"Knowing the pros and cons of each type of reliever will allow you to choose among them,\" says William T. Beaver, M.D., professor of pharmacology and anesthesia at Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C.\nOld Faithful\nAmericans have been reaching for aspirin for almost 100 years as an all-purpose reliever (see \"Aspirin: A New Look at an Old Drug\" in the January-February 1994 FDA Consumer). Aspirin (oracetylsalicylic acid) works in part by suppressing the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that have wide-ranging roles throughout the body, such as stimulating uterine contractions, regulating body temperature and blood vessel constriction, and helping blood clotting. \"Regular\" strength aspirin contains 325 milligrams (mg) per tablet; \"extra\" or \"maximum\" strength, 500 mg per tablet. The usual adult (defined as12 years and older) dosage is one to two 325-mg aspirin tablets every four hours. Some manufacturers add caffeine to aspirin. \"There is no evidence that caffeine relieves pain , but it can enhance the effects of aspirin, possibly by lifting a person's mood,\" says Michael Weintraub, M.D., director of FDA's Office of OTC Drug Evaluation.\nSince a two-tablet dose provides roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee, you can get the same effect by taking two plain aspirin with coffee. To minimize the stomach irritation aspirin can cause, some brands are \"buffered\" with calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, and other antacids or coated so the pills don't dissolve until they reach the small intestine. Buffered formulas may offset aspirin'sdirectly irritating effects on the stomach lining. They may be useful for people who get heartburn or stomach pain when they take aspirin, as well as for those with arthritis, who need to take as much as 4,000 mg every day. Aspirin also causes gastrointestinal (GI) upset indirectly (by inhibiting production of a prostaglandin that protects the stomach lining by stimulating mucus production); buffering does nothing to offset this effect. The downside of coated aspirin products is that they may take up to twice as long to provide relief as plain aspirin, according to Weintraub.\nLast September, an FDA advisory panel recommended that labels on products containing aspirin warn that heavy drinkers are especially vulnerable to developing GI bleeding. Aspirin should not be taken by people who have:\n- ulcers, because it can worsen symptoms\n- asthma, because it can trigger an attack in some asthmatics\n- uncontrolled high blood pressure, because of an increased risk of one type of stroke\n- liver or kidney disease, because it may worsen these conditions\n- bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulant medication, because it may cause bleeding.\nContinual high dosages of aspirin can cause hearing loss or tinnitis--a persistent ringing in the ears. FDA requires products containing aspirin and other salicylates to carry a label warning that children and teenagers should not use the medicine for chickenpox or flu symptoms because of its association with Reyes syndrome, a rare disorder that may cause seizures, brain damage, and death. The label also alerts pregnant women that use of aspirin in the last trimester may increase the risk of stillbirth and of maternal and fetal bleeding during delivery.\nOne Aspirin Alternative\nTwenty years ago, FDA approved acetaminophen (Tylenol, and other brands and generics) in dosages of 325 mg and 500 mg for OTC use. \"Nobody knows exactly how acetaminophen works, but one theory is that it acts on nerve endings to suppress pain,\" says Weintraub. Acetaminophen is as effective as aspirin in relieving mild-to-moderate pain and in reducing fever, but less so when it comes to soft tissue injuries, such as muscle strains and sprains, he adds. The usual adult dosage is two 325-mg tablets every four hours. Acetaminophen-based products to ease menstrual cramps often contain other ingredients, such as pamabrom (a diuretic) orpyrilamine maleate (an antihistamine used for its sedative effects). \"While these ingredients are safe, they have not been proven effective against uterine cramps, although they may relieve other symptoms associated with menstrual pain.\" says Weintraub. Though acetaminophen is no better or faster at relief than aspirin, the drug is gentler on the stomach and reduces fever without the risk of Reyes syndrome. However, even at moderate doses, acetaminophen can cause liver damage in heavy drinkers. At press time, FDA was planning to require a warning about this on the labels of OTC products containing the drug.\nFrom Prescription to Over-the-Counter\nLike aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium inhibit prostaglandin production. However, they are more potent relievers, especially for menstrual cramps, toothaches, minor arthritis, and injuries accompanied by inflammation, such as tendinitis. FDA approved ibuprofen for OTC marketing in 1984 at a dosage level of 200 mg every 4 to 6 hours, and naproxen sodium in1994 at a dosage level of 200 mg every 8 to 12 hours. \"Ibuprofen and naproxen sodium were converted to OTC status after their manufacturers did the necessary studies to show that these relievers were effective at OTC dosages, which are lower than prescription dosages,\" explains Weintraub. The lowest dosage strength for prescription-strength ibuprofen (Motrin and others) is 300 mg per tablet, and 275 mg per tablet for the prescription version of naproxen sodium (Anaprox, for example). \"In addition, the pharmaceutical companies had to show that these drugs were safe for use by a larger, more varied group of people [than would have received them by prescription only] and that the drugs were safe to use without medical supervision, as is the case with all nonprescription drugs.\" Taken at the recommended adult dosage, OTC ibuprofen (Advil and others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) are somewhat gentler on the stomach than aspirin.\nHowever, people who have ulcers or who get GI upset when taking aspirin should avoid both. In addition, asthmatics and people who are allergic to aspirin should avoid ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. An FDA advisory panel has recommended labeling on ibuprofen products like that recommended for aspirin, warning heavy drinkers about increased risk of gastric bleeding and impaired liver function (products with naproxen sodium labels already include this information). Although ibuprofen and naproxen sodium interfere with blood clotting much less than aspirin does, they should not be used by people who have bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulants.\nChildren under 12 should not be given either drug, except under a doctor's supervision, and people over 65 are advised to take no more than one naproxen sodium tablet every 12 hours. Choosing an OTC reliever involves balancing effectiveness for a particular ailment with side effects. Often this is a very individual choice, based in part on your health history and how the drug affects you. Regardless of which type of OTC reliever you choose, remember that it is intended to be used on a short-term basis, unless directed by a doctor, cautions Weintraub. The warning labels on these products include limitations on duration of use to ensure that chronic or serious illnesses are not masked. Typically, labels advise against taking the product for more than 10 days to relieve pain (for children, the upper limit is five days), or more than three days to reduce fever. If symptoms worsen, pain persists, or there is redness or swelling, medical attention should be sought.\nRuth Papazian is a writer in New York City.\nReprinted with the permission of:\n"}, {"score": 500.76392, "uuid": "dc118e35-1e17-56e4-bbab-501294e31310", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0300tw-42-06238", "target_hostname": "www.archildrens.org", "target_uri": "http://www.archildrens.org/Health-Info/Library/Pediatric-Health-Library/Article.aspx?Document=P10177&Type=88", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Article | Arkansas Children's Hospital", "snippet": "&quot;If you bring a <em>fever</em> down, your child may not produce as many white cells to fight the infection.&quot; On the other hand, if your child seems lethargic and <em>is</em> generally uncomfortable, <em>fever</em>-<em>reducing</em> medications such as acetaminophen <em>or</em> <em>ibuprofen</em> may make your child feel a little <em>better</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Published Date: 2-Mar-2011\nNew Advice on Fevers: Wait and Watch\n< Mar. 02, 2011 > -- When a child runs a fever, most parents run to the medicine cabinet to offer relief.\nBut here's the latest word from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP): Wait.\n\"Sometimes, parents think that if they treat a fever that their child will get better faster, but fever is a sign of illness, and it's the body's way of slowing the germs down to help get rid of them,\" says Janice Sullivan, M.D., at the University of Louisville.\nObserve behavior\nThe AAP, in a report published in this month's Pediatrics, now recommends that parents only treat a fever if it's making their child feel uncomfortable. Instead of focusing on the thermometer reading, parents should monitor their child's behavior.\nIf your child is eating and drinking well, and playing, you probably don't need to offer any fever-reducing medication, the AAP says.\n\"Fever is one of the triggers that your body uses to produce more white cells,\" says Dr. Sullivan. \"If you bring a fever down, your child may not produce as many white cells to fight the infection.\"\nUse only as directed\nOn the other hand, if your child seems lethargic and is generally uncomfortable, fever-reducing medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may make your child feel a little better. Give these medications only as directed by the package or your child's health care provider, based on your child's age and weight.\nDr. Sullivan says it's important to not give your children adult formulations of anti-fever drugs, even if you attempt to break tablets up to provide the correct dose.\nAnd NEVER give aspirin to children, because of its association with Reye syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition.\nIn addition\nHere is other fever advice from the AAP:\nStore any fever-reducing medication safely away from young children.\nAlways use an accurate measuring device for each dose.\nDon't wake a sleeping child to give fever-reducing medication.\nWhen should you call the doctor about a fever? Dr. Sullivan offers these general guidelines:\nAn infant under 3 months of age with a fever of 100.4 degrees or more\nAn infant between 3 and 6 months of age with a fever of 101.5 degrees or more\nAn older child with a fever of 103 degrees or more\nAny child with a fever plus lethargy, headache, skin rash, difficulty breathing, or dehydration\nFor more information on health and wellness, please visit health information modules on this website.\nHow to Take a Rectal Temperature\nWhen your little one is ill and you need to check his temperature, follow these steps:\nUse a lubricating jelly to lubricate the tip of the thermometer. (A water-soluble jelly such as K-Y is preferred. You may also use a disposable plastic cover on the thermometer. Check with your child's health care provider to see what he or she recommends.)\nPlace the child across your lap, making sure to support his head. You can also lay him on the changing table or other firm surface.\nHold the baby still by pressing the palm of one hand on his lower back.\nWith the other hand, insert the thermometer one-half inch to one inch into the rectum. Stop immediately if the thermometer meets resistance.\nHold the thermometer between your second and third fingers and cup your hand around the child's rear. As you hold the thermometer in place, calm the child by speaking softly to him.\nKeep the thermometer in place until you hear the signal or beep that it is ready. Write down the temperature, the date and time of day.\nAlways talk with your health care provider to find out more information.\nOnline Resources\n"}, {"score": 495.2101, "uuid": "4ae58bb1-3ef8-5e2d-83aa-d3d33bab2f53", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1015wb-15-11948", "target_hostname": "childrens.advil.com", "target_uri": "http://childrens.advil.com/childrens-advil-faqs", "page_rank": 1.4848281e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "FAQs | Children's Advil&reg;", "snippet": "A <em>fever</em> <em>is</em> not an illness unto itself.

Also, if a particular brand name is not mentioned, this does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory.\nTraditional NSAIDs\nKetoprofen\nNaproxen\nNSAIDs help relieve pain within hours of admin-istration in dosages available over-the-counter (available for all three medications). They relieve pain and inflammation in dosages available in prescription form (ibu-profen and ketoprofen). It may take several days to reduce inflammation.\nFor all traditional NSAIDs: Abdominal or stomach cramps, pain, or discomfort; diarrhea; dizziness; drowsiness or light-headedness; headache; heartburn or indigestion; peptic ulcers; nausea or vomiting; possible kidney and liver damage (rare).\nFor all traditional NSAIDs: Before taking these drugs, let your doctor know if you drink alcohol or use blood thinners or if you have or have had any of the following: sensitivity or allergy to aspirin or similar drugs, kidney or liver disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, or peptic ulcers.\nCOX-2 Inhibitor NSAIDs\nRofecoxib\nValdecoxib\nCOX-2 inhibitors, like traditional NSAIDs, block COX-2, an enzyme in the body that stimulates an inflammatory response. Unlike traditional NSAIDs, however, they do not block the action of COX-1, an enzyme that protects the stomach lining. This results in reduced risk of gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding. Reduces joint pain and inflammation.\nStomach irritation, ulceration, and bleeding may occur. Caution is advisable for patients with a history of bleeding or ulcers, de-creased renal function, hepatic disease, hyper-tension, or asthma.\nUse of COX-2s with low-dose aspirin is permitted but may slightly increase ulcer risk.

They relieve painful, swollen joints and slow joint damage, and several DMARDs may be used over the disease course. They take a few weeks or months to have an effect, and may produce significant improvements for many patients. Exactly how they work is still unknown.\nSide effects vary with each medicine. DMARDs may increase risk of infection, hair loss, and kidney or liver damage.\nDoctor monitoring allows the risk of toxicities to be weighed against the potential benefits of individual medications.\nAzathioprine\nThis drug was first used in higher doses in cancer chemotherapy and organ transplantation. It is used in patients who have not responded to other drugs, and in combination therapy.\nCough or hoarseness, fever or chills, loss of appetite, lower back or side pain, nausea or vomiting, painful or difficult urination, unusual tiredness or weakness.\nBefore taking this drug, tell your doctor if you use allopurinol or have kidney or liver disease. This drug can reduce your ability to fight infection, so call your doctor immediately if you develop chills, fever, or a cough. Regular blood and liver function tests are needed.\nCyclosporine\nThis medication was first used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection. It is used in patients who have not responded to other drugs.\nBleeding, tender, or enlarged gums; high blood pressure; increase in hair growth; kidney problems; trembling and shaking of hands.\nBefore taking this drug, tell your doctor if you have one of the following: sensitivity to castor oil (if receiving the drug by injection), liver or kidney disease, active infection, or high blood pressure.

Joint pain may occur for one or two days after injection.\nBefore taking this drug, tell your doctor if you have any of the following: lupus, skin rash, kidney disease, or colitis. Periodic urine and blood tests are needed to check for side effects.\nLeflunomide\nThis drug reduces signs and symptoms and slows structural damage to joints caused by arthritis.\nBloody or cloudy urine; congestion in chest; cough; diarrhea; difficult, burning, or painful urination or breathing; fever; hair loss; headache; heartburn; loss of appetite; nausea and/or vomiting; skin rash; stomach pain; sneezing; and sore throat.\nBefore taking this medication, let your doctor know if you have one of the following: active infection, liver disease, known immune deficiency, renal insufficiency, or underlying malignancy. You will need regular blood tests, including liver function tests. Leflunomide must not be taken during pregnancy because it may cause birth defects in humans.\nMethotrexate\nThis drug can be taken by mouth or by injection and results in rapid improvement (it usually takes 3-6 weeks to begin working). It appears to be very effective, especially in combination with infliximab or etanercept. In general, it produces more favorable long-term responses compared with other DMARDs such as sulfasalazine, gold sodium thiomalate, and hydroxychloroquine.\nAbdominal discomfort, chest pain, chills, nausea, mouth sores, painful urination, sore throat, unusual tiredness or weakness.\nDoctor monitoring is important, particularly if you have an abnormal blood count, liver or lung disease, alcoholism, immune-system deficiency, or active infection. Methotrexate must not be taken during pregnancy because it may cause birth defects in humans.\nSulfasalazine\nThis drug works to reduce the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis by suppressing the immune system.\nAbdominal pain, aching joints, diarrhea, headache, sensitivity to sunlight, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, skin rash.\nDoctor monitoring is important, particularly if you are allergic to sulfa drugs or aspirin, or if you have a kidney, liver, or blood disease.\nBiologic Response Modifiers\nThese drugs selectively block parts of the immune system called cytokines. Cytokines play a role in inflammation. Long-term efficacy and safety are uncertain.\nIncreased risk of infection, especially tuberculosis. Increased risk of pneumonia, and listeriosis (a foodborne illness caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes).\nIt is important to avoid eating undercooked foods (including unpasteurized cheeses, cold cuts, and hot dogs) because undercooked food can cause listeriosis for patients taking biologic response modifiers.\nTumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors\nInfliximab\nAdalimumab\nThese medications are highly effective for treating patients with an inadequate response to DMARDs. They may be prescribed in combination with some DMARDs, particularly methotrexate. Etanercept requires subcutaneous (beneath the skin) injections two times per week. Infliximab is taken intravenously (IV) during a 2-hour procedure. It is administered with methotrexate. Adalimumab requires injections every 2 weeks.

Long-term efficacy and safety are uncertain.\nRedness, swelling, bruising, or pain at the site of injection; head-ache; upset stomach; diarrhea; runny nose; and stomach pain.\nDoctor monitoring is required.\nReturn to top\nCurrent Research\nOver the last several decades, research has greatly increased our understanding of the immune system, genetics, and biology. This research is now showing results in several areas important to rheumatoid arthritis. Scientists are thinking about rheumatoid arthritis in exciting ways that were not possible even 10 years ago.\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds a wide variety of medical research at its headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, and at universities and medical centers across the United States. One of the NIH institutes, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), is a major supporter of research and research training in rheumatoid arthritis through grants to individual scientists, Specialized Centers of Research, Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Centers, and Multipurpose Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases Centers.\nFollowing are examples of current research directions in rheumatoid arthritis supported by the Federal Government through the NIAMS and other parts of the NIH.\nScientists are looking at the immune systems of people with rheumatoid arthritis and in some animal models of the disease to understand why and how the disease develops. For example, small studies are looking at the role of T cells, which play an important role in immunity and in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Findings from these studies may lead to precise, targeted therapies that could stop the inflammatory process in its earliest stages. They may even lead to a vaccine that could prevent rheumatoid arthritis.\nResearchers are studying genetic factors that predispose some people to developing rheumatoid arthritis, as well as factors connected with disease severity. For example, by studying genetically engineered mice, scientists supported by the NIH discovered that immune cells called mast cells play a key role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Findings from these studies should increase our understanding of the disease and will help develop new therapies, as well as guide treatment decisions.\nIn a major effort aimed at identifying genes involved in rheumatoid arthritis, the NIH and the Arthritis Foundation have joined together to support the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium. This group of 10 research centers around the United States is collecting medical information and genetic material from 1,000 families in which two or more siblings have rheumatoid arthritis. It serves as a national resource for genetic studies of this disease.\nTo help identify the multiple factors that predict disease course and outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis in African Americans, the NIH is supporting the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluations of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) Registry at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This registry aims to collect clinical and x-ray data and DNA to help scientists analyze genetic and nongenetic factors that predict disease course and outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis.\nScientists are also unearthing the genetic basis of rheumatoid arthritis by studying rats with a condition that resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans. NIAMS researchers have identified several genetic regions that affect arthritis susceptibility and severity in these animal models of the disease. These genetic regions are important because they can assist scientists in predicting the symptoms and severity of rheumatoid arthritis. Replacing malfunctioning genes with healthy genes (gene transfer) is being tested in mice, and it may eventually be used in humans to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\nResearchers are also uncovering the complex relationships between the hormonal, nervous, and immune systems in rheumatoid arthritis. For example, they are exploring whether and how the normal changes in the levels of naturally produced steroid hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone) during a person's lifetime may be related to the development, improvement, or flares of the disease. Scientists also are researching how these systems interact with environmental and genetic factors. The results of this research may suggest new treatment strategies.\nScientists are exploring why so many more women than men develop rheumatoid arthritis. In hopes of finding clues, they are studying female and male hormones and other differences between women and men.\nScientists are examining why rheumatoid arthritis often improves during pregnancy. Results of one study suggest that the explanation may be related to differences in certain special proteins that pass between a mother and her unborn child. These proteins help the immune system distinguish between the body's own cells and foreign cells. Such differences, the scientists speculate, may change the activity of the mother's immune system during pregnancy.\nA growing body of evidence indicates that infectious agents, such as viruses and bacteria, may trigger rheumatoid arthritis in people who have an inherited predisposition to the disease. Scientists are trying to discover which infectious agents may be responsible and how they trigger arthritis.\nResearchers are searching for new drugs or combinations of drugs that can reduce inflammation and slow or stop the progression of rheumatoid arthritis with few side effects. Already, the new biologic response modifiers infliximab and etanercept are proving to be extremely effective for some people. Studies show that these treatments are more effective at slowing joint damage than methotrexate alone. Combination treatment with etanercept and methotrexate or infliximab and methotrexate has been found even more effective than either of the new treatments alone. (Methotrexate was used for comparison because it is a commonly prescribed \"front-line\" treatment.) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved adalimumab (Humira) for slowing the progression of structural damage in adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have not responded well to one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drugs.\nInvestigators have also shown that treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with minocycline, a drug in the tetracycline family, has a modest benefit. Other studies have shown that the omega-3 fatty acids in certain fish or plant seed oils also may reduce rheumatoid arthritis inflammation. However, many people are not able to tolerate the large amounts of oil necessary for any benefit.\nScientists are examining many issues related to quality of life for people with rheumatoid arthritis and the quality, cost, and effectiveness of the health care services they receive. Some new techniques for managing symptoms under investigation include tai chi (a form of movement-based meditation), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (a technique that teaches you to anticipate and prepare yourself for the situations and bodily sensations that may trigger painful symptoms). Scientists have found that even a small improvement in a patient's sense of physical and mental well-being can have an impact on his or her quality of life and use of health care services.\nReturn to top\nHope for the Future\nScientists are making rapid progress in understanding the complexities of rheumatoid arthritis: how and why it develops, why some people get it and others do not, why some people get it more severely than others. Results from research are having an impact today, enabling people with rheumatoid arthritis to remain active in life, family, and work far longer than was possible 20 years ago. There is also hope for tomorrow, as researchers begin to apply new technologies such as stem cell transplantation and novel imaging techniques. (Stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into specific cell types, which gives them the potential to change damaged tissue in which they are placed.) These and other advances will lead to an improved quality of life for people with rheumatoid arthritis.\n"}], [{"score": 486.44272, "uuid": "a9525b22-6bad-5302-a6c3-fa354e70da59", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1402wb-07-04531", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/cc8115f059259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____", "page_rank": 1.1962573e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Anemia Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Up to 20% of American <em>children</em> and 80% of <em>children</em> <em>in</em> developing countries become anemic <em>at</em> some point during their childhood and adolescence.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)\nIrritability and other mood disturbances\nPale skin (however, healthy-looking skin color does not rule out anemia if a patient has risk factors and other symptoms of anemia)\nMental confusion\nLoss of sexual drive\nUnusual Symptoms\nPica. One odd symptom, which in some cases is also a cause of iron deficiency, is pica. This is the habit of eating unusual substances, such as ice (called pagophagia), clay, cardboard, foods that crunch (such as raw potatoes, carrots, or celery), or raw starch. The pica often stops, particularly in children, when iron supplements are given. Pica is difficult to detect because patients are often ashamed to admit to such cravings.\nFrequent Breath Holding. Children who hold their breath frequently when angry or upset, even to the point of fainting, may be iron-deficient.\nSymptoms of Megaloblastic Anemia and its Causes\nSymptoms of Megaloblastic Anemia. The symptoms of megaloblastic anemia from vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiencies include not only standard anemic symptoms but also:\nInflammation of the mouth (stomatitis)\nInflammation of the tongue (glossitis), which involves shrinkage at the surface and edges of the tongue\nOver time, psychiatric and neurologic problems develop. Vitamin B12 deficiencies cause neurologic symptoms (numbness and tingling, depression, memory loss, and irritability), and folate deficiency may result in depression and dementia (in severe cases).\nSymptoms of Pernicious Anemia. Early neurologic symptoms of pernicious anemia are due to B12 deficiency. They include numbness and tingling, depression, memory loss, and irritability. Advanced nerve damage can cause loss of balance and staggering, confusion, dementia, spasticity, loss of bladder control, and erectile dysfunction. Folic acid deficiency does not cause neurologic damage, although people with this deficiency can be irritable, forgetful, and experience personality changes.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nThe first step in any diagnosis is a physical examination to determine if the patient has symptoms of anemia and any complications. Because anemia may be the first symptom of a serious illness, determining its cause is very important. This may be difficult, particularly in the elderly, malnourished, or people with chronic diseases, whose anemia may be caused by one or more factors. A detailed medical, personal, and dietary history should report:\nAny family or personal history of anemia\nA history of gallbladder disease, jaundice, or enlarged spleen\nHeavy menstrual bleeding in women\nAny occurrence of blood in the stool or other signs of internal bleeding. (Even if the patient has not observed any bleeding, nonvisible blood may be present, so a rectal exam and stool test are essential.)\nAny dietary history, particularly in people who are elderly, poor, or both\nThe doctor should examine the patient carefully, especially checking for swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged spleen, and pale skin and nail color.\nA complete blood count (CBC) blood test is performed to determine the presence of anemia. Other iron status blood tests are also used.\nComplete Blood Count (CBC)\nA complete blood count (CBC) is a panel of tests that measures red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. For diagnosis of anemia, the CBC provides critical information on the size, volume, and shape of red blood cells (erythrocytes). CBC results include measurements of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume.\nHemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-bearing and oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. The normal value for hemoglobin varies by age and gender. Anemia is generally considered when hemoglobin concentrations fall below 11 g/dL for pregnant women, 12 g/dL for non-pregnant women, and 13 g/dL for men.\nThe severity of anemia is categorized by the following hemoglobin concentration ranges:\nMild anemia is considered when hemoglobin is between 9.5 - 13.0 g/dL\nModerate anemia is considered when hemoglobin is between 8.0 - 9.5 g/dL\nSevere anemia is considered for hemoglobin concentrations below 8.0 g/dL\nHematocrit. Hematocrit is the percentage of blood composed of red blood cells. People with a high volume of plasma (the liquid portion of blood) may be anemic even if their blood count is normal because the blood cells have become diluted. Like hemoglobin, a normal hematocrit percentage depends on age and gender. Anemic ranges for hematocrit generally fall below:\nChildren ages 6 months - 5 years: Below 33%\nChildren ages 5 years - 12 years: Below 35%\nChildren ages 12 years - 15 years: Below 36%\nAdult men: Below 39%\nAdult non-pregnant women: Below 36%\nAdult pregnant women: Below 33%\nOther hemoglobin measurements such as mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) may also be calculated.\nMean Corpuscular Volume. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of red blood cells. The MCV increases when red blood cells are larger than normal (macrocytic) and decreases when red blood cells are smaller than normal (microcytic). Macrocytic cells can be a sign of anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, while microcytic cells are a sign of iron-deficiency anemia or thalassemias.\nOther Iron Status Blood Tests\nSerum Ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and helps to store iron in the body. Low levels typically mean reduced iron stores. Normal values are generally 12 - 300 ng/mL for men and 12 - 150 ng/mL for women. Lower than normal levels of ferritin are a sign of iron-deficiency anemia, while higher than normal levels may indicate hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, or anemia of chronic disease.\nSerum Iron. Serum iron measures the amount of iron in the blood. A normal serum iron is 60 - 170 mcg/dL. Lower levels may indicate iron-deficiency anemia or anemia of chronic disease, while higher levels may indicate hemolytic anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency.\nTotal Iron Binding Capacity. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) measures the level of transferrin in the blood. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. TIBC calculates how much or how little the transferrin in the body is carrying iron. A higher than normal TIBC is a sign of iron-deficiency anemia. A lower than normal level may indicate anemia of chronic disease, sickle cell, pernicious anemia, or hemolytic anemia.\nReticulocyte Count. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells, and their count reflects the rate of red blood cell production. The upper normal limit is about 100,000/mL. A low count, when bleeding isn't the cause, suggests problems in production in the bone marrow. An abnormally high count indicates that the red blood cells are being destroyed in high numbers and indicates hemolytic anemia. Recent research suggests that the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) test may be more accurate than a standard hemoglobin test for detecting iron deficiency in infants.\nVitamin Deficiencies. Tests for vitamin B12 and folate levels.\nOther Diagnostic Tests\nIf internal bleeding is suspected as the cause of anemia, the gastrointestinal tract is usually the first suspect as the source. A diagnosis in these cases can often be made if the patient has noticed blood in the stools, which can be black and tarry or red-streaked. Often, however, bleeding may be present but not visible. If so, stool tests for this hidden (occult) blood are required. Additional tests may then be needed to diagnose the precipitating condition. Endoscopy, in which a fiber optic tube is used to view into the gastrointestinal tract, is helpful in many patients, particularly when the source of bleeding is unclear. A colonoscopy may also be recommended to rule out colorectal cancer.\nIf the patient's diet suggests low iron intake and other causes cannot be established using inexpensive or noninvasive techniques, then the patient may simply be given a monthly trial of iron supplements. If the patient fails to respond, further evaluation is needed.\nDietary Factors\nIron found in foods is either in the form of heme or non-heme iron:\nHeme Iron. Foods containing heme iron are the best sources for increasing or maintaining healthy iron levels. Such foods include (in decreasing order of iron-richness) clams, oysters, organ meats, beef, pork, poultry, and fish.\nNon-Heme Iron. Non-heme iron is less well-absorbed. About 60% of the iron in meat is non-heme (although meat itself helps absorb non-heme iron). Eggs, dairy products, and iron-containing vegetables have only the non-heme form. Such vegetable products include dried beans and peas, iron-fortified cereals, bread, and pasta products, dark green leafy vegetables (chard, spinach, mustard greens, kale), dried fruits, nuts, and seeds.\nThe absorption of non-heme iron often depends on the food balances in meals. The following foods and cooking methods can enhance absorption of iron:\nMeat and fish not only contain heme iron -- the best form for maintaining stores -- but they also help absorb non-heme iron.\nIncreasing intake of vitamin-C rich foods, such as orange juice, may enhance absorption of non-heme iron, although it is not clear if it improves iron stores in iron-deficient people. In any case, vitamin-C rich foods are healthy and include broccoli, cabbage, citrus fruits, melon, tomatoes, and strawberries.\nRiboflavin (vitamin B2) may help enhance the response of hemoglobin to iron. Food sources include dairy products, liver, and dried fortified cereals.\nCooking methods can enhance iron stores. Cooking in cast iron pans and skillets can help increase the iron content of food.\nVitamins B12 and folate are important for prevention of megaloblastic anemia and for good health in general. The only natural dietary sources of B12 are animal products, such as meats, dairy products, eggs, and fish (clams and oily fish are very high in B12). As is the case with other B vitamins, however, B12 is added to commercial dried cereals. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 2.4 mcg a day. Deficiencies are rare in young people, although the elderly may have trouble absorbing natural vitamin B12 and require synthetic forms from supplements and fortified foods.\nClick the icon to see an image of sources of vitamin B12.\nFolate is best found in avocado, bananas, orange juice, cold cereal, asparagus, fruits, green, leafy vegetables, dried beans and peas, and yeast. The synthetic form, folic acid, is now added to commercial grain products. Vitamins are usually made from folic acid, which is about twice as potent as folate. The recommended daily amount of folic acid or folate for teenagers and adults is 400 mcg. Women who are pregnant need 600 mcg per day and women who are breastfeeding need 500 mcg daily.\nClick the icon to see an image of sources of folate.\nRecommended Daily Allowance for Iron\nThe Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of iron for people who are not iron deficient varies by age group and other risk factors. (Iron supplements are rarely recommended in people without evidence of iron deficiency or anemia.) The RDA recommends these daily amounts of iron:\nChildren 1 - 3 years old: 10 mg\nTeenage boys: 12 mg\nTeenage girls and premenopausal women: 15 mg\nPregnant or nursing women: 30 mg\nAdult men (up to age 50): 10 mg\nOlder men and women (over age 50): 10 mg\nPreventing Anemia in Infants and Small Children\nThe main source of iron for an infant from birth to 1 year of age is in milk, from breast milk, iron-fortified infant formula, or cereal. The best methods for preventing iron deficiency during infancy are:\nBreast-feeding and Iron-Supplemented Formulas. Mothers should be encouraged to breast-feed their babies for their first year. Up to half of the iron in breast milk is absorbed by the baby and is sufficient to prevent anemia for the first 4 - 6 months, assuming that the mother had adequate iron stores during pregnancy. Breast milk itself is low in iron, but if the mother's diet is healthy, vitamin C and lactose in the breast milk may enhance iron absorption. Breast-fed babies should have iron supplements after 4 - 6 weeks, even if they are still nursing.\nInfants who are not breast-fed should start with iron-fortified formulas (7-12 mg/L). Most doctors strongly discourage the use of low-iron formulas (less than 4.0 mg/L). Parents should discuss the best formula with their doctor. Children given iron supplements may have a slightly higher risk for diarrhea. Experts advise against cow's milk for the first year of life. When cereals are begun, they should be iron fortified.\nRecommendations for Toddlers. Toddlers who did not have iron supplements during infancy should be checked for iron deficiency. After the first year, children should be given a varied diet that is rich in sources of iron, B vitamins, and vitamin C. Milk does not contain enough iron and can decrease children's appetite for iron-rich foods. Toddlers older than 1 year should not drink more than 2 cups of milk a day. A preference for apple juice over vitamin-C rich orange juice does not reduce iron absorption in children with any otherwise healthy diet.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nOral iron supplements are the best way to restore iron levels for people who are iron deficient, but they should be used only when dietary measures have failed. However, iron supplements cannot correct anemias that are not due to iron deficiency.\nIron replacement therapy can cause gastrointestinal problems, sometimes severe ones. Excess iron may also contribute to heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Doctors generally advise against iron supplements in anyone with a healthy diet and no indications of iron deficiency anemia.\nTreatment of Anemia of Chronic Disease. In general, the best treatment for anemia of chronic diseases is treating the disease itself. In some cases, iron deficiency accompanies the condition and requires iron replacement. Erythropoietin, most often administered with intravenous iron, is used for some patients.\nOral Iron Supplements\nSupplement Forms. There are two forms of supplemental iron: ferrous and ferric. Ferrous iron is better absorbed and is the preferred form of iron tablets. Ferrous iron is available in three forms: ferrous fumarate, ferrous sulfate, and ferrous gluconate.\nThe label of an iron supplement contains information both on the tablet size (which is typically 325 mg) and the amount of elemental iron contained in the tablet (the amount of iron that is available for absorption by the body.) When selecting an iron supplement, it is important to look at the amount of elemental iron.\nA 325 mg iron supplement contains the following amounts of elemental iron depending on the type of iron:\nFerrous fumarate. 108 mg of elemental iron\nFerrous sulfate. 65 mg of elemental iron\nFerrous gluconate. 35 mg of elemental iron\nDosage. Depending on the severity of your anemia, as well as your age and weight, your doctor will recommend a dosage of 60 - 200 mg of elemental iron per day. This means taking one iron pill 2 - 3 time during the day. Make sure your doctor explains to you how many pills you should take in a day and when you should take them. Never take a double dose of iron.\nSide Effects and Safety. Common side effects of iron supplements include:\nConstipation and diarrhea are very common. They are rarely severe, although iron tablets can aggravate existing gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers and ulcerative colitis.\nNausea and vomiting may occur with high doses, but can be controlled by taking smaller amounts. Switching to ferrous gluconate may help some people with severe gastrointestinal problems.\nBlack stools are normal when taking iron tablets. In fact, if they do not turn black, the tablets may not be working effectively. This tends to be a more common problem with coated or long-acting iron tablets.\nIf the stools are tarry looking as well as black, if they have red streaks, or if cramps, sharp pains, or soreness in the stomach occur, gastrointestinal bleeding may be causing the iron deficiency and the patient should call the doctor promptly.\nAcute iron poisoning is rare in adults but can be fatal in children who take adult-strength tablets. Keep iron supplements out of the reach of children. If your child swallows an iron pill, immediately contact a poison control center.\nOther Tips for Safety and Effectiveness. Other tips for taking iron are as follows:\nFor best absorption, iron should be taken between meals. Iron may cause stomach and intestinal disturbances, however. Low doses of ferrous sulfate can be taken with food and are still absorbed but with fewer side effects.)\nDrink a full 8 ounces of fluid with an iron pill. Taking orange juice with an iron pill can help increase iron absorption. (Some doctors also recommend taking a vitamin C supplement with the iron pill.)\nIf constipation becomes a problem, take a stool softener such as docusate sodium (Colace).\nCertain medications, including antacids, can reduce iron absorption. Iron tablets may also reduce the effectiveness of other drugs, including the antibiotics tetracycline, penicillamine, and ciprofloxacin and the Parkinson's disease drugs methyldopa, levodopa, and carbidopa. At least 2 hours should elapse between doses of these drugs and iron supplements.\nAvoid taking milk, caffeine, antacids, or calcium supplements at the same time as an iron pill as they can interfere with iron absorption.\nTablets should be kept in a cool place. (Bathroom medicine cabinets may be too warm and humid, which may cause the pills to disintegrate.)\nFull recovery takes 6 - 8 weeks. Recovery will take longer in people with internal bleeding that is not under control. Iron replacement therapy must continue for about 6 months, even if anemia has been reversed. Treatment must be continued indefinitely for people with chronic bleeding; in such cases, iron levels should be closely monitored.\nIntravenous or Injected Iron\nIn some cases, iron is administered through muscular injections or intravenously. Intravenous iron has the advantage of causing less gastrointestinal discomfort and inconvenience. It may be in the form of iron dextran (Dexferrum, InFed), sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose (Ferrlecit), or iron sucrose (Venofer). Ferrlecit or Venofer are proving to be at least equally effective and safer than iron dextran.\nCandidates. The injected or intravenous forms should be limited to the following patients with iron deficiency:\nPeople with iron deficiency anemia in whom oral therapy has clearly failed.\nPatients with bleeding disorders in which blood loss continues to exceed the rate at which oral iron is absorbed.\nIn emergencies, when people need red blood cells but transfusion is not appropriate or available.\nIn people with serious gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, who cannot take iron therapy by mouth.\nPeople undergoing hemodialysis who receive supplemental erythropoietin therapy. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose (Ferrlecit) or iron sucrose (Venofer) is specifically approved as first-line therapy for these patients.\nCertain patients, even if they meet these qualifications, may not be appropriate candidates or should be monitored closely for complications. They include:\nPatients with any underlying autoimmune disease.\nMalnourished patients who also have an underlying infection.\nPatients who are at risk for iron overload.\nSide Effects. Some side effects differ depending on how the iron is administered and include the following:\nMuscular injections include pain at the site.\nIntravenous administration can cause pain in the vein, flushing, and metallic taste, all of which are brief.\nFor both methods, side effects and serious complications can include:\nBlood clots\n"}, {"score": 486.3094, "uuid": "b254372e-68a6-51ef-91fc-ed8f51d60ab1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1401wb-50-27852", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/cc8115f059259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____", "page_rank": 1.2090678e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Anemia Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Up to 20% of American <em>children</em> and 80% of <em>children</em> <em>in</em> developing countries become anemic <em>at</em> some point during their childhood and adolescence.", "explanation": null, "document": "Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)\nIrritability and other mood disturbances\nPale skin (however, healthy-looking skin color does not rule out anemia if a patient has risk factors and other symptoms of anemia)\nMental confusion\nLoss of sexual drive\nUnusual Symptoms\nPica.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of red blood cells. The MCV increases when red blood cells are larger than normal (macrocytic) and decreases when red blood cells are smaller than normal (microcytic). Macrocytic cells can be a sign of anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, while microcytic cells are a sign of iron-deficiency anemia or thalassemias.\nOther Iron Status Blood Tests\nSerum Ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and helps to store iron in the body. Low levels typically mean reduced iron stores. Normal values are generally 12 - 300 ng/mL for men and 12 - 150 ng/mL for women. Lower than normal levels of ferritin are a sign of iron-deficiency anemia, while higher than normal levels may indicate hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, or anemia of chronic disease.\nSerum Iron. Serum iron measures the amount of iron in the blood. A normal serum iron is 60 - 170 mcg/dL. Lower levels may indicate iron-deficiency anemia or anemia of chronic disease, while higher levels may indicate hemolytic anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency.\nTotal Iron Binding Capacity. Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) measures the level of transferrin in the blood. Transferrin is a protein that carries iron in the blood. TIBC calculates how much or how little the transferrin in the body is carrying iron. A higher than normal TIBC is a sign of iron-deficiency anemia. A lower than normal level may indicate anemia of chronic disease, sickle cell, pernicious anemia, or hemolytic anemia.\nReticulocyte Count. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells, and their count reflects the rate of red blood cell production. The upper normal limit is about 100,000/mL.

Most doctors strongly discourage the use of low-iron formulas (less than 4.0 mg/L). Parents should discuss the best formula with their doctor. Children given iron supplements may have a slightly higher risk for diarrhea. Experts advise against cow's milk for the first year of life. When cereals are begun, they should be iron fortified.\nRecommendations for Toddlers. Toddlers who did not have iron supplements during infancy should be checked for iron deficiency. After the first year, children should be given a varied diet that is rich in sources of iron, B vitamins, and vitamin C. Milk does not contain enough iron and can decrease children's appetite for iron-rich foods. Toddlers older than 1 year should not drink more than 2 cups of milk a day. A preference for apple juice over vitamin-C rich orange juice does not reduce iron absorption in children with any otherwise healthy diet.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nOral iron supplements are the best way to restore iron levels for people who are iron deficient, but they should be used only when dietary measures have failed. However, iron supplements cannot correct anemias that are not due to iron deficiency.\nIron replacement therapy can cause gastrointestinal problems, sometimes severe ones. Excess iron may also contribute to heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Doctors generally advise against iron supplements in anyone with a healthy diet and no indications of iron deficiency anemia.\nTreatment of Anemia of Chronic Disease. In general, the best treatment for anemia of chronic diseases is treating the disease itself. In some cases, iron deficiency accompanies the condition and requires iron replacement. Erythropoietin, most often administered with intravenous iron, is used for some patients.\nOral Iron Supplements\nSupplement Forms. There are two forms of supplemental iron: ferrous and ferric. Ferrous iron is better absorbed and is the preferred form of iron tablets. Ferrous iron is available in three forms: ferrous fumarate, ferrous sulfate, and ferrous gluconate.\nThe label of an iron supplement contains information both on the tablet size (which is typically 325 mg) and the amount of elemental iron contained in the tablet (the amount of iron that is available for absorption by the body.) When selecting an iron supplement, it is important to look at the amount of elemental iron.\nA 325 mg iron supplement contains the following amounts of elemental iron depending on the type of iron:\nFerrous fumarate. 108 mg of elemental iron\nFerrous sulfate. 65 mg of elemental iron\nFerrous gluconate. 35 mg of elemental iron\nDosage. Depending on the severity of your anemia, as well as your age and weight, your doctor will recommend a dosage of 60 - 200 mg of elemental iron per day. This means taking one iron pill 2 - 3 time during the day. Make sure your doctor explains to you how many pills you should take in a day and when you should take them. Never take a double dose of iron.\nSide Effects and Safety. Common side effects of iron supplements include:\nConstipation and diarrhea are very common. They are rarely severe, although iron tablets can aggravate existing gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers and ulcerative colitis.\nNausea and vomiting may occur with high doses, but can be controlled by taking smaller amounts. Switching to ferrous gluconate may help some people with severe gastrointestinal problems.\nBlack stools are normal when taking iron tablets. In fact, if they do not turn black, the tablets may not be working effectively. This tends to be a more common problem with coated or long-acting iron tablets.\nIf the stools are tarry looking as well as black, if they have red streaks, or if cramps, sharp pains, or soreness in the stomach occur, gastrointestinal bleeding may be causing the iron deficiency and the patient should call the doctor promptly.\nAcute iron poisoning is rare in adults but can be fatal in children who take adult-strength tablets. Keep iron supplements out of the reach of children. If your child swallows an iron pill, immediately contact a poison control center.\nOther Tips for Safety and Effectiveness. Other tips for taking iron are as follows:\nFor best absorption, iron should be taken between meals. Iron may cause stomach and intestinal disturbances, however. Low doses of ferrous sulfate can be taken with food and are still absorbed but with fewer side effects.)\nDrink a full 8 ounces of fluid with an iron pill. Taking orange juice with an iron pill can help increase iron absorption. (Some doctors also recommend taking a vitamin C supplement with the iron pill.)\nIf constipation becomes a problem, take a stool softener such as docusate sodium (Colace).\nCertain medications, including antacids, can reduce iron absorption. Iron tablets may also reduce the effectiveness of other drugs, including the antibiotics tetracycline, penicillamine, and ciprofloxacin and the Parkinson's disease drugs methyldopa, levodopa, and carbidopa. At least 2 hours should elapse between doses of these drugs and iron supplements.\nAvoid taking milk, caffeine, antacids, or calcium supplements at the same time as an iron pill as they can interfere with iron absorption.\nTablets should be kept in a cool place. (Bathroom medicine cabinets may be too warm and humid, which may cause the pills to disintegrate.)\nFull recovery takes 6 - 8 weeks. Recovery will take longer in people with internal bleeding that is not under control. Iron replacement therapy must continue for about 6 months, even if anemia has been reversed. Treatment must be continued indefinitely for people with chronic bleeding; in such cases, iron levels should be closely monitored.\nIntravenous or Injected Iron\nIn some cases, iron is administered through muscular injections or intravenously. Intravenous iron has the advantage of causing less gastrointestinal discomfort and inconvenience. It may be in the form of iron dextran (Dexferrum, InFed), sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose (Ferrlecit), or iron sucrose (Venofer). Ferrlecit or Venofer are proving to be at least equally effective and safer than iron dextran.\nCandidates. The injected or intravenous forms should be limited to the following patients with iron deficiency:\nPeople with iron deficiency anemia in whom oral therapy has clearly failed.\nPatients with bleeding disorders in which blood loss continues to exceed the rate at which oral iron is absorbed.\nIn emergencies, when people need red blood cells but transfusion is not appropriate or available.\nIn people with serious gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, who cannot take iron therapy by mouth.\nPeople undergoing hemodialysis who receive supplemental erythropoietin therapy. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose (Ferrlecit) or iron sucrose (Venofer) is specifically approved as first-line therapy for these patients.\nCertain patients, even if they meet these qualifications, may not be appropriate candidates or should be monitored closely for complications. They include:\nPatients with any underlying autoimmune disease.\nMalnourished patients who also have an underlying infection.\nPatients who are at risk for iron overload.\nSide Effects. Some side effects differ depending on how the iron is administered and include the following:\nMuscular injections include pain at the site.\nIntravenous administration can cause pain in the vein, flushing, and metallic taste, all of which are brief.\nFor both methods, side effects and serious complications can include:\nBlood clots\n"}, {"score": 484.0424, "uuid": "d03a4558-aa5c-5223-8588-267d7e6eb60d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0610wb-60-10359", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/Stroke", "page_rank": 1.2315468e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Stroke Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Clopidogrel may be used if <em>aspirin</em> cannot be taken but it <em>is</em> not <em>better</em> than <em>aspirin</em>.

These guidelines emphasize that patients should lower their LDL ('bad') cholesterol and recommend that more people take LDL-lowering medication. Lowering LDL cholesterol and raising HDL ('good') cholesterol can significantly reduce the risks of heart disease, including stroke.\nThe doctor will start or consider medication, increase dosage of medication, or add new medication when:\nLDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL or higher.\nLDL cholesterol is 160 mg/dL or higher AND patient has one risk factor for heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol is 130 mg/dL or higher AND patient has either diabetes or two other risk factors for heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol is 100 mg/dL or higher AND patient has heart disease or any other form of atherosclerosis. (If patient has diabetes, even without heart disease, medication may be considered for an LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL.)\nLDL cholesterol is greater than 70 mg/dL AND patient has had a recent heart attack or has known heart disease along with diabetes, current cigarette smoking, poorly controlled high blood pressure, or the metabolic syndrome (high triglycerides, low HDL, and obesity).\nRisk factors for heart disease include:\nHaving a first-degree female relative diagnosed with heart disease before age 65 or a first-degree male relative diagnosed before age 55\nBeing male and over age 45 or female and over age 55\nCigarette smoking\nHigh blood pressure\nMetabolic syndrome (risk factors associated with obesity such as low HDL levels and high triglycerides)\nStatins have become the most important LDL-lowering drugs. Brands include lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), fluvastatin (Lescol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Research increasingly suggests that lowering LDL levels as much as possible is critical for preventing stroke and other heart disease problems. Analysis of data from many studies indicate that statins reduced the risk for heart problems by 60% and stroke by 17 - 25%.\nStatins are proven to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in people at increased risk for heart disease. (However, statins can increase the risk for the less-common hemorrhagic type of stroke.) Research suggests that they may also prevent stroke in patients without heart disease. However, current guidelines recommend that statins should be prescribed to patients without heart disease or high LDL ('bad' cholesterol) levels only if diabetes or other heart disease risk factors are also present.\nResearchers are also investigating whether statins might be beneficial in preventing a second stroke in patients who have suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Recent studies indicate that high-dose statin therapy may help reduce the risk of stroke recurrence and other heart events for patients who have had a prior stroke or TIA.\n[For more information, see In-Depth Report #23: Cholesterol .]\nAtrial Fibrillation and Its Treatments\nAs discussed previously, patients with chronic or recurrent atrial fibrillation are treated with aspirin or warfarin) to prevent clots from forming. Attempts to restore or maintain normal heart rhythm may be attempted with anti-arrhythmic drugs, cardioversion procedures, or surgery to remove the defective area. However, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation often occur. Simply controlling the heart rate is increasingly considered the preferable approach for many patients.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nPreventing a major stroke in people who experience transient ischemic attacks or small strokes requires determining the source of such attacks. A complete blood count, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram are usually performed.\nExamining the Carotid Artery. The doctor examines the carotid artery to determine if it is severely narrowed. If so, the patient is in danger of a major stroke. (The thickness of the carotid artery is also an important indicator for long-term risks for stroke, as well as heart disease and mortality rates in general.)\nThe doctor may use a number of approaches to determine the thickness of the artery.\nPhysical Examination. An important clue to a blocked carotid artery is a bruit. This is a whooshing sound caused by blood flow turbulence in the narrowed artery. A doctor may be able to hear a bruit using a stethoscope. Occasionally, even a patient can hear the sound. The presence of a bruit, however, is not necessarily a sign of an impending stroke, nor does the absence of a bruit indicate an unblocked artery.\nCarotid Ultrasound or Duplex. Carotid ultrasound is a very valuable tool for measuring the width of the artery and how the blood flows through it. Severely blocked carotid arteries (a condition called carotid stenosis) may distort some measurements, so other tests may be required to confirm the results. Possible reasons to perform this test include:\nWhen the doctor hears a bruit over the patient's carotid artery during the physical exam\nAfter a patient has had a TIA or a stroke\nTo monitor patients who are known to have blockage (stenosis) in their carotid arteries\nScreening of the general population with carotid duplex to identify those with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has not been studied in a randomized trial and is generally not recommended.\nGeneral Guidelines for Diagnosing a Major Stroke\nIdentifying a Stroke Quickly. To save a patient's life, a fast diagnosis of both the presence and type of stroke is critical. Health professionals have devised different tests to help emergency workers quickly identify a person with stroke even before they reach the hospital. For example, an assessment tool called Face, Arms, Speech, Time (FAST) is highly accurate. It involves watching for the following signs:\n(F)ACE. Ask the person to smile. Check to see if one side of the face droops.\n(A)RMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward.\n(S)PEECH. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Check to see if words are slurred and if the sentence is repeated correctly.\n(T)IME. If a person shows any of these symptoms, time is essential. It is important to get to the hospital as quickly as possible. Call 9-1-1. Act FAST.\nDetermining Ischemia Versus Hemorrhagic Stroke. Once a stroke has been identified, the next important step is to determine as quickly as possible whether it is hemorrhagic or ischemic. Clot-busting drug therapies can be life-saving for ischemic stroke patients, but they are effective only in the first 3 hours. In addition, they cause bleeding and can be lethal if the stroke is caused by a hemorrhage.\nRuling Out Other Disorders. In most cases of stroke, the diagnosis is evident although a number of conditions may cause similar symptoms. These include seizures, infections that cause mental confusion, syncope (fainting), hypoglycemia, and brain tumors.\nDiagnostic Tests Used for Stroke and Risk Factors for Stroke\nComputed Tomography. A computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for identifying or ruling out hemorrhagic strokes. The goal is to complete the CT examination and obtain and interpret the results within 45 minutes of arrival at the hospital. (An ultrasound technique called transcranial duplex sonography may be sensitive enough to differentiate between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes if CT scans are not available.)\nCertain factors suggest a hemorrhagic rather than ischemic stroke. They include specific symptoms (coma, vomiting, and severe headache), taking anticoagulants, very high systolic blood pressure, or high blood sugar levels in nondiabetics. However, such findings are not conclusive, and a CT scan or MRI is always needed.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI uses a magnetic field to provide 3-dimensional images of the brain. The MRI appears to work especially well for detecting ischemic stroke (stroke caused by blood clot) and is considered more accurate for detecting ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset (an important timeframe for delivering clotbuster drugs) in 46% of patients compared to only 7% for CT. Both MRI and CT perform similarly for detecting strokes caused by bleeding.\nA computed tomography (CT) test uses x-ray images to take pictures of the skull and brain. Sometimes a dye is injected into a patient's veins to enhance image contrast. Although research indicates that MRI is better in determining ischemic stroke, CT still may be useful in diagnosing hemorrhagic strokes. CT scans can generally be performed within a shorter period of time when needed to help make a quick decision about therapy. If it is performed first and the results are negative, patients who have suspicious signs or symptoms of stroke will often also receive an MRI soon after.\nTranscranial Ultrasound. Transcranial duplex sonography can identify blockage in large arteries in stroke patients and monitor the effects of thrombolytic therapy.\nCerebral Angiography. Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure that may be used for patients with TIAs who need surgery. It can also detect aneurysms and monitor thrombolytic therapy. It requires the insertion of a catheter into the groin, which is then threaded up through the arteries to the base of the carotid artery. At this point a dye is injected, and x-rays, CTs, or MRI scans determine the location and extent of the narrowing, or stenosis, of the artery. In people with TIAs the risk of stroke itself increases using this technique, particularly in elderly people with diabetes.\nMagnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Computerized Tomography Angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography and computerized tomography angiography are noninvasive ways of evaluating the carotid arteries and the arteries in the brain. In many situations, these tests can be used instead of cerebral angiography, an invasive procedure which carries a risk for bleeding in stroke.\nOther Techniques. Other imaging tests, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), may also help the doctor identify injuries caused by the stroke.\nHeart Evaluation\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). A heart evaluation using an electrocardiogram (ECG) is important in any patient with a stroke or suspected stroke. An ECG records the electrical current in the heart muscle.\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses ultrasound to view the chambers and valves of the heart. It is generally useful for stroke patients to identify blood clots or risk factors for blood clots that can travel to the brain and cause stroke. There two are types:\nTransthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) view the heart through the chest. It is noninvasive and is the standard approach.\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) examines the heart using an ultrasound tube that the patient literally swallows and passes down the throat. It is uncomfortable and requires sedation. It is typically used to obtain more accurate images of the heart if a TTE has suggested abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation or patent foramen ovale (PFO).\nABCD2 Score\nPatients who have a TIA are at increased risk for a major stroke in the days and weeks that follow. The ABCD2 score is a tool that helps doctors predict short-term stroke risk following a TIA. The ABCD2 score assigns points for various factors, including:\nAge (over 60 years)\nBlood pressure (greater or equal to 140/90 mm Hg)\nClinical features (weakness on one side of the body, speech impairment without weakness)\nDuration of TIA symptoms (at least 60 minutes)\nDiabetes\nBased on the number of points, a doctor can identify whether a patient is at low, moderate, or high risk of having a stroke within 2 days after a TIA. Several 2006 and 2007 studies indicated that the ABCD2 score works well in predicting stroke, and can help doctors better decide which patients need hospitalization and emergency care.\nOther Tests\nBlood Tests. Several blood tests may help predict the risk for a stroke and determine the severity and complications of an existing stroke.\nSpecific blood tests are important to determine clotting times, to check electrolytes (potassium, calcium, sodium), and to measure factors indicating liver or kidney problems. Kidney tests measure blood proteins that are filtered through the kidneys. These proteins include creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A more recent type of kidney test measures the protein cystatin C. Recent research suggests that the cystatin C kidney test may be better at predicting cardiovascular risks in elderly patients.\nBlood sugar (glucose) levels are measured. Hyperglycemia (high levels) may indicate a worse outcome for some strokes (although not hemorrhagic or lacunar strokes). Hypoglycemia (low levels) is a common complication of diabetes treatments, and its symptoms may mimic those of a stroke.\nExamination of Spinal Fluid. If the CT scan is negative but the doctor still suspects a subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke, a spinal tap may be performed. Spinal fluid containing significant amounts of blood will usually confirm a hemorrhagic stroke.\nBack to Top\nManaging a Stroke\nUntil recently, the treatment of stroke was restricted to basic life support at the time of the stroke and rehabilitation later. Now, however, treatments can be beneficial when administered as soon as possible after the onset of the stroke. It is critical to get to the hospital and be diagnosed as soon as possible. There are several steps in the initial assessment and management of a person with a stroke.\nGet to the Hospital Immediately\nIf symptoms appear that suggest a stroke is occurring, calling 911 is critical (as opposed to calling the family doctor or trying to get the patient to the hospital by car). Receiving treatment early is essential in reducing the damage from a stroke.\nImmediate Diagnosis and Evaluation of the Patient\nImportant diagnostic and evaluation steps are needed for the optimal treatment of a stroke patient:\nDetermining Whether the Stroke Is Ischemic or Hemorrhagic. As soon as the patient enters the hospital, diagnostic tests, particularly a CT scan, should be performed to determine whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, and how extensive the stroke may be.\nDetermining The Need for Thrombolytic Drugs. If the stroke is ischemic, the next step is to determine if the patient would benefit from blood clot-busting drugs (called thrombolytics). The following factors are important for making this decision:\nTime is critical in the decision-making process. Clot-buster drugs do not generally help if given more than 3 hours after stroke onset. Onset is when the patient first experiences any symptoms, even minor impairment. If the patient had a previous TIA that completely resolved before the stroke, however, onset is dated from when the more recent symptoms developed.\nRisk factors for administering thrombolytic drugs include having recently taken a blood thinning drug, any accompanying medical or physical condition, and any recent event (such as surgery or injury) that may contribute to the condition.\nSupportive Treatment for Acute Stroke\nThe patient should receive treatment to support basic life functions and to reduce stress, pain, and agitation. The following steps are also very important:\nMaintaining Adequate Delivery of Oxygen. It is very important to maintain oxygen levels. In some cases, airway ventilation may be required. Supplemental oxygen may also be necessary for patients when tests suggest low blood levels of oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen administered under pressure) therapy for acute stroke has been evaluated some, but there is no strong evidence from high-quality clinical trials that hyperbaric oxygen is beneficial.\nManaging Fever and Lowering Body Temperature (Hypothermia). Fever should be aggressively treated, since its presence predicts a poorer outlook. Some evidence suggests that hypothermia -- reducing body temperature to below normal -- might protect nerve cells in stroke patients. Cooling is done through special cooling blankets, ventilators, or infusion of cool fluids. Unfortunately, severe side effects occur with even moderate hypothermia (86\u00b0 F, 30\u00b0 C), which can include pneumonia, blood clotting disorders, heart rhythm disturbances, and others.\nMaintain Electrolytes. Maintaining a healthy electrolyte balance (the ratio of sodium, calcium, and potassium in the body's fluids) is critical.\nManaging Blood Pressure. Managing blood pressure is essential and complicated. Patients with stroke and pressures above 220 (systolic) or 120 (diastolic) should be treated. Lowering blood pressure too quickly can be dangerous, however, in patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In general, experts do not advise aggressively lowering elevated pressures below 220/120 mm Hg in patients unless they have other conditions, such as a heart attack, that require pressure-lowering treatments. In patients who need thrombolytic drugs, blood pressure should cautiously be lowered to 185/110 mm Hg. In most cases, blood pressure declines when these patients become stabilized.\nManaging Increased Brain Pressure. Hospital staff should watch carefully for evidence of increased pressure on the brain, which is a frequent complication of hemorrhagic strokes. It can also occur a few days after ischemic strokes. Early symptoms of increased brain pressure are drowsiness, confusion, lethargy, weakness, and headache. Medications such as mannitol may be given during a stroke to reduce pressure or the risk for it.\nKeeping the top of the body higher than the lower part, such as by elevating the head of the bed, can reduce pressure in the brain and is standard practice for patients with ischemic stroke. However, this practice also lowers blood pressure in general, which may be dangerous for patients with massive stroke.\nMonitoring the Heart. Heart attack and arrhythmias are potential complications of ischemic stroke. Patients must be monitored using electrocardiographic tracings.\nControlling Glucose Levels. Elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels can occur with severe stroke and may be a marker of serious trouble. In general, it is advisable to lower glucose levels that are about 300 mg/dL, usually with insulin. It is not clear, however, if glucose-lowering treatments offer any advantage. Excessive lowering of glucose levels can have damaging effects on the brain. Studies are underway to determine the best approach.\nMedications\nThrombolytics\nIntravenous Thrombolytics. Clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs break up existing blood clots. They are among the important treatments for heart attacks, and are now also used for ischemic (not hemorrhagic) stroke. While research has confirmed that early treatment with thrombolytics can greatly increase a stroke patient's chances for recovery, their use has been limited due to the short treatment window (within 3 hours of onset of stroke symptoms). The standard thrombolytic drugs are tissue plasminogen activators (t-PAs). They include alteplase (Activase) and reteplase (Retavase).\nThe following steps are critical before administering these clot-buster drugs:\nBefore the thrombolytic is given, a CT scan must first confirm that the stroke is not hemorrhagic. If the stroke is ischemic, a CT scan can also suggest if injuries are very extensive, which might affect the use of thrombolytics.\nThrombolytics must be administered within 3 hours of a stroke to have any effect. Best results are achieved if patients are treated with 90 minutes of a stroke. Unfortunately, most stroke patients arrive at the hospital more than 3 hours after an attack and therefore are not eligible for treatment. There is some evidence that t-PA administered withing 4 hours may also be effective, but more research needs to be conducted. These findings underscore the critical need for people to go to a hospital immediately if a stroke is suspected.\nThrombolytics carry a risk for hemorrhage, so they may not be appropriate for patients with existing risk factors for bleeding. They should not be used in patients who are experiencing seizures. The drug may be appropriate in more patients than previously thought, however, including older people, those with a history of stroke, and those with high blood pressure.\nIntra-Arterial Thrombolytics. Researchers are investigating thrombolytics injected directly into an artery in the brain. Early studies suggest this approach may allow effective treatment up to 6 hours after a stroke and improve recovery in more patients. The risk for bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke is significantly increased, however.\nNatural Defibronogenerating Drugs. These drugs deplete the amount of fibrinogen in blood, which in turn reduces the \"stickiness\" in blood. Such drugs include ancrod and batroxobin (Defibrase), both derived from the venom of poisonous snakes. They are being evaluated as a possible alternative to thrombolytics. Studies have not consistently shown benefit or a clearer role for these drugs in the treatment of acute stroke. As with all anti-clotting drugs, there is a higher risk for hemorrhage, but it appears to be slight.\nGlycoprotein IIB/IIIa Inhibitors. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors are sometimes administered intravenously in the hospital and include abciximab (ReoPro, Centocor), eptifibatide (Integrilin), tirofiban (Aggrastat), lotrafiban, and lamifiban. They are being investigated alone or as additions to thrombolytic (clot-busting) drugs at the time of an acute stroke.\nAntiplatelets and Anticoagulant Medications\nAspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) are used for prevention of stroke. (For more information, see the Prevention section in this report.)\nAnticoagulants thin blood and may be useful under certain circumstances. These medicines include:\nWarfarin. The anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin) may not work as well as aspirin in preventing a second stroke in people who have partial artery blockage in the brain (intracranial stenosis). Warfarin is, however, very important in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation. It may be useful in other situations, such as patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO), those whose stroke followed a heart attack, or in high-risk patients who cannot take antiplatelet drugs.\nHeparin. Intravenous heparin, a potent anti-platelet drug, has been used for ischemic stroke since 1941. Although many doctors continue to use it, five out of six major studies have reported no clear protective benefits for the use of standard heparin or heparin-like drugs compared to aspirin. These medicines also pose a much higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Experts now recommend heparins only for preventing thromboembolism in stroke patients at risk for this condition.\nDirect Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs). Direct thrombin inhibitors are a more recent group of anti-coagulants. The first DTI is hirudin, a natural substance derived from the saliva of leeches. New forms include argatroban (Novastan), bivalirudin (Angiomax), danaparoid (Orgaran), lepirudin (Refludan), and desirudin (Revasc).\nAll anti-clotting drugs carry a risk for bleeding and a slightly increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke.\nOther Medications for Preventing a Recurring Stroke\nIt is important that patients control their high blood pressure and LDL ('bad') cholesterol levels. Various drugs, such as statins, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, can manage these conditions. People with diabetes should also maintain tight control of their blood sugar levels.\nDrugs for Hemorrhagic Stroke\nCalcium Channel Blockers. Early administration of calcium channel blockers, such as nimodipine (Nimotop), can improve functional outcome. One of the most common and serious dangers after a subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke is spasm of the blood vessels near the ruptured site, which closes off oxygen to the brain. Calcium causes contraction of the smooth muscles of the blood vessels; calcium channel blockers are drugs that relax the blood vessels. The drugs work best if they are administered within 6 hours of the stroke. Calcium channel blockers are not useful for ischemic strokes, although they can be used in combinations with blood pressure lowering drugs to prevent them.\nSurgery\nCarotid Endarterectomy\nCarotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that cleans out and opens up the narrowed carotid artery. It is used in patients at high risk for thrombotic ischemic strokes, which are caused by blockages in the internal carotid artery. It is also sometimes used after a stroke. In such cases, patients have reported improvements in vision, speech, swallowing, functioning of arms and legs, and general quality of life.\nThere is a risk of a heart attack or stroke from the procedure. Anyone undergoing this procedure should be sure their surgeon is experienced in recent techniques and that the medical center has complication rates of less than 6%. A 2000 study reported that older surgeons had a worse record than younger ones, possibly because they relied on residents or were less likely to adopt new procedures.\nProcedure Description. The procedure generally is as follows:\nThe patient is usually given general anesthesia, although it has been reported that using local anesthetic is just as safe and reduces the cost of the procedure.\nA bypass tube is put in place to transport blood around the blocked area during the procedure.\nThe surgeon scrapes away the plaque on the arterial wall.\nThe artery is sewn back together, and blood flow is restored.\nThe patient generally stays in the hospital for about 2 days. There is often a slight aching in the neck for about 2 weeks, and the patient should refrain as much as possible from turning the head during this period.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing surgery for unblocking carotid arteries.\nDetermining Who Should Have Surgery. An important factor in deciding which patients with carotid stenosis are the best candidates for surgery is whether or not they are having symptoms.\nCarotid stenosis may be identified when a carotid ultrasound is done to investigate findings on physical exam, such as a carotid bruit (a sound heard when a physician listens to the carotid artery in the neck with a stethoscope). If these patients are not having any symptoms, they have what is called asymptomatic carotid stenosis. If the carotid artery blockage is greater than 60%, surgery is considered an option since patients with this much blockage are at risk for a TIA or stroke in the future.\nHowever, carotid artery surgery has a risk of complications (stroke, heart attack, death) during surgery or in the period soon afterwards. Large, high-quality studies have evaluated this problem and compared surgical treatment with medical treatment (usually aspirin or clopidogrel). Most of these studies have found a small benefit for performing surgery in patients 40 - 75 years of age, but only when performed by surgeons who have demonstrated that they do not have a high rate of serious complications when performing the surgery.\nPatients with a history of stroke and evidence of severe stenosis (over 70% of the carotid artery is obstructed) can benefit from either carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. An experienced surgeon with a good track record is essential. Patients with mild stenosis (less than 50% obstruction) should not have endarterectomy; these patients do better with medications even if they have symptoms. For patients with moderate stenosis (50 - 69%), the decision to perform surgery needs to be determined on an individual basis.\nCarotid endarterectomy is generally not recommended for patients with acute stroke.\nCarotid Angioplasty and Stenting\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is being investigated as a less-invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy. It is based on the same principles as angiography done for heart disease.\nAn extremely thin catheter tube is inserted into an artery in the groin.\nIt is threaded through the circulatory system until it reaches the blocked area in the carotid artery.\nThe doctor either breaks up the clot or inflates a tiny balloon against the blood vessel walls (angioplasty).\nAfter temporarily inflating the balloon, the doctor typically leaves a circular wire mesh (stent) inside the vessel to keep it open.\nThis procedure carries a risk for an embolic stroke and other complications. At this time, it is being used in some centers as an alternative to endarterectomy in patients who cannot undergo endarterectomy, especially for patients with severe stenosis (blockage greater than 70%) and high surgical risk. Several studies published in 2006 suggested that CAS should be used only for patients with these types of conditions.\nExtracranial-Intracranial Bypass\nExtracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass has been under investigation for decades for ischemic stroke, but has had very mixed results, some extremely negative. With this procedure, a healthy artery in the scalp is rerouted to an area of the brain that was deprived of blood because of a blocked artery. This procedure is now sometimes used for patients with aneurysms. Some experts hope, however, that, in specific cases chosen via careful imaging and using the latest surgical techniques, EC-IC may prove to be helpful for some stroke patients.\nSurgery for Preventing and Treating Hemorrhagic Strokes\nSurgical Intervention of the Ruptured Aneurysms. In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke, surgery to block off the aneurysm is usually recommended within a few days of the stroke. The standard procedure is to clip the aneurysm and stop bleeding. Alternative approaches are promising.\nSurgical Intervention of Unruptured Aneurysms. With MRI of the brain being used in the evaluation and diagnosis of many neurologic disorders, many patients have cerebral aneurysms diagnosed incidentally. If an unruptured aneurysm is detected, patients should discuss all options with their doctor, including surgical repair. Unruptured aneurysms occur in 1 - 8% of the general population, however, and controversy exists over when to operate and on which patients.\nIn general, the decision rests on the size of the aneurysm, but uncertainty still exists. In one study, for example, the risk of rupture for aneurysms between 10 - 25 mm was quite low -- slightly less than 1% per year for both groups. Aneurysms over 25 mm, however, had a 6% chance of rupturing within a year. Studies have reported that in general, the risk for rupture is .05 - 2% a year, but recent evidence suggests that the risks may be even less.\nAneurysms can often cause symptoms, however, even if they do not rupture. Patients should discuss their particular risk factors carefully with their doctors. Individuals with arteriovenous malformation, a condition caused by abnormal associations between arteries and veins, should be monitored for the development of an aneurysm.\nClipping the Aneurysm. The standard surgical procedure for treating a ruptured aneurysm is to place a clip across the neck of the aneurysm, which blocks off bleeding. It is usually performed within the first 3 days. Getting to the aneurysm is often extremely difficult. Deep cooling of the body to stop circulation may be used to allow more time for the operation. Procedures that remove large portions of the bone in the skull are being developed to allow fast access. There is a relatively high risk for newly formed aneurysms, particularly after 9 years. Patients may want to discuss follow-up angiography to detect any new aneurysms 9 - 10 years after the procedure.\nTranscatheter Embolization for Sealing off the Aneurysm. Transcatheter embolization is a new technique for ruptured and unruptured aneurysms that is proving to be effective, although it is still investigational. The surgeon threads a thin tube through the artery leading to the aneurysm through which materials are passed to plug or obstruct the aneurysm. In one version of this procedure, the following occurs:\nA tiny platinum coil is inserted through the tube and positioned into the aneurysm.\nAn electric charge is passed through the coil to form blood clots.\nIn this case, blood clots benefit the patient by using the coil as a scaffold and sealing off the aneurysm.\nEmergency Surgery for Hemorrhagic Strokes. Emergency surgery for a hemorrhagic stroke involves locating and removing large blood clots. In the past, such procedures had little effect on survival. Advances, however, are improving outcomes when surgery is performed very early.\nBack to Top\nRecovery\nAfter a stroke, patients should take all necessary measures, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent another stroke. For those whose stroke was ischemic, aspirin, warfarin, or both will usually be prescribed.\nHaving a neurologist as the primary doctor after a stroke, rather than some other specialist or primary care doctor, significantly increases the chance for survival. Patients or their families should be persistent in requesting the best care possible during this important early period.\nReceiving initial treatment at a stroke unit, instead of a general ward, plays a strong role for better long-term quality of life. Rehabilitation services aimed at patients living at home are also very effective in improving independence. Patients or their families should seek patient advocates or support associations to ensure they receive the right care.\nReducing the Risk for Non-Neurologic Complications after a Stroke\nIn addition to problems brought on by neurologic damage, stroke patients are also at risk for other serious problems that reduce their chances for survival. They include:\nBlood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)\nPulmonary embolism (a blood clot that travels to the lungs)\nPneumonia\nWidespread infection\nHeart problems\nUrinary tract infections (a catheter is sometimes used in the first 48 hours after stroke to help with urinary retention, but if it is left in longer it can cause urinary tract infections)\nMeasures should be taken to monitor and treat patients for these important problems.\nCandidates for Rehabilitation\nIn all, 90% of stroke survivors experience varying degrees of improvement after rehabilitation. The current cost-cutting climate generates pressure to send elderly patients who have had a stroke directly to a nursing home rather than a rehabilitation first. Not all patients, however, need or benefit from formal rehabilitation:\nIf the stroke is severe, intensive training would not be helpful.\nIf the stroke is mild, patients often improve without rehabilitation.\nPositive factors that help predict good candidates for rehabilitation:\nA patient should be able to sit up for at least an hour.\nThe patient should be able to learn and be aware.\nSpasticity may be a good sign, because it indicates live nerve action.\nPatients who are able to move their shoulders or fingers within the first 3 weeks after having a stroke are more likely to recover the use of their hands than patients who cannot perform these movements. The ability to feel light pressure on the affected hand, however, makes no difference for future hand movement.\nFamily members or close friends are available to be active participants in the rehabilitation process.\nFactors that predict a poor response to rehabilitation:\nDysphagia (the inability to swallow) is associated with a higher mortality rate, possibly because of increased risk for infection and malnutrition. Dysphagic patients are given nutrition using a stomach tube or a feeding tube inserted down through the nose.\nIncontinence.\nThe inability to recognize nonspeech sounds that occur right after a stroke.\nA poor hand grip that is still present after 3 weeks is an indicator of severe problems.\nHaving had very severe seizures after the stroke.\nFactors that do not rule out rehabilitation:\nAbout 30% of patients experience aphasia (an impaired ability to speak). However, this disability does not necessarily affect the ability to think. Aphasia can also be temporary.\nAlthough confusion is common among people who have had strokes, partial or even complete recovery is very possible.\nSome Approaches to Rehabilitation\nPhysical therapy should be started as soon as the patient is stable, as early as 2 days after the stroke. Some patients will experience the fastest recovery in the first few days, but many will continue to improve for about 6 months or longer. Because stroke affects different parts of the brain, specific approaches to managing rehabilitation vary widely among individual patients:\nExercise program. Recent guidelines from the Veteran's Administration recommend that patients get back on their feet as soon as possible to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Patients should try to walk at least 50 feet a day. Assisted devices or bracing are sometimes used to help support the legs. Treadmill exercises can be very helpful for patients with mild-to-moderate dysfunction. Exercise should be tailored to the stroke survivor's physical condition and can include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and neuromuscular (coordination and balance) activities.\nRetraining muscles. Stretching and range-of-motion exercises are used to help treat spastic muscles. They can also help patients regain function in a paralyzed arm. Multiple techniques have been developed and studied. These include the Bilateral Arm Training with Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (BATRAC) technique, (which involves moving a bar with both arms in a sustained rhythmic pattern), and constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), which involves doing a series of repetitive exercises while the less functional arm is restrained.\nSpeech therapy and sign language. People who have had a stroke often have aphasia, a brain condition that makes it difficult to speak and understand language. Aphasia can come in many different forms. A person may be unable to speak at all, or just have difficulty saying the right word. Intense speech therapy after a stroke is important for recovery. Some experts recommend 9 hours a week of therapy for 3 months. A 2005 study indicated that a shorter period (3 hours a week for 10 days) also works well. Language skills improve the most when family and friends help reinforce the speech therapy lessons.\nSwallowing training. Training patients and their caregivers regarding swallowing techniques, as well as safe and not safe foods and liquids, is essential for preventing aspiration (accidental sucking in of food or fluids into the airway).\nAttention training. Problems with attention are very common after strokes. Direct retraining teaches patients to perform specific tasks using repetitive drills in response to certain stimuli. (For example, they are told to press a buzzer each time they hear a specific number.) A variant of this approach trains patients to relearn real-life skills, such as driving, carrying on a conversation, or other daily tasks.\nOccupational training. Occupational therapy is important and improves daily living activities and social participation.\nDrug Therapy for Rehabilitation\nDrug therapy can sometimes help relieve specific effects of stroke:\nDantrolene (Dantrium), tizanidine (Zanaflex), and baclofen (Lioresel) are used to treat spasticity.\nHeparin, a blood-thinning drug, is used to prevent blood clots from forming in the veins of the legs (thrombosis).\nSome patients experience constant hiccups, which can be very serious. Chlorpromazine and baclofen are among the drugs used for this condition.\nStudies have reported that dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate (Ritalin), an amphetamine used in attention deficit disorder, may help patients recover speech and motor skills when combined with physical therapy.\nCertain drugs commonly taken for conditions associated with stroke may actually slow recovery. They include drugs used for high blood pressure, including clonidine and prazosin, anticonvulsant drugs, the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, and anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines.\nManaging the Emotional Consequences\nThe Emotional State of the Patients. Strong motivation with the goal of independence after rehabilitation is important for recovery. Unfortunately, depression is very common after a stroke, both as a direct and indirect result of the stroke:\nStrokes that affect the right hemisphere in the brain increase the risk for depression.\nPatients can become depressed by the changes in their ability to function.\nA peculiar stroke-induced condition, known as post-stroke crying or neurologic emotionalism, is a neurologic not a psychologic disorder.\nIf depression is prolonged, it can interfere with recovery. One study showed that people who suffered strokes and became depressed were three times more likely to die within 10 years than stroke victims who were not depressed. There is a significantly increased risk of suicide in patients with stroke, especially in women and those under age 60.\nAntidepressants, particularly fluoxetine (Prozac) and similar so-called SSRI drugs, have been beneficial in relieving post-stroke crying as well as improving recovery in general and mood in particular. Antidepressants may also help restore mental abilities.\nSome doctors also recommend tricyclic antidepressants, which include amitriptyline (Elavil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor). In one study nortriptyline (Pamelor) not only improved mood but also had positive effects on mental functioning, suggesting perhaps that some dementia associated with stroke may actually be due to depression. Tricyclics may also be useful for neurologic emotionalism.\nAnxiety disorder is also common and debilitating. Some research indicates that many patients suffer from feelings identical to post-traumatic stress syndrome. The two disorders often overlap, but drug treatments for each differ and may offset the other.\nMany drugs for psychologic disorders affect the central nervous system and can delay rehabilitation. Skilled professional help is needed to determine the most effective and safest treatments.\nThe Emotional State of the Caregiver. The caregiver's emotions and responses to the patient are critical. Patients do worse when caregivers are depressed, overprotective, or not knowledgeable about the stroke. Unfortunately, in one study, over half of the caregivers themselves were depressed, particularly if the stroke victims were left with dementia or abnormal behavior.\n"}, {"score": 484.0424, "uuid": "89592b41-30d8-55a9-ad3f-117975622e48", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1402wb-24-17034", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Stroke", "page_rank": 1.1899493e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Stroke Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Clopidogrel may be used if <em>aspirin</em> cannot be taken but it <em>is</em> not <em>better</em> than <em>aspirin</em>.

These guidelines emphasize that patients should lower their LDL ('bad') cholesterol and recommend that more people take LDL-lowering medication. Lowering LDL cholesterol and raising HDL ('good') cholesterol can significantly reduce the risks of heart disease, including stroke.\nThe doctor will start or consider medication, increase dosage of medication, or add new medication when:\nLDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL or higher.\nLDL cholesterol is 160 mg/dL or higher AND patient has one risk factor for heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol is 130 mg/dL or higher AND patient has either diabetes or two other risk factors for heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol is 100 mg/dL or higher AND patient has heart disease or any other form of atherosclerosis. (If patient has diabetes, even without heart disease, medication may be considered for an LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL.)\nLDL cholesterol is greater than 70 mg/dL AND patient has had a recent heart attack or has known heart disease along with diabetes, current cigarette smoking, poorly controlled high blood pressure, or the metabolic syndrome (high triglycerides, low HDL, and obesity).\nRisk factors for heart disease include:\nHaving a first-degree female relative diagnosed with heart disease before age 65 or a first-degree male relative diagnosed before age 55\nBeing male and over age 45 or female and over age 55\nCigarette smoking\nHigh blood pressure\nMetabolic syndrome (risk factors associated with obesity such as low HDL levels and high triglycerides)\nStatins have become the most important LDL-lowering drugs. Brands include lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), fluvastatin (Lescol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Research increasingly suggests that lowering LDL levels as much as possible is critical for preventing stroke and other heart disease problems. Analysis of data from many studies indicate that statins reduced the risk for heart problems by 60% and stroke by 17 - 25%.\nStatins are proven to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in people at increased risk for heart disease. (However, statins can increase the risk for the less-common hemorrhagic type of stroke.) Research suggests that they may also prevent stroke in patients without heart disease. However, current guidelines recommend that statins should be prescribed to patients without heart disease or high LDL ('bad' cholesterol) levels only if diabetes or other heart disease risk factors are also present.\nResearchers are also investigating whether statins might be beneficial in preventing a second stroke in patients who have suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Recent studies indicate that high-dose statin therapy may help reduce the risk of stroke recurrence and other heart events for patients who have had a prior stroke or TIA.\n[For more information, see In-Depth Report #23: Cholesterol .]\nAtrial Fibrillation and Its Treatments\nAs discussed previously, patients with chronic or recurrent atrial fibrillation are treated with aspirin or warfarin) to prevent clots from forming. Attempts to restore or maintain normal heart rhythm may be attempted with anti-arrhythmic drugs, cardioversion procedures, or surgery to remove the defective area. However, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation often occur. Simply controlling the heart rate is increasingly considered the preferable approach for many patients.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nPreventing a major stroke in people who experience transient ischemic attacks or small strokes requires determining the source of such attacks. A complete blood count, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram are usually performed.\nExamining the Carotid Artery. The doctor examines the carotid artery to determine if it is severely narrowed. If so, the patient is in danger of a major stroke. (The thickness of the carotid artery is also an important indicator for long-term risks for stroke, as well as heart disease and mortality rates in general.)\nThe doctor may use a number of approaches to determine the thickness of the artery.\nPhysical Examination. An important clue to a blocked carotid artery is a bruit. This is a whooshing sound caused by blood flow turbulence in the narrowed artery. A doctor may be able to hear a bruit using a stethoscope. Occasionally, even a patient can hear the sound. The presence of a bruit, however, is not necessarily a sign of an impending stroke, nor does the absence of a bruit indicate an unblocked artery.\nCarotid Ultrasound or Duplex. Carotid ultrasound is a very valuable tool for measuring the width of the artery and how the blood flows through it. Severely blocked carotid arteries (a condition called carotid stenosis) may distort some measurements, so other tests may be required to confirm the results. Possible reasons to perform this test include:\nWhen the doctor hears a bruit over the patient's carotid artery during the physical exam\nAfter a patient has had a TIA or a stroke\nTo monitor patients who are known to have blockage (stenosis) in their carotid arteries\nScreening of the general population with carotid duplex to identify those with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has not been studied in a randomized trial and is generally not recommended.\nGeneral Guidelines for Diagnosing a Major Stroke\nIdentifying a Stroke Quickly. To save a patient's life, a fast diagnosis of both the presence and type of stroke is critical. Health professionals have devised different tests to help emergency workers quickly identify a person with stroke even before they reach the hospital. For example, an assessment tool called Face, Arms, Speech, Time (FAST) is highly accurate. It involves watching for the following signs:\n(F)ACE. Ask the person to smile. Check to see if one side of the face droops.\n(A)RMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward.\n(S)PEECH. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Check to see if words are slurred and if the sentence is repeated correctly.\n(T)IME. If a person shows any of these symptoms, time is essential. It is important to get to the hospital as quickly as possible. Call 9-1-1. Act FAST.\nDetermining Ischemia Versus Hemorrhagic Stroke. Once a stroke has been identified, the next important step is to determine as quickly as possible whether it is hemorrhagic or ischemic. Clot-busting drug therapies can be life-saving for ischemic stroke patients, but they are effective only in the first 3 hours. In addition, they cause bleeding and can be lethal if the stroke is caused by a hemorrhage.\nRuling Out Other Disorders. In most cases of stroke, the diagnosis is evident although a number of conditions may cause similar symptoms. These include seizures, infections that cause mental confusion, syncope (fainting), hypoglycemia, and brain tumors.\nDiagnostic Tests Used for Stroke and Risk Factors for Stroke\nComputed Tomography. A computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for identifying or ruling out hemorrhagic strokes. The goal is to complete the CT examination and obtain and interpret the results within 45 minutes of arrival at the hospital. (An ultrasound technique called transcranial duplex sonography may be sensitive enough to differentiate between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes if CT scans are not available.)\nCertain factors suggest a hemorrhagic rather than ischemic stroke. They include specific symptoms (coma, vomiting, and severe headache), taking anticoagulants, very high systolic blood pressure, or high blood sugar levels in nondiabetics. However, such findings are not conclusive, and a CT scan or MRI is always needed.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI uses a magnetic field to provide 3-dimensional images of the brain. The MRI appears to work especially well for detecting ischemic stroke (stroke caused by blood clot) and is considered more accurate for detecting ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset (an important timeframe for delivering clotbuster drugs) in 46% of patients compared to only 7% for CT. Both MRI and CT perform similarly for detecting strokes caused by bleeding.\nA computed tomography (CT) test uses x-ray images to take pictures of the skull and brain. Sometimes a dye is injected into a patient's veins to enhance image contrast. Although research indicates that MRI is better in determining ischemic stroke, CT still may be useful in diagnosing hemorrhagic strokes. CT scans can generally be performed within a shorter period of time when needed to help make a quick decision about therapy. If it is performed first and the results are negative, patients who have suspicious signs or symptoms of stroke will often also receive an MRI soon after.\nTranscranial Ultrasound. Transcranial duplex sonography can identify blockage in large arteries in stroke patients and monitor the effects of thrombolytic therapy.\nCerebral Angiography. Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure that may be used for patients with TIAs who need surgery. It can also detect aneurysms and monitor thrombolytic therapy. It requires the insertion of a catheter into the groin, which is then threaded up through the arteries to the base of the carotid artery. At this point a dye is injected, and x-rays, CTs, or MRI scans determine the location and extent of the narrowing, or stenosis, of the artery. In people with TIAs the risk of stroke itself increases using this technique, particularly in elderly people with diabetes.\nMagnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Computerized Tomography Angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography and computerized tomography angiography are noninvasive ways of evaluating the carotid arteries and the arteries in the brain. In many situations, these tests can be used instead of cerebral angiography, an invasive procedure which carries a risk for bleeding in stroke.\nOther Techniques. Other imaging tests, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), may also help the doctor identify injuries caused by the stroke.\nHeart Evaluation\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). A heart evaluation using an electrocardiogram (ECG) is important in any patient with a stroke or suspected stroke. An ECG records the electrical current in the heart muscle.\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses ultrasound to view the chambers and valves of the heart. It is generally useful for stroke patients to identify blood clots or risk factors for blood clots that can travel to the brain and cause stroke. There two are types:\nTransthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) view the heart through the chest. It is noninvasive and is the standard approach.\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) examines the heart using an ultrasound tube that the patient literally swallows and passes down the throat. It is uncomfortable and requires sedation. It is typically used to obtain more accurate images of the heart if a TTE has suggested abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation or patent foramen ovale (PFO).\nABCD2 Score\nPatients who have a TIA are at increased risk for a major stroke in the days and weeks that follow. The ABCD2 score is a tool that helps doctors predict short-term stroke risk following a TIA. The ABCD2 score assigns points for various factors, including:\nAge (over 60 years)\nBlood pressure (greater or equal to 140/90 mm Hg)\nClinical features (weakness on one side of the body, speech impairment without weakness)\nDuration of TIA symptoms (at least 60 minutes)\nDiabetes\nBased on the number of points, a doctor can identify whether a patient is at low, moderate, or high risk of having a stroke within 2 days after a TIA. Several 2006 and 2007 studies indicated that the ABCD2 score works well in predicting stroke, and can help doctors better decide which patients need hospitalization and emergency care.\nOther Tests\nBlood Tests. Several blood tests may help predict the risk for a stroke and determine the severity and complications of an existing stroke.\nSpecific blood tests are important to determine clotting times, to check electrolytes (potassium, calcium, sodium), and to measure factors indicating liver or kidney problems. Kidney tests measure blood proteins that are filtered through the kidneys. These proteins include creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A more recent type of kidney test measures the protein cystatin C. Recent research suggests that the cystatin C kidney test may be better at predicting cardiovascular risks in elderly patients.\nBlood sugar (glucose) levels are measured. Hyperglycemia (high levels) may indicate a worse outcome for some strokes (although not hemorrhagic or lacunar strokes). Hypoglycemia (low levels) is a common complication of diabetes treatments, and its symptoms may mimic those of a stroke.\nExamination of Spinal Fluid. If the CT scan is negative but the doctor still suspects a subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke, a spinal tap may be performed. Spinal fluid containing significant amounts of blood will usually confirm a hemorrhagic stroke.\nBack to Top\nManaging a Stroke\nUntil recently, the treatment of stroke was restricted to basic life support at the time of the stroke and rehabilitation later. Now, however, treatments can be beneficial when administered as soon as possible after the onset of the stroke. It is critical to get to the hospital and be diagnosed as soon as possible. There are several steps in the initial assessment and management of a person with a stroke.\nGet to the Hospital Immediately\nIf symptoms appear that suggest a stroke is occurring, calling 911 is critical (as opposed to calling the family doctor or trying to get the patient to the hospital by car). Receiving treatment early is essential in reducing the damage from a stroke.\nImmediate Diagnosis and Evaluation of the Patient\nImportant diagnostic and evaluation steps are needed for the optimal treatment of a stroke patient:\nDetermining Whether the Stroke Is Ischemic or Hemorrhagic. As soon as the patient enters the hospital, diagnostic tests, particularly a CT scan, should be performed to determine whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, and how extensive the stroke may be.\nDetermining The Need for Thrombolytic Drugs. If the stroke is ischemic, the next step is to determine if the patient would benefit from blood clot-busting drugs (called thrombolytics). The following factors are important for making this decision:\nTime is critical in the decision-making process. Clot-buster drugs do not generally help if given more than 3 hours after stroke onset. Onset is when the patient first experiences any symptoms, even minor impairment. If the patient had a previous TIA that completely resolved before the stroke, however, onset is dated from when the more recent symptoms developed.\nRisk factors for administering thrombolytic drugs include having recently taken a blood thinning drug, any accompanying medical or physical condition, and any recent event (such as surgery or injury) that may contribute to the condition.\nSupportive Treatment for Acute Stroke\nThe patient should receive treatment to support basic life functions and to reduce stress, pain, and agitation. The following steps are also very important:\nMaintaining Adequate Delivery of Oxygen. It is very important to maintain oxygen levels. In some cases, airway ventilation may be required. Supplemental oxygen may also be necessary for patients when tests suggest low blood levels of oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen administered under pressure) therapy for acute stroke has been evaluated some, but there is no strong evidence from high-quality clinical trials that hyperbaric oxygen is beneficial.\nManaging Fever and Lowering Body Temperature (Hypothermia). Fever should be aggressively treated, since its presence predicts a poorer outlook. Some evidence suggests that hypothermia -- reducing body temperature to below normal -- might protect nerve cells in stroke patients. Cooling is done through special cooling blankets, ventilators, or infusion of cool fluids. Unfortunately, severe side effects occur with even moderate hypothermia (86\u00b0 F, 30\u00b0 C), which can include pneumonia, blood clotting disorders, heart rhythm disturbances, and others.\nMaintain Electrolytes. Maintaining a healthy electrolyte balance (the ratio of sodium, calcium, and potassium in the body's fluids) is critical.\nManaging Blood Pressure. Managing blood pressure is essential and complicated. Patients with stroke and pressures above 220 (systolic) or 120 (diastolic) should be treated. Lowering blood pressure too quickly can be dangerous, however, in patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In general, experts do not advise aggressively lowering elevated pressures below 220/120 mm Hg in patients unless they have other conditions, such as a heart attack, that require pressure-lowering treatments. In patients who need thrombolytic drugs, blood pressure should cautiously be lowered to 185/110 mm Hg. In most cases, blood pressure declines when these patients become stabilized.\nManaging Increased Brain Pressure. Hospital staff should watch carefully for evidence of increased pressure on the brain, which is a frequent complication of hemorrhagic strokes. It can also occur a few days after ischemic strokes. Early symptoms of increased brain pressure are drowsiness, confusion, lethargy, weakness, and headache. Medications such as mannitol may be given during a stroke to reduce pressure or the risk for it.\nKeeping the top of the body higher than the lower part, such as by elevating the head of the bed, can reduce pressure in the brain and is standard practice for patients with ischemic stroke. However, this practice also lowers blood pressure in general, which may be dangerous for patients with massive stroke.\nMonitoring the Heart. Heart attack and arrhythmias are potential complications of ischemic stroke. Patients must be monitored using electrocardiographic tracings.\nControlling Glucose Levels. Elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels can occur with severe stroke and may be a marker of serious trouble. In general, it is advisable to lower glucose levels that are about 300 mg/dL, usually with insulin. It is not clear, however, if glucose-lowering treatments offer any advantage. Excessive lowering of glucose levels can have damaging effects on the brain. Studies are underway to determine the best approach.\nMedications\nThrombolytics\nIntravenous Thrombolytics. Clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs break up existing blood clots. They are among the important treatments for heart attacks, and are now also used for ischemic (not hemorrhagic) stroke. While research has confirmed that early treatment with thrombolytics can greatly increase a stroke patient's chances for recovery, their use has been limited due to the short treatment window (within 3 hours of onset of stroke symptoms). The standard thrombolytic drugs are tissue plasminogen activators (t-PAs). They include alteplase (Activase) and reteplase (Retavase).\nThe following steps are critical before administering these clot-buster drugs:\nBefore the thrombolytic is given, a CT scan must first confirm that the stroke is not hemorrhagic. If the stroke is ischemic, a CT scan can also suggest if injuries are very extensive, which might affect the use of thrombolytics.\nThrombolytics must be administered within 3 hours of a stroke to have any effect. Best results are achieved if patients are treated with 90 minutes of a stroke. Unfortunately, most stroke patients arrive at the hospital more than 3 hours after an attack and therefore are not eligible for treatment. There is some evidence that t-PA administered withing 4 hours may also be effective, but more research needs to be conducted. These findings underscore the critical need for people to go to a hospital immediately if a stroke is suspected.\nThrombolytics carry a risk for hemorrhage, so they may not be appropriate for patients with existing risk factors for bleeding. They should not be used in patients who are experiencing seizures. The drug may be appropriate in more patients than previously thought, however, including older people, those with a history of stroke, and those with high blood pressure.\nIntra-Arterial Thrombolytics. Researchers are investigating thrombolytics injected directly into an artery in the brain. Early studies suggest this approach may allow effective treatment up to 6 hours after a stroke and improve recovery in more patients. The risk for bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke is significantly increased, however.\nNatural Defibronogenerating Drugs. These drugs deplete the amount of fibrinogen in blood, which in turn reduces the \"stickiness\" in blood. Such drugs include ancrod and batroxobin (Defibrase), both derived from the venom of poisonous snakes. They are being evaluated as a possible alternative to thrombolytics. Studies have not consistently shown benefit or a clearer role for these drugs in the treatment of acute stroke. As with all anti-clotting drugs, there is a higher risk for hemorrhage, but it appears to be slight.\nGlycoprotein IIB/IIIa Inhibitors. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors are sometimes administered intravenously in the hospital and include abciximab (ReoPro, Centocor), eptifibatide (Integrilin), tirofiban (Aggrastat), lotrafiban, and lamifiban. They are being investigated alone or as additions to thrombolytic (clot-busting) drugs at the time of an acute stroke.\nAntiplatelets and Anticoagulant Medications\nAspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) are used for prevention of stroke. (For more information, see the Prevention section in this report.)\nAnticoagulants thin blood and may be useful under certain circumstances. These medicines include:\nWarfarin. The anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin) may not work as well as aspirin in preventing a second stroke in people who have partial artery blockage in the brain (intracranial stenosis). Warfarin is, however, very important in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation. It may be useful in other situations, such as patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO), those whose stroke followed a heart attack, or in high-risk patients who cannot take antiplatelet drugs.\nHeparin. Intravenous heparin, a potent anti-platelet drug, has been used for ischemic stroke since 1941. Although many doctors continue to use it, five out of six major studies have reported no clear protective benefits for the use of standard heparin or heparin-like drugs compared to aspirin. These medicines also pose a much higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Experts now recommend heparins only for preventing thromboembolism in stroke patients at risk for this condition.\nDirect Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs). Direct thrombin inhibitors are a more recent group of anti-coagulants. The first DTI is hirudin, a natural substance derived from the saliva of leeches. New forms include argatroban (Novastan), bivalirudin (Angiomax), danaparoid (Orgaran), lepirudin (Refludan), and desirudin (Revasc).\nAll anti-clotting drugs carry a risk for bleeding and a slightly increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke.\nOther Medications for Preventing a Recurring Stroke\nIt is important that patients control their high blood pressure and LDL ('bad') cholesterol levels. Various drugs, such as statins, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, can manage these conditions. People with diabetes should also maintain tight control of their blood sugar levels.\nDrugs for Hemorrhagic Stroke\nCalcium Channel Blockers. Early administration of calcium channel blockers, such as nimodipine (Nimotop), can improve functional outcome. One of the most common and serious dangers after a subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke is spasm of the blood vessels near the ruptured site, which closes off oxygen to the brain. Calcium causes contraction of the smooth muscles of the blood vessels; calcium channel blockers are drugs that relax the blood vessels. The drugs work best if they are administered within 6 hours of the stroke. Calcium channel blockers are not useful for ischemic strokes, although they can be used in combinations with blood pressure lowering drugs to prevent them.\nSurgery\nCarotid Endarterectomy\nCarotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that cleans out and opens up the narrowed carotid artery. It is used in patients at high risk for thrombotic ischemic strokes, which are caused by blockages in the internal carotid artery. It is also sometimes used after a stroke. In such cases, patients have reported improvements in vision, speech, swallowing, functioning of arms and legs, and general quality of life.\nThere is a risk of a heart attack or stroke from the procedure. Anyone undergoing this procedure should be sure their surgeon is experienced in recent techniques and that the medical center has complication rates of less than 6%. A 2000 study reported that older surgeons had a worse record than younger ones, possibly because they relied on residents or were less likely to adopt new procedures.\nProcedure Description. The procedure generally is as follows:\nThe patient is usually given general anesthesia, although it has been reported that using local anesthetic is just as safe and reduces the cost of the procedure.\nA bypass tube is put in place to transport blood around the blocked area during the procedure.\nThe surgeon scrapes away the plaque on the arterial wall.\nThe artery is sewn back together, and blood flow is restored.\nThe patient generally stays in the hospital for about 2 days. There is often a slight aching in the neck for about 2 weeks, and the patient should refrain as much as possible from turning the head during this period.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing surgery for unblocking carotid arteries.\nDetermining Who Should Have Surgery. An important factor in deciding which patients with carotid stenosis are the best candidates for surgery is whether or not they are having symptoms.\nCarotid stenosis may be identified when a carotid ultrasound is done to investigate findings on physical exam, such as a carotid bruit (a sound heard when a physician listens to the carotid artery in the neck with a stethoscope). If these patients are not having any symptoms, they have what is called asymptomatic carotid stenosis. If the carotid artery blockage is greater than 60%, surgery is considered an option since patients with this much blockage are at risk for a TIA or stroke in the future.\nHowever, carotid artery surgery has a risk of complications (stroke, heart attack, death) during surgery or in the period soon afterwards. Large, high-quality studies have evaluated this problem and compared surgical treatment with medical treatment (usually aspirin or clopidogrel). Most of these studies have found a small benefit for performing surgery in patients 40 - 75 years of age, but only when performed by surgeons who have demonstrated that they do not have a high rate of serious complications when performing the surgery.\nPatients with a history of stroke and evidence of severe stenosis (over 70% of the carotid artery is obstructed) can benefit from either carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. An experienced surgeon with a good track record is essential. Patients with mild stenosis (less than 50% obstruction) should not have endarterectomy; these patients do better with medications even if they have symptoms. For patients with moderate stenosis (50 - 69%), the decision to perform surgery needs to be determined on an individual basis.\nCarotid endarterectomy is generally not recommended for patients with acute stroke.\nCarotid Angioplasty and Stenting\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is being investigated as a less-invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy. It is based on the same principles as angiography done for heart disease.\nAn extremely thin catheter tube is inserted into an artery in the groin.\nIt is threaded through the circulatory system until it reaches the blocked area in the carotid artery.\nThe doctor either breaks up the clot or inflates a tiny balloon against the blood vessel walls (angioplasty).\nAfter temporarily inflating the balloon, the doctor typically leaves a circular wire mesh (stent) inside the vessel to keep it open.\nThis procedure carries a risk for an embolic stroke and other complications. At this time, it is being used in some centers as an alternative to endarterectomy in patients who cannot undergo endarterectomy, especially for patients with severe stenosis (blockage greater than 70%) and high surgical risk. Several studies published in 2006 suggested that CAS should be used only for patients with these types of conditions.\nExtracranial-Intracranial Bypass\nExtracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass has been under investigation for decades for ischemic stroke, but has had very mixed results, some extremely negative. With this procedure, a healthy artery in the scalp is rerouted to an area of the brain that was deprived of blood because of a blocked artery. This procedure is now sometimes used for patients with aneurysms. Some experts hope, however, that, in specific cases chosen via careful imaging and using the latest surgical techniques, EC-IC may prove to be helpful for some stroke patients.\nSurgery for Preventing and Treating Hemorrhagic Strokes\nSurgical Intervention of the Ruptured Aneurysms. In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke, surgery to block off the aneurysm is usually recommended within a few days of the stroke. The standard procedure is to clip the aneurysm and stop bleeding. Alternative approaches are promising.\nSurgical Intervention of Unruptured Aneurysms. With MRI of the brain being used in the evaluation and diagnosis of many neurologic disorders, many patients have cerebral aneurysms diagnosed incidentally. If an unruptured aneurysm is detected, patients should discuss all options with their doctor, including surgical repair. Unruptured aneurysms occur in 1 - 8% of the general population, however, and controversy exists over when to operate and on which patients.\nIn general, the decision rests on the size of the aneurysm, but uncertainty still exists. In one study, for example, the risk of rupture for aneurysms between 10 - 25 mm was quite low -- slightly less than 1% per year for both groups. Aneurysms over 25 mm, however, had a 6% chance of rupturing within a year. Studies have reported that in general, the risk for rupture is .05 - 2% a year, but recent evidence suggests that the risks may be even less.\nAneurysms can often cause symptoms, however, even if they do not rupture. Patients should discuss their particular risk factors carefully with their doctors. Individuals with arteriovenous malformation, a condition caused by abnormal associations between arteries and veins, should be monitored for the development of an aneurysm.\nClipping the Aneurysm. The standard surgical procedure for treating a ruptured aneurysm is to place a clip across the neck of the aneurysm, which blocks off bleeding. It is usually performed within the first 3 days. Getting to the aneurysm is often extremely difficult. Deep cooling of the body to stop circulation may be used to allow more time for the operation. Procedures that remove large portions of the bone in the skull are being developed to allow fast access. There is a relatively high risk for newly formed aneurysms, particularly after 9 years. Patients may want to discuss follow-up angiography to detect any new aneurysms 9 - 10 years after the procedure.\nTranscatheter Embolization for Sealing off the Aneurysm. Transcatheter embolization is a new technique for ruptured and unruptured aneurysms that is proving to be effective, although it is still investigational. The surgeon threads a thin tube through the artery leading to the aneurysm through which materials are passed to plug or obstruct the aneurysm. In one version of this procedure, the following occurs:\nA tiny platinum coil is inserted through the tube and positioned into the aneurysm.\nAn electric charge is passed through the coil to form blood clots.\nIn this case, blood clots benefit the patient by using the coil as a scaffold and sealing off the aneurysm.\nEmergency Surgery for Hemorrhagic Strokes. Emergency surgery for a hemorrhagic stroke involves locating and removing large blood clots. In the past, such procedures had little effect on survival. Advances, however, are improving outcomes when surgery is performed very early.\nBack to Top\nRecovery\nAfter a stroke, patients should take all necessary measures, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent another stroke. For those whose stroke was ischemic, aspirin, warfarin, or both will usually be prescribed.\nHaving a neurologist as the primary doctor after a stroke, rather than some other specialist or primary care doctor, significantly increases the chance for survival. Patients or their families should be persistent in requesting the best care possible during this important early period.\nReceiving initial treatment at a stroke unit, instead of a general ward, plays a strong role for better long-term quality of life. Rehabilitation services aimed at patients living at home are also very effective in improving independence. Patients or their families should seek patient advocates or support associations to ensure they receive the right care.\nReducing the Risk for Non-Neurologic Complications after a Stroke\nIn addition to problems brought on by neurologic damage, stroke patients are also at risk for other serious problems that reduce their chances for survival. They include:\nBlood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)\nPulmonary embolism (a blood clot that travels to the lungs)\nPneumonia\nWidespread infection\nHeart problems\nUrinary tract infections (a catheter is sometimes used in the first 48 hours after stroke to help with urinary retention, but if it is left in longer it can cause urinary tract infections)\nMeasures should be taken to monitor and treat patients for these important problems.\nCandidates for Rehabilitation\nIn all, 90% of stroke survivors experience varying degrees of improvement after rehabilitation. The current cost-cutting climate generates pressure to send elderly patients who have had a stroke directly to a nursing home rather than a rehabilitation first. Not all patients, however, need or benefit from formal rehabilitation:\nIf the stroke is severe, intensive training would not be helpful.\nIf the stroke is mild, patients often improve without rehabilitation.\nPositive factors that help predict good candidates for rehabilitation:\nA patient should be able to sit up for at least an hour.\nThe patient should be able to learn and be aware.\nSpasticity may be a good sign, because it indicates live nerve action.\nPatients who are able to move their shoulders or fingers within the first 3 weeks after having a stroke are more likely to recover the use of their hands than patients who cannot perform these movements. The ability to feel light pressure on the affected hand, however, makes no difference for future hand movement.\nFamily members or close friends are available to be active participants in the rehabilitation process.\nFactors that predict a poor response to rehabilitation:\nDysphagia (the inability to swallow) is associated with a higher mortality rate, possibly because of increased risk for infection and malnutrition. Dysphagic patients are given nutrition using a stomach tube or a feeding tube inserted down through the nose.\nIncontinence.\nThe inability to recognize nonspeech sounds that occur right after a stroke.\nA poor hand grip that is still present after 3 weeks is an indicator of severe problems.\nHaving had very severe seizures after the stroke.\nFactors that do not rule out rehabilitation:\nAbout 30% of patients experience aphasia (an impaired ability to speak). However, this disability does not necessarily affect the ability to think. Aphasia can also be temporary.\nAlthough confusion is common among people who have had strokes, partial or even complete recovery is very possible.\nSome Approaches to Rehabilitation\nPhysical therapy should be started as soon as the patient is stable, as early as 2 days after the stroke. Some patients will experience the fastest recovery in the first few days, but many will continue to improve for about 6 months or longer. Because stroke affects different parts of the brain, specific approaches to managing rehabilitation vary widely among individual patients:\nExercise program. Recent guidelines from the Veteran's Administration recommend that patients get back on their feet as soon as possible to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Patients should try to walk at least 50 feet a day. Assisted devices or bracing are sometimes used to help support the legs. Treadmill exercises can be very helpful for patients with mild-to-moderate dysfunction. Exercise should be tailored to the stroke survivor's physical condition and can include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and neuromuscular (coordination and balance) activities.\nRetraining muscles. Stretching and range-of-motion exercises are used to help treat spastic muscles. They can also help patients regain function in a paralyzed arm. Multiple techniques have been developed and studied. These include the Bilateral Arm Training with Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (BATRAC) technique, (which involves moving a bar with both arms in a sustained rhythmic pattern), and constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), which involves doing a series of repetitive exercises while the less functional arm is restrained.\nSpeech therapy and sign language. People who have had a stroke often have aphasia, a brain condition that makes it difficult to speak and understand language. Aphasia can come in many different forms. A person may be unable to speak at all, or just have difficulty saying the right word. Intense speech therapy after a stroke is important for recovery. Some experts recommend 9 hours a week of therapy for 3 months. A 2005 study indicated that a shorter period (3 hours a week for 10 days) also works well. Language skills improve the most when family and friends help reinforce the speech therapy lessons.\nSwallowing training. Training patients and their caregivers regarding swallowing techniques, as well as safe and not safe foods and liquids, is essential for preventing aspiration (accidental sucking in of food or fluids into the airway).\nAttention training. Problems with attention are very common after strokes. Direct retraining teaches patients to perform specific tasks using repetitive drills in response to certain stimuli. (For example, they are told to press a buzzer each time they hear a specific number.) A variant of this approach trains patients to relearn real-life skills, such as driving, carrying on a conversation, or other daily tasks.\nOccupational training. Occupational therapy is important and improves daily living activities and social participation.\nDrug Therapy for Rehabilitation\nDrug therapy can sometimes help relieve specific effects of stroke:\nDantrolene (Dantrium), tizanidine (Zanaflex), and baclofen (Lioresel) are used to treat spasticity.\nHeparin, a blood-thinning drug, is used to prevent blood clots from forming in the veins of the legs (thrombosis).\nSome patients experience constant hiccups, which can be very serious. Chlorpromazine and baclofen are among the drugs used for this condition.\nStudies have reported that dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate (Ritalin), an amphetamine used in attention deficit disorder, may help patients recover speech and motor skills when combined with physical therapy.\nCertain drugs commonly taken for conditions associated with stroke may actually slow recovery. They include drugs used for high blood pressure, including clonidine and prazosin, anticonvulsant drugs, the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, and anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines.\nManaging the Emotional Consequences\nThe Emotional State of the Patients. Strong motivation with the goal of independence after rehabilitation is important for recovery. Unfortunately, depression is very common after a stroke, both as a direct and indirect result of the stroke:\nStrokes that affect the right hemisphere in the brain increase the risk for depression.\nPatients can become depressed by the changes in their ability to function.\nA peculiar stroke-induced condition, known as post-stroke crying or neurologic emotionalism, is a neurologic not a psychologic disorder.\nIf depression is prolonged, it can interfere with recovery. One study showed that people who suffered strokes and became depressed were three times more likely to die within 10 years than stroke victims who were not depressed. There is a significantly increased risk of suicide in patients with stroke, especially in women and those under age 60.\nAntidepressants, particularly fluoxetine (Prozac) and similar so-called SSRI drugs, have been beneficial in relieving post-stroke crying as well as improving recovery in general and mood in particular. Antidepressants may also help restore mental abilities.\nSome doctors also recommend tricyclic antidepressants, which include amitriptyline (Elavil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor). In one study nortriptyline (Pamelor) not only improved mood but also had positive effects on mental functioning, suggesting perhaps that some dementia associated with stroke may actually be due to depression. Tricyclics may also be useful for neurologic emotionalism.\nAnxiety disorder is also common and debilitating. Some research indicates that many patients suffer from feelings identical to post-traumatic stress syndrome. The two disorders often overlap, but drug treatments for each differ and may offset the other.\nMany drugs for psychologic disorders affect the central nervous system and can delay rehabilitation. Skilled professional help is needed to determine the most effective and safest treatments.\nThe Emotional State of the Caregiver. The caregiver's emotions and responses to the patient are critical. Patients do worse when caregivers are depressed, overprotective, or not knowledgeable about the stroke. Unfortunately, in one study, over half of the caregivers themselves were depressed, particularly if the stroke victims were left with dementia or abnormal behavior.\n"}, {"score": 483.83636, "uuid": "395fc573-c4fa-586e-bd8e-d32489ab7147", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0303wb-69-00141", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/DiseasesandConditions/item/Stroke", "page_rank": 1.2632846e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Stroke Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Clopidogrel may be used if <em>aspirin</em> cannot be taken but it <em>is</em> not <em>better</em> than <em>aspirin</em>.

These guidelines emphasize that patients should lower their LDL ('bad') cholesterol and recommend that more people take LDL-lowering medication. Lowering LDL cholesterol and raising HDL ('good') cholesterol can significantly reduce the risks of heart disease, including stroke.\nThe doctor will start or consider medication, increase dosage of medication, or add new medication when:\nLDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL or higher.\nLDL cholesterol is 160 mg/dL or higher AND patient has one risk factor for heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol is 130 mg/dL or higher AND patient has either diabetes or two other risk factors for heart disease.\nLDL cholesterol is 100 mg/dL or higher AND patient has heart disease or any other form of atherosclerosis. (If patient has diabetes, even without heart disease, medication may be considered for an LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dL.)\nLDL cholesterol is greater than 70 mg/dL AND patient has had a recent heart attack or has known heart disease along with diabetes, current cigarette smoking, poorly controlled high blood pressure, or the metabolic syndrome (high triglycerides, low HDL, and obesity).\nRisk factors for heart disease include:\nHaving a first-degree female relative diagnosed with heart disease before age 65 or a first-degree male relative diagnosed before age 55\nBeing male and over age 45 or female and over age 55\nCigarette smoking\nHigh blood pressure\nMetabolic syndrome (risk factors associated with obesity such as low HDL levels and high triglycerides)\nStatins have become the most important LDL-lowering drugs. Brands include lovastatin (Mevacor), pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), fluvastatin (Lescol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Research increasingly suggests that lowering LDL levels as much as possible is critical for preventing stroke and other heart disease problems. Analysis of data from many studies indicate that statins reduced the risk for heart problems by 60% and stroke by 17 - 25%.\nStatins are proven to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in people at increased risk for heart disease. (However, statins can increase the risk for the less-common hemorrhagic type of stroke.) Research suggests that they may also prevent stroke in patients without heart disease. However, current guidelines recommend that statins should be prescribed to patients without heart disease or high LDL ('bad' cholesterol) levels only if diabetes or other heart disease risk factors are also present.\nResearchers are also investigating whether statins might be beneficial in preventing a second stroke in patients who have suffered a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Recent studies indicate that high-dose statin therapy may help reduce the risk of stroke recurrence and other heart events for patients who have had a prior stroke or TIA.\n[For more information, see In-Depth Report #23: Cholesterol .]\nAtrial Fibrillation and Its Treatments\nAs discussed previously, patients with chronic or recurrent atrial fibrillation are treated with aspirin or warfarin) to prevent clots from forming. Attempts to restore or maintain normal heart rhythm may be attempted with anti-arrhythmic drugs, cardioversion procedures, or surgery to remove the defective area. However, recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation often occur. Simply controlling the heart rate is increasingly considered the preferable approach for many patients.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nPreventing a major stroke in people who experience transient ischemic attacks or small strokes requires determining the source of such attacks. A complete blood count, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram are usually performed.\nExamining the Carotid Artery. The doctor examines the carotid artery to determine if it is severely narrowed. If so, the patient is in danger of a major stroke. (The thickness of the carotid artery is also an important indicator for long-term risks for stroke, as well as heart disease and mortality rates in general.)\nThe doctor may use a number of approaches to determine the thickness of the artery.\nPhysical Examination. An important clue to a blocked carotid artery is a bruit. This is a whooshing sound caused by blood flow turbulence in the narrowed artery. A doctor may be able to hear a bruit using a stethoscope. Occasionally, even a patient can hear the sound. The presence of a bruit, however, is not necessarily a sign of an impending stroke, nor does the absence of a bruit indicate an unblocked artery.\nCarotid Ultrasound or Duplex. Carotid ultrasound is a very valuable tool for measuring the width of the artery and how the blood flows through it. Severely blocked carotid arteries (a condition called carotid stenosis) may distort some measurements, so other tests may be required to confirm the results. Possible reasons to perform this test include:\nWhen the doctor hears a bruit over the patient's carotid artery during the physical exam\nAfter a patient has had a TIA or a stroke\nTo monitor patients who are known to have blockage (stenosis) in their carotid arteries\nScreening of the general population with carotid duplex to identify those with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has not been studied in a randomized trial and is generally not recommended.\nGeneral Guidelines for Diagnosing a Major Stroke\nIdentifying a Stroke Quickly. To save a patient's life, a fast diagnosis of both the presence and type of stroke is critical. Health professionals have devised different tests to help emergency workers quickly identify a person with stroke even before they reach the hospital. For example, an assessment tool called Face, Arms, Speech, Time (FAST) is highly accurate. It involves watching for the following signs:\n(F)ACE. Ask the person to smile. Check to see if one side of the face droops.\n(A)RMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward.\n(S)PEECH. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Check to see if words are slurred and if the sentence is repeated correctly.\n(T)IME. If a person shows any of these symptoms, time is essential. It is important to get to the hospital as quickly as possible. Call 9-1-1. Act FAST.\nDetermining Ischemia Versus Hemorrhagic Stroke. Once a stroke has been identified, the next important step is to determine as quickly as possible whether it is hemorrhagic or ischemic. Clot-busting drug therapies can be life-saving for ischemic stroke patients, but they are effective only in the first 3 hours. In addition, they cause bleeding and can be lethal if the stroke is caused by a hemorrhage.\nRuling Out Other Disorders. In most cases of stroke, the diagnosis is evident although a number of conditions may cause similar symptoms. These include seizures, infections that cause mental confusion, syncope (fainting), hypoglycemia, and brain tumors.\nDiagnostic Tests Used for Stroke and Risk Factors for Stroke\nComputed Tomography. A computed tomography (CT) scan is essential for identifying or ruling out hemorrhagic strokes. The goal is to complete the CT examination and obtain and interpret the results within 45 minutes of arrival at the hospital. (An ultrasound technique called transcranial duplex sonography may be sensitive enough to differentiate between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes if CT scans are not available.)\nCertain factors suggest a hemorrhagic rather than ischemic stroke. They include specific symptoms (coma, vomiting, and severe headache), taking anticoagulants, very high systolic blood pressure, or high blood sugar levels in nondiabetics. However, such findings are not conclusive, and a CT scan or MRI is always needed.\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI uses a magnetic field to provide 3-dimensional images of the brain. The MRI appears to work especially well for detecting ischemic stroke (stroke caused by blood clot) and is considered more accurate for detecting ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset (an important timeframe for delivering clotbuster drugs) in 46% of patients compared to only 7% for CT. Both MRI and CT perform similarly for detecting strokes caused by bleeding.\nA computed tomography (CT) test uses x-ray images to take pictures of the skull and brain. Sometimes a dye is injected into a patient's veins to enhance image contrast. Although research indicates that MRI is better in determining ischemic stroke, CT still may be useful in diagnosing hemorrhagic strokes. CT scans can generally be performed within a shorter period of time when needed to help make a quick decision about therapy. If it is performed first and the results are negative, patients who have suspicious signs or symptoms of stroke will often also receive an MRI soon after.\nTranscranial Ultrasound. Transcranial duplex sonography can identify blockage in large arteries in stroke patients and monitor the effects of thrombolytic therapy.\nCerebral Angiography. Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure that may be used for patients with TIAs who need surgery. It can also detect aneurysms and monitor thrombolytic therapy. It requires the insertion of a catheter into the groin, which is then threaded up through the arteries to the base of the carotid artery. At this point a dye is injected, and x-rays, CTs, or MRI scans determine the location and extent of the narrowing, or stenosis, of the artery. In people with TIAs the risk of stroke itself increases using this technique, particularly in elderly people with diabetes.\nMagnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) and Computerized Tomography Angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography and computerized tomography angiography are noninvasive ways of evaluating the carotid arteries and the arteries in the brain. In many situations, these tests can be used instead of cerebral angiography, an invasive procedure which carries a risk for bleeding in stroke.\nOther Techniques. Other imaging tests, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), may also help the doctor identify injuries caused by the stroke.\nHeart Evaluation\nElectrocardiogram (ECG). A heart evaluation using an electrocardiogram (ECG) is important in any patient with a stroke or suspected stroke. An ECG records the electrical current in the heart muscle.\nEchocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses ultrasound to view the chambers and valves of the heart. It is generally useful for stroke patients to identify blood clots or risk factors for blood clots that can travel to the brain and cause stroke. There two are types:\nTransthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) view the heart through the chest. It is noninvasive and is the standard approach.\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) examines the heart using an ultrasound tube that the patient literally swallows and passes down the throat. It is uncomfortable and requires sedation. It is typically used to obtain more accurate images of the heart if a TTE has suggested abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation or patent foramen ovale (PFO).\nABCD2 Score\nPatients who have a TIA are at increased risk for a major stroke in the days and weeks that follow. The ABCD2 score is a tool that helps doctors predict short-term stroke risk following a TIA. The ABCD2 score assigns points for various factors, including:\nAge (over 60 years)\nBlood pressure (greater or equal to 140/90 mm Hg)\nClinical features (weakness on one side of the body, speech impairment without weakness)\nDuration of TIA symptoms (at least 60 minutes)\nDiabetes\nBased on the number of points, a doctor can identify whether a patient is at low, moderate, or high risk of having a stroke within 2 days after a TIA. Several 2006 and 2007 studies indicated that the ABCD2 score works well in predicting stroke, and can help doctors better decide which patients need hospitalization and emergency care.\nOther Tests\nBlood Tests. Several blood tests may help predict the risk for a stroke and determine the severity and complications of an existing stroke.\nSpecific blood tests are important to determine clotting times, to check electrolytes (potassium, calcium, sodium), and to measure factors indicating liver or kidney problems. Kidney tests measure blood proteins that are filtered through the kidneys. These proteins include creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). A more recent type of kidney test measures the protein cystatin C. Recent research suggests that the cystatin C kidney test may be better at predicting cardiovascular risks in elderly patients.\nBlood sugar (glucose) levels are measured. Hyperglycemia (high levels) may indicate a worse outcome for some strokes (although not hemorrhagic or lacunar strokes). Hypoglycemia (low levels) is a common complication of diabetes treatments, and its symptoms may mimic those of a stroke.\nExamination of Spinal Fluid. If the CT scan is negative but the doctor still suspects a subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke, a spinal tap may be performed. Spinal fluid containing significant amounts of blood will usually confirm a hemorrhagic stroke.\nBack to Top\nManaging a Stroke\nUntil recently, the treatment of stroke was restricted to basic life support at the time of the stroke and rehabilitation later. Now, however, treatments can be beneficial when administered as soon as possible after the onset of the stroke. It is critical to get to the hospital and be diagnosed as soon as possible. There are several steps in the initial assessment and management of a person with a stroke.\nGet to the Hospital Immediately\nIf symptoms appear that suggest a stroke is occurring, calling 911 is critical (as opposed to calling the family doctor or trying to get the patient to the hospital by car). Receiving treatment early is essential in reducing the damage from a stroke.\nImmediate Diagnosis and Evaluation of the Patient\nImportant diagnostic and evaluation steps are needed for the optimal treatment of a stroke patient:\nDetermining Whether the Stroke Is Ischemic or Hemorrhagic. As soon as the patient enters the hospital, diagnostic tests, particularly a CT scan, should be performed to determine whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, and how extensive the stroke may be.\nDetermining The Need for Thrombolytic Drugs. If the stroke is ischemic, the next step is to determine if the patient would benefit from blood clot-busting drugs (called thrombolytics). The following factors are important for making this decision:\nTime is critical in the decision-making process. Clot-buster drugs do not generally help if given more than 3 hours after stroke onset. Onset is when the patient first experiences any symptoms, even minor impairment. If the patient had a previous TIA that completely resolved before the stroke, however, onset is dated from when the more recent symptoms developed.\nRisk factors for administering thrombolytic drugs include having recently taken a blood thinning drug, any accompanying medical or physical condition, and any recent event (such as surgery or injury) that may contribute to the condition.\nSupportive Treatment for Acute Stroke\nThe patient should receive treatment to support basic life functions and to reduce stress, pain, and agitation. The following steps are also very important:\nMaintaining Adequate Delivery of Oxygen. It is very important to maintain oxygen levels. In some cases, airway ventilation may be required. Supplemental oxygen may also be necessary for patients when tests suggest low blood levels of oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen administered under pressure) therapy for acute stroke has been evaluated some, but there is no strong evidence from high-quality clinical trials that hyperbaric oxygen is beneficial.\nManaging Fever and Lowering Body Temperature (Hypothermia). Fever should be aggressively treated, since its presence predicts a poorer outlook. Some evidence suggests that hypothermia -- reducing body temperature to below normal -- might protect nerve cells in stroke patients. Cooling is done through special cooling blankets, ventilators, or infusion of cool fluids. Unfortunately, severe side effects occur with even moderate hypothermia (86\u00b0 F, 30\u00b0 C), which can include pneumonia, blood clotting disorders, heart rhythm disturbances, and others.\nMaintain Electrolytes. Maintaining a healthy electrolyte balance (the ratio of sodium, calcium, and potassium in the body's fluids) is critical.\nManaging Blood Pressure. Managing blood pressure is essential and complicated. Patients with stroke and pressures above 220 (systolic) or 120 (diastolic) should be treated. Lowering blood pressure too quickly can be dangerous, however, in patients with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In general, experts do not advise aggressively lowering elevated pressures below 220/120 mm Hg in patients unless they have other conditions, such as a heart attack, that require pressure-lowering treatments. In patients who need thrombolytic drugs, blood pressure should cautiously be lowered to 185/110 mm Hg. In most cases, blood pressure declines when these patients become stabilized.\nManaging Increased Brain Pressure. Hospital staff should watch carefully for evidence of increased pressure on the brain, which is a frequent complication of hemorrhagic strokes. It can also occur a few days after ischemic strokes. Early symptoms of increased brain pressure are drowsiness, confusion, lethargy, weakness, and headache. Medications such as mannitol may be given during a stroke to reduce pressure or the risk for it.\nKeeping the top of the body higher than the lower part, such as by elevating the head of the bed, can reduce pressure in the brain and is standard practice for patients with ischemic stroke. However, this practice also lowers blood pressure in general, which may be dangerous for patients with massive stroke.\nMonitoring the Heart. Heart attack and arrhythmias are potential complications of ischemic stroke. Patients must be monitored using electrocardiographic tracings.\nControlling Glucose Levels. Elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels can occur with severe stroke and may be a marker of serious trouble. In general, it is advisable to lower glucose levels that are about 300 mg/dL, usually with insulin. It is not clear, however, if glucose-lowering treatments offer any advantage. Excessive lowering of glucose levels can have damaging effects on the brain. Studies are underway to determine the best approach.\nMedications\nThrombolytics\nIntravenous Thrombolytics. Clot-busting (thrombolytic) drugs break up existing blood clots. They are among the important treatments for heart attacks, and are now also used for ischemic (not hemorrhagic) stroke. While research has confirmed that early treatment with thrombolytics can greatly increase a stroke patient's chances for recovery, their use has been limited due to the short treatment window (within 3 hours of onset of stroke symptoms). The standard thrombolytic drugs are tissue plasminogen activators (t-PAs). They include alteplase (Activase) and reteplase (Retavase).\nThe following steps are critical before administering these clot-buster drugs:\nBefore the thrombolytic is given, a CT scan must first confirm that the stroke is not hemorrhagic. If the stroke is ischemic, a CT scan can also suggest if injuries are very extensive, which might affect the use of thrombolytics.\nThrombolytics must be administered within 3 hours of a stroke to have any effect. Best results are achieved if patients are treated with 90 minutes of a stroke. Unfortunately, most stroke patients arrive at the hospital more than 3 hours after an attack and therefore are not eligible for treatment. There is some evidence that t-PA administered withing 4 hours may also be effective, but more research needs to be conducted. These findings underscore the critical need for people to go to a hospital immediately if a stroke is suspected.\nThrombolytics carry a risk for hemorrhage, so they may not be appropriate for patients with existing risk factors for bleeding. They should not be used in patients who are experiencing seizures. The drug may be appropriate in more patients than previously thought, however, including older people, those with a history of stroke, and those with high blood pressure.\nIntra-Arterial Thrombolytics. Researchers are investigating thrombolytics injected directly into an artery in the brain. Early studies suggest this approach may allow effective treatment up to 6 hours after a stroke and improve recovery in more patients. The risk for bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke is significantly increased, however.\nNatural Defibronogenerating Drugs. These drugs deplete the amount of fibrinogen in blood, which in turn reduces the \"stickiness\" in blood. Such drugs include ancrod and batroxobin (Defibrase), both derived from the venom of poisonous snakes. They are being evaluated as a possible alternative to thrombolytics. Studies have not consistently shown benefit or a clearer role for these drugs in the treatment of acute stroke. As with all anti-clotting drugs, there is a higher risk for hemorrhage, but it appears to be slight.\nGlycoprotein IIB/IIIa Inhibitors. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors are sometimes administered intravenously in the hospital and include abciximab (ReoPro, Centocor), eptifibatide (Integrilin), tirofiban (Aggrastat), lotrafiban, and lamifiban. They are being investigated alone or as additions to thrombolytic (clot-busting) drugs at the time of an acute stroke.\nAntiplatelets and Anticoagulant Medications\nAspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) are used for prevention of stroke. (For more information, see the Prevention section in this report.)\nAnticoagulants thin blood and may be useful under certain circumstances. These medicines include:\nWarfarin. The anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin) may not work as well as aspirin in preventing a second stroke in people who have partial artery blockage in the brain (intracranial stenosis). Warfarin is, however, very important in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation. It may be useful in other situations, such as patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO), those whose stroke followed a heart attack, or in high-risk patients who cannot take antiplatelet drugs.\nHeparin. Intravenous heparin, a potent anti-platelet drug, has been used for ischemic stroke since 1941. Although many doctors continue to use it, five out of six major studies have reported no clear protective benefits for the use of standard heparin or heparin-like drugs compared to aspirin. These medicines also pose a much higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Experts now recommend heparins only for preventing thromboembolism in stroke patients at risk for this condition.\nDirect Thrombin Inhibitors (DTIs). Direct thrombin inhibitors are a more recent group of anti-coagulants. The first DTI is hirudin, a natural substance derived from the saliva of leeches. New forms include argatroban (Novastan), bivalirudin (Angiomax), danaparoid (Orgaran), lepirudin (Refludan), and desirudin (Revasc).\nAll anti-clotting drugs carry a risk for bleeding and a slightly increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke.\nOther Medications for Preventing a Recurring Stroke\nIt is important that patients control their high blood pressure and LDL ('bad') cholesterol levels. Various drugs, such as statins, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors, can manage these conditions. People with diabetes should also maintain tight control of their blood sugar levels.\nDrugs for Hemorrhagic Stroke\nCalcium Channel Blockers. Early administration of calcium channel blockers, such as nimodipine (Nimotop), can improve functional outcome. One of the most common and serious dangers after a subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke is spasm of the blood vessels near the ruptured site, which closes off oxygen to the brain. Calcium causes contraction of the smooth muscles of the blood vessels; calcium channel blockers are drugs that relax the blood vessels. The drugs work best if they are administered within 6 hours of the stroke. Calcium channel blockers are not useful for ischemic strokes, although they can be used in combinations with blood pressure lowering drugs to prevent them.\nSurgery\nCarotid Endarterectomy\nCarotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that cleans out and opens up the narrowed carotid artery. It is used in patients at high risk for thrombotic ischemic strokes, which are caused by blockages in the internal carotid artery. It is also sometimes used after a stroke. In such cases, patients have reported improvements in vision, speech, swallowing, functioning of arms and legs, and general quality of life.\nThere is a risk of a heart attack or stroke from the procedure. Anyone undergoing this procedure should be sure their surgeon is experienced in recent techniques and that the medical center has complication rates of less than 6%. A 2000 study reported that older surgeons had a worse record than younger ones, possibly because they relied on residents or were less likely to adopt new procedures.\nProcedure Description. The procedure generally is as follows:\nThe patient is usually given general anesthesia, although it has been reported that using local anesthetic is just as safe and reduces the cost of the procedure.\nA bypass tube is put in place to transport blood around the blocked area during the procedure.\nThe surgeon scrapes away the plaque on the arterial wall.\nThe artery is sewn back together, and blood flow is restored.\nThe patient generally stays in the hospital for about 2 days. There is often a slight aching in the neck for about 2 weeks, and the patient should refrain as much as possible from turning the head during this period.\nClick the icon to see an illustrated series detailing surgery for unblocking carotid arteries.\nDetermining Who Should Have Surgery. An important factor in deciding which patients with carotid stenosis are the best candidates for surgery is whether or not they are having symptoms.\nCarotid stenosis may be identified when a carotid ultrasound is done to investigate findings on physical exam, such as a carotid bruit (a sound heard when a physician listens to the carotid artery in the neck with a stethoscope). If these patients are not having any symptoms, they have what is called asymptomatic carotid stenosis. If the carotid artery blockage is greater than 60%, surgery is considered an option since patients with this much blockage are at risk for a TIA or stroke in the future.\nHowever, carotid artery surgery has a risk of complications (stroke, heart attack, death) during surgery or in the period soon afterwards. Large, high-quality studies have evaluated this problem and compared surgical treatment with medical treatment (usually aspirin or clopidogrel). Most of these studies have found a small benefit for performing surgery in patients 40 - 75 years of age, but only when performed by surgeons who have demonstrated that they do not have a high rate of serious complications when performing the surgery.\nPatients with a history of stroke and evidence of severe stenosis (over 70% of the carotid artery is obstructed) can benefit from either carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. An experienced surgeon with a good track record is essential. Patients with mild stenosis (less than 50% obstruction) should not have endarterectomy; these patients do better with medications even if they have symptoms. For patients with moderate stenosis (50 - 69%), the decision to perform surgery needs to be determined on an individual basis.\nCarotid endarterectomy is generally not recommended for patients with acute stroke.\nCarotid Angioplasty and Stenting\nCarotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is being investigated as a less-invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy. It is based on the same principles as angiography done for heart disease.\nAn extremely thin catheter tube is inserted into an artery in the groin.\nIt is threaded through the circulatory system until it reaches the blocked area in the carotid artery.\nThe doctor either breaks up the clot or inflates a tiny balloon against the blood vessel walls (angioplasty).\nAfter temporarily inflating the balloon, the doctor typically leaves a circular wire mesh (stent) inside the vessel to keep it open.\nThis procedure carries a risk for an embolic stroke and other complications. At this time, it is being used in some centers as an alternative to endarterectomy in patients who cannot undergo endarterectomy, especially for patients with severe stenosis (blockage greater than 70%) and high surgical risk. Several studies published in 2006 suggested that CAS should be used only for patients with these types of conditions.\nExtracranial-Intracranial Bypass\nExtracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass has been under investigation for decades for ischemic stroke, but has had very mixed results, some extremely negative. With this procedure, a healthy artery in the scalp is rerouted to an area of the brain that was deprived of blood because of a blocked artery. This procedure is now sometimes used for patients with aneurysms. Some experts hope, however, that, in specific cases chosen via careful imaging and using the latest surgical techniques, EC-IC may prove to be helpful for some stroke patients.\nSurgery for Preventing and Treating Hemorrhagic Strokes\nSurgical Intervention of the Ruptured Aneurysms. In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhagic stroke, surgery to block off the aneurysm is usually recommended within a few days of the stroke. The standard procedure is to clip the aneurysm and stop bleeding. Alternative approaches are promising.\nSurgical Intervention of Unruptured Aneurysms. With MRI of the brain being used in the evaluation and diagnosis of many neurologic disorders, many patients have cerebral aneurysms diagnosed incidentally. If an unruptured aneurysm is detected, patients should discuss all options with their doctor, including surgical repair. Unruptured aneurysms occur in 1 - 8% of the general population, however, and controversy exists over when to operate and on which patients.\nIn general, the decision rests on the size of the aneurysm, but uncertainty still exists. In one study, for example, the risk of rupture for aneurysms between 10 - 25 mm was quite low -- slightly less than 1% per year for both groups. Aneurysms over 25 mm, however, had a 6% chance of rupturing within a year. Studies have reported that in general, the risk for rupture is .05 - 2% a year, but recent evidence suggests that the risks may be even less.\nAneurysms can often cause symptoms, however, even if they do not rupture. Patients should discuss their particular risk factors carefully with their doctors. Individuals with arteriovenous malformation, a condition caused by abnormal associations between arteries and veins, should be monitored for the development of an aneurysm.\nClipping the Aneurysm. The standard surgical procedure for treating a ruptured aneurysm is to place a clip across the neck of the aneurysm, which blocks off bleeding. It is usually performed within the first 3 days. Getting to the aneurysm is often extremely difficult. Deep cooling of the body to stop circulation may be used to allow more time for the operation. Procedures that remove large portions of the bone in the skull are being developed to allow fast access. There is a relatively high risk for newly formed aneurysms, particularly after 9 years. Patients may want to discuss follow-up angiography to detect any new aneurysms 9 - 10 years after the procedure.\nTranscatheter Embolization for Sealing off the Aneurysm. Transcatheter embolization is a new technique for ruptured and unruptured aneurysms that is proving to be effective, although it is still investigational. The surgeon threads a thin tube through the artery leading to the aneurysm through which materials are passed to plug or obstruct the aneurysm. In one version of this procedure, the following occurs:\nA tiny platinum coil is inserted through the tube and positioned into the aneurysm.\nAn electric charge is passed through the coil to form blood clots.\nIn this case, blood clots benefit the patient by using the coil as a scaffold and sealing off the aneurysm.\nEmergency Surgery for Hemorrhagic Strokes. Emergency surgery for a hemorrhagic stroke involves locating and removing large blood clots. In the past, such procedures had little effect on survival. Advances, however, are improving outcomes when surgery is performed very early.\nBack to Top\nRecovery\nAfter a stroke, patients should take all necessary measures, including medications and lifestyle changes, to prevent another stroke. For those whose stroke was ischemic, aspirin, warfarin, or both will usually be prescribed.\nHaving a neurologist as the primary doctor after a stroke, rather than some other specialist or primary care doctor, significantly increases the chance for survival. Patients or their families should be persistent in requesting the best care possible during this important early period.\nReceiving initial treatment at a stroke unit, instead of a general ward, plays a strong role for better long-term quality of life. Rehabilitation services aimed at patients living at home are also very effective in improving independence. Patients or their families should seek patient advocates or support associations to ensure they receive the right care.\nReducing the Risk for Non-Neurologic Complications after a Stroke\nIn addition to problems brought on by neurologic damage, stroke patients are also at risk for other serious problems that reduce their chances for survival. They include:\nBlood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)\nPulmonary embolism (a blood clot that travels to the lungs)\nPneumonia\nWidespread infection\nHeart problems\nUrinary tract infections (a catheter is sometimes used in the first 48 hours after stroke to help with urinary retention, but if it is left in longer it can cause urinary tract infections)\nMeasures should be taken to monitor and treat patients for these important problems.\nCandidates for Rehabilitation\nIn all, 90% of stroke survivors experience varying degrees of improvement after rehabilitation. The current cost-cutting climate generates pressure to send elderly patients who have had a stroke directly to a nursing home rather than a rehabilitation first. Not all patients, however, need or benefit from formal rehabilitation:\nIf the stroke is severe, intensive training would not be helpful.\nIf the stroke is mild, patients often improve without rehabilitation.\nPositive factors that help predict good candidates for rehabilitation:\nA patient should be able to sit up for at least an hour.\nThe patient should be able to learn and be aware.\nSpasticity may be a good sign, because it indicates live nerve action.\nPatients who are able to move their shoulders or fingers within the first 3 weeks after having a stroke are more likely to recover the use of their hands than patients who cannot perform these movements. The ability to feel light pressure on the affected hand, however, makes no difference for future hand movement.\nFamily members or close friends are available to be active participants in the rehabilitation process.\nFactors that predict a poor response to rehabilitation:\nDysphagia (the inability to swallow) is associated with a higher mortality rate, possibly because of increased risk for infection and malnutrition. Dysphagic patients are given nutrition using a stomach tube or a feeding tube inserted down through the nose.\nIncontinence.\nThe inability to recognize nonspeech sounds that occur right after a stroke.\nA poor hand grip that is still present after 3 weeks is an indicator of severe problems.\nHaving had very severe seizures after the stroke.\nFactors that do not rule out rehabilitation:\nAbout 30% of patients experience aphasia (an impaired ability to speak). However, this disability does not necessarily affect the ability to think. Aphasia can also be temporary.\nAlthough confusion is common among people who have had strokes, partial or even complete recovery is very possible.\nSome Approaches to Rehabilitation\nPhysical therapy should be started as soon as the patient is stable, as early as 2 days after the stroke. Some patients will experience the fastest recovery in the first few days, but many will continue to improve for about 6 months or longer. Because stroke affects different parts of the brain, specific approaches to managing rehabilitation vary widely among individual patients:\nExercise program. Recent guidelines from the Veteran's Administration recommend that patients get back on their feet as soon as possible to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Patients should try to walk at least 50 feet a day. Assisted devices or bracing are sometimes used to help support the legs. Treadmill exercises can be very helpful for patients with mild-to-moderate dysfunction. Exercise should be tailored to the stroke survivor's physical condition and can include aerobic, strength, flexibility, and neuromuscular (coordination and balance) activities.\nRetraining muscles. Stretching and range-of-motion exercises are used to help treat spastic muscles. They can also help patients regain function in a paralyzed arm. Multiple techniques have been developed and studied. These include the Bilateral Arm Training with Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (BATRAC) technique, (which involves moving a bar with both arms in a sustained rhythmic pattern), and constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), which involves doing a series of repetitive exercises while the less functional arm is restrained.\nSpeech therapy and sign language. People who have had a stroke often have aphasia, a brain condition that makes it difficult to speak and understand language. Aphasia can come in many different forms. A person may be unable to speak at all, or just have difficulty saying the right word. Intense speech therapy after a stroke is important for recovery. Some experts recommend 9 hours a week of therapy for 3 months. A 2005 study indicated that a shorter period (3 hours a week for 10 days) also works well. Language skills improve the most when family and friends help reinforce the speech therapy lessons.\nSwallowing training. Training patients and their caregivers regarding swallowing techniques, as well as safe and not safe foods and liquids, is essential for preventing aspiration (accidental sucking in of food or fluids into the airway).\nAttention training. Problems with attention are very common after strokes. Direct retraining teaches patients to perform specific tasks using repetitive drills in response to certain stimuli. (For example, they are told to press a buzzer each time they hear a specific number.) A variant of this approach trains patients to relearn real-life skills, such as driving, carrying on a conversation, or other daily tasks.\nOccupational training. Occupational therapy is important and improves daily living activities and social participation.\nDrug Therapy for Rehabilitation\nDrug therapy can sometimes help relieve specific effects of stroke:\nDantrolene (Dantrium), tizanidine (Zanaflex), and baclofen (Lioresel) are used to treat spasticity.\nHeparin, a blood-thinning drug, is used to prevent blood clots from forming in the veins of the legs (thrombosis).\nSome patients experience constant hiccups, which can be very serious. Chlorpromazine and baclofen are among the drugs used for this condition.\nStudies have reported that dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate (Ritalin), an amphetamine used in attention deficit disorder, may help patients recover speech and motor skills when combined with physical therapy.\nCertain drugs commonly taken for conditions associated with stroke may actually slow recovery. They include drugs used for high blood pressure, including clonidine and prazosin, anticonvulsant drugs, the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, and anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines.\nManaging the Emotional Consequences\nThe Emotional State of the Patients. Strong motivation with the goal of independence after rehabilitation is important for recovery. Unfortunately, depression is very common after a stroke, both as a direct and indirect result of the stroke:\nStrokes that affect the right hemisphere in the brain increase the risk for depression.\nPatients can become depressed by the changes in their ability to function.\nA peculiar stroke-induced condition, known as post-stroke crying or neurologic emotionalism, is a neurologic not a psychologic disorder.\nIf depression is prolonged, it can interfere with recovery. One study showed that people who suffered strokes and became depressed were three times more likely to die within 10 years than stroke victims who were not depressed. There is a significantly increased risk of suicide in patients with stroke, especially in women and those under age 60.\nAntidepressants, particularly fluoxetine (Prozac) and similar so-called SSRI drugs, have been beneficial in relieving post-stroke crying as well as improving recovery in general and mood in particular. Antidepressants may also help restore mental abilities.\nSome doctors also recommend tricyclic antidepressants, which include amitriptyline (Elavil) and nortriptyline (Pamelor). In one study nortriptyline (Pamelor) not only improved mood but also had positive effects on mental functioning, suggesting perhaps that some dementia associated with stroke may actually be due to depression. Tricyclics may also be useful for neurologic emotionalism.\nAnxiety disorder is also common and debilitating. Some research indicates that many patients suffer from feelings identical to post-traumatic stress syndrome. The two disorders often overlap, but drug treatments for each differ and may offset the other.\nMany drugs for psychologic disorders affect the central nervous system and can delay rehabilitation. Skilled professional help is needed to determine the most effective and safest treatments.\nThe Emotional State of the Caregiver. The caregiver's emotions and responses to the patient are critical. Patients do worse when caregivers are depressed, overprotective, or not knowledgeable about the stroke. Unfortunately, in one study, over half of the caregivers themselves were depressed, particularly if the stroke victims were left with dementia or abnormal behavior.\n"}, {"score": 482.76672, "uuid": "e66a611e-121e-5b1b-b036-42b256539a9f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-58-28587", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/DiseasesandConditions/item/Migraine+headaches", "page_rank": 1.1819176e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Migraine headaches Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Acetaminophen works faster than <em>ibuprofen</em>, but the effects of <em>ibuprofen</em> last longer. * For adolescents age 12 years and older, sumaptriptan (Imitrex) nasal spray <em>is</em> recommended.

In this age group, it is particularly important to first rule out age-related disorders including stroke, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), accumulation of fluid within the brain (hydrocephalus), and head injuries (usually from falls).\nPatients with worsening headache or headaches that do not respond to routine treatment.\nThe following tests may be used:\nA CT (computed tomography) scan may be ordered to rule out brain disorders or headaches caused by chronic sinusitis.\nX-rays and other tests may also be used if sinusitis is strongly suspected.\nA neck x-ray can reveal arthritis or spinal problems.\nOther imaging tests include an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EEG (electroencephalogram), lumbar puncture, ultrasound testing, and cerebral angiography, positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These tests are only performed if there is reason to suspect an underlying disease or as part of clinical studies.\nSymptoms that Could Indicate a Serious Underlying Condition\nHeadaches indicating a serious underlying problem, such as cerebrovascular disorder or malignant hypertension, are uncommon. (It should again be emphasized that a headache is not a common symptom of a brain tumor.) People with existing chronic headaches, however, might miss a more serious condition by believing it to be one of their usual headaches. Such patients should call a doctor promptly if the quality of a headache or accompanying symptoms has changed. Everyone should call a doctor for any of the following symptoms:\nSudden, severe headache that persists or increases in intensity over the following hours, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or altered mental states (possible hemorrhagic stroke)\nSudden, very severe headache, worse than any headache ever experienced (possible indication of hemorrhage or a ruptured aneurysm)\nChronic or severe headaches that begin after age 50\nHeadaches in the back of the head accompanied by other symptoms, such as memory loss, confusion, loss of balance, changes in speech or vision, or loss of strength in or numbness or tingling in arms or legs (possibility of small stroke in the base of the skull)\nHeadaches after head injury, especially if drowsiness or nausea are present (possibility of hemorrhage)\nHeadaches accompanied by fever, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting (possibility of spinal meningitis)\nHeadaches that increase with coughing or straining (possibility of brain swelling).\nA throbbing pain around or behind the eyes or in the forehead accompanied by redness in the eye and perceptions of halos or rings around lights (possibility of acute glaucoma)\nA one-sided headache in the temple in elderly people; the artery in the temple is firm and knotty and has no pulse; scalp is tender (possibility of temporal arteritis, which can cause blindness or even stroke if not treated)\nSudden onset and then persistent, throbbing pain around the eye possibly spreading to the ear or neck unrelieved by pain medication (possibility of blood clot in one of the sinus veins of the brain)\nBack to Top\nTreatment Approaches\nMigraine treatment involves both treating acute attacks when they occur, and developing preventive strategies for reducing the frequency and severity of attacks.\nTreating Migraine Attacks\nMany effective headache remedies are available for treating a migraine attack. Still, many patients are treated with unapproved drugs, including opoids and barbiturates that can be potentially addictive or dangerous.\nThe main types of medications for treating a migraine attack are:\nPain relievers (usually nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or acetaminophen)\nErgotamines\nTriptans\nIt is best to treat a migraine attack as soon as symptoms first occur. Doctors generally recommend starting with nonprescription pain relievers for mild-to-moderate attacks. If migraine pain is severe, a prescription version of an NSAID may be recommended. A triptan is generally the next drug of choice. Ergotamine drugs tend to be less effective than triptans, but are helpful for some patients. Depending on the severity of the attacks, and accompanying symptoms, the doctor may recommend taking a triptan or ergotamine drug in tablet, injection, or suppository form. The doctor may also prescribe specific medications for treating symptoms such as nausea.\nTry to guard against rebound effect. Nearly all drugs used for migraine can cause rebound headache, and patients should not take any the drugs more than 9 days per month. If you find that you need to use acute migraine treatment more frequently, talk to your doctor about preventive medications.\nPreventing Migraine Attacks\nPreventive strategies for migraine include both drug treatment and behavioral therapy or lifestyle adjustments.\nPatients should consider using preventive migraine drugs if they have:\nMigraines that are not helped by acute treatment drugs\nFrequent attacks (more than once per week)\nSide effects from acute treatment drugs or contraindications to taking them\nThe main preventive drug treatments for migraine are:\nBeta-blocker drugs (usually propranolol [Inderal] or timolol [Blocadren]\nAnti-seizure drugs (usually divalproex [Depakote] or topiramate [Topamax]\nTricyclic antidepressants {usually amitriptyline [Elavil])\nA preventive medication strategy needs to be carefully tailored to an individual patient, taking into account the patient's medical history and co-existing medical conditions. These drugs can have serious side effects.\nA preventive medication is usually started at a low dose, and then gradually increased. It may take 2 - 3 months for a drug to achieve its full effect. Preventive treatment may be needed for 6 - 12 months or longer. Most patients take preventive medications on a daily basis, but some patients may use these drugs intermittently (for example, for preventing menstrual migraine).\nPatients can also help prevent migraines by identifying and avoiding potential triggers, such as specific foods. Relaxation therapy and stress reduction techniques may also help. (See Lifestyle section below.)\nTreatment Approaches for Children\nMigraine Treatment for Children. Most children with migraines may need only mild pain relievers and home remedies (such as ginger tea) to treat their headaches. The American Academy of Neurology's practice guidelines for children and adolescents recommend the following drug treatments:\nFor children age 6 years and older, ibuprofen (Advil) is recommended. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may also be effective. Acetaminophen works faster than ibuprofen, but the effects of ibuprofen last longer.\nFor adolescents age 12 years and older, sumaptriptan (Imitrex) nasal spray is recommended.\nMigraine Prevention for Children. Non-medication methods, including biofeedback and muscle relaxation techniques may be helpful. If these methods fail, then preventive drugs may be used, although evidence is weak on the effectiveness of standard migraine preventive drugs in children.\nWithdrawing from Medications\nIf medication overuse causes rebound migraines develop, the patients cannot recover without stopping the drugs. (If caffeine is the culprit, a person may need only to reduce coffee or tea drinking to a reasonable level, not necessarily stop drinking it altogether.) The patient can usually stop abruptly or gradually. The patient should expect the following:\nMost headache drugs can be stopped abruptly, but the patient should talk to their doctor first. Certain non-headache medications, such as anti-anxiety drugs or beta-blockers, require gradual withdrawal under medical supervision.\nIf the patient chooses to taper off standard headache medications, withdrawal should be completed within three days.\nThe patient may take other pain medicines during the first days. Examples of drugs that may be used include dihydroergotamine (with or without metoclopramide), NSAIDs (in mild cases), corticosteroids, or valproate.\nThe patient must expect their headache to get worse after they stop taking their medications, no matter which method they use. Most people feel better within 2 weeks, although headache symptoms can persist up to 16 weeks (and in rare cases even longer).\nIf the symptoms do not respond to treatment and cause severe nausea and vomiting, the patient may need to be hospitalized.\nBack to Top\nMedications for Treating Migraine Attacks\nMany different medications are used to treat migraines. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specifically approved only the following types of drugs for treating migraine attacks:\nNon-prescription drugs: Excedrin Migraine, Advil Migraine, Motrin Migraine Pain\nPrescription drugs: Triptans and ergotamine\nOther types of drugs, including opioids and barbiturates, are sometimes prescribed off-label for migraine treatment. Opioids and barbiturates have not been approved by the FDA for migraine relief, and they can be addictive.\nAll FDA-approved migraine treatments are approved only for adults. No migraine products have officially been approved for use in children.\nPain Relievers\nSome patients with mild migraines respond well to over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers, particularly if they take the medicine at the very first sign of an attack. OTC pain relievers, (also called analgesics), include:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin. The FDA-approved migraine products Advil Migraine and Motrin Migraine Pain both contain ibuprofen.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol). The FDA-approved migraine product Excedrin Migraine contains acetaminophen, as well as aspirin and caffeine.\nThere are also prescription-only NSAIDs. These include diclofenac (Cataflam), which is taken by mouth, and ketorolac (Toradol), which is given by injection.\nNSAID Side Effects. High dosages and long-term use of NSAIDs can increase the risk for heart attack, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach bleeding. Aspirin does not increase the risk for heart problems, but it can cause other NSAID-related side effects.\nTriptans\nTriptans (also referred to as serotonin agonists) were the first drugs specifically developed for use against migraine. They are the most important migraine drugs currently available. They help maintain serotonin levels in the brain, and so specifically target one of the major components in the migraine process.\nTriptans are recommended as first-line drugs for adult patients with moderate-to-severe migraines when NSAIDs are not effective. Triptans have the following benefits:\nThey are effective for most patients with migraine, as well as patients with combination tension and migraine headaches.\nThey do not have the sedative effect of other migraine drugs.\nWithdrawal after overuse appears to be shorter and less severe than with other migraine medications\nSumatriptan. Sumatriptan (Imitrex) has the longest track record and is the most studied of all triptans. It is available as a fast-dissolving pill, nasal spray, or injection. Injected sumatriptan works the fastest of all the triptans and is the most effective, but it can cause pain at the injection site. The nasal spray form bypasses the stomach and is absorbed more quickly than the oral form. Some patients report relief as soon as 15 minutes after administration. The spray tends to work less well when a person has nasal congestion from cold or allergy. It may also leave a bad taste. Sumatriptan is effective for many patients, but headache recurs in 20 - 40% of people within 24 hours after taking the drug.\nIn 2008, the FDA approved a drug (Treximet) that combines in one pill both sumatriptan and the anti-inflammatory pain reliever naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Some studies have found that the combination of sumatriptan and naproxen works better for migraine relief than either drug alone.\nOther Triptans. Newer triptans include almotriptan (Axert), zolmitriptan (Zomig), naratriptan (Amerge), rizatriptan (Maxalt), frovatriptan (Frova), and eletriptan (Relpax). Comparison studies with sumatriptan suggest that some of the newer drugs may have fewer side effects and may be better for providing immediate, sustained, and consistent pain relief. Triptans are also being investigated for prevention under certain circumstances, such as menstrual migraines, but benefits appear limited.\nAlthough triptans, (like all migraine medications), are approved only for adults, researchers are investigating zolmitriptan for treating migraines in adolescents.\nSide Effects. Side effects of triptans may include:\nTingling and numbness in the toes\nSensations of warmth\nDiscomfort in the ear, nose, and throat\nNausea\nDizziness\nMuscle weakness\nHeaviness, pain, or both in the chest. (About 40% of patients taking sumatriptan experience these symptoms, and they are major factors in discontinuing the drug. Newer drugs, such as almotriptan, produce fewer chest symptoms.)\nRapid heart rate\nComplications of Triptans. The following are potentially serious problems.\nComplications of heart and circulation. Triptans narrow (constrict) blood vessels. Because of this effect, spasms in the blood vessels may occur and cause serious side effects, including stroke and heart attack. Such events are rare, but patients with an existing history or risk factors for these conditions should generally avoid triptans.\nSerotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a life-threatening condition that occurs from an excess of the brain chemical serotonin. Triptan drugs used to treat migraine, as well as certain types of antidepressant medications, can increase serotonin levels. These antidepressant drugs include serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) -- such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft) -- and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor). It is very important that patients not combine a triptan drug with a SSRI or SNRI drug. Serotonin syndrome is most likely to occur when starting or increasing the dose of a triptan or antidepressant drug. Symptoms include restlessness, hallucinations, rapid heartbeat, tremors, increased body temperature, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. You should seek immediate medical care if you have these symptoms.\nThe following people should avoid triptans or take them with caution and only with the advisement of a doctor:\nAnyone with a history or any risk factors for stroke, uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease.\nPeople taking antidepressants that increase serotonin levels.\nChildren and adolescents. They may be safe, but controlled studies are needed to confirm this. (Triptans should not, in any case, be the first-line treatment for children.)\nPeople with basilar or hemiplegic migraines. (Triptans are not indicated for these migraineurs.)\nThere is no evidence to date of any higher risk for birth defects in pregnant women who take triptans. Still, women should be cautious about taking any medications during pregnancy and discuss any possible adverse effects with their doctors.\nErgotamine (Ergot)\nDrugs containing ergotamine (commonly called ergots) constrict smooth muscles, including those in blood vessels, and are useful for migraine. They were the first anti-migraine drugs available. Ergotamine is available by prescription in the following preparations:\nDihydroergotamine (DHE) is an ergot derivative. It is administered as a nasal spray form (Migranal) or by injection, which can be performed at home.\nErgotamine is available tablets taken by mouth, tablets taken under the tongue (sublingual), and rectal suppositories. Some of the tablet forms of ergotamine contain caffeine.\nErgotamine's role since the introduction of triptans is now less certain. Only the rectal forms of ergotamine are superior to rectal triptans. Injected, oral, and nasal-spray forms are all inferior to the triptans. Ergotamine may still be helpful for patients with status migrainous or those with frequent recurring headaches.\nSide Effects. Side effects of ergotamine include:\nNausea\n"}, {"score": 482.38068, "uuid": "5876287d-5030-5add-8067-5a402d80888f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-58-28583", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Migraine+headaches", "page_rank": 1.1750715e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "Migraine headaches Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Acetaminophen works faster than <em>ibuprofen</em>, but the effects of <em>ibuprofen</em> last longer. * For adolescents age 12 years and older, sumaptriptan (Imitrex) nasal spray <em>is</em> recommended.

In this age group, it is particularly important to first rule out age-related disorders including stroke, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), accumulation of fluid within the brain (hydrocephalus), and head injuries (usually from falls).\nPatients with worsening headache or headaches that do not respond to routine treatment.\nThe following tests may be used:\nA CT (computed tomography) scan may be ordered to rule out brain disorders or headaches caused by chronic sinusitis.\nX-rays and other tests may also be used if sinusitis is strongly suspected.\nA neck x-ray can reveal arthritis or spinal problems.\nOther imaging tests include an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), EEG (electroencephalogram), lumbar puncture, ultrasound testing, and cerebral angiography, positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These tests are only performed if there is reason to suspect an underlying disease or as part of clinical studies.\nSymptoms that Could Indicate a Serious Underlying Condition\nHeadaches indicating a serious underlying problem, such as cerebrovascular disorder or malignant hypertension, are uncommon. (It should again be emphasized that a headache is not a common symptom of a brain tumor.) People with existing chronic headaches, however, might miss a more serious condition by believing it to be one of their usual headaches. Such patients should call a doctor promptly if the quality of a headache or accompanying symptoms has changed. Everyone should call a doctor for any of the following symptoms:\nSudden, severe headache that persists or increases in intensity over the following hours, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or altered mental states (possible hemorrhagic stroke)\nSudden, very severe headache, worse than any headache ever experienced (possible indication of hemorrhage or a ruptured aneurysm)\nChronic or severe headaches that begin after age 50\nHeadaches in the back of the head accompanied by other symptoms, such as memory loss, confusion, loss of balance, changes in speech or vision, or loss of strength in or numbness or tingling in arms or legs (possibility of small stroke in the base of the skull)\nHeadaches after head injury, especially if drowsiness or nausea are present (possibility of hemorrhage)\nHeadaches accompanied by fever, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting (possibility of spinal meningitis)\nHeadaches that increase with coughing or straining (possibility of brain swelling).\nA throbbing pain around or behind the eyes or in the forehead accompanied by redness in the eye and perceptions of halos or rings around lights (possibility of acute glaucoma)\nA one-sided headache in the temple in elderly people; the artery in the temple is firm and knotty and has no pulse; scalp is tender (possibility of temporal arteritis, which can cause blindness or even stroke if not treated)\nSudden onset and then persistent, throbbing pain around the eye possibly spreading to the ear or neck unrelieved by pain medication (possibility of blood clot in one of the sinus veins of the brain)\nBack to Top\nTreatment Approaches\nMigraine treatment involves both treating acute attacks when they occur, and developing preventive strategies for reducing the frequency and severity of attacks.\nTreating Migraine Attacks\nMany effective headache remedies are available for treating a migraine attack. Still, many patients are treated with unapproved drugs, including opoids and barbiturates that can be potentially addictive or dangerous.\nThe main types of medications for treating a migraine attack are:\nPain relievers (usually nonprescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or acetaminophen)\nErgotamines\nTriptans\nIt is best to treat a migraine attack as soon as symptoms first occur. Doctors generally recommend starting with nonprescription pain relievers for mild-to-moderate attacks. If migraine pain is severe, a prescription version of an NSAID may be recommended. A triptan is generally the next drug of choice. Ergotamine drugs tend to be less effective than triptans, but are helpful for some patients. Depending on the severity of the attacks, and accompanying symptoms, the doctor may recommend taking a triptan or ergotamine drug in tablet, injection, or suppository form. The doctor may also prescribe specific medications for treating symptoms such as nausea.\nTry to guard against rebound effect. Nearly all drugs used for migraine can cause rebound headache, and patients should not take any the drugs more than 9 days per month. If you find that you need to use acute migraine treatment more frequently, talk to your doctor about preventive medications.\nPreventing Migraine Attacks\nPreventive strategies for migraine include both drug treatment and behavioral therapy or lifestyle adjustments.\nPatients should consider using preventive migraine drugs if they have:\nMigraines that are not helped by acute treatment drugs\nFrequent attacks (more than once per week)\nSide effects from acute treatment drugs or contraindications to taking them\nThe main preventive drug treatments for migraine are:\nBeta-blocker drugs (usually propranolol [Inderal] or timolol [Blocadren]\nAnti-seizure drugs (usually divalproex [Depakote] or topiramate [Topamax]\nTricyclic antidepressants {usually amitriptyline [Elavil])\nA preventive medication strategy needs to be carefully tailored to an individual patient, taking into account the patient's medical history and co-existing medical conditions. These drugs can have serious side effects.\nA preventive medication is usually started at a low dose, and then gradually increased. It may take 2 - 3 months for a drug to achieve its full effect. Preventive treatment may be needed for 6 - 12 months or longer. Most patients take preventive medications on a daily basis, but some patients may use these drugs intermittently (for example, for preventing menstrual migraine).\nPatients can also help prevent migraines by identifying and avoiding potential triggers, such as specific foods. Relaxation therapy and stress reduction techniques may also help. (See Lifestyle section below.)\nTreatment Approaches for Children\nMigraine Treatment for Children. Most children with migraines may need only mild pain relievers and home remedies (such as ginger tea) to treat their headaches. The American Academy of Neurology's practice guidelines for children and adolescents recommend the following drug treatments:\nFor children age 6 years and older, ibuprofen (Advil) is recommended. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may also be effective. Acetaminophen works faster than ibuprofen, but the effects of ibuprofen last longer.\nFor adolescents age 12 years and older, sumaptriptan (Imitrex) nasal spray is recommended.\nMigraine Prevention for Children. Non-medication methods, including biofeedback and muscle relaxation techniques may be helpful. If these methods fail, then preventive drugs may be used, although evidence is weak on the effectiveness of standard migraine preventive drugs in children.\nWithdrawing from Medications\nIf medication overuse causes rebound migraines develop, the patients cannot recover without stopping the drugs. (If caffeine is the culprit, a person may need only to reduce coffee or tea drinking to a reasonable level, not necessarily stop drinking it altogether.) The patient can usually stop abruptly or gradually. The patient should expect the following:\nMost headache drugs can be stopped abruptly, but the patient should talk to their doctor first. Certain non-headache medications, such as anti-anxiety drugs or beta-blockers, require gradual withdrawal under medical supervision.\nIf the patient chooses to taper off standard headache medications, withdrawal should be completed within three days.\nThe patient may take other pain medicines during the first days. Examples of drugs that may be used include dihydroergotamine (with or without metoclopramide), NSAIDs (in mild cases), corticosteroids, or valproate.\nThe patient must expect their headache to get worse after they stop taking their medications, no matter which method they use. Most people feel better within 2 weeks, although headache symptoms can persist up to 16 weeks (and in rare cases even longer).\nIf the symptoms do not respond to treatment and cause severe nausea and vomiting, the patient may need to be hospitalized.\nBack to Top\nMedications for Treating Migraine Attacks\nMany different medications are used to treat migraines. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specifically approved only the following types of drugs for treating migraine attacks:\nNon-prescription drugs: Excedrin Migraine, Advil Migraine, Motrin Migraine Pain\nPrescription drugs: Triptans and ergotamine\nOther types of drugs, including opioids and barbiturates, are sometimes prescribed off-label for migraine treatment.

Stress affects most people <em>in</em> some way.", "explanation": null, "document": "The physical symptoms of anxiety disorders mirror many symptoms of stress, including:\nA fast heart rate\nRapid, shallow breathing\nIncreased muscle tension\nAnxiety is an emotional disorder, however, and is characterized by feelings of apprehension, uncertainty, fear, or panic. Unlike stress, the triggers for anxiety are not necessarily or even usually associated with specific stressful or threatening conditions. Some individuals with anxiety disorders have numerous physical complaints, such as headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, and chest pain. Severe cases of anxiety disorders are debilitating, and interfere with career, family, and social spheres.\nDepression\nDepression can be a disabling condition, and, like anxiety disorders, may sometimes be linked to chronic stress. A study of Canadian workers found that individuals with a high level of work-related stress are more than twice as likely to experience a major depressive episode, compared with people under less stress. Evidence also suggests that certain people may be genetically susceptible to depression after stressful life events.\nDepression also mimics some of the symptoms of stress, including changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and concentration. Serious depression, however, is distinguished from stress by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in life, and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide. Acute depression is also accompanied by significant changes in the patient's functioning. Professional therapy may be needed in order to determine if depression is caused by stress, or if it is the primary problem.\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a reaction to a very traumatic event, and it is actually classified as an anxiety disorder. The event that brings on PTSD is usually outside the norm of human experience, such as intense combat or sexual assault. The patient struggles to forget the traumatic event and frequently develops emotional numbness and event-related amnesia. Often, however, there is a mental flashback, and the patient re-experiences the painful circumstance in the form of dreams and disturbing thoughts and memories. These thoughts and dreams resemble or recall the trauma. Other symptoms may include lack of pleasure in formerly enjoyed activities, hopelessness, irritability, mood swings, sleep problems, inability to concentrate, and an excessive startle-response to noise.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nPerhaps the best general approach for treating stress can be found in the elegant passage by Reinhold Niebuhr, \"Grant me the courage to change the things I can change, the serenity to accept the things I can't change, and the wisdom to know the difference.\" The process of learning to control stress is life-long, and will not only contribute to better health, but a greater ability to succeed in one's own agenda.\nWhen to Seek Professional Help for Stress\nStress can be a factor in a variety of physical and emotional illnesses, which should be professionally treated. Many stress symptoms are mild and can be managed by over-the-counter medications (for example, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen for tension headaches; antacids, anti-diarrhea medications, or laxatives for mild stomach distress). A physician should be consulted, however, for physical symptoms that are out of the ordinary, particularly those that get worse or wake a person up at night. A mental health professional should be consulted for unmanageable acute stress or for severe anxiety or depression. Often short-term therapy can resolve stress-related emotional problems.\nConsiderations for Choosing a Strategy for Reducing Stress\nIn choosing specific strategies for treating stress, several factors should be considered.\nNo single method is always successful: A combination of approaches is generally most effective.\nWhat works for one person does not necessarily work for someone else.\nStress can be positive as well as negative. Appropriate and controllable stress provides interest and excitement and motivates the individual to greater achievement. A lack of stress may lead to boredom and depression.\nStress may play a part in making people vulnerable to illness. A physician or psychologist should be consulted if there are any indications of accompanying medical or psychological conditions, such as heart symptoms, significant pain, anxiety, or depression.\nOvercoming Obstacles to Treatment\nPeople often succeed in relieving stress for the short term. However, they go back to previous ways of stressful thinking and behaving because of outside pressure, long-held beliefs, or habits. The following are some obstacles to managing stress:\nThe fight or flight urge: The very idea of relaxation can feel threatening, because it is perceived as letting down one's guard. For example, an over-demanding boss may put a subordinate into a psychological state of fighting-readiness, even though there is no safe opportunity for the subordinate to fight back or express anger. Stress builds up, but the worker has the illusion, even subconsciously, that the stress itself is providing safety or preparedness. For this reason, the employee does nothing to correct the condition.\nMany people are afraid of being perceived as selfish if they engage in stress-reducing activities that benefit only themselves. The truth is that self-sacrifice (in the form of not reducing one's stress) may be inappropriate and even damaging, if the person making the sacrifice is unhappy, angry, or physically unwell.\nSome people believe that certain emotional responses to stress, such as anger, are natural and unchangeable features of personality. Research has shown, however, that with cognitive behavioral therapy, individuals can be taught to change their emotional reactions to stressful events.\nIt is essential to remember that reducing stress and staying relaxed clears the mind, so it can begin appropriate actions to get rid of the stress-ridden conditions.\nStress Reduction and Effects on Health\nAlthough treating stress cannot cure medical problems, stress management can be a very important part of medical treatment. Specific stress reduction approaches may benefit different medical problems. For example, acupuncture in one study helped reduce harmful heart muscle actions in people with heart failure, but it had no effect on blood pressure. Relaxation methods, on the other hand, may help people with high blood pressure. Stress reduction may improve well-being and quality of life for many patients who are experiencing stress because of severe or chronic medical conditions.\nImportant Note: Never use stress reduction techniques as the only treatment, or in place of proven treatments, for any medical condition.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAt some point in their lives virtually everyone will experience stressful events or situations that overwhelm their natural coping mechanisms. In one poll, 89% of respondents indicated that they had experienced serious stress in their lives. Some people are simply biologically prone to stress. Many outside factors influence susceptibility as well.\nConditions Most Likely To Produce Stress-Related Health Problems. Conditions that are most likely to be associated with stress and negative physical effects include the following:\nAn accumulation of persistent stressful situations, particularly those that a person cannot easily control (for example, high-pressured work plus an unhappy relationship)\nPersistent stress following a severe acute response to a traumatic event (such as an automobile accident)\nAcute stress accompanying serious illness, such as heart disease\nFactors That Influence the Response to Stress. People respond to stress differently, depending on different factors:\nEarly nurturing: Abusive behavior towards children may cause long-term abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary system, which regulates stress.\nPersonality traits: Certain people have personality traits that cause them to over-respond to stressful events.\nGenetic factors: Some people have genetic factors that affect stress, such as having a more or less efficient relaxation response. One study found a genetic abnormality in serotonin regulation that was connected with a heightened reaction of heart rates and blood pressure in response to stress. (Serotonin is a brain chemical involved with feelings of well-being.)\nImmune regulated diseases: Certain diseases that are associated with immune abnormalities (such as rheumatoid arthritis or eczema) may actually weaken a response to stress.\nThe length and quality of stressors: Naturally, the longer the duration and more intense the stressors, the more harmful the effects.\nIndividuals at Higher Risk for Stress. Studies indicate that the following people are more vulnerable to the effects of stress than others:\nOlder adults: As people age, achieving a relaxation response after a stressful event becomes more difficult. Aging may simply wear out the systems in the brain that respond to stress, so that they become inefficient. The elderly, too, are very often exposed to major stressors such as medical problems, the loss of a spouse and friends, a change in a living situation, and financial worries. No one is immune to stress, however, and it may simply go unnoticed in the very young and old.\nWomen in general and working mothers specifically: Working mothers, regardless of whether they are married or single, face higher stress levels and possibly adverse health effects, most likely because they bear a greater and more diffuse work load than men or other women. This has been observed in women in the U.S. and in Europe. Such stress may also have a domino and harmful effect on their children. It is not clear, however, if stress has the same adverse effects on women's hearts as it does on men's.\nLess educated individuals.\nDivorced or widowed individuals: Numerous studies indicate that unmarried people generally do not live as long as their married contemporaries.\nAnyone experiencing financial strain, particularly long-term unemployed and those without health insurance.\nPeople who are isolated or lonely.\nPeople who are targets of racial or sexual discrimination.\nPeople who live in cities.\nChildhood Factors\nChildren are frequent victims of stress because they are often unable to communicate their feelings accurately. They also have trouble communicating their responses to events over which they have no control. Certain physical symptoms, notably repeated abdominal pain without a known cause, may be indicators of stress in children.\nVarious conditions can affect their susceptibility to stress.\nParental Stress. Parental stress, especially in mothers, is a particularly powerful source of stress in children, even more important than poverty or overcrowding. Young children of mothers who are highly stressed (particularly if they were depressed) tend to be at high risk for developing stress-related problems. This may be especially true if the mothers were stressed during both the child's infancy and early years. Some evidence even supports the old idea that stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the infant's mood and behavior. Older children with stressed mothers may become aggressive and anti-social. Another study suggested that stress-reduction techniques in parents may improve their children's behavior.\nGender Differences in Adolescent Stress. Adolescent boys and girls experience equal amounts of stress, but the source and effects may differ. Girls tend to become stressed from interpersonal situations, and stress is more likely to lead to depression in girls than in boys. For boys, however, specific events, such as changing schools or getting poor grades, appear to be the major sources of stress.\nA report issued in October 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends more unstructured play time for children. The report notes that today?\u00a2\u00e2'\u00ac\u00e2'\u00a2s overscheduled, hurried lifestyle that many children experience is a source of stress and anxiety in some children.\nWork and Stress\nIn a study of 46,000 workers, health care costs were 147% higher in workers who were stressed or depressed than in others who were not. Furthermore, according to one survey, 40% of American workers describe their jobs as very stressful, making job-related stress an important and preventable health hazard.\nSeveral studies are now suggesting that job-related stress is as great a threat to health as smoking or not exercising. Stress impairs concentration, causes sleeplessness, and increases the risk for illness, back problems, accidents, and lost time from work. Work stress can lead to harassment or even violence while on the job. At its most extreme, chronic stress places a burden on the heart and circulation that in some cases may be fatal. The Japanese even have a word for sudden death due to overwork, karoushi.\nNot all work stress is harmful. However, studies suggest the following job-related stressors may increase people's -- particularly men's -- health risks:\nHaving no say in decisions that affect one's responsibilities\nUnrelenting and unreasonable performance demands\nLack of effective communication and conflict-resolution methods among workers and employers\nLack of job security\nNight-shift work, long hours, or both\nToo much time spent away from home and family\nWages not matching levels of responsibility\nReducing Stress on the Job. Many institutions within the current culture, while paying lip service to stress reduction, put intense pressure on individuals to behave in ways that increase tension. Yet, there are numerous effective management tools and techniques available to reduce stress. Furthermore, treatment for work-related stress has proven benefits for both the employee and employer. In one study, at the end of 2 years, a company that instituted a stress management program saved nearly $150,000 in workers compensations costs (the cost of the program was only $6,000). Other studies have reported specific health benefits resulting from workplace stress-management programs. In one of the studies, workers with hypertension experienced reduced blood pressure after even a brief (16-hour) program that helped them manage stress behaviorally.\nIn general, however, few workplaces offer stress management programs, and it is usually up to the employee to find their own ways to reduce stress. Here are some suggestions:\nSeek out someone in the Human Resources department or a sympathetic manager and communicate concerns about job stress. Work with them in a non-confrontational way to improve working conditions, letting them know that productivity can be improved if some of the pressure is off.\nEstablish or reinforce a network of friends at work and at home.\nRestructure priorities and eliminate unnecessary tasks.\nLearn to focus on positive outcomes.\nIf the job is unendurable, plan and execute a career change. Send out resumes or work on transfers within the company.\nIf this isn't possible, be sure to schedule daily pleasant activities and physical exercise during free time.\nIt may be helpful to keep in mind that bosses are also victimized by the same stressful conditions they are imposing. For example, in one study of male managers in three Swedish companies, those who worked in a bureaucracy had greater stress-related heart risks than those who worked in companies with social supports.\nCaregiving\nCaregivers of Family Members. Studies show that caregivers of physically or mentally disabled family members are at risk for chronic stress. One study reported that overall mortality rates were over 60% higher in caregivers who were under constant stress. Spouses caring for a disabled partner are particularly vulnerable to a range of stress-related health threats, including influenza, depression, heart disease, and even poorer survival rates. Caring for a spouse with even minor disabilities can induce severe stress.\nSpecific risk factors that put caregivers at higher risk for severe stress, or stress-related illnesses, include:\nCaregiving wives: Some studies suggest that wives experience significantly greater stress from caregiving than husbands do.\nHaving a low income.\nBeing African-American: African-Americans tend to be in poorer physical health, and have lower incomes, than Caucasians. They therefore face greater stress as caregivers to their spouses than their white counterparts.\nLiving alone with the patient.\nHelping a highly dependent patient.\nHaving a difficult relationship with the patient.\nIntervention programs that are aimed at helping the caregiver approach the situation positively can reduce stress, and help the caregiver maintain a positive attitude. A 2002 program also demonstrated that moderate-intensity exercise was very helpful in reducing stress and improving sleep in caregivers.\nHealth Professional Caregivers. Caregiving among the health professionals is also a high risk factor for stress. One study, for example, found that registered nurses with low job control, high job demands, and low work-related social support experienced very dramatic health declines, both physically and emotionally.\nAnxiety Disorders\nPeople who are less emotionally stable or have high anxiety levels tend to experience specific events as more stressful than others. Some doctors describe an exaggerated negative response to stress as \"catastrophizing\" the event (turning it into a catastrophe). Nevertheless, a 2003 study of patients with anxiety disorder did not find any differences in actual physical response to stress (heart rate, blood pressure, release of stress hormones) compared to people without anxiety.\nLacking a Social Network\nThe lack of an established network of family and friends predisposes one to stress disorders and stress-related health problems, including heart disease and infections. A study, meanwhile, reported that older people who maintain active relationships with their adult children are buffered against the adverse health effects of chronic stress-inducing situations, such as low income or lower social class. Another study suggested this may be because people who live alone are unable to discuss negative feelings as a means to relieve their stress.\nStudies of people who remain happy and healthy despite many life stresses conclude that most have very good networks of social support. One study indicated that support even from strangers reduced blood pressure surges in people undergoing a stressful event. Many studies suggest that having a pet helps reduce medical problems aggravated by stress, including heart disease and high blood pressure.\nBack to Top\nLifestyle Changes\nA healthy lifestyle is an essential companion to any stress-reduction program. General health and stress resistance can be enhanced by regular exercise, a diet rich in a variety of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, and by avoiding excessive alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco.\nExercise\nExercise in combination with stress management techniques is extremely important for many reasons:\nExercise is an effective distraction from stressful events.\nExercise may directly blunt the harmful effects of stress on blood pressure and the heart (exercise protects the heart in any case).\nUsually, a varied exercise regime is more interesting, and thus easier to stick to. Start slowly. Strenuous exercise in people who are not used to it can be very dangerous and any exercise program should be discussed with a physician. In addition, half of all people who begin a vigorous training regime drop out within a year. The key is to find activities that are exciting, challenging, and satisfying. The following are some suggestions:\nSign up for aerobics classes at a gym.\nBrisk walking is an excellent aerobic exercise that is free and available to nearly anyone. Even short brisk walks can relieve bouts of stress.\nSwimming is an ideal exercise for many stressed people, including pregnant women, individuals with musculoskeletal problems, and those who suffer exercise-induced asthma.\nYoga or Tai Chi can be very effective, combining many of the benefits of breathing, muscle relaxation, and meditation while toning and stretching the muscles. The benefits of yoga may be considerable. Numerous studies have found it beneficial for many conditions in which stress is an important factor, such as anxiety, headaches, high blood pressure, and asthma. It also elevates mood and improves concentration and the ability to focus.\nAs in other areas of stress management, making a plan and executing it successfully develops feelings of mastery and control, which are very beneficial in and of themselves. Start small. Just 10 minutes of exercise three times a week can build a good base for novices. Gradually build up the length of these every-other-day sessions to 30 minutes or more.\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is among the most effective ways of reducing stress, both when the source of stress is chronic pain or a chronic disease. In fact, in a study of patients with HIV, CBT was more helpful than support groups for improving well-being and quality-of-life.\nA typical CBT approach includes identifying sources of stress, restructuring priorities, changing one's response to stress, and finding methods for managing and reducing stress.\nIdentifying Sources of Stress. One key component in most CBT approaches is a diary that keeps an informal inventory of daily events and activities. While this exercise might itself seem stress producing (and yet one more chore), it need not be done in painstaking detail. A few words accompanying a time and date are usually enough to serve as reminders of significant events or activities.\nThe first step is to note activities that put a strain on energy and time, trigger anger or anxiety, or precipitate a negative physical response (such as a sour stomach or headache).\nAlso note positive experiences, such as those that are mentally or physically refreshing or produce a sense of accomplishment.\nAfter a week or two, try to identify two or three events or activities that have been significantly upsetting or overwhelming.\nQuestioning the Sources of Stress. Individuals should then ask themselves the following questions:\nDo these stressful activities meet my goals or someone else's?\nHave I taken on tasks that I can reasonably accomplish?\nWhich tasks are under my control and which ones aren't?\nRestructuring Priorities: Adding Stress Reducing Activities. The next step is to attempt to shift the balance from stress-producing to stress-reducing activities. Eliminating stress is rarely practical or feasible, but there are many ways to reduce its impact.\nConsider as many relief options as possible. Examples include:\nListen to music. Music is an effective stress reducer in both healthy individuals and people with health problems. In one study, for example, students who listened to a well-known gentle classical piece of music during a stressful task had reduced feelings of anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure.\nTake long weekends or, ideally, vacations.\nIf the source of stress is in the home, plan times away, even if it is only an hour or 2 a week.\nReplace unnecessary time-consuming chores with pleasurable or interesting activities.\nMake time for recreation. This is as essential as paying bills or shopping for groceries.\nOwn a pet. In a study of people with high blood pressure, pet owners had much lower blood pressure increase in response to stress than non-owners. Note that owning a pet was beneficial only for people who like animals to begin with.\nDiscuss Feelings. The concept of communication and letting your feelings out has been so excessively promoted and parodied that it has nearly lost its value as good psychological advice. Nevertheless, feelings of anger or frustration that are not expressed in an acceptable way may lead to hostility, a sense of helplessness, and depression.\nExpressing feelings does not mean venting frustration on waiters and subordinates, boring friends with emotional minutia, or wallowing in self-pity. In fact, because blood pressure may spike when certain chronically hostile individuals become angry, some therapists strongly advise that just talking, not simply venting anger, is the best approach, especially for these people.\nThe primary goal is to explain and assert one's needs to a trusted individual in as positive a way as possible. Direct communication may not even be necessary. Writing in a journal, writing a poem, or composing a letter that is never mailed may be sufficient.\nExpressing one's feelings solves only half of the communication puzzle. Learning to listen, empathize, and respond to others with understanding is just as important for maintaining the strong relationships necessary for emotional fulfillment and reduced stress.\nKeep Perspective and Look for the Positive. Reversing negative ideas and learning to focus on positive outcomes helps reduce tension and achieve goals. The following steps, using an example of a person who is alarmed at the prospect of giving a speech, may be useful:\nFirst, identify the worst possible outcomes (forgetting the speech, stumbling over words, humiliation, audience contempt).\nRate the likelihood of these bad outcomes happening (probably very low or that speaker wouldn't have been selected in the first place).\nEnvision a favorable result (a well-rounded, articulate presentation with rewarding applause).\nDevelop a specific plan to achieve the positive outcome (preparing in front of a mirror, using a video camera or tape recorder, relaxation exercises).\nTry to recall previous situations that initially seemed negative but ended well.\nUse Humor. Research has shown that humor is a very effective mechanism for coping with acute stress. Keeping a sense of humor during difficult situations is a common recommendation from stress management experts. Laughter not only releases the tension of pent-up feelings and helps keep perspective, but it appears to have actual physical effects that reduce stress hormone levels. It is not uncommon for people to recall laughing intensely even during tragic events, such as the death of a loved one, and to remember this laughter as helping them to endure the emotional pain.\nRelaxation and Other Alternative Techniques\nRelaxation Methods. Since stress is here to stay, everyone needs to develop methods to promote the relaxation response, the natural unwinding of the stress response. Relaxation lowers blood pressure, respiration, and pulse rates, releases muscle tension, and eases emotional strains. This response is highly individualized, but there are certain approaches that seem to work.\nCombinations are probably best. For example, in a study of children and adolescents with adjustment disorder and depression, a combination of yoga, a brief massage, and progressive muscle relaxation effectively reduced both feelings of anxiety and stress hormone levels. No one should expect a total resolution of stress from these approaches, but if done regularly, these programs can be very effective.\nNo one should expect a total resolution of stress from these approaches, but if done regularly, these programs can be very effective.\nAcupuncture. Some evidence suggests that acupuncture may also be helpful. It might even improve some physical factors associated with stress and health problems. For example, in a study of heart failure patients, acupuncture improved stress-related heart muscle activity, which could be an important benefit in these patients. However, acupuncture had no effect on stress-related blood pressure or heart rate.\nHypnosis. Hypnosis may also benefit some people with severe stress. In one study of patients with irritable bowel, stress reduction by hypnosis correlated with improvement in many bowel symptoms.\nRelaxation Methods\nSpecific Procedure\nDeep Breathing Exercises. During stress, breathing becomes shallow and rapid. Taking a deep breath is an automatic and effective technique for winding down. Deep breathing exercises consciously intensify this natural physiologic reaction and can be very useful during a stressful situation, or for maintaining a relaxed state during the day.\nInhale through the nose slowly and deeply to the count of 10.\nMake sure that the stomach and abdomen expand, but the chest does not rise.\nExhale through the nose, slowly and completely, also to the count of 10.\nTo help quiet the mind, concentrate fully on breathing and counting through each cycle.\nRepeat five to 10 times, and make a habit of doing the exercise several times each day, even when not feeling stressed.\nMuscle Relaxation. Muscle relaxation techniques, often combined with deep breathing, are simple to learn and very useful for getting to sleep. In the beginning it is useful to have a friend or partner check for tension by lifting an arm and dropping it. The arm should fall freely. Practice makes the exercise much more effective and produces relaxation much more rapidly. Small studies have reported beneficial effects on blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure who use this technique.\nAfter lying down in a comfortable position without crossing the limbs, concentrate on each part of the body.\nMaintain a slow, deep breathing pattern throughout this exercise.\nTense each muscle as tightly as possible for a count of five to 10, and then release it completely.\nExperience the muscle as totally relaxed and lead-heavy.\nBegin with the top of the head and progress downward to focus on all the muscles in the body.\nBe sure to include the forehead, ears, eyes, mouth, neck, shoulders, arms and hands, fingers, chest, belly, thighs, calves, and feet.\nOnce the external review is complete, imagine tensing and releasing internal muscles.\nMeditation. Meditation, used for many years in Eastern cultures, is now widely accepted in this country as a relaxation technique. The goal of all meditative procedures, both religious and therapeutic, is to quiet the mind (essentially, to relax thought). Small studies have suggested that regular meditation can benefit the heart and help reduce blood pressure. Better research is needed, however, to confirm such claims.\nSome recommend meditating for no longer than 20 minutes in the morning after awakening and then again in early evening before dinner. Even once a day is helpful. Note: Meditating before going to bed may cause some people to wake up in the middle of the night, alert and unable to return to sleep.\nNew practitioners should understand that it can be difficult to quiet the mind, and should not be discouraged by lack of immediate results.\nSeveral techniques are available. A few are discussed here.\nThe only potential risks from meditating are in people with psychosis, in whom meditating may trigger a psychotic event.\nMindfulness Meditation. Mindfulness is a common practice that focuses on breathing. It employs the basic technique used in other forms of meditation.\nSit upright with the spine straight, either cross-legged or sitting on a firm chair with both feet on the floor, uncrossed.\nWith the eyes closed or gently looking a few feet ahead, observe the exhalation of the breath.\nAs the mind wanders, simply note it as a fact and returns to the \"out\" breath. It may be helpful to imagine your thoughts as clouds dissipating away.\nTranscendental Meditation (TM). TM uses a mantra (a word that has a specific chanting sound but no meaning). The person meditating repeats the word silently, letting thoughts come and go. In one study, TM was as effective as exercise in elevating mood.\nMini-Meditation. The method involves heightening awareness of the immediate surrounding environment. Choose a routine activity when alone. For example:\nWhile washing dishes, concentrate on the feel of the water and dishes.\nAllow the mind to wander to any immediate sensory experience (sounds outside the window, smells from the stove, colors in the room).\nIf the mind begins to think about the past or future, or fills with unformed thoughts or worries, redirect it gently back.\nThis redirection of brain activity from your thoughts and worries to your senses disrupts the stress response and prompts relaxation. It also helps promote an emotional and sensual appreciation of simple pleasures already present in a person's life.\nBiofeedback. Biofeedback is a technique that measures bodily functions, like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, and muscle tension. By watching these measurements, you can learn how to alter these functions by relaxing or holding pleasant images in your mind.\nDuring biofeedback, electric leads are taped to a subject's head.\nThe person is encouraged to relax using methods such as those described above.\nBrain waves are measured and an audible signal is emitted when alpha waves are detected, a frequency which coincides with a state of deep relaxation.\nBy repeating the process, subjects associate the sound with the relaxed state and learn to achieve relaxation by themselves.\nMassage Therapy. A review of data from multiple studies showed that massage therapy decreases cortisol levels. Interestingly, massage was more beneficial than receiving social support from the partner, indicating the power of physical touch in managing stress.\nSeveral massage therapies are available.\nMany massage techniques are available, such as the following:\nSwedish massage is the standard massage technique. It uses long smooth strokes, and kneading and tapping of the muscles.\nShiatsu applies intense pressure to the same points targeted in acupuncture. It can be painful, but people report deep relaxation afterward.\nReflexology manipulates acupuncture points in the hands and feet.\nHerbal and Natural Remedies\nSome people who experience chronic stress seek herbal or natural remedies. It should be strongly noted, however, that just as with standard drugs, so-called natural remedies can cause problems, sometimes serious ones.\nAromatherapy. The smell of lavender has long been associated with a calming effect. In addition, several other aromatherapies are now used for relaxation. Use caution, however, as some of the exotic plant extracts in these formulas have been associated with a wide range of skin allergies.\nValerian. Valerian is an herb that has sedative qualities and may reduce stress and associated physical effects. This herb is on the FDA's list of generally safe products. Of note, however, the herb's effects could be dangerously increased if it is used with standard sedatives. Other interactions and long-term side effects are unknown. Side effects include vivid dreams. High doses of valerian can cause blurred vision, excitability, and changes in heart rhythm.\nGenerally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, however, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been numerous reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary supplements.\nSpecial Warning on Kava. Kava has been commonly used to reduce anxiety and stress. It is now highly associated with liver injury and even liver failure in a few cases. Experts now strongly warn against its use.\nPeople seeking relief from stress should be wary of things that promise a quick cure, or plans that include the purchase of expensive treatments. These treatments may be useless and sometimes even dangerous.\n"}, {"score": 480.759, "uuid": "16280e0f-d441-581b-b042-ce15fa2c5b94", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1315wb-67-25594", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/Stress", "page_rank": 1.1802074e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "Stress Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Knowing <em>what</em> occurs <em>at</em> the cellular level may help researchers find more ways to counteract the detrimental physical and emotional effects of stress. * Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) <em>is</em> one of the most effective ways of <em>reducing</em> stress. Stress affects most people <em>in</em> some way.", "explanation": null, "document": "The physical symptoms of anxiety disorders mirror many symptoms of stress, including:\nA fast heart rate\nRapid, shallow breathing\nIncreased muscle tension\nAnxiety is an emotional disorder, however, and is characterized by feelings of apprehension, uncertainty, fear, or panic. Unlike stress, the triggers for anxiety are not necessarily or even usually associated with specific stressful or threatening conditions. Some individuals with anxiety disorders have numerous physical complaints, such as headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, and chest pain. Severe cases of anxiety disorders are debilitating, and interfere with career, family, and social spheres.\nDepression\nDepression can be a disabling condition, and, like anxiety disorders, may sometimes be linked to chronic stress. A study of Canadian workers found that individuals with a high level of work-related stress are more than twice as likely to experience a major depressive episode, compared with people under less stress. Evidence also suggests that certain people may be genetically susceptible to depression after stressful life events.\nDepression also mimics some of the symptoms of stress, including changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and concentration. Serious depression, however, is distinguished from stress by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in life, and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide. Acute depression is also accompanied by significant changes in the patient's functioning. Professional therapy may be needed in order to determine if depression is caused by stress, or if it is the primary problem.\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a reaction to a very traumatic event, and it is actually classified as an anxiety disorder. The event that brings on PTSD is usually outside the norm of human experience, such as intense combat or sexual assault. The patient struggles to forget the traumatic event and frequently develops emotional numbness and event-related amnesia. Often, however, there is a mental flashback, and the patient re-experiences the painful circumstance in the form of dreams and disturbing thoughts and memories. These thoughts and dreams resemble or recall the trauma. Other symptoms may include lack of pleasure in formerly enjoyed activities, hopelessness, irritability, mood swings, sleep problems, inability to concentrate, and an excessive startle-response to noise.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nPerhaps the best general approach for treating stress can be found in the elegant passage by Reinhold Niebuhr, \"Grant me the courage to change the things I can change, the serenity to accept the things I can't change, and the wisdom to know the difference.\" The process of learning to control stress is life-long, and will not only contribute to better health, but a greater ability to succeed in one's own agenda.\nWhen to Seek Professional Help for Stress\nStress can be a factor in a variety of physical and emotional illnesses, which should be professionally treated. Many stress symptoms are mild and can be managed by over-the-counter medications (for example, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen for tension headaches; antacids, anti-diarrhea medications, or laxatives for mild stomach distress). A physician should be consulted, however, for physical symptoms that are out of the ordinary, particularly those that get worse or wake a person up at night. A mental health professional should be consulted for unmanageable acute stress or for severe anxiety or depression. Often short-term therapy can resolve stress-related emotional problems.\nConsiderations for Choosing a Strategy for Reducing Stress\nIn choosing specific strategies for treating stress, several factors should be considered.\nNo single method is always successful: A combination of approaches is generally most effective.\nWhat works for one person does not necessarily work for someone else.\nStress can be positive as well as negative. Appropriate and controllable stress provides interest and excitement and motivates the individual to greater achievement. A lack of stress may lead to boredom and depression.\nStress may play a part in making people vulnerable to illness. A physician or psychologist should be consulted if there are any indications of accompanying medical or psychological conditions, such as heart symptoms, significant pain, anxiety, or depression.\nOvercoming Obstacles to Treatment\nPeople often succeed in relieving stress for the short term. However, they go back to previous ways of stressful thinking and behaving because of outside pressure, long-held beliefs, or habits. The following are some obstacles to managing stress:\nThe fight or flight urge: The very idea of relaxation can feel threatening, because it is perceived as letting down one's guard. For example, an over-demanding boss may put a subordinate into a psychological state of fighting-readiness, even though there is no safe opportunity for the subordinate to fight back or express anger. Stress builds up, but the worker has the illusion, even subconsciously, that the stress itself is providing safety or preparedness. For this reason, the employee does nothing to correct the condition.\nMany people are afraid of being perceived as selfish if they engage in stress-reducing activities that benefit only themselves. The truth is that self-sacrifice (in the form of not reducing one's stress) may be inappropriate and even damaging, if the person making the sacrifice is unhappy, angry, or physically unwell.\nSome people believe that certain emotional responses to stress, such as anger, are natural and unchangeable features of personality. Research has shown, however, that with cognitive behavioral therapy, individuals can be taught to change their emotional reactions to stressful events.\nIt is essential to remember that reducing stress and staying relaxed clears the mind, so it can begin appropriate actions to get rid of the stress-ridden conditions.\nStress Reduction and Effects on Health\nAlthough treating stress cannot cure medical problems, stress management can be a very important part of medical treatment. Specific stress reduction approaches may benefit different medical problems. For example, acupuncture in one study helped reduce harmful heart muscle actions in people with heart failure, but it had no effect on blood pressure. Relaxation methods, on the other hand, may help people with high blood pressure. Stress reduction may improve well-being and quality of life for many patients who are experiencing stress because of severe or chronic medical conditions.\nImportant Note: Never use stress reduction techniques as the only treatment, or in place of proven treatments, for any medical condition.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAt some point in their lives virtually everyone will experience stressful events or situations that overwhelm their natural coping mechanisms. In one poll, 89% of respondents indicated that they had experienced serious stress in their lives. Some people are simply biologically prone to stress. Many outside factors influence susceptibility as well.\nConditions Most Likely To Produce Stress-Related Health Problems. Conditions that are most likely to be associated with stress and negative physical effects include the following:\nAn accumulation of persistent stressful situations, particularly those that a person cannot easily control (for example, high-pressured work plus an unhappy relationship)\nPersistent stress following a severe acute response to a traumatic event (such as an automobile accident)\nAcute stress accompanying serious illness, such as heart disease\nFactors That Influence the Response to Stress. People respond to stress differently, depending on different factors:\nEarly nurturing: Abusive behavior towards children may cause long-term abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary system, which regulates stress.\nPersonality traits: Certain people have personality traits that cause them to over-respond to stressful events.\nGenetic factors: Some people have genetic factors that affect stress, such as having a more or less efficient relaxation response. One study found a genetic abnormality in serotonin regulation that was connected with a heightened reaction of heart rates and blood pressure in response to stress. (Serotonin is a brain chemical involved with feelings of well-being.)\nImmune regulated diseases: Certain diseases that are associated with immune abnormalities (such as rheumatoid arthritis or eczema) may actually weaken a response to stress.\nThe length and quality of stressors: Naturally, the longer the duration and more intense the stressors, the more harmful the effects.\nIndividuals at Higher Risk for Stress. Studies indicate that the following people are more vulnerable to the effects of stress than others:\nOlder adults: As people age, achieving a relaxation response after a stressful event becomes more difficult. Aging may simply wear out the systems in the brain that respond to stress, so that they become inefficient. The elderly, too, are very often exposed to major stressors such as medical problems, the loss of a spouse and friends, a change in a living situation, and financial worries. No one is immune to stress, however, and it may simply go unnoticed in the very young and old.\nWomen in general and working mothers specifically: Working mothers, regardless of whether they are married or single, face higher stress levels and possibly adverse health effects, most likely because they bear a greater and more diffuse work load than men or other women. This has been observed in women in the U.S. and in Europe. Such stress may also have a domino and harmful effect on their children. It is not clear, however, if stress has the same adverse effects on women's hearts as it does on men's.\nLess educated individuals.\nDivorced or widowed individuals: Numerous studies indicate that unmarried people generally do not live as long as their married contemporaries.\nAnyone experiencing financial strain, particularly long-term unemployed and those without health insurance.\nPeople who are isolated or lonely.\nPeople who are targets of racial or sexual discrimination.\nPeople who live in cities.\nChildhood Factors\nChildren are frequent victims of stress because they are often unable to communicate their feelings accurately. They also have trouble communicating their responses to events over which they have no control. Certain physical symptoms, notably repeated abdominal pain without a known cause, may be indicators of stress in children.\nVarious conditions can affect their susceptibility to stress.\nParental Stress. Parental stress, especially in mothers, is a particularly powerful source of stress in children, even more important than poverty or overcrowding. Young children of mothers who are highly stressed (particularly if they were depressed) tend to be at high risk for developing stress-related problems. This may be especially true if the mothers were stressed during both the child's infancy and early years. Some evidence even supports the old idea that stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the infant's mood and behavior. Older children with stressed mothers may become aggressive and anti-social. Another study suggested that stress-reduction techniques in parents may improve their children's behavior.\nGender Differences in Adolescent Stress. Adolescent boys and girls experience equal amounts of stress, but the source and effects may differ. Girls tend to become stressed from interpersonal situations, and stress is more likely to lead to depression in girls than in boys. For boys, however, specific events, such as changing schools or getting poor grades, appear to be the major sources of stress.\nA report issued in October 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends more unstructured play time for children. The report notes that today?\u00a2\u00e2'\u00ac\u00e2'\u00a2s overscheduled, hurried lifestyle that many children experience is a source of stress and anxiety in some children.\nWork and Stress\nIn a study of 46,000 workers, health care costs were 147% higher in workers who were stressed or depressed than in others who were not. Furthermore, according to one survey, 40% of American workers describe their jobs as very stressful, making job-related stress an important and preventable health hazard.\nSeveral studies are now suggesting that job-related stress is as great a threat to health as smoking or not exercising. Stress impairs concentration, causes sleeplessness, and increases the risk for illness, back problems, accidents, and lost time from work. Work stress can lead to harassment or even violence while on the job. At its most extreme, chronic stress places a burden on the heart and circulation that in some cases may be fatal. The Japanese even have a word for sudden death due to overwork, karoushi.\nNot all work stress is harmful. However, studies suggest the following job-related stressors may increase people's -- particularly men's -- health risks:\nHaving no say in decisions that affect one's responsibilities\nUnrelenting and unreasonable performance demands\nLack of effective communication and conflict-resolution methods among workers and employers\nLack of job security\nNight-shift work, long hours, or both\nToo much time spent away from home and family\nWages not matching levels of responsibility\nReducing Stress on the Job. Many institutions within the current culture, while paying lip service to stress reduction, put intense pressure on individuals to behave in ways that increase tension. Yet, there are numerous effective management tools and techniques available to reduce stress. Furthermore, treatment for work-related stress has proven benefits for both the employee and employer. In one study, at the end of 2 years, a company that instituted a stress management program saved nearly $150,000 in workers compensations costs (the cost of the program was only $6,000). Other studies have reported specific health benefits resulting from workplace stress-management programs. In one of the studies, workers with hypertension experienced reduced blood pressure after even a brief (16-hour) program that helped them manage stress behaviorally.\nIn general, however, few workplaces offer stress management programs, and it is usually up to the employee to find their own ways to reduce stress. Here are some suggestions:\nSeek out someone in the Human Resources department or a sympathetic manager and communicate concerns about job stress. Work with them in a non-confrontational way to improve working conditions, letting them know that productivity can be improved if some of the pressure is off.\nEstablish or reinforce a network of friends at work and at home.\nRestructure priorities and eliminate unnecessary tasks.\nLearn to focus on positive outcomes.\nIf the job is unendurable, plan and execute a career change. Send out resumes or work on transfers within the company.\nIf this isn't possible, be sure to schedule daily pleasant activities and physical exercise during free time.\nIt may be helpful to keep in mind that bosses are also victimized by the same stressful conditions they are imposing. For example, in one study of male managers in three Swedish companies, those who worked in a bureaucracy had greater stress-related heart risks than those who worked in companies with social supports.\nCaregiving\nCaregivers of Family Members. Studies show that caregivers of physically or mentally disabled family members are at risk for chronic stress. One study reported that overall mortality rates were over 60% higher in caregivers who were under constant stress. Spouses caring for a disabled partner are particularly vulnerable to a range of stress-related health threats, including influenza, depression, heart disease, and even poorer survival rates. Caring for a spouse with even minor disabilities can induce severe stress.\nSpecific risk factors that put caregivers at higher risk for severe stress, or stress-related illnesses, include:\nCaregiving wives: Some studies suggest that wives experience significantly greater stress from caregiving than husbands do.\nHaving a low income.\nBeing African-American: African-Americans tend to be in poorer physical health, and have lower incomes, than Caucasians. They therefore face greater stress as caregivers to their spouses than their white counterparts.\nLiving alone with the patient.\nHelping a highly dependent patient.\nHaving a difficult relationship with the patient.\nIntervention programs that are aimed at helping the caregiver approach the situation positively can reduce stress, and help the caregiver maintain a positive attitude. A 2002 program also demonstrated that moderate-intensity exercise was very helpful in reducing stress and improving sleep in caregivers.\nHealth Professional Caregivers. Caregiving among the health professionals is also a high risk factor for stress. One study, for example, found that registered nurses with low job control, high job demands, and low work-related social support experienced very dramatic health declines, both physically and emotionally.\nAnxiety Disorders\nPeople who are less emotionally stable or have high anxiety levels tend to experience specific events as more stressful than others. Some doctors describe an exaggerated negative response to stress as \"catastrophizing\" the event (turning it into a catastrophe). Nevertheless, a 2003 study of patients with anxiety disorder did not find any differences in actual physical response to stress (heart rate, blood pressure, release of stress hormones) compared to people without anxiety.\nLacking a Social Network\nThe lack of an established network of family and friends predisposes one to stress disorders and stress-related health problems, including heart disease and infections. A study, meanwhile, reported that older people who maintain active relationships with their adult children are buffered against the adverse health effects of chronic stress-inducing situations, such as low income or lower social class. Another study suggested this may be because people who live alone are unable to discuss negative feelings as a means to relieve their stress.\nStudies of people who remain happy and healthy despite many life stresses conclude that most have very good networks of social support. One study indicated that support even from strangers reduced blood pressure surges in people undergoing a stressful event. Many studies suggest that having a pet helps reduce medical problems aggravated by stress, including heart disease and high blood pressure.\nBack to Top\nLifestyle Changes\nA healthy lifestyle is an essential companion to any stress-reduction program. General health and stress resistance can be enhanced by regular exercise, a diet rich in a variety of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, and by avoiding excessive alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco.\nExercise\nExercise in combination with stress management techniques is extremely important for many reasons:\nExercise is an effective distraction from stressful events.\nExercise may directly blunt the harmful effects of stress on blood pressure and the heart (exercise protects the heart in any case).\nUsually, a varied exercise regime is more interesting, and thus easier to stick to. Start slowly. Strenuous exercise in people who are not used to it can be very dangerous and any exercise program should be discussed with a physician. In addition, half of all people who begin a vigorous training regime drop out within a year. The key is to find activities that are exciting, challenging, and satisfying. The following are some suggestions:\nSign up for aerobics classes at a gym.\nBrisk walking is an excellent aerobic exercise that is free and available to nearly anyone. Even short brisk walks can relieve bouts of stress.\nSwimming is an ideal exercise for many stressed people, including pregnant women, individuals with musculoskeletal problems, and those who suffer exercise-induced asthma.\nYoga or Tai Chi can be very effective, combining many of the benefits of breathing, muscle relaxation, and meditation while toning and stretching the muscles. The benefits of yoga may be considerable. Numerous studies have found it beneficial for many conditions in which stress is an important factor, such as anxiety, headaches, high blood pressure, and asthma. It also elevates mood and improves concentration and the ability to focus.\nAs in other areas of stress management, making a plan and executing it successfully develops feelings of mastery and control, which are very beneficial in and of themselves. Start small. Just 10 minutes of exercise three times a week can build a good base for novices. Gradually build up the length of these every-other-day sessions to 30 minutes or more.\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is among the most effective ways of reducing stress, both when the source of stress is chronic pain or a chronic disease. In fact, in a study of patients with HIV, CBT was more helpful than support groups for improving well-being and quality-of-life.\nA typical CBT approach includes identifying sources of stress, restructuring priorities, changing one's response to stress, and finding methods for managing and reducing stress.\nIdentifying Sources of Stress. One key component in most CBT approaches is a diary that keeps an informal inventory of daily events and activities. While this exercise might itself seem stress producing (and yet one more chore), it need not be done in painstaking detail. A few words accompanying a time and date are usually enough to serve as reminders of significant events or activities.\nThe first step is to note activities that put a strain on energy and time, trigger anger or anxiety, or precipitate a negative physical response (such as a sour stomach or headache).\nAlso note positive experiences, such as those that are mentally or physically refreshing or produce a sense of accomplishment.\nAfter a week or two, try to identify two or three events or activities that have been significantly upsetting or overwhelming.\nQuestioning the Sources of Stress. Individuals should then ask themselves the following questions:\nDo these stressful activities meet my goals or someone else's?\nHave I taken on tasks that I can reasonably accomplish?\nWhich tasks are under my control and which ones aren't?\nRestructuring Priorities: Adding Stress Reducing Activities. The next step is to attempt to shift the balance from stress-producing to stress-reducing activities. Eliminating stress is rarely practical or feasible, but there are many ways to reduce its impact.\nConsider as many relief options as possible. Examples include:\nListen to music. Music is an effective stress reducer in both healthy individuals and people with health problems. In one study, for example, students who listened to a well-known gentle classical piece of music during a stressful task had reduced feelings of anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure.\nTake long weekends or, ideally, vacations.\nIf the source of stress is in the home, plan times away, even if it is only an hour or 2 a week.\nReplace unnecessary time-consuming chores with pleasurable or interesting activities.\nMake time for recreation. This is as essential as paying bills or shopping for groceries.\nOwn a pet. In a study of people with high blood pressure, pet owners had much lower blood pressure increase in response to stress than non-owners. Note that owning a pet was beneficial only for people who like animals to begin with.\nDiscuss Feelings. The concept of communication and letting your feelings out has been so excessively promoted and parodied that it has nearly lost its value as good psychological advice. Nevertheless, feelings of anger or frustration that are not expressed in an acceptable way may lead to hostility, a sense of helplessness, and depression.\nExpressing feelings does not mean venting frustration on waiters and subordinates, boring friends with emotional minutia, or wallowing in self-pity. In fact, because blood pressure may spike when certain chronically hostile individuals become angry, some therapists strongly advise that just talking, not simply venting anger, is the best approach, especially for these people.\nThe primary goal is to explain and assert one's needs to a trusted individual in as positive a way as possible. Direct communication may not even be necessary. Writing in a journal, writing a poem, or composing a letter that is never mailed may be sufficient.\nExpressing one's feelings solves only half of the communication puzzle. Learning to listen, empathize, and respond to others with understanding is just as important for maintaining the strong relationships necessary for emotional fulfillment and reduced stress.\nKeep Perspective and Look for the Positive. Reversing negative ideas and learning to focus on positive outcomes helps reduce tension and achieve goals. The following steps, using an example of a person who is alarmed at the prospect of giving a speech, may be useful:\nFirst, identify the worst possible outcomes (forgetting the speech, stumbling over words, humiliation, audience contempt).\nRate the likelihood of these bad outcomes happening (probably very low or that speaker wouldn't have been selected in the first place).\nEnvision a favorable result (a well-rounded, articulate presentation with rewarding applause).\nDevelop a specific plan to achieve the positive outcome (preparing in front of a mirror, using a video camera or tape recorder, relaxation exercises).\nTry to recall previous situations that initially seemed negative but ended well.\nUse Humor. Research has shown that humor is a very effective mechanism for coping with acute stress. Keeping a sense of humor during difficult situations is a common recommendation from stress management experts. Laughter not only releases the tension of pent-up feelings and helps keep perspective, but it appears to have actual physical effects that reduce stress hormone levels. It is not uncommon for people to recall laughing intensely even during tragic events, such as the death of a loved one, and to remember this laughter as helping them to endure the emotional pain.\nRelaxation and Other Alternative Techniques\nRelaxation Methods. Since stress is here to stay, everyone needs to develop methods to promote the relaxation response, the natural unwinding of the stress response. Relaxation lowers blood pressure, respiration, and pulse rates, releases muscle tension, and eases emotional strains. This response is highly individualized, but there are certain approaches that seem to work.\nCombinations are probably best. For example, in a study of children and adolescents with adjustment disorder and depression, a combination of yoga, a brief massage, and progressive muscle relaxation effectively reduced both feelings of anxiety and stress hormone levels. No one should expect a total resolution of stress from these approaches, but if done regularly, these programs can be very effective.\nNo one should expect a total resolution of stress from these approaches, but if done regularly, these programs can be very effective.\nAcupuncture. Some evidence suggests that acupuncture may also be helpful. It might even improve some physical factors associated with stress and health problems. For example, in a study of heart failure patients, acupuncture improved stress-related heart muscle activity, which could be an important benefit in these patients. However, acupuncture had no effect on stress-related blood pressure or heart rate.\nHypnosis. Hypnosis may also benefit some people with severe stress. In one study of patients with irritable bowel, stress reduction by hypnosis correlated with improvement in many bowel symptoms.\nRelaxation Methods\nSpecific Procedure\nDeep Breathing Exercises. During stress, breathing becomes shallow and rapid. Taking a deep breath is an automatic and effective technique for winding down. Deep breathing exercises consciously intensify this natural physiologic reaction and can be very useful during a stressful situation, or for maintaining a relaxed state during the day.\nInhale through the nose slowly and deeply to the count of 10.\nMake sure that the stomach and abdomen expand, but the chest does not rise.\nExhale through the nose, slowly and completely, also to the count of 10.\nTo help quiet the mind, concentrate fully on breathing and counting through each cycle.\nRepeat five to 10 times, and make a habit of doing the exercise several times each day, even when not feeling stressed.\nMuscle Relaxation. Muscle relaxation techniques, often combined with deep breathing, are simple to learn and very useful for getting to sleep. In the beginning it is useful to have a friend or partner check for tension by lifting an arm and dropping it. The arm should fall freely. Practice makes the exercise much more effective and produces relaxation much more rapidly. Small studies have reported beneficial effects on blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure who use this technique.\nAfter lying down in a comfortable position without crossing the limbs, concentrate on each part of the body.\nMaintain a slow, deep breathing pattern throughout this exercise.\nTense each muscle as tightly as possible for a count of five to 10, and then release it completely.\nExperience the muscle as totally relaxed and lead-heavy.\nBegin with the top of the head and progress downward to focus on all the muscles in the body.\nBe sure to include the forehead, ears, eyes, mouth, neck, shoulders, arms and hands, fingers, chest, belly, thighs, calves, and feet.\nOnce the external review is complete, imagine tensing and releasing internal muscles.\nMeditation. Meditation, used for many years in Eastern cultures, is now widely accepted in this country as a relaxation technique. The goal of all meditative procedures, both religious and therapeutic, is to quiet the mind (essentially, to relax thought). Small studies have suggested that regular meditation can benefit the heart and help reduce blood pressure. Better research is needed, however, to confirm such claims.\nSome recommend meditating for no longer than 20 minutes in the morning after awakening and then again in early evening before dinner. Even once a day is helpful. Note: Meditating before going to bed may cause some people to wake up in the middle of the night, alert and unable to return to sleep.\nNew practitioners should understand that it can be difficult to quiet the mind, and should not be discouraged by lack of immediate results.\nSeveral techniques are available. A few are discussed here.\nThe only potential risks from meditating are in people with psychosis, in whom meditating may trigger a psychotic event.\nMindfulness Meditation. Mindfulness is a common practice that focuses on breathing. It employs the basic technique used in other forms of meditation.\nSit upright with the spine straight, either cross-legged or sitting on a firm chair with both feet on the floor, uncrossed.\nWith the eyes closed or gently looking a few feet ahead, observe the exhalation of the breath.\nAs the mind wanders, simply note it as a fact and returns to the \"out\" breath. It may be helpful to imagine your thoughts as clouds dissipating away.\nTranscendental Meditation (TM). TM uses a mantra (a word that has a specific chanting sound but no meaning). The person meditating repeats the word silently, letting thoughts come and go. In one study, TM was as effective as exercise in elevating mood.\nMini-Meditation. The method involves heightening awareness of the immediate surrounding environment. Choose a routine activity when alone. For example:\nWhile washing dishes, concentrate on the feel of the water and dishes.\nAllow the mind to wander to any immediate sensory experience (sounds outside the window, smells from the stove, colors in the room).\nIf the mind begins to think about the past or future, or fills with unformed thoughts or worries, redirect it gently back.\nThis redirection of brain activity from your thoughts and worries to your senses disrupts the stress response and prompts relaxation. It also helps promote an emotional and sensual appreciation of simple pleasures already present in a person's life.\nBiofeedback. Biofeedback is a technique that measures bodily functions, like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, and muscle tension. By watching these measurements, you can learn how to alter these functions by relaxing or holding pleasant images in your mind.\nDuring biofeedback, electric leads are taped to a subject's head.\nThe person is encouraged to relax using methods such as those described above.\nBrain waves are measured and an audible signal is emitted when alpha waves are detected, a frequency which coincides with a state of deep relaxation.\nBy repeating the process, subjects associate the sound with the relaxed state and learn to achieve relaxation by themselves.\nMassage Therapy. A review of data from multiple studies showed that massage therapy decreases cortisol levels. Interestingly, massage was more beneficial than receiving social support from the partner, indicating the power of physical touch in managing stress.\nSeveral massage therapies are available.\nMany massage techniques are available, such as the following:\nSwedish massage is the standard massage technique. It uses long smooth strokes, and kneading and tapping of the muscles.\nShiatsu applies intense pressure to the same points targeted in acupuncture. It can be painful, but people report deep relaxation afterward.\nReflexology manipulates acupuncture points in the hands and feet.\nHerbal and Natural Remedies\nSome people who experience chronic stress seek herbal or natural remedies. It should be strongly noted, however, that just as with standard drugs, so-called natural remedies can cause problems, sometimes serious ones.\nAromatherapy. The smell of lavender has long been associated with a calming effect. In addition, several other aromatherapies are now used for relaxation. Use caution, however, as some of the exotic plant extracts in these formulas have been associated with a wide range of skin allergies.\nValerian. Valerian is an herb that has sedative qualities and may reduce stress and associated physical effects. This herb is on the FDA's list of generally safe products. Of note, however, the herb's effects could be dangerously increased if it is used with standard sedatives. Other interactions and long-term side effects are unknown. Side effects include vivid dreams. High doses of valerian can cause blurred vision, excitability, and changes in heart rhythm.\nGenerally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, however, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been numerous reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary supplements.\nSpecial Warning on Kava. Kava has been commonly used to reduce anxiety and stress. It is now highly associated with liver injury and even liver failure in a few cases. Experts now strongly warn against its use.\nPeople seeking relief from stress should be wary of things that promise a quick cure, or plans that include the purchase of expensive treatments. These treatments may be useless and sometimes even dangerous.\n"}, {"score": 483.97882, "uuid": "8acd9238-3931-5322-aab8-f27b4bdbbf40", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1015wb-15-11950", "target_hostname": "childrens.advil.com", "target_uri": "http://childrens.advil.com/infants-advil-drops", "page_rank": 1.6295291e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Infants' Advil&reg; Drops | Children's Advil&reg;", "snippet": "This product <em>is</em> intended for use <em>in</em> <em>children</em> ages 6 months - 23 months. * relieves minor aches and pains due to the common cold, flu, headaches and toothaches Allergy alert: <em>Ibuprofen</em> may cause a severe allergic reaction, especially <em>in</em> people allergic to <em>aspirin</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Infants' Advil\u00ae Drops\nUnsurpassed fever relief with a syringe for easy dosing.

Stress affects most people <em>in</em> some way.", "explanation": null, "document": "The physical symptoms of anxiety disorders mirror many symptoms of stress, including:\nA fast heart rate\nRapid, shallow breathing\nIncreased muscle tension\nAnxiety is an emotional disorder, however, and is characterized by feelings of apprehension, uncertainty, fear, or panic. Unlike stress, the triggers for anxiety are not necessarily or even usually associated with specific stressful or threatening conditions. Some individuals with anxiety disorders have numerous physical complaints, such as headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, and chest pain. Severe cases of anxiety disorders are debilitating, and interfere with career, family, and social spheres.\nDepression\nDepression can be a disabling condition, and, like anxiety disorders, may sometimes be linked to chronic stress. A study of Canadian workers found that individuals with a high level of work-related stress are more than twice as likely to experience a major depressive episode, compared with people under less stress. Evidence also suggests that certain people may be genetically susceptible to depression after stressful life events.\nDepression also mimics some of the symptoms of stress, including changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and concentration. Serious depression, however, is distinguished from stress by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in life, and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide. Acute depression is also accompanied by significant changes in the patient's functioning. Professional therapy may be needed in order to determine if depression is caused by stress, or if it is the primary problem.\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a reaction to a very traumatic event, and it is actually classified as an anxiety disorder. The event that brings on PTSD is usually outside the norm of human experience, such as intense combat or sexual assault. The patient struggles to forget the traumatic event and frequently develops emotional numbness and event-related amnesia. Often, however, there is a mental flashback, and the patient re-experiences the painful circumstance in the form of dreams and disturbing thoughts and memories. These thoughts and dreams resemble or recall the trauma. Other symptoms may include lack of pleasure in formerly enjoyed activities, hopelessness, irritability, mood swings, sleep problems, inability to concentrate, and an excessive startle-response to noise.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nPerhaps the best general approach for treating stress can be found in the elegant passage by Reinhold Niebuhr, \"Grant me the courage to change the things I can change, the serenity to accept the things I can't change, and the wisdom to know the difference.\" The process of learning to control stress is life-long, and will not only contribute to better health, but a greater ability to succeed in one's own agenda.\nWhen to Seek Professional Help for Stress\nStress can be a factor in a variety of physical and emotional illnesses, which should be professionally treated. Many stress symptoms are mild and can be managed by over-the-counter medications (for example, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen for tension headaches; antacids, anti-diarrhea medications, or laxatives for mild stomach distress). A physician should be consulted, however, for physical symptoms that are out of the ordinary, particularly those that get worse or wake a person up at night. A mental health professional should be consulted for unmanageable acute stress or for severe anxiety or depression. Often short-term therapy can resolve stress-related emotional problems.\nConsiderations for Choosing a Strategy for Reducing Stress\nIn choosing specific strategies for treating stress, several factors should be considered.\nNo single method is always successful: A combination of approaches is generally most effective.\nWhat works for one person does not necessarily work for someone else.\nStress can be positive as well as negative. Appropriate and controllable stress provides interest and excitement and motivates the individual to greater achievement. A lack of stress may lead to boredom and depression.\nStress may play a part in making people vulnerable to illness. A physician or psychologist should be consulted if there are any indications of accompanying medical or psychological conditions, such as heart symptoms, significant pain, anxiety, or depression.\nOvercoming Obstacles to Treatment\nPeople often succeed in relieving stress for the short term. However, they go back to previous ways of stressful thinking and behaving because of outside pressure, long-held beliefs, or habits. The following are some obstacles to managing stress:\nThe fight or flight urge: The very idea of relaxation can feel threatening, because it is perceived as letting down one's guard. For example, an over-demanding boss may put a subordinate into a psychological state of fighting-readiness, even though there is no safe opportunity for the subordinate to fight back or express anger. Stress builds up, but the worker has the illusion, even subconsciously, that the stress itself is providing safety or preparedness. For this reason, the employee does nothing to correct the condition.\nMany people are afraid of being perceived as selfish if they engage in stress-reducing activities that benefit only themselves. The truth is that self-sacrifice (in the form of not reducing one's stress) may be inappropriate and even damaging, if the person making the sacrifice is unhappy, angry, or physically unwell.\nSome people believe that certain emotional responses to stress, such as anger, are natural and unchangeable features of personality. Research has shown, however, that with cognitive behavioral therapy, individuals can be taught to change their emotional reactions to stressful events.\nIt is essential to remember that reducing stress and staying relaxed clears the mind, so it can begin appropriate actions to get rid of the stress-ridden conditions.\nStress Reduction and Effects on Health\nAlthough treating stress cannot cure medical problems, stress management can be a very important part of medical treatment. Specific stress reduction approaches may benefit different medical problems. For example, acupuncture in one study helped reduce harmful heart muscle actions in people with heart failure, but it had no effect on blood pressure. Relaxation methods, on the other hand, may help people with high blood pressure. Stress reduction may improve well-being and quality of life for many patients who are experiencing stress because of severe or chronic medical conditions.\nImportant Note: Never use stress reduction techniques as the only treatment, or in place of proven treatments, for any medical condition.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAt some point in their lives virtually everyone will experience stressful events or situations that overwhelm their natural coping mechanisms. In one poll, 89% of respondents indicated that they had experienced serious stress in their lives. Some people are simply biologically prone to stress. Many outside factors influence susceptibility as well.\nConditions Most Likely To Produce Stress-Related Health Problems. Conditions that are most likely to be associated with stress and negative physical effects include the following:\nAn accumulation of persistent stressful situations, particularly those that a person cannot easily control (for example, high-pressured work plus an unhappy relationship)\nPersistent stress following a severe acute response to a traumatic event (such as an automobile accident)\nAcute stress accompanying serious illness, such as heart disease\nFactors That Influence the Response to Stress. People respond to stress differently, depending on different factors:\nEarly nurturing: Abusive behavior towards children may cause long-term abnormalities in the hypothalamus-pituitary system, which regulates stress.\nPersonality traits: Certain people have personality traits that cause them to over-respond to stressful events.\nGenetic factors: Some people have genetic factors that affect stress, such as having a more or less efficient relaxation response. One study found a genetic abnormality in serotonin regulation that was connected with a heightened reaction of heart rates and blood pressure in response to stress. (Serotonin is a brain chemical involved with feelings of well-being.)\nImmune regulated diseases: Certain diseases that are associated with immune abnormalities (such as rheumatoid arthritis or eczema) may actually weaken a response to stress.\nThe length and quality of stressors: Naturally, the longer the duration and more intense the stressors, the more harmful the effects.\nIndividuals at Higher Risk for Stress. Studies indicate that the following people are more vulnerable to the effects of stress than others:\nOlder adults: As people age, achieving a relaxation response after a stressful event becomes more difficult. Aging may simply wear out the systems in the brain that respond to stress, so that they become inefficient. The elderly, too, are very often exposed to major stressors such as medical problems, the loss of a spouse and friends, a change in a living situation, and financial worries. No one is immune to stress, however, and it may simply go unnoticed in the very young and old.\nWomen in general and working mothers specifically: Working mothers, regardless of whether they are married or single, face higher stress levels and possibly adverse health effects, most likely because they bear a greater and more diffuse work load than men or other women. This has been observed in women in the U.S. and in Europe. Such stress may also have a domino and harmful effect on their children. It is not clear, however, if stress has the same adverse effects on women's hearts as it does on men's.\nLess educated individuals.\nDivorced or widowed individuals: Numerous studies indicate that unmarried people generally do not live as long as their married contemporaries.\nAnyone experiencing financial strain, particularly long-term unemployed and those without health insurance.\nPeople who are isolated or lonely.\nPeople who are targets of racial or sexual discrimination.\nPeople who live in cities.\nChildhood Factors\nChildren are frequent victims of stress because they are often unable to communicate their feelings accurately. They also have trouble communicating their responses to events over which they have no control. Certain physical symptoms, notably repeated abdominal pain without a known cause, may be indicators of stress in children.\nVarious conditions can affect their susceptibility to stress.\nParental Stress. Parental stress, especially in mothers, is a particularly powerful source of stress in children, even more important than poverty or overcrowding. Young children of mothers who are highly stressed (particularly if they were depressed) tend to be at high risk for developing stress-related problems. This may be especially true if the mothers were stressed during both the child's infancy and early years. Some evidence even supports the old idea that stress during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the infant's mood and behavior. Older children with stressed mothers may become aggressive and anti-social. Another study suggested that stress-reduction techniques in parents may improve their children's behavior.\nGender Differences in Adolescent Stress. Adolescent boys and girls experience equal amounts of stress, but the source and effects may differ. Girls tend to become stressed from interpersonal situations, and stress is more likely to lead to depression in girls than in boys. For boys, however, specific events, such as changing schools or getting poor grades, appear to be the major sources of stress.\nA report issued in October 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends more unstructured play time for children. The report notes that today?\u00a2\u00e2'\u00ac\u00e2'\u00a2s overscheduled, hurried lifestyle that many children experience is a source of stress and anxiety in some children.\nWork and Stress\nIn a study of 46,000 workers, health care costs were 147% higher in workers who were stressed or depressed than in others who were not. Furthermore, according to one survey, 40% of American workers describe their jobs as very stressful, making job-related stress an important and preventable health hazard.\nSeveral studies are now suggesting that job-related stress is as great a threat to health as smoking or not exercising. Stress impairs concentration, causes sleeplessness, and increases the risk for illness, back problems, accidents, and lost time from work. Work stress can lead to harassment or even violence while on the job. At its most extreme, chronic stress places a burden on the heart and circulation that in some cases may be fatal. The Japanese even have a word for sudden death due to overwork, karoushi.\nNot all work stress is harmful. However, studies suggest the following job-related stressors may increase people's -- particularly men's -- health risks:\nHaving no say in decisions that affect one's responsibilities\nUnrelenting and unreasonable performance demands\nLack of effective communication and conflict-resolution methods among workers and employers\nLack of job security\nNight-shift work, long hours, or both\nToo much time spent away from home and family\nWages not matching levels of responsibility\nReducing Stress on the Job. Many institutions within the current culture, while paying lip service to stress reduction, put intense pressure on individuals to behave in ways that increase tension. Yet, there are numerous effective management tools and techniques available to reduce stress. Furthermore, treatment for work-related stress has proven benefits for both the employee and employer. In one study, at the end of 2 years, a company that instituted a stress management program saved nearly $150,000 in workers compensations costs (the cost of the program was only $6,000). Other studies have reported specific health benefits resulting from workplace stress-management programs. In one of the studies, workers with hypertension experienced reduced blood pressure after even a brief (16-hour) program that helped them manage stress behaviorally.\nIn general, however, few workplaces offer stress management programs, and it is usually up to the employee to find their own ways to reduce stress. Here are some suggestions:\nSeek out someone in the Human Resources department or a sympathetic manager and communicate concerns about job stress. Work with them in a non-confrontational way to improve working conditions, letting them know that productivity can be improved if some of the pressure is off.\nEstablish or reinforce a network of friends at work and at home.\nRestructure priorities and eliminate unnecessary tasks.\nLearn to focus on positive outcomes.\nIf the job is unendurable, plan and execute a career change. Send out resumes or work on transfers within the company.\nIf this isn't possible, be sure to schedule daily pleasant activities and physical exercise during free time.\nIt may be helpful to keep in mind that bosses are also victimized by the same stressful conditions they are imposing. For example, in one study of male managers in three Swedish companies, those who worked in a bureaucracy had greater stress-related heart risks than those who worked in companies with social supports.\nCaregiving\nCaregivers of Family Members. Studies show that caregivers of physically or mentally disabled family members are at risk for chronic stress. One study reported that overall mortality rates were over 60% higher in caregivers who were under constant stress. Spouses caring for a disabled partner are particularly vulnerable to a range of stress-related health threats, including influenza, depression, heart disease, and even poorer survival rates. Caring for a spouse with even minor disabilities can induce severe stress.\nSpecific risk factors that put caregivers at higher risk for severe stress, or stress-related illnesses, include:\nCaregiving wives: Some studies suggest that wives experience significantly greater stress from caregiving than husbands do.\nHaving a low income.\nBeing African-American: African-Americans tend to be in poorer physical health, and have lower incomes, than Caucasians. They therefore face greater stress as caregivers to their spouses than their white counterparts.\nLiving alone with the patient.\nHelping a highly dependent patient.\nHaving a difficult relationship with the patient.\nIntervention programs that are aimed at helping the caregiver approach the situation positively can reduce stress, and help the caregiver maintain a positive attitude. A 2002 program also demonstrated that moderate-intensity exercise was very helpful in reducing stress and improving sleep in caregivers.\nHealth Professional Caregivers. Caregiving among the health professionals is also a high risk factor for stress. One study, for example, found that registered nurses with low job control, high job demands, and low work-related social support experienced very dramatic health declines, both physically and emotionally.\nAnxiety Disorders\nPeople who are less emotionally stable or have high anxiety levels tend to experience specific events as more stressful than others. Some doctors describe an exaggerated negative response to stress as \"catastrophizing\" the event (turning it into a catastrophe). Nevertheless, a 2003 study of patients with anxiety disorder did not find any differences in actual physical response to stress (heart rate, blood pressure, release of stress hormones) compared to people without anxiety.\nLacking a Social Network\nThe lack of an established network of family and friends predisposes one to stress disorders and stress-related health problems, including heart disease and infections. A study, meanwhile, reported that older people who maintain active relationships with their adult children are buffered against the adverse health effects of chronic stress-inducing situations, such as low income or lower social class. Another study suggested this may be because people who live alone are unable to discuss negative feelings as a means to relieve their stress.\nStudies of people who remain happy and healthy despite many life stresses conclude that most have very good networks of social support. One study indicated that support even from strangers reduced blood pressure surges in people undergoing a stressful event. Many studies suggest that having a pet helps reduce medical problems aggravated by stress, including heart disease and high blood pressure.\nBack to Top\nLifestyle Changes\nA healthy lifestyle is an essential companion to any stress-reduction program. General health and stress resistance can be enhanced by regular exercise, a diet rich in a variety of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, and by avoiding excessive alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco.\nExercise\nExercise in combination with stress management techniques is extremely important for many reasons:\nExercise is an effective distraction from stressful events.\nExercise may directly blunt the harmful effects of stress on blood pressure and the heart (exercise protects the heart in any case).\nUsually, a varied exercise regime is more interesting, and thus easier to stick to. Start slowly. Strenuous exercise in people who are not used to it can be very dangerous and any exercise program should be discussed with a physician. In addition, half of all people who begin a vigorous training regime drop out within a year. The key is to find activities that are exciting, challenging, and satisfying. The following are some suggestions:\nSign up for aerobics classes at a gym.\nBrisk walking is an excellent aerobic exercise that is free and available to nearly anyone. Even short brisk walks can relieve bouts of stress.\nSwimming is an ideal exercise for many stressed people, including pregnant women, individuals with musculoskeletal problems, and those who suffer exercise-induced asthma.\nYoga or Tai Chi can be very effective, combining many of the benefits of breathing, muscle relaxation, and meditation while toning and stretching the muscles. The benefits of yoga may be considerable. Numerous studies have found it beneficial for many conditions in which stress is an important factor, such as anxiety, headaches, high blood pressure, and asthma. It also elevates mood and improves concentration and the ability to focus.\nAs in other areas of stress management, making a plan and executing it successfully develops feelings of mastery and control, which are very beneficial in and of themselves. Start small. Just 10 minutes of exercise three times a week can build a good base for novices. Gradually build up the length of these every-other-day sessions to 30 minutes or more.\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is among the most effective ways of reducing stress, both when the source of stress is chronic pain or a chronic disease. In fact, in a study of patients with HIV, CBT was more helpful than support groups for improving well-being and quality-of-life.\nA typical CBT approach includes identifying sources of stress, restructuring priorities, changing one's response to stress, and finding methods for managing and reducing stress.\nIdentifying Sources of Stress. One key component in most CBT approaches is a diary that keeps an informal inventory of daily events and activities. While this exercise might itself seem stress producing (and yet one more chore), it need not be done in painstaking detail. A few words accompanying a time and date are usually enough to serve as reminders of significant events or activities.\nThe first step is to note activities that put a strain on energy and time, trigger anger or anxiety, or precipitate a negative physical response (such as a sour stomach or headache).\nAlso note positive experiences, such as those that are mentally or physically refreshing or produce a sense of accomplishment.\nAfter a week or two, try to identify two or three events or activities that have been significantly upsetting or overwhelming.\nQuestioning the Sources of Stress. Individuals should then ask themselves the following questions:\nDo these stressful activities meet my goals or someone else's?\nHave I taken on tasks that I can reasonably accomplish?\nWhich tasks are under my control and which ones aren't?\nRestructuring Priorities: Adding Stress Reducing Activities. The next step is to attempt to shift the balance from stress-producing to stress-reducing activities. Eliminating stress is rarely practical or feasible, but there are many ways to reduce its impact.\nConsider as many relief options as possible. Examples include:\nListen to music. Music is an effective stress reducer in both healthy individuals and people with health problems. In one study, for example, students who listened to a well-known gentle classical piece of music during a stressful task had reduced feelings of anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure.\nTake long weekends or, ideally, vacations.\nIf the source of stress is in the home, plan times away, even if it is only an hour or 2 a week.\nReplace unnecessary time-consuming chores with pleasurable or interesting activities.\nMake time for recreation. This is as essential as paying bills or shopping for groceries.\nOwn a pet. In a study of people with high blood pressure, pet owners had much lower blood pressure increase in response to stress than non-owners. Note that owning a pet was beneficial only for people who like animals to begin with.\nDiscuss Feelings. The concept of communication and letting your feelings out has been so excessively promoted and parodied that it has nearly lost its value as good psychological advice. Nevertheless, feelings of anger or frustration that are not expressed in an acceptable way may lead to hostility, a sense of helplessness, and depression.\nExpressing feelings does not mean venting frustration on waiters and subordinates, boring friends with emotional minutia, or wallowing in self-pity. In fact, because blood pressure may spike when certain chronically hostile individuals become angry, some therapists strongly advise that just talking, not simply venting anger, is the best approach, especially for these people.\nThe primary goal is to explain and assert one's needs to a trusted individual in as positive a way as possible. Direct communication may not even be necessary. Writing in a journal, writing a poem, or composing a letter that is never mailed may be sufficient.\nExpressing one's feelings solves only half of the communication puzzle. Learning to listen, empathize, and respond to others with understanding is just as important for maintaining the strong relationships necessary for emotional fulfillment and reduced stress.\nKeep Perspective and Look for the Positive. Reversing negative ideas and learning to focus on positive outcomes helps reduce tension and achieve goals. The following steps, using an example of a person who is alarmed at the prospect of giving a speech, may be useful:\nFirst, identify the worst possible outcomes (forgetting the speech, stumbling over words, humiliation, audience contempt).\nRate the likelihood of these bad outcomes happening (probably very low or that speaker wouldn't have been selected in the first place).\nEnvision a favorable result (a well-rounded, articulate presentation with rewarding applause).\nDevelop a specific plan to achieve the positive outcome (preparing in front of a mirror, using a video camera or tape recorder, relaxation exercises).\nTry to recall previous situations that initially seemed negative but ended well.\nUse Humor. Research has shown that humor is a very effective mechanism for coping with acute stress. Keeping a sense of humor during difficult situations is a common recommendation from stress management experts. Laughter not only releases the tension of pent-up feelings and helps keep perspective, but it appears to have actual physical effects that reduce stress hormone levels. It is not uncommon for people to recall laughing intensely even during tragic events, such as the death of a loved one, and to remember this laughter as helping them to endure the emotional pain.\nRelaxation and Other Alternative Techniques\nRelaxation Methods. Since stress is here to stay, everyone needs to develop methods to promote the relaxation response, the natural unwinding of the stress response. Relaxation lowers blood pressure, respiration, and pulse rates, releases muscle tension, and eases emotional strains. This response is highly individualized, but there are certain approaches that seem to work.\nCombinations are probably best. For example, in a study of children and adolescents with adjustment disorder and depression, a combination of yoga, a brief massage, and progressive muscle relaxation effectively reduced both feelings of anxiety and stress hormone levels. No one should expect a total resolution of stress from these approaches, but if done regularly, these programs can be very effective.\nNo one should expect a total resolution of stress from these approaches, but if done regularly, these programs can be very effective.\nAcupuncture. Some evidence suggests that acupuncture may also be helpful. It might even improve some physical factors associated with stress and health problems. For example, in a study of heart failure patients, acupuncture improved stress-related heart muscle activity, which could be an important benefit in these patients. However, acupuncture had no effect on stress-related blood pressure or heart rate.\nHypnosis. Hypnosis may also benefit some people with severe stress. In one study of patients with irritable bowel, stress reduction by hypnosis correlated with improvement in many bowel symptoms.\nRelaxation Methods\nSpecific Procedure\nDeep Breathing Exercises. During stress, breathing becomes shallow and rapid. Taking a deep breath is an automatic and effective technique for winding down. Deep breathing exercises consciously intensify this natural physiologic reaction and can be very useful during a stressful situation, or for maintaining a relaxed state during the day.\nInhale through the nose slowly and deeply to the count of 10.\nMake sure that the stomach and abdomen expand, but the chest does not rise.\nExhale through the nose, slowly and completely, also to the count of 10.\nTo help quiet the mind, concentrate fully on breathing and counting through each cycle.\nRepeat five to 10 times, and make a habit of doing the exercise several times each day, even when not feeling stressed.\nMuscle Relaxation. Muscle relaxation techniques, often combined with deep breathing, are simple to learn and very useful for getting to sleep. In the beginning it is useful to have a friend or partner check for tension by lifting an arm and dropping it. The arm should fall freely. Practice makes the exercise much more effective and produces relaxation much more rapidly. Small studies have reported beneficial effects on blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure who use this technique.\nAfter lying down in a comfortable position without crossing the limbs, concentrate on each part of the body.\nMaintain a slow, deep breathing pattern throughout this exercise.\nTense each muscle as tightly as possible for a count of five to 10, and then release it completely.\nExperience the muscle as totally relaxed and lead-heavy.\nBegin with the top of the head and progress downward to focus on all the muscles in the body.\nBe sure to include the forehead, ears, eyes, mouth, neck, shoulders, arms and hands, fingers, chest, belly, thighs, calves, and feet.\nOnce the external review is complete, imagine tensing and releasing internal muscles.\nMeditation. Meditation, used for many years in Eastern cultures, is now widely accepted in this country as a relaxation technique. The goal of all meditative procedures, both religious and therapeutic, is to quiet the mind (essentially, to relax thought). Small studies have suggested that regular meditation can benefit the heart and help reduce blood pressure. Better research is needed, however, to confirm such claims.\nSome recommend meditating for no longer than 20 minutes in the morning after awakening and then again in early evening before dinner. Even once a day is helpful. Note: Meditating before going to bed may cause some people to wake up in the middle of the night, alert and unable to return to sleep.\nNew practitioners should understand that it can be difficult to quiet the mind, and should not be discouraged by lack of immediate results.\nSeveral techniques are available. A few are discussed here.\nThe only potential risks from meditating are in people with psychosis, in whom meditating may trigger a psychotic event.\nMindfulness Meditation. Mindfulness is a common practice that focuses on breathing. It employs the basic technique used in other forms of meditation.\nSit upright with the spine straight, either cross-legged or sitting on a firm chair with both feet on the floor, uncrossed.\nWith the eyes closed or gently looking a few feet ahead, observe the exhalation of the breath.\nAs the mind wanders, simply note it as a fact and returns to the \"out\" breath. It may be helpful to imagine your thoughts as clouds dissipating away.\nTranscendental Meditation (TM). TM uses a mantra (a word that has a specific chanting sound but no meaning). The person meditating repeats the word silently, letting thoughts come and go. In one study, TM was as effective as exercise in elevating mood.\nMini-Meditation. The method involves heightening awareness of the immediate surrounding environment. Choose a routine activity when alone. For example:\nWhile washing dishes, concentrate on the feel of the water and dishes.\nAllow the mind to wander to any immediate sensory experience (sounds outside the window, smells from the stove, colors in the room).\nIf the mind begins to think about the past or future, or fills with unformed thoughts or worries, redirect it gently back.\nThis redirection of brain activity from your thoughts and worries to your senses disrupts the stress response and prompts relaxation. It also helps promote an emotional and sensual appreciation of simple pleasures already present in a person's life.\nBiofeedback. Biofeedback is a technique that measures bodily functions, like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, and muscle tension. By watching these measurements, you can learn how to alter these functions by relaxing or holding pleasant images in your mind.\nDuring biofeedback, electric leads are taped to a subject's head.\nThe person is encouraged to relax using methods such as those described above.\nBrain waves are measured and an audible signal is emitted when alpha waves are detected, a frequency which coincides with a state of deep relaxation.\nBy repeating the process, subjects associate the sound with the relaxed state and learn to achieve relaxation by themselves.\nMassage Therapy. A review of data from multiple studies showed that massage therapy decreases cortisol levels. Interestingly, massage was more beneficial than receiving social support from the partner, indicating the power of physical touch in managing stress.\nSeveral massage therapies are available.\nMany massage techniques are available, such as the following:\nSwedish massage is the standard massage technique. It uses long smooth strokes, and kneading and tapping of the muscles.\nShiatsu applies intense pressure to the same points targeted in acupuncture. It can be painful, but people report deep relaxation afterward.\nReflexology manipulates acupuncture points in the hands and feet.\nHerbal and Natural Remedies\nSome people who experience chronic stress seek herbal or natural remedies. It should be strongly noted, however, that just as with standard drugs, so-called natural remedies can cause problems, sometimes serious ones.\nAromatherapy. The smell of lavender has long been associated with a calming effect. In addition, several other aromatherapies are now used for relaxation. Use caution, however, as some of the exotic plant extracts in these formulas have been associated with a wide range of skin allergies.\nValerian. Valerian is an herb that has sedative qualities and may reduce stress and associated physical effects. This herb is on the FDA's list of generally safe products. Of note, however, the herb's effects could be dangerously increased if it is used with standard sedatives. Other interactions and long-term side effects are unknown. Side effects include vivid dreams. High doses of valerian can cause blurred vision, excitability, and changes in heart rhythm.\nGenerally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need FDA approval to sell their products. Just like a drug, however, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful. There have been numerous reported cases of serious and even lethal side effects from herbal products. Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary supplements.\nSpecial Warning on Kava. Kava has been commonly used to reduce anxiety and stress. It is now highly associated with liver injury and even liver failure in a few cases. Experts now strongly warn against its use.\nPeople seeking relief from stress should be wary of things that promise a quick cure, or plans that include the purchase of expensive treatments. These treatments may be useless and sometimes even dangerous.\n"}, {"score": 471.00388, "uuid": "abb7878b-82b1-5eea-a80c-fc04198f8177", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-59-15083", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Headaches+-+tension", "page_rank": 1.1713311e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Headaches - tension Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "The brain itself <em>is</em> insensitive to pain, so that <em>is</em> not <em>what</em> hurts when a headache arises.", "explanation": null, "document": "Highlights\nWhat Are Tension-Type Headaches?\nTension-type headaches are the most common type of headache, accounting for about half of all headaches. The pain is usually mild-to-moderate in intensity, with a steady pressing or tightening quality (like a vise being squeezed around the head). The headache is not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, and the pain is not increased by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. A tension-type headache attack can last anywhere from 30 minutes to an entire week.\nWho Gets Tension-Type Headaches?\nWomen are more likely to get tension-type headaches than men. Nearly everyone will have at least one tension-type headache at some point in their lives. Many people who have migraine headaches also have tension-type headaches.\nWhat Is The Difference Between Tension-Type Headaches and Migraine Headaches?\nMigraines and tension headaches have some similar characteristics, but also some important differences:\nMigraine pain is usually throbbing and while tension-type headache pain is usually a steady ache\nMigraine pain may affect only one side of the head while tension-type headache pain typically affects both sides of the head\nMigraine pain, but not tension-type pain, worsens with head movement\nMigraine headaches, but not tension-type headaches, may be accompanied by nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to both light and sound, or aura\nTreatment\nTreatment of tension-type headache focuses on relieving pain when attacks occur, and preventing recurrence of attacks. Most tension-type headache attacks respond to simple over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve).\nPatients who have two or more tension-type headache attacks each month should talk to their doctors about preventive therapy. This may include a tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), combined with behavioral therapies. Behavioral treatment approaches include relaxation therapy, biofeedback, stress management, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\nBack to Top\nIntroduction\nMost people are familiar with headaches, the all too common affliction marked by throbbing, piercing, or vise-like pain around much or a part of the head. There are many different kinds of headaches, and they range from being an infrequent annoyance to a persistent, severe, and disabling medical condition.\nThe brain itself is insensitive to pain, so that is not what hurts when a headache arises. The pain, instead, occurs in the following locations:\nThe tissues covering the brain\nThe attaching structures at the base of the brain\nMuscles and blood vessels around the scalp, face, and neck\nDoctors categorize headaches as either primary or secondary, which helps to distinguish the many different kinds of headaches and to determine appropriate treatments for each.\nPrimary Headaches. A headache is considered primary when a disease or other medical condition does not cause it. Most primary headaches fall into three main types: Tension-type, migraine, and cluster headaches.\nTension headache is the most common primary headache.\nNeurovascular headaches are the second most frequently occurring primary headaches and include migraines (the more common) and cluster headaches. Such headaches are caused by an interaction between blood vessel and nerve abnormalities. [See In-Depth Report #97: Migraine headaches and In-DepthReport #99: Cluster headaches .]\nSymptoms of migraine and tension-type headaches often overlap, and a diagnosis is sometimes difficult.\nSecondary Headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other medical conditions, such as sinus infections, neck injuries, and strokes. About 2% of headaches are secondary to abnormalities or infections in the nasal or sinus passages, and they are commonly referred to as sinus headaches.\nChronic Daily Headaches. The International Headache Society's classification system includes a category called chronic daily headaches. They may originate as tension headaches, migraines, or a combination of these or other headache types. Chronic daily headaches affect 4 - 5% of the population.\nClick the icon to see an image of the different types of headache.\nChronic daily headaches are defined as any benign headache that occurs at least 15 days a month and is not associated with a serious neurologic abnormality. Most people with these headaches have them daily, or almost daily, and they can be quite debilitating.\nChronic daily headaches are, in turn, subdivided into two categories:\nShort-duration headaches last fewer than 4 hours. The most common short-acting chronic headaches are cluster headaches.\nLong-duration headaches last more than 4 hours. Tension-type headaches are the most common type of long-duration chronic (recurring) headaches and, in fact, the most common type of chronic headaches in general.\nTension-Type Headaches\nGeneral Description. Tension-type headaches, also called muscle contraction headaches or simply tension headaches, are the most common of all headaches. Tension-type headaches tend to have the following characteristics:\nThe pain is commonly described as a tight feeling, as if the head were in a vise. It usually occurs on both sides of the head and is often experienced in the forehead, in the back of the head and neck, or in both regions. Soreness in the shoulders or neck is common.\nThe pain is of mild-to-moderate intensity and is steady, not throbbing or pulsating\nThe headache is not accompanied by nausea or vomiting\nThe pain is not worsened by routine physical activity (climbing stairs, walking)\nSome patients may have either sensitivity to light or sensitivity to noise, but not both\nTypes of Tension Headache. In 2004, the International Headache Society updated its original 1988 classification criteria. Tension-type headaches are now divided into the following four classifications:\nFrequent episodic tension-type headache. Headaches occur at least once but not more than 15 days per month for at least 3 months (a minimum of 12 days but not more than 180 days per year). Headaches last from at least 30 minutes to 7 days.\nInfrequent episodic tension-type headache. At least 10 episodes of headache that occur less than 1 day per month (12 days per year). Because these headaches occur infrequently, they do not impact a patient's quality of life as severely as frequent episodic headaches and may not require attention from a medical professional.\nChronic tension-type headache. Headaches occur at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months (180 days per year). The headache persists for hours at a time and may be continuous.\nProbable tension-type headache. Probable tension headaches may be classified as probable frequent episodic, probable infrequent episodic, or probable chronic. They have most, but not all, of the symptoms of tension-type headaches and are not attributed to migraine without aura or other neurological disorders. Probable chronic tension-type headache may be related to medication overuse.\nBack to Top\nCauses\nThe causes of tension-type headache are still uncertain. Although tension-type headaches were once thought to be primarily due to muscle contractions, this theory has largely been discounted. Instead, researchers think that tension-type headaches occur due to an interaction of different factors that involve pain sensitivity and perception, as well as the role of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters). Genetic factors are likely be involved in chronic tension-type headache, whereas environmental factors (physical and psychological stress) may play a role in the physiologic processes involved with episodic tension-type headache.\nPain Sensitivity and Perception\nResearch indicates that patients with tension-type headache may have abnormalities in the central nervous system, (which includes the nerves in the brain and spine), that increase their sensitivity to pain.\nTension-type headaches may also be linked to myofascial trigger points in the neck and shoulder muscles. Myofascial pain involves the fascia (connective tissue) and muscles. Trigger points are knots in the muscle tissue that can cause tightness, weakness, and intense pain in various areas of the body. (For example, a trigger point in the shoulder may result in headache.) Because fibromyalgia is also characterized by myofascial pain, researchers are exploring whether there may be an association between this condition and tension-type headache. [See In-Depth Report #76: Fibromyalgia .]\nBrain Chemicals (Neurotransmitters)\nNeurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the brain. Several types of neurotransmitters have been identified as playing a role in increasing activity in pain pathways in the brain and affecting how the brain reacts to pain stimulation. In particular, serotonin (also called 5-HT) and nitric oxide are thought to be involved in these chemical changes. Release of these chemicals may activate nerve pathways in the brain, muscles, or elsewhere and increase pain.\nTriggers for Tension-Type Headache\nIn addition to stress, many different factors can trigger or aggravate tension-type headaches:\nMedication and Substance Overuse. About a third of persistent headaches -- whether chronic migraine or tension-type -- are medication-overuse headaches. These are the result of a rebound effect caused by the regular overuse of headache medications. Nearly any headache medication can produce this effect. Headaches can also occur after withdrawing from caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.\nPoor Posture and Work Conditions. Working or sleeping in an awkward position can contribute to posture problems (especially those that affect muscles in neck and shoulders) that trigger headaches. Eyestrain caused by overwork can also play a role.\nFatigue. Lack of sleep and tiredness from overwork are also headache triggers.\nFoods and Beverages. Rapid consumption of ice cream or other very cold foods or beverages is the most common trigger of sudden headache pain, which may be prevented by warming the food or drink for a few seconds in the front of the mouth before swallowing. Not eating on time is also a trigger for headache.\nPhysical Activity. Intense physical exertion (including athletics or sexual activity) as well as lack of physical activity can trigger headaches. However, tension-type headache pain is not worsened by routine physical activity.\nDental Problems. Jaw clenching or teeth grinding, especially during sleep, are signs of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ, also known as TMD). TMJ pain can occur in the ear, cheek, temples, neck, or shoulders. This condition often coexists with chronic tension headache. Some patients with TMJ may see improvement in tension-type headaches from procedures or exercises therapies that specifically address the dental condition.\nClick the icon to see an image of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.\nPhysical Trauma. Whiplash or head or neck injury can lead to headaches.\nHormonal Changes. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or perimenopause, can affect headache occurrence.\nCauses of Secondary Headaches\nAbout 90% of people seeking help for headaches have a primary headache. The rest are secondary headaches, caused by an underlying disorder that produces headache as a symptom. More than 300 conditions can cause headaches. These can range from sinus conditions to brain tumor. While fear of brain tumor is common among people with headaches, headache is almost never the first or only sign of a tumor. Changes in personality and mental functioning, vomiting, seizures, and other symptoms are more likely to appear first.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nTension-type headaches are the most common headaches, accounting for nearly half of all headaches. According to one study, nearly 40% of Americans have at least one episode of tension headache during the course of a year. Tension-type headaches are more common among women than men. Some reports estimate that over 85% of women and about 63% of men will have a tension-type headache at some point during a year. Nearly everyone has at least one tension-type headache during their lifetime.\nEpisodic tension-type headaches are more common than chronic tension-type headaches. Surveys indicate that about 3% of the general population has chronic tension-type headache.\nTension-type headaches are most likely to occur among people in their 40s. The prevalence of tension-type headaches declines as people become older.\nHeadaches in Children\nHeadaches are rare before age 4 but increase in prevalence throughout childhood, reaching a peak around age 13. In one large study, about 7% of 7-year olds and 15% of 11-year olds had headaches. Ten percent of these childhood headaches were recurrent. In many of these patients, chronic headaches persist into adulthood. In addition, as adults these patients have a tendency to develop multiple physical or psychiatric complaints, such as back pain, muscle aches, digestive complaints, and depression.\nStudies have found that only a minority of chronic childhood headaches are due to physical conditions, such as head injuries or medical problems. Many children with tension-type headache episodes also suffer from some form of emotional disorder.\nPsychosocial factors associated with childhood tension-type headaches include:\nSleep problems. Many children who experience chronic daily headaches suffer from sleep disturbances, especially difficulty falling asleep.\nModerate or severe depression.\nEmotional rigidity in a child and more repressed anger than their peers.\nFamily stress. This includes maternal illness or separation, family bereavement, relationship problems, mental illness in a family member, and other stressful family events.\nProblems at school. According to a National Headache Foundation survey, nearly 30% of children miss school because of headaches. For many children, the start of the school season can be a particularly stressful time.\nThe National Headache Foundation recommends these tips for parents:\nKeep a diary of child's headaches noting time of onset, length and intensity of attack, location of pain, and food triggers.\nMake sure child gets plenty of sleep at regular times.\nAvoid changes in child's eating routing (hunger and eating at irregular times can trigger headaches).\nDiscuss any headache concerns with child's doctor.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nManagement of tension-type headaches focuses in the short term on treating acute attacks, and in the long term on preventing recurrent episodes of headache. In general, short-term treatment of tension-type headache involves drugs (mainly pain relievers) while long-term preventive measures include both drug and non-drug approaches. With medications, relaxation training, lifestyle changes, and other therapies, nearly all patients can be helped.\nTreatment for Acute Attacks of Tension-Type Headaches\nFortunately, most acute tension-type headaches get better without any treatment, and simple over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can treat mild symptoms. Aspirin or ibuprofen (Motrin) are usually the first choices, followed by naproxen (Aleve). Some patients may also find helpful medications that combine a pain reliever with caffeine.\nMassage therapy may also be useful for treating acute episodes of tension-type headache.\nTreatment and Prevention of Frequent and Chronic Tension-Type Headaches\nDaily preventive treatment is recommended for patients who experience at least two headache attacks a month. Preventive treatments do not work as well when patients are overusing pain-relief medication, so doctors may recommend stopping and withdrawing from analgesics before beginning preventive approaches.\nThe goals of preventive treatment are to reduce the frequency and severity of headache attacks, and to improve the response to pain medication.\nPreventive treatment for tension-type headache includes:\nDrug treatment with an antidepressant, usually the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline\nRelaxation training and biofeedback\nStress management through cognitive-behavioral therapy\nStudies indicate that best results are achieved when drug treatment is combined with relaxation or stress-management training.\nWithdrawing from Medications After Medication-Overuse Headaches\nIf headaches develop because of medication overuse, the patient cannot recover without stopping the drugs. (If caffeine is the culprit, a person may only need to reduce coffee or tea drinking to a reasonable level, not necessarily stop drinking it altogether.) The patient usually has the option of stopping abruptly or gradually and should expect the following course:\nMost headache drugs can be stopped abruptly, but the patient should be sure to check with the doctor before withdrawal. Certain non-headache medications, such as anti-anxiety drugs or beta-blockers, require gradual withdrawal under medical supervision.\nIf the patient chooses to taper off standard headache medications, withdrawal should be completed within 3 days or less. Otherwise the patient may become discouraged.\nNo matter which approach is used for stopping medication, the patient must expect a period of worsening headache for a few days afterward. Alternative pain relievers may be administered during the first days to help withdrawal.\nMost people feel better within 2 weeks, although headache symptoms can persist up to 16 weeks (and in rare cases even longer).\nBack to Top\nMedications\nThe standard treatments for tension-type headaches are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen, and tricyclic antidepressants, usually amitriptyline (Elavil).\nDue to the risks of overuse and dependence, opoids, opoid-like drugs, and sedative hypnotics are not recommended for treatment of tension-type headaches.\nPain Relievers\nSeveral pain relievers are helpful for mild-to-moderate headaches. They should not be used to prevent headaches, however.\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are common pain relievers that block prostaglandins, substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation and pain. NSAIDs are usually the first drugs tried for almost any kind of headache. There are dozens of NSAIDs. Common NSAIDs include:\nOver-the-counter NSAIDs. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT)\nPrescription NSAIDs. Diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Solaraze), tolmetin (Tolectin), indomethacin (Indocin)\nPatients should be aware that long-term use of high-dose NSAIDs may increase the risk for stomach bleeding and heart problems, including heart attack and stroke.\nAcetaminophen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a good alternative to NSAIDs when stomach distress, ulcers, or allergic reactions prohibit their use. A high dose (1,000 mg), however, is needed for this drug to be effective for headaches. Midrin (a combination of a drug that narrows blood vessels, a mild sedative, and acetaminophen) may be very helpful for tension-type headaches.\nAcetaminophen does have some adverse effects, however, and the daily dose should not exceed 4 grams (4,000 mg). Patients who take high doses of this drug for long periods are at risk for liver damage, particularly if they drink alcohol and do not eat regularly. Acetaminophen may cause serious kidney problems in people who already have kidney disease. It also may interact with certain medications, including the blood thinner warfarin.\nTricyclics and Other Antidepressants\nAntidepressants known as tricyclics are most often used for prevention of severe chronic tension-type headaches. Newer selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants are also sometimes used in milder cases.\nTricyclic Antidepressants. Tricyclics are not only useful for depression but also appear to help relieve muscle pain and improve sleep. They are sometimes classified in one of two categories: tertiary or secondary amines:\nTertiary amines include amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil). Amitriptyline is the tricyclic most commonly used for tension-type headache. These drugs tend to cause more drowsiness than secondary amines, which may be helpful for patients with sleep problems.)\nSecondary amines include desipramine (Norpramin) and nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl). Secondary amines may have fewer side effects than tertiary amines, but they are just as toxic in high amounts.\nA tricyclic antidepressant is usually started at a lower dose and then slowly increased. A headache diary can help the patient and the doctor assess the effectiveness of the treatment. In general, patients should remain on preventive drug treatment for at least 6 months. After that time, the doctor will slowly reduce the dose while continuing to monitor the frequency of headache attacks.\nSide effects are fairly common with these medications. Drowsiness is the most common, but may vary by specific drug. In addition, side effects most often reported include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, trouble urinating, heart rhythm problems, and dizziness. Blood pressure may also drop suddenly when sitting up or standing.\nTricyclics can have serious, although rare, side effects, including heart rhythm problems, which can be dangerous for some patients with certain heart diseases. These drugs can be fatal with overdose.\nOther Antidepressants. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. SSRIs used for tension-type headache preventive treatment include paroxetine (Paxil) and citalopram (Celexa). Other antidepressants used for tension-type headache are mirtazapine (Remeron) and venlafaxine (Effexor), which target both serotonin and norepinephrine.\nAlthough these antidepressants have fewer side effects than tricyclics, they do not appear to be as effective for preventive treatment of tension-type headaches.\nInvestigational Drugs\nTizanidine. Tizanidine (Zanaflex) is a muscle relaxant that is being studied as a possible preventive drug for chronic tension-type headaches. In one study, the combination of tazanidine and amitriptyline provided faster headache relief than amitriptyline alone. It is still not clear how useful this drug is for most patients.\nTopiramate. In one study, the anticonvulsant medication topiramate (Topamax), which is used for migraine prevention, was also effective for patients with chronic tension-type headache. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this result. Other anti-seizure medications are also under investigation.\nBotulinum Toxin. Botulinum toxin A (Botox) injections are now widely used to relax muscles and reduce skin wrinkles. Botox is also becoming popular as a treatment for chronic daily headaches, which include tension-type headache. However, at present there is little scientific evidence to support its use. Botox is not approved for headache treatment.\nNitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors block nitric oxide, which may play a role in increasing nerve activity that leads to headache. Drugs are currently being investigated in clinical trials for migraine treatment, and may also be studied for tension-type headache.\nBack to Top\nLifestyle Changes\nPsychological and behavioral techniques, and lifestyle changes, can have a beneficial effect on tension-type headaches. These therapies can also enhance the effects of drug treatments. To date, relaxation training and biofeedback have the strongest evidence for improvement in tension-type headache outcomes.\nRelaxation Training and Biofeedback\nRelaxation training uses breathing exercises, guided imagery, and other techniques to help relax muscles and relieve stress. Biofeedback uses a device to record a patient's bodily responses (heart rate, surface skin temperature, muscle tension). This information is then 'fed back' to the patient through a sound or visual image. Through this feedback, patients learns to control their physical responses. In clinical studies, relaxation training and biofeedback, both alone and in combination, have led to improvements in tension-type headache.\nStress Management and Behavioral Training\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) teaches patients how to recognize and cope with stressors in their life. It can help patients understand how their thoughts and behavior patterns may affect their symptoms, and how to change the way the body responds to anticipated pain. CBT is often included in stress management techniques. Research indicates that CBT and stress management is most effective when combined with relaxation training or biofeedback.\nMassage, Spinal Manipulation, and Physical Therapy\nMassage can help relax tense muscles, and may be helpful during acute headache attacks, although there is little evidence for long-term benefits. Although some small studies have suggested that spinal manipulation by chiropractors or osteopaths may have some benefits for preventing tension-type headaches, there is insufficient evidence overall to confirm their effectiveness for tension-type headache pain reduction.\nEvidence is stronger on the benefits of spinal manipulation for patients with headaches originating from nerve or muscular problems in the neck. Some researchers believe that tension-type headaches relieved by spinal manipulation are probably really caused by neck problems.\nThere has been little research evaluating the benefits of physical therapy for tension-type headache. Still, a physical therapist may be helpful in teaching specific exercises for strengthening and stretching muscles or improving posture. A physical therapist may also be able to advise on ergonomic changes to the patient's workplace environment.\nAcupuncture\nAn analysis of 26 trials of acupuncture suggested that it may have some benefit for tension headache, but the evidence to date is not completely convincing. Some studies comparing short-term acupuncture to sham (dummy) procedures report no benefits. A recent study suggested that acupuncture may help tension-type headache, but needling at non-acupuncture points worked just as well. This suggests a placebo effect may account for the headache relief experienced by acupuncture patients.\nDiet and Exercise\nGood health habits -- including adequate sleep, healthy diet, regular exercise-- are helpful for reducing stress.. Some Quitting smoking is important in reducing the risks for all headaches.\nHome Remedies\nHeat or cold packs may be helpful. An ancient remedy for tension headaches uses pressure applied to the head (such as a headband or a towel wrapped around the head) plus either heat or cold. Some people report more relief with cold, others with heat. Packs can either be frozen or heated.\nHerbal and Other Natural Remedies\nNumerous herbal remedies are promoted for tension-type headache. It is important that anyone taking herbal or so-called natural remedies be aware of the lack of regulations governing their quality and effectiveness. Generally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful. Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary supplements.\nEssential Oils. Some patients find relief using two drops of peppermint, eucalyptus, or lavender oil added to one cup of water. The patient soaks a cloth in the solution and applies it as a compress to the head.\nHerbs. Feverfew and valerian are two popular herbal remedies for headache relief. There have been few studies to confirm the effectiveness of these or other herbs for headache treatment.\nThe following are special concerns for people taking these herbs:\nPeople who have a bleeding or blood clot disorder, or who take blood-thinning medications such as coumadin (Warfarin), should not take feverfew. Feverfew can interfere with these medications and can affect the time it takes blood to clot. Pregnant women or women hoping to become pregnant should not take this herb, as it may potentially harm the fetus.\nValerian has sedative properties but can cause dizziness and drowsiness. High doses of valerian may cause blurred vision, excitability, vivid dreams, and changes in heart rhythm.\nReferences\nAntttila P. Tension-type headache in childhood and adolescence.

The pain is usually mild-to-moderate in intensity, with a steady pressing or tightening quality (like a vise being squeezed around the head). The headache is not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, and the pain is not increased by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. A tension-type headache attack can last anywhere from 30 minutes to an entire week.\nWho Gets Tension-Type Headaches?\nWomen are more likely to get tension-type headaches than men. Nearly everyone will have at least one tension-type headache at some point in their lives. Many people who have migraine headaches also have tension-type headaches.\nWhat Is The Difference Between Tension-Type Headaches and Migraine Headaches?\nMigraines and tension headaches have some similar characteristics, but also some important differences:\nMigraine pain is usually throbbing and while tension-type headache pain is usually a steady ache\nMigraine pain may affect only one side of the head while tension-type headache pain typically affects both sides of the head\nMigraine pain, but not tension-type pain, worsens with head movement\nMigraine headaches, but not tension-type headaches, may be accompanied by nausea or vomiting, sensitivity to both light and sound, or aura\nTreatment\nTreatment of tension-type headache focuses on relieving pain when attacks occur, and preventing recurrence of attacks. Most tension-type headache attacks respond to simple over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve).\nPatients who have two or more tension-type headache attacks each month should talk to their doctors about preventive therapy. This may include a tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), combined with behavioral therapies. Behavioral treatment approaches include relaxation therapy, biofeedback, stress management, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\nBack to Top\nIntroduction\nMost people are familiar with headaches, the all too common affliction marked by throbbing, piercing, or vise-like pain around much or a part of the head. There are many different kinds of headaches, and they range from being an infrequent annoyance to a persistent, severe, and disabling medical condition.\nThe brain itself is insensitive to pain, so that is not what hurts when a headache arises. The pain, instead, occurs in the following locations:\nThe tissues covering the brain\nThe attaching structures at the base of the brain\nMuscles and blood vessels around the scalp, face, and neck\nDoctors categorize headaches as either primary or secondary, which helps to distinguish the many different kinds of headaches and to determine appropriate treatments for each.\nPrimary Headaches. A headache is considered primary when a disease or other medical condition does not cause it. Most primary headaches fall into three main types: Tension-type, migraine, and cluster headaches.\nTension headache is the most common primary headache.\nNeurovascular headaches are the second most frequently occurring primary headaches and include migraines (the more common) and cluster headaches. Such headaches are caused by an interaction between blood vessel and nerve abnormalities. [See In-Depth Report #97: Migraine headaches and In-DepthReport #99: Cluster headaches .]\nSymptoms of migraine and tension-type headaches often overlap, and a diagnosis is sometimes difficult.\nSecondary Headaches. Secondary headaches are caused by other medical conditions, such as sinus infections, neck injuries, and strokes. About 2% of headaches are secondary to abnormalities or infections in the nasal or sinus passages, and they are commonly referred to as sinus headaches.\nChronic Daily Headaches. The International Headache Society's classification system includes a category called chronic daily headaches. They may originate as tension headaches, migraines, or a combination of these or other headache types. Chronic daily headaches affect 4 - 5% of the population.\nClick the icon to see an image of the different types of headache.\nChronic daily headaches are defined as any benign headache that occurs at least 15 days a month and is not associated with a serious neurologic abnormality. Most people with these headaches have them daily, or almost daily, and they can be quite debilitating.\nChronic daily headaches are, in turn, subdivided into two categories:\nShort-duration headaches last fewer than 4 hours. The most common short-acting chronic headaches are cluster headaches.\nLong-duration headaches last more than 4 hours. Tension-type headaches are the most common type of long-duration chronic (recurring) headaches and, in fact, the most common type of chronic headaches in general.\nTension-Type Headaches\nGeneral Description. Tension-type headaches, also called muscle contraction headaches or simply tension headaches, are the most common of all headaches. Tension-type headaches tend to have the following characteristics:\nThe pain is commonly described as a tight feeling, as if the head were in a vise. It usually occurs on both sides of the head and is often experienced in the forehead, in the back of the head and neck, or in both regions. Soreness in the shoulders or neck is common.\nThe pain is of mild-to-moderate intensity and is steady, not throbbing or pulsating\nThe headache is not accompanied by nausea or vomiting\nThe pain is not worsened by routine physical activity (climbing stairs, walking)\nSome patients may have either sensitivity to light or sensitivity to noise, but not both\nTypes of Tension Headache. In 2004, the International Headache Society updated its original 1988 classification criteria. Tension-type headaches are now divided into the following four classifications:\nFrequent episodic tension-type headache. Headaches occur at least once but not more than 15 days per month for at least 3 months (a minimum of 12 days but not more than 180 days per year). Headaches last from at least 30 minutes to 7 days.\nInfrequent episodic tension-type headache. At least 10 episodes of headache that occur less than 1 day per month (12 days per year). Because these headaches occur infrequently, they do not impact a patient's quality of life as severely as frequent episodic headaches and may not require attention from a medical professional.\nChronic tension-type headache. Headaches occur at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months (180 days per year). The headache persists for hours at a time and may be continuous.\nProbable tension-type headache. Probable tension headaches may be classified as probable frequent episodic, probable infrequent episodic, or probable chronic. They have most, but not all, of the symptoms of tension-type headaches and are not attributed to migraine without aura or other neurological disorders. Probable chronic tension-type headache may be related to medication overuse.\nBack to Top\nCauses\nThe causes of tension-type headache are still uncertain. Although tension-type headaches were once thought to be primarily due to muscle contractions, this theory has largely been discounted. Instead, researchers think that tension-type headaches occur due to an interaction of different factors that involve pain sensitivity and perception, as well as the role of brain chemicals (neurotransmitters). Genetic factors are likely be involved in chronic tension-type headache, whereas environmental factors (physical and psychological stress) may play a role in the physiologic processes involved with episodic tension-type headache.\nPain Sensitivity and Perception\nResearch indicates that patients with tension-type headache may have abnormalities in the central nervous system, (which includes the nerves in the brain and spine), that increase their sensitivity to pain.\nTension-type headaches may also be linked to myofascial trigger points in the neck and shoulder muscles. Myofascial pain involves the fascia (connective tissue) and muscles. Trigger points are knots in the muscle tissue that can cause tightness, weakness, and intense pain in various areas of the body. (For example, a trigger point in the shoulder may result in headache.) Because fibromyalgia is also characterized by myofascial pain, researchers are exploring whether there may be an association between this condition and tension-type headache. [See In-Depth Report #76: Fibromyalgia .]\nBrain Chemicals (Neurotransmitters)\nNeurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the brain. Several types of neurotransmitters have been identified as playing a role in increasing activity in pain pathways in the brain and affecting how the brain reacts to pain stimulation. In particular, serotonin (also called 5-HT) and nitric oxide are thought to be involved in these chemical changes. Release of these chemicals may activate nerve pathways in the brain, muscles, or elsewhere and increase pain.\nTriggers for Tension-Type Headache\nIn addition to stress, many different factors can trigger or aggravate tension-type headaches:\nMedication and Substance Overuse. About a third of persistent headaches -- whether chronic migraine or tension-type -- are medication-overuse headaches. These are the result of a rebound effect caused by the regular overuse of headache medications. Nearly any headache medication can produce this effect. Headaches can also occur after withdrawing from caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.\nPoor Posture and Work Conditions. Working or sleeping in an awkward position can contribute to posture problems (especially those that affect muscles in neck and shoulders) that trigger headaches. Eyestrain caused by overwork can also play a role.\nFatigue. Lack of sleep and tiredness from overwork are also headache triggers.\nFoods and Beverages. Rapid consumption of ice cream or other very cold foods or beverages is the most common trigger of sudden headache pain, which may be prevented by warming the food or drink for a few seconds in the front of the mouth before swallowing. Not eating on time is also a trigger for headache.\nPhysical Activity. Intense physical exertion (including athletics or sexual activity) as well as lack of physical activity can trigger headaches. However, tension-type headache pain is not worsened by routine physical activity.\nDental Problems. Jaw clenching or teeth grinding, especially during sleep, are signs of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ, also known as TMD). TMJ pain can occur in the ear, cheek, temples, neck, or shoulders. This condition often coexists with chronic tension headache. Some patients with TMJ may see improvement in tension-type headaches from procedures or exercises therapies that specifically address the dental condition.\nClick the icon to see an image of temporomandibular joint dysfunction.\nPhysical Trauma. Whiplash or head or neck injury can lead to headaches.\nHormonal Changes. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or perimenopause, can affect headache occurrence.\nCauses of Secondary Headaches\nAbout 90% of people seeking help for headaches have a primary headache. The rest are secondary headaches, caused by an underlying disorder that produces headache as a symptom. More than 300 conditions can cause headaches. These can range from sinus conditions to brain tumor. While fear of brain tumor is common among people with headaches, headache is almost never the first or only sign of a tumor. Changes in personality and mental functioning, vomiting, seizures, and other symptoms are more likely to appear first.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nTension-type headaches are the most common headaches, accounting for nearly half of all headaches. According to one study, nearly 40% of Americans have at least one episode of tension headache during the course of a year. Tension-type headaches are more common among women than men. Some reports estimate that over 85% of women and about 63% of men will have a tension-type headache at some point during a year. Nearly everyone has at least one tension-type headache during their lifetime.\nEpisodic tension-type headaches are more common than chronic tension-type headaches. Surveys indicate that about 3% of the general population has chronic tension-type headache.\nTension-type headaches are most likely to occur among people in their 40s. The prevalence of tension-type headaches declines as people become older.\nHeadaches in Children\nHeadaches are rare before age 4 but increase in prevalence throughout childhood, reaching a peak around age 13. In one large study, about 7% of 7-year olds and 15% of 11-year olds had headaches. Ten percent of these childhood headaches were recurrent. In many of these patients, chronic headaches persist into adulthood. In addition, as adults these patients have a tendency to develop multiple physical or psychiatric complaints, such as back pain, muscle aches, digestive complaints, and depression.\nStudies have found that only a minority of chronic childhood headaches are due to physical conditions, such as head injuries or medical problems. Many children with tension-type headache episodes also suffer from some form of emotional disorder.\nPsychosocial factors associated with childhood tension-type headaches include:\nSleep problems. Many children who experience chronic daily headaches suffer from sleep disturbances, especially difficulty falling asleep.\nModerate or severe depression.\nEmotional rigidity in a child and more repressed anger than their peers.\nFamily stress. This includes maternal illness or separation, family bereavement, relationship problems, mental illness in a family member, and other stressful family events.\nProblems at school. According to a National Headache Foundation survey, nearly 30% of children miss school because of headaches. For many children, the start of the school season can be a particularly stressful time.\nThe National Headache Foundation recommends these tips for parents:\nKeep a diary of child's headaches noting time of onset, length and intensity of attack, location of pain, and food triggers.\nMake sure child gets plenty of sleep at regular times.\nAvoid changes in child's eating routing (hunger and eating at irregular times can trigger headaches).\nDiscuss any headache concerns with child's doctor.\nBack to Top\nTreatment\nManagement of tension-type headaches focuses in the short term on treating acute attacks, and in the long term on preventing recurrent episodes of headache. In general, short-term treatment of tension-type headache involves drugs (mainly pain relievers) while long-term preventive measures include both drug and non-drug approaches. With medications, relaxation training, lifestyle changes, and other therapies, nearly all patients can be helped.\nTreatment for Acute Attacks of Tension-Type Headaches\nFortunately, most acute tension-type headaches get better without any treatment, and simple over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can treat mild symptoms. Aspirin or ibuprofen (Motrin) are usually the first choices, followed by naproxen (Aleve). Some patients may also find helpful medications that combine a pain reliever with caffeine.\nMassage therapy may also be useful for treating acute episodes of tension-type headache.\nTreatment and Prevention of Frequent and Chronic Tension-Type Headaches\nDaily preventive treatment is recommended for patients who experience at least two headache attacks a month. Preventive treatments do not work as well when patients are overusing pain-relief medication, so doctors may recommend stopping and withdrawing from analgesics before beginning preventive approaches.\nThe goals of preventive treatment are to reduce the frequency and severity of headache attacks, and to improve the response to pain medication.\nPreventive treatment for tension-type headache includes:\nDrug treatment with an antidepressant, usually the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline\nRelaxation training and biofeedback\nStress management through cognitive-behavioral therapy\nStudies indicate that best results are achieved when drug treatment is combined with relaxation or stress-management training.\nWithdrawing from Medications After Medication-Overuse Headaches\nIf headaches develop because of medication overuse, the patient cannot recover without stopping the drugs. (If caffeine is the culprit, a person may only need to reduce coffee or tea drinking to a reasonable level, not necessarily stop drinking it altogether.) The patient usually has the option of stopping abruptly or gradually and should expect the following course:\nMost headache drugs can be stopped abruptly, but the patient should be sure to check with the doctor before withdrawal. Certain non-headache medications, such as anti-anxiety drugs or beta-blockers, require gradual withdrawal under medical supervision.\nIf the patient chooses to taper off standard headache medications, withdrawal should be completed within 3 days or less. Otherwise the patient may become discouraged.\nNo matter which approach is used for stopping medication, the patient must expect a period of worsening headache for a few days afterward. Alternative pain relievers may be administered during the first days to help withdrawal.\nMost people feel better within 2 weeks, although headache symptoms can persist up to 16 weeks (and in rare cases even longer).\nBack to Top\nMedications\nThe standard treatments for tension-type headaches are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen, and tricyclic antidepressants, usually amitriptyline (Elavil).\nDue to the risks of overuse and dependence, opoids, opoid-like drugs, and sedative hypnotics are not recommended for treatment of tension-type headaches.\nPain Relievers\nSeveral pain relievers are helpful for mild-to-moderate headaches. They should not be used to prevent headaches, however.\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are common pain relievers that block prostaglandins, substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation and pain. NSAIDs are usually the first drugs tried for almost any kind of headache. There are dozens of NSAIDs. Common NSAIDs include:\nOver-the-counter NSAIDs. Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT)\nPrescription NSAIDs. Diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Solaraze), tolmetin (Tolectin), indomethacin (Indocin)\nPatients should be aware that long-term use of high-dose NSAIDs may increase the risk for stomach bleeding and heart problems, including heart attack and stroke.\nAcetaminophen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a good alternative to NSAIDs when stomach distress, ulcers, or allergic reactions prohibit their use. A high dose (1,000 mg), however, is needed for this drug to be effective for headaches. Midrin (a combination of a drug that narrows blood vessels, a mild sedative, and acetaminophen) may be very helpful for tension-type headaches.\nAcetaminophen does have some adverse effects, however, and the daily dose should not exceed 4 grams (4,000 mg). Patients who take high doses of this drug for long periods are at risk for liver damage, particularly if they drink alcohol and do not eat regularly. Acetaminophen may cause serious kidney problems in people who already have kidney disease. It also may interact with certain medications, including the blood thinner warfarin.\nTricyclics and Other Antidepressants\nAntidepressants known as tricyclics are most often used for prevention of severe chronic tension-type headaches. Newer selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants are also sometimes used in milder cases.\nTricyclic Antidepressants. Tricyclics are not only useful for depression but also appear to help relieve muscle pain and improve sleep. They are sometimes classified in one of two categories: tertiary or secondary amines:\nTertiary amines include amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil). Amitriptyline is the tricyclic most commonly used for tension-type headache. These drugs tend to cause more drowsiness than secondary amines, which may be helpful for patients with sleep problems.)\nSecondary amines include desipramine (Norpramin) and nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl). Secondary amines may have fewer side effects than tertiary amines, but they are just as toxic in high amounts.\nA tricyclic antidepressant is usually started at a lower dose and then slowly increased. A headache diary can help the patient and the doctor assess the effectiveness of the treatment. In general, patients should remain on preventive drug treatment for at least 6 months. After that time, the doctor will slowly reduce the dose while continuing to monitor the frequency of headache attacks.\nSide effects are fairly common with these medications. Drowsiness is the most common, but may vary by specific drug. In addition, side effects most often reported include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, trouble urinating, heart rhythm problems, and dizziness. Blood pressure may also drop suddenly when sitting up or standing.\nTricyclics can have serious, although rare, side effects, including heart rhythm problems, which can be dangerous for some patients with certain heart diseases. These drugs can be fatal with overdose.\nOther Antidepressants. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. SSRIs used for tension-type headache preventive treatment include paroxetine (Paxil) and citalopram (Celexa). Other antidepressants used for tension-type headache are mirtazapine (Remeron) and venlafaxine (Effexor), which target both serotonin and norepinephrine.\nAlthough these antidepressants have fewer side effects than tricyclics, they do not appear to be as effective for preventive treatment of tension-type headaches.\nInvestigational Drugs\nTizanidine. Tizanidine (Zanaflex) is a muscle relaxant that is being studied as a possible preventive drug for chronic tension-type headaches. In one study, the combination of tazanidine and amitriptyline provided faster headache relief than amitriptyline alone. It is still not clear how useful this drug is for most patients.\nTopiramate. In one study, the anticonvulsant medication topiramate (Topamax), which is used for migraine prevention, was also effective for patients with chronic tension-type headache. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this result. Other anti-seizure medications are also under investigation.\nBotulinum Toxin. Botulinum toxin A (Botox) injections are now widely used to relax muscles and reduce skin wrinkles. Botox is also becoming popular as a treatment for chronic daily headaches, which include tension-type headache. However, at present there is little scientific evidence to support its use. Botox is not approved for headache treatment.\nNitric Oxide Synthase Inhibitors. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors block nitric oxide, which may play a role in increasing nerve activity that leads to headache. Drugs are currently being investigated in clinical trials for migraine treatment, and may also be studied for tension-type headache.\nBack to Top\nLifestyle Changes\nPsychological and behavioral techniques, and lifestyle changes, can have a beneficial effect on tension-type headaches. These therapies can also enhance the effects of drug treatments. To date, relaxation training and biofeedback have the strongest evidence for improvement in tension-type headache outcomes.\nRelaxation Training and Biofeedback\nRelaxation training uses breathing exercises, guided imagery, and other techniques to help relax muscles and relieve stress. Biofeedback uses a device to record a patient's bodily responses (heart rate, surface skin temperature, muscle tension). This information is then 'fed back' to the patient through a sound or visual image. Through this feedback, patients learns to control their physical responses. In clinical studies, relaxation training and biofeedback, both alone and in combination, have led to improvements in tension-type headache.\nStress Management and Behavioral Training\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) teaches patients how to recognize and cope with stressors in their life. It can help patients understand how their thoughts and behavior patterns may affect their symptoms, and how to change the way the body responds to anticipated pain. CBT is often included in stress management techniques. Research indicates that CBT and stress management is most effective when combined with relaxation training or biofeedback.\nMassage, Spinal Manipulation, and Physical Therapy\nMassage can help relax tense muscles, and may be helpful during acute headache attacks, although there is little evidence for long-term benefits. Although some small studies have suggested that spinal manipulation by chiropractors or osteopaths may have some benefits for preventing tension-type headaches, there is insufficient evidence overall to confirm their effectiveness for tension-type headache pain reduction.\nEvidence is stronger on the benefits of spinal manipulation for patients with headaches originating from nerve or muscular problems in the neck. Some researchers believe that tension-type headaches relieved by spinal manipulation are probably really caused by neck problems.\nThere has been little research evaluating the benefits of physical therapy for tension-type headache. Still, a physical therapist may be helpful in teaching specific exercises for strengthening and stretching muscles or improving posture. A physical therapist may also be able to advise on ergonomic changes to the patient's workplace environment.\nAcupuncture\nAn analysis of 26 trials of acupuncture suggested that it may have some benefit for tension headache, but the evidence to date is not completely convincing. Some studies comparing short-term acupuncture to sham (dummy) procedures report no benefits. A recent study suggested that acupuncture may help tension-type headache, but needling at non-acupuncture points worked just as well. This suggests a placebo effect may account for the headache relief experienced by acupuncture patients.\nDiet and Exercise\nGood health habits -- including adequate sleep, healthy diet, regular exercise-- are helpful for reducing stress.. Some Quitting smoking is important in reducing the risks for all headaches.\nHome Remedies\nHeat or cold packs may be helpful. An ancient remedy for tension headaches uses pressure applied to the head (such as a headband or a towel wrapped around the head) plus either heat or cold. Some people report more relief with cold, others with heat. Packs can either be frozen or heated.\nHerbal and Other Natural Remedies\nNumerous herbal remedies are promoted for tension-type headache. It is important that anyone taking herbal or so-called natural remedies be aware of the lack of regulations governing their quality and effectiveness. Generally, manufacturers of herbal remedies and dietary supplements do not need approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell their products. Just like a drug, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful. Always check with your doctor before using any herbal remedies or dietary supplements.\nEssential Oils. Some patients find relief using two drops of peppermint, eucalyptus, or lavender oil added to one cup of water. The patient soaks a cloth in the solution and applies it as a compress to the head.\nHerbs. Feverfew and valerian are two popular herbal remedies for headache relief. There have been few studies to confirm the effectiveness of these or other herbs for headache treatment.\nThe following are special concerns for people taking these herbs:\nPeople who have a bleeding or blood clot disorder, or who take blood-thinning medications such as coumadin (Warfarin), should not take feverfew. Feverfew can interfere with these medications and can affect the time it takes blood to clot. Pregnant women or women hoping to become pregnant should not take this herb, as it may potentially harm the fetus.\nValerian has sedative properties but can cause dizziness and drowsiness. High doses of valerian may cause blurred vision, excitability, vivid dreams, and changes in heart rhythm.\nReferences\nAntttila P. Tension-type headache in childhood and adolescence.

These include:\nLiver Disorders. The liver is particularly endangered by alcoholism. Between 10 - 20% of people who drink heavily (five or more drinks a day) develop cirrhosis, a progressive and irreversible scarring of the liver that can eventually be fatal.\nGastrointestinal Problems. Alcoholism increases the risk for inflammation of the esophagus ('food pipe'), and stomach ulcers. It can also lead to swollen veins (varices) in the esophagus. Violent vomiting can produce tears in the junction between the stomach and esophagus. Alcoholism can also cause serious acute and chronic inflammation of the pancreas.\nHeart Disease. Excessive drinking has many negative effects on heart health. Alcohol is a toxin that damages the heart muscle. In fact, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for alcoholics. Alcohol abuse increases levels of triglycerides (unhealthy fats) and increases the risks for high blood pressure, heart failure, and stroke.\nCancer. Alcoholism increases the risk for mouth, throat, esophageal, gastrointestinal, liver, colorectal, and breast cancers.\nNeurological Problems. Chronic alcohol abuse can impair so-called \"executive functions,\" which include problem solving, mental flexibility, memory, and attention. Vitamin B12 deficiencies can lead to peripheral neuropathy and other nerve damage.\nDiabetes. Heavy drinking is associated with obesity, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. In addition, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia, a drop in blood sugar.\nSkin, Muscle, and Bone Disorders. Severe alcoholism is associated with osteoporosis (loss of bone density), muscular deterioration, skin sores, and itching.\nReproductive Problems. Alcoholism can contribute to erectile dysfunction in men and infertility in women. Even moderate amounts of alcohol can have damaging effects on a developing fetus.\nLung Problems. Patients who abuse alcoholism have a greater risk for developing severe pneumonia.\nBack to Top\nIntroduction\nAlcoholism is a chronic, progressive, and often fatal disease. It is a primary disorder and not a symptom of other diseases or emotional problems. The chemistry of alcohol allows it to affect nearly every type of cell in the body, including those in the central nervous system. After prolonged exposure to alcohol, the brain becomes dependent on it. The severity of this disease is influenced by factors such as genetics, psychology, culture, and response to physical pain.\nAlcoholism, alcohol dependence, and alcohol abuse are associated with the following:\nThe only indication of early alcoholism may be the unpleasant physical responses to withdrawal that occur during even brief periods of abstinence.\nAlcoholics have little or no control over the quantity they drink or the duration or frequency of their drinking.\nAlcoholics are preoccupied with drinking, deny their own addiction, and continue to drink even though they are aware of the dangers.\nOver time, some alcoholics become tolerant to the effects of drinking and require more alcohol to become intoxicated, creating the illusion that they can \"hold their liquor.\"\nAlcoholics may have blackouts after drinking and have frequent hangovers that cause them to miss work and other normal activities.\nAlcoholics might drink alone and start their drinking early in the day.\nAlcoholics periodically quit drinking or switch from hard liquor to beer or wine, but these periods rarely last.\nSevere alcoholics often have a history of accidents, marital and work instability, and alcohol-related health problems.\nEpisodic violent and abusive incidents involving spouses and children and a history of unexplained or frequent accidents are often signs of drug or alcohol abuse.\nAlcoholism can develop insidiously, and often there is no clear line between problem drinking and alcoholism. Eventually alcohol dominates thinking, emotions, and actions and becomes the primary means through which a person can deal with people, work, and life.\nDefinition of Alcohol Use and Abuse\nIn addition to alcohol dependence, alcohol use is defined by levels of harm that it may be causing. This information is useful to determine possible interventions at earlier stages. The following categories of alcohol use and abuse use a definition of one drink as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces (a jigger) of 90-proof liquor.\nModerate Drinking. Moderate drinking, particularly red wine, appears to offer health benefits. Moderate drinking is defined as equal to or less than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women.\nHazardous (Heavy) Drinking. Hazardous drinking puts people at risk for adverse health events. People who are heavy drinkers consume:\nMore than 14 drinks per week, or four to five drinks at one sitting, for men\nMore than seven drinks per week, or three drinks at one sitting, for women\nFrequent intoxication\nHarmful Drinking. Drinking is considered harmful when alcohol consumption has actually caused physical or psychological harm. This is determined by:\nClear evidence that alcohol is responsible for such harm.\nThe nature of that harm can be identified.\nAlcohol consumption has persisted for at least a month or has occurred repeatedly for the past year.\nCertain people are at much higher risk for harmful drinking, such as older individuals with high blood pressure or those taking medications for arthritis or pain.\nAlcohol Abuse. People with alcohol abuse have one or more of the following alcohol-related problems over a period of 1 year:\nFailure to fulfill work or personal obligations\nRecurrent use in potentially dangerous situations\nProblems with the law\nContinued use in spite of harm being done to social or personal relationships\nAlcohol Dependence. People who are alcohol dependent have three or more of the following alcohol-related problems over a year:\nIncreased amounts of alcohol are needed to produce an effect\nWithdrawal symptoms or drinking alcohol is used to avoid these symptoms\nDrinks more over a given period than intended\nUnsuccessful attempts to quit or cut down\nGives up significant leisure or work activities\nContinues to drink in spite of the knowledge of its physical or psychological harm to oneself or others\nTwo-thirds of those with alcohol dependence continued to be dependent on alcohol after 5 years.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAbout 90% of adults in the U.S. drink alcohol. Every day, more than 700,000 Americans are being treated for alcoholism. In addition, up to half of American men have problems that are caused by alcohol.\nCategories of Alcoholic Types\nSome researchers have categorized people with alcoholism as Type 1 or Type 2.\nType 1 individuals are more often women. They typically become alcoholic at a later age, have less severe symptoms or fewer psychiatric problems, and have a better outlook on life than those classified as type 2.\nType 2 people are more likely to be male. They tend to become alcoholic at an early age and have a high family risk for alcoholism, more severe symptoms, and a negative outlook on life.\nNot only do these two groups tend to respond differently to psychotherapeutic approaches, but they may also respond differently to medications.\nAge\nDrinking in Adolescence. About half of under-age Americans have used alcohol. About 2 million people ages 12 - 20 are considered heavy drinkers, and 4.4 million are binge drinkers. Anyone who begins drinking in adolescence is at risk for developing alcoholism. The earlier a person begins drinking, the greater the risk. A survey of over 40,000 adults indicated that among those who began drinking before age 14, nearly half had become alcoholic dependent by the age of 21. In contrast, only 9% of people who began drinking after the age of 21 developed alcoholism.\nYoung people at highest risk for early drinking are those with a history of abuse, family violence, depression, and stressful life events. People with a family history of alcoholism are also more likely to begin drinking before the age of 20 and to become alcoholic. Such adolescent drinkers are also more apt to underestimate the effects of drinking and to make judgment errors, such as going on binges or driving after drinking, than young drinkers without a family history of alcoholism.\nDrinking in the Elderly Population. Although alcoholism usually develops in early adulthood, the elderly are not exempt. In fact, doctors may overlook alcoholism when evaluating elderly patients, mistakenly attributing the signs of alcohol abuse to the normal effects of the aging process.\nAlcohol also affects the older body differently. People who maintain the same drinking patterns as they age can easily develop alcohol dependency without realizing it. It takes fewer drinks to become intoxicated, and older organs can be damaged by smaller amounts of alcohol than those of younger people. Also, up to one-half of the 100 most prescribed drugs for older people react adversely with alcohol. Medications used for arthritis or pain pose a particular danger for interaction with alcohol.\nGender\nMost alcoholics are men, but the incidence of alcoholism in women has been increasing over the past 30 years. Studies indicate that about 7% of men and 2.5% of women abuse alcohol. However, studies suggest that women are more vulnerable than men to many of the long-term consequences of alcoholism. For example, women are more likely than men to develop alcoholic hepatitis and to die from cirrhosis, and women are more vulnerable to the brain cell damage caused by alcohol.\nHistory of Abuse\nIndividuals who were abused as children have a higher risk for substance abuse later on. In one study, 72% of women and 27% of men with substance abuse disorders reported physical or sexual abuse or both. They also had worse response to treatment than those without such a history.\nEthnicity\nOverall, there is no difference in alcoholic prevalence among African-Americans, Caucasians, and Hispanic-Americans. Some population groups, however, such as Native Americans, have an increased incidence of alcoholism while others, such as Jewish and Asian Americans, have a lower risk. Although the biological or cultural causes of such different risks are not known, certain people in these population groups may have a genetic susceptibility or invulnerability to alcoholism because of the way they metabolize alcohol.\nPsychiatric and Behavioral Disorders\nPsychiatric Disorders. Severely depressed or anxious people are at high risk for alcoholism, smoking, and other forms of addiction. Likewise, a large proportion of alcohol-dependent people suffer from an accompanying psychiatric or substance abuse disorder. Either anxiety or depression may increase the risk for self-medication with alcohol. Depression is the most common psychiatric problem in people with alcoholism or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is very common in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\nSpecific anxiety disorders, such as panic disorders and social phobia, may pose particular risks for alcohol and substance abuse. Social phobia causes an intense fear of being publicly scrutinized and humiliated. Panic disorders cause intense anxiety and panic attacks. People with these disorders may use alcohol as a way to become less inhibited in public situations or to calm feelings of panic. While anxiety disorders are found in about 15% of adults overall, over 50% of people with alcohol abuse problems suffer from these conditions. People who have anxiety disorders are more likely to resume drinking after treatment for alcohol dependence. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #28: Anxiety .]\nLong-term alcoholism itself may cause chemical changes that produce anxiety and depression. In fact, a study on elderly people with depression reported that when even moderate drinkers reduced consumption, their mood improved. Studies also indicate that alcohol use may promote panic attacks. It is not always clear, then, whether people with emotional disorders are self-medicating with alcohol, or whether alcohol itself is producing mood swings.\nBehavioral Disorders and Lack of Impulse Control. Studies are also finding that alcoholism is strongly related to impulsive, excitable, and novelty-seeking behavior, and such patterns are established early on. Children who later become alcoholics or who abuse drugs are more likely to have less fear of new situations than others, even if there is a greater risk for harm than in nonalcoholics. Specifically, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition that shares these behaviors, have a higher risk for alcoholism in adulthood. The risk is especially high in children with ADHD and conduct disorder.\nSocioeconomic Factors\nBack to Top\nComplications\nAlcoholism reduces life expectancy by 10 - 12 years. Although studies indicate that adults who drink moderately (about one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men) have a lower mortality rate than their nondrinking peers, their risk for untimely death increases with heavier drinking. The earlier a person begins drinking heavily, the greater their chance of developing serious illnesses later on. Once one becomes dependent on alcohol, it is very difficult to quit.\nAlcoholism and Early Death\nAlcohol can affect the body in so many ways that researchers have a hard time determining exactly what the consequences are from drinking. Heavy drinking is associated with earlier death. However, it is not just from a higher risk of the more common serious health problems, such as heart attack, heart failure, diabetes, lung disease, or stroke. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to many problems that can increase the risk for death:\nPeople who drink regularly have a higher rate of death from injury or violence.\nAlcohol overdose can lead to death. This is a particular danger for adolescents who may want to impress their friends with their ability to drink alcohol but cannot yet gauge its effects. However, alcohol overdose doesn't only occur from any one heavy drinking incident, but may also occur from a constant infusion of alcohol in the bloodstream.\nSevere withdrawal and delirium tremens. Delirium tremens occurs in about 5% of alcoholics. It includes progressively severe withdrawal symptoms and altered mental states. In some cases, it can be fatal.\nFrequent, heavy alcohol use directly harms many areas in the body and produce dangerous health conditions (liver damage, pancreatitis, anemia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, nerve damage, and impotence).\nAlcohol abusers who need surgery have an increased risk of postoperative complications, including infections, bleeding, insufficient heart and lung functions, and problems with wound healing. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms after surgery may impose further stress on the patient and hinder recuperation.\nThe Effects of Hangover\nAlthough not traditionally thought of as a medical problem, hangovers have significant consequences that include changes in liver function, hormonal balance, and mental functioning and an increased risk for depression and cardiac events. Hangovers can impair job performance, increasing the risk for mistakes and accidents. Interestingly, hangovers are generally more common in light-to-moderate drinkers than heavy and chronic drinkers, suggesting that binge drinking can be as threatening as chronic drinking. Any man who drinks more than five drinks or any woman who has more than three drinks is at risk for a hangover.\nAccidents, Suicide, and Murder\nAlcohol plays a large role in accidents, suicide, and crime:\nAlcohol plays a major role in more than half of all automobile fatalities.\nAlcohol-related automobile accidents are the leading causes of death in young people.\nFewer than two drinks can impair the ability to drive. Even one drink may double the risk of injury, and more than four drinks increases the risk by 11 times.\nAlcoholism is the primary diagnosis in one-quarter of all people who commit suicide.\nAlcohol is implicated in over half of all murders.\nDomestic Violence\nAlcoholic households are less cohesive and have more conflicts, and their members are less independent and expressive than households with nonalcoholic or recovering alcoholic parents. Domestic violence is a common consequence of alcohol abuse.\nEffect on Women. A serious risk factor for injury from domestic violence may be a history of alcohol abuse in her male partner.\nEffect on Children. Alcoholism in parents also increases the risk for violent behavior and abuse toward their children. Children of alcoholics tend to do worse academically than others, have a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, and stress and lower self-esteem than their peers. In addition to their own inherited risk for later alcoholism, many children of alcoholics have serious coping problems that may last their entire life.\nAdult children of alcoholic parents are at higher risk for divorce and for psychiatric symptoms. One study concluded that the only events with greater psychological impact on children are sexual and physical abuse.\nIncreased Risk for Other Addictions\nResearchers are finding common genetic factors in alcohol and nicotine addiction, which may explain, in part, why alcoholics are often smokers. Alcoholics who smoke compound their health problems. More alcoholics die from tobacco-related illnesses, such as heart disease or cancer, than from chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or other conditions that are more directly tied to excessive drinking. Abuse of other substance is also common among alcoholics.\nLiver Disorders\nAlcoholic Hepatitis and Cirrhosis. Alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine and passes directly into the liver, where it becomes the preferred energy source. The liver, then, is particularly endangered by alcoholism. In the liver, alcohol converts to toxic chemicals, notably acetaldehyde, which trigger the production of immune factors called cytokines. In large amounts, these factors cause inflammation and tissue injury.\nEven moderate alcohol intake can produce pain in the upper right quarter of the abdomen -- a possible symptom of liver involvement. In many cases, such symptoms may be an indication of fatty liver or alcohol hepatitis, which are reversible liver conditions.\nBetween 10 - 20% of people who drink heavily (five or more drinks a day) develop cirrhosis, a progressive and irreversible scarring of the liver that can eventually be fatal. Alcoholic cirrhosis (also sometimes referred to as portal, Laennec's, nutritional, or micronodular cirrhosis) is the primary cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #75: Cirrhosis .]\nNot eating when drinking and consuming a variety of alcoholic beverages increase the risk for liver damage. Nevertheless, the amount of alcohol consumed and the patterns of drinking are only weak predictions of risk. Up to 90% of heavy drinkers do not develop advanced irreversible liver disease. Other risk factors have been identified that may increase the danger to the liver in heavy drinkers:\nObesity is a major factor for all stages of liver disease.\nWomen develop liver disease at lower quantities of alcohol intake than men.\nGenetic factors that regulate the immune responses also play role.\nHepatitis B and C. People with alcoholism tend to have lifestyles that put them at higher risk for hepatitis B and C, which are caused by viruses. Chronic forms of viral hepatitis pose risks for cirrhosis and liver cancer, and alcoholism significantly increases these risks. People with alcoholism should be immunized against hepatitis B. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #59: Hepatitis .]\nGastrointestinal Problems\nAlcoholism can cause many problems in the gastrointestinal tract. Violent vomiting can produce tears in the junction between the stomach and esophagus. It increases the risk for ulcers, particularly in people taking the painkillers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. It can also lead to swollen veins in the esophagus, called varices, which can lead to inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) and to bleeding.\nClick the icon to see an image of ulcer emergencies.\nAlcohol can contribute to serious acute and chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in people who are susceptible to this condition. There is some evidence of a higher risk for pancreatic cancer in people with alcoholism, although this higher risk may occur only in people who are also smokers.\nClick the icon to see an image of the pancreas.\nEffect on Heart Disease and Stroke\nModerate amounts (one to two drinks a day) of alcohol can improve some heart disease risk factors, such as increasing HDL ('good cholesterol') levels. However, at this time there is no definitive proof that moderate drinking improves overall health, and the American Heart Association does not recommend drinking alcoholic beverages solely to reduce cardiovascular risk.\nExcessive drinking clearly has negative effects on heart health. Alcohol is a toxin that damages the heart muscle. In fact, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for alcoholics. Alcohol abuse increases levels of triglycerides (unhealthy fats) and increases the risks for high blood pressure, heart failure, and stroke. In addition, the extra calories in alcohol can contribute to obesity, a major risk factor for many heart problems.\nClick the icon to see an image of the heart.\nCancer\nAlcohol abuse and dependence may increase the risk for certain type of cancers. In particular, heavy alcohol use appears to increase the risks for mouth, throat, esophageal, gastrointestinal, liver, and colorectal, cancers. Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. Although the additional risk is small, women who are at high risk for breast cancer should consider not drinking at all.\nEffects on the Lungs\nPneumonia. Over time, chronic alcoholism can cause severe reductions in white blood cells, which increase the risk for community-acquired pneumonia (pneumonia acquired outside of hospitals or nursing homes). When patients are inebriated they are also at risk for aspiration of mucus from the airways, causing pneumonia. Patients who abuse alcoholism have a greater risk for developing severe pneumonia. Doctors recommend that patients with alcohol dependence should receive an annual pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination. The initial signs of pneumococcal pneumonia are high fever, cough, and stabbing chest pains. Immediately contact your doctor if you experience these symptoms.\nClick the icon to see an image of pneumonia.\nSkin, Muscle, and Bone Disorders\nSevere alcoholism is associated with osteoporosis (loss of bone density), muscular deterioration, skin sores, and itching. Alcohol-dependent women seem to face a higher risk than men for damage to muscles, including muscles of the heart, from the toxic effects of alcohol.\nClick the icon to see an image of osteoporosis.\nEffects on Reproduction and Fetal Development\nSexual Function and Fertility. Alcoholism increases levels of the female hormone estrogen and reduces levels of the male hormone testosterone, factors that possibly contribute to erectile dysfunction and enlarged breasts in men and infertility in women. Such changes may also be responsible for the higher risks for absent periods and abnormal uterine bleeding in women with alcoholism.\nDrinking During Pregnancy and Effects on the Infant. Even moderate amounts of alcohol can have damaging effects on the developing fetus, including low birth weight and an increased risk for miscarriage. High amounts can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition that can cause mental and growth retardation. Although there is no specific amount of alcohol intake, the risk of developing the syndrome is increased depending on the time of alcohol exposure during pregnancy, a pattern of drinking (four or more drinks per occasion), and how often alcohol consumption occurs.\nEffect on Weight and Diabetes\nModerate alcohol consumption may help protect the hearts of adults with type 2 diabetes. Heavy drinking, however, is associated with obesity, which is a risk factor for this form of diabetes. In addition, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia, a drop in blood sugar, which is especially dangerous for people with diabetes who are taking insulin. Intoxicated diabetics may not be able to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia, a potentially hazardous condition.\nEffect on Central and Peripheral Nervous System and Mental Functioning\nDrinking too much alcohol can cause immediate mild neurologic problems in anyone, including insomnia and headache. Long-term alcohol use may even physically affect the brain. Depending on length and severity of alcohol abuse, neurologic damage may not be permanent, and abstinence nearly always leads to eventual recovery of normal mental function.\nEffect on Mental Functioning. Recent high alcohol use (within the last 3 months) is associated with some loss of verbal memory and slower reaction times. Over time, chronic alcohol abuse can impair so-called \"executive functions,\" which include problem solving, mental flexibility, short-term memory, and attention. These problems are usually mild to moderate and can last for weeks or even years after a person quits drinking. In fact, such persistent problems in judgment are possibly one reason for the difficulty in quitting. Alcoholic patients who have co-existing psychiatric or neurologic problems are at particular risk for mental confusion and depression.\nClick the icon to see an image of the nervous system.\nVitamin and Mineral Deficiencies\nPeople with alcoholism should be sure to take vitamin and mineral supplements. Even apparently well-nourished people with alcoholism may be deficient in important nutrients. Deficiencies in vitamin B are particular health risks in people with alcoholism. Other vitamin and mineral deficiencies, however, can also cause widespread health problems.\nFolate Deficiencies. Alcohol interferes with the metabolism of folate, a very important B vitamin, called folic acid when used as a supplement. Folate deficiencies can cause severe anemia. Deficiencies during pregnancy can lead to birth defects in the infant.\nWernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a serious consequence of severe thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency in alcoholism. Symptoms of this syndrome include severe loss of balance, confusion, and memory loss. Eventually, it can result in permanent brain damage and death. Once the syndrome develops, oral supplements have no effect, and only adequate and rapid intravenous vitamin B1 can treat this serious condition.\nPeripheral Neuropathy. Vitamin B12 deficiencies can also lead to peripheral neuropathy, a condition that causes pain, tingling, and other abnormal sensations in the arms and legs.\nDrug Interactions\nThe effects of many medications are strengthened by alcohol, while others are inhibited. Of particular importance is alcohol's reinforcing effect on anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications.\nAlcohol also interacts with many drugs used by people with diabetes. It interferes with drugs that prevent seizures or blood clotting. It increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in people taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ibuprofen and naproxen.\nChronic alcohol abusers have a particularly high risk for adverse side effects from consuming alcohol while taking certain antibiotics. These side effects include flushing, headache, nausea, and vomiting. In other words, taking almost any medication should preclude drinking alcohol.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nEven when people with alcoholism experience withdrawal symptoms, they nearly always deny the problem, leaving it up to co-workers, friends, or relatives to recognize the symptoms and to take the first steps toward encouraging treatment. Denial, in fact, may be an important warning signal for alcoholism.\nFamily members cannot always rely on a doctor to make an initial diagnosis. Although 15 - 30% of people who are hospitalized have alcoholism or alcohol dependence, doctors often fail to screen for the problem. In addition, doctors themselves often do not recognize the symptoms. Even when doctors identify an alcohol problem, however, they are frequently reluctant to confront the patient with a diagnosis that might lead to treatment for addiction.\nScreening Tests for Alcoholism\nA doctor who suspects alcohol abuse should ask the patient questions about current and past drinking habits to distinguish moderate from heavy, or hazardous, drinking. Screening tests for alcohol problems in older people should account for possible medical problems or medications that might place them at higher risk for hazardous drinking than younger individuals.\nA number of short screening tests are available, which a person can even take on their own. Because people with alcoholism often deny their problem or otherwise attempt to hide it, the tests are designed to elicit answers related to problems associated with drinking rather than the amount of liquor consumed or other specific drinking habits.\nCAGE Test. The CAGE test is an acronym for the following questions and is the quickest test:\nAttempts to CUT (C) down on drinking\nANNOYANCE (A) with criticisms about drinking\nGUILT (G) about drinking\nUse of alcohol as an EYE-OPENER (E) in the morning\nThis test and another called the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST) appear to be most useful in detecting possible alcoholism in white, middle-aged males.\nT-ACE Test. The T-ACE test is a four-question test that asks the following questions:\nDoes it TAKE (T) more than three drinks to make you feel high?\nHave you ever been ANNOYED (A) by people's criticism of your drinking?\nAre you trying to CUT DOWN (C) on drinking?\nHave you ever used alcohol as an EYE OPENER (E) in the morning?\nA positive response to two of these four questions is considered to indicate possible alcohol abuse or dependence.\nAUDIT Test. A more effective and important test for most people may be the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which is the only test specifically designed to identify hazardous or harmful drinking. It asks three questions about amount and frequency of drinking, three questions about alcohol dependence, and four questions about problems related to alcohol consumption.\nA Single-Question. One simple question may be as sensitive as the CAGE or AUDIT: \"When was the last time you had more than five drinks (for men) or four drinks (for women) in one day?\" An answer of \"within 3 months\" accurately identified about half of people who were problem drinkers. Problem drinking is defined as hazardous drinking within the last month or some alcohol-use disorder during the past year.\nOther Screening Tests. Other short screening tests are the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS).\nRuling out Other Problems\nSome symptoms of alcoholism may be attributed to other disorders, particularly in the elderly, where symptoms of confusion, memory loss, or falling may be attributed to the aging process alone. Heavy drinkers may be more likely to complain to their doctors about so-called somatization symptoms, which are vague ailments, such as joint pain, intestinal problems, or general weakness, that have no identifiable physical cause. Such complaints should signal the doctor to follow-up with screening tests for alcoholism.\nAlcoholism is particularly difficult to detect in elderly women. In fact, only 1% of older women who need treatment for alcoholism are diagnosed accurately and treated appropriately. Instead, they are often diagnosed with depression and may even be prescribed anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants that can have dangerous interactions with alcohol.\nTests for Related Medical Problems\nPhysical Examination. A physical examination and other tests should be performed to uncover any related medical problems.\nLaboratory Tests. Tests for alcohol levels in the blood are not useful for diagnosing alcoholism because they reflect consumption at only one point in time and not long-term usage. Certain blood tests, however, may provide biologic markers that suggest medical problems associated with alcoholism or indications of alcohol abuse:\nCarbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT). This compound is a marker for heavy drinking and can be helpful in monitoring patients for progress towards abstinence.\nGamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). This liver enzyme is very sensitive to alcohol and can be elevated after moderate alcohol intake and in chronic alcoholism.\nAspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransaminases (ALT). These are liver enzymes and are markers for liver damage.\nTestosterone. Male hormone levels in men with alcoholism may be low. (Such results sometimes persuade men with alcoholism to seek help.)\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV). This blood test measures the size of red blood cells, which increase in alcoholics with vitamin deficiencies.\nBack to Top\nTreatment for Alcoholism\nOnce a diagnosis of alcoholism is made, the next major step is getting the patient to seek treatment. The main reasons alcoholics do not seek treatment are:\nLack of confidence in successful therapies\nDenial of their own alcoholism\nSocial stigma attached to the condition and its treatment\nThe alcoholic patient and everyone involved should fully understand that alcoholism is a disease. Furthermore, the responses to this disease (need, craving, fear of withdrawal) are not character flaws but symptoms, just as pain or discomfort are symptoms of other illnesses. They should also realize that treatment is difficult and sometimes painful, just as are treatments for other life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, but that treatment is the only hope for a cure.\nInterventions by family members, employers, and therapists can be very effective in motivating a person to quit and in reducing drinking over the short term. Even brief interventions from a primary care doctor and self-help information can be helpful in reducing harmful drinking. Studies report, however, that only regular follow-up and reinforcement will sustain quit rates and possibly even improve survival rates.\nPersonal Intervention Meetings. The best approaches for motivating a patient to seek treatment are interventional group meetings between people with alcoholism and their friends and family members who have been affected by the alcoholic behavior. Using this approach, each person affected offers a compassionate but direct and honest report describing specifically how they have been hurt by their loved one's alcoholism. The family and friends should express their affection for the patient and their intentions for supporting the patient through recovery, but they must strongly and consistently demand that the patient seek treatment. Children may even be involved in this process, depending on their level of maturity and ability to handle the situation.\nEmployer Intervention. Employers can be particularly effective. Their approach should also be compassionate but strong, threatening the employee with loss of employment if they do not seek help. Some large companies provide access to inexpensive or free treatment programs for their workers. Studies suggest that such interventions are effective at helping the worker at least to cut back on drinking.\nOverall Treatment Goals\nThe ideal goals of long-term treatment by many doctors and organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) are total abstinence. Patients who secure total abstinence have better survival rates, mental health, and marriages, and they are more responsible parents and employees than those who continue to drink or relapse. To achieve this, the patient aims to avoid high-risk situations and replace the addictive patterns with satisfying, time-filling behaviors.\nBecause abstinence is so difficult to attain, however, many professionals choose to treat alcoholism as a chronic disease. In other words, patients should expect and accept relapse but should aim for as long a remission period as possible. Even merely reducing alcohol intake can lower the risk for alcohol-related medical problems.\nAA and other alcoholic treatment groups are greatly worried by treatment approaches that do not aim for strict abstinence, however. Many people with alcoholism are eager for any excuse to start drinking again. There is also no way to determine which people can stop after one drink and which ones cannot.\nEvidence strongly suggests that seeking total abstinence and avoiding high-risk situations are the optimal goal for people with alcoholism.\nInpatient Versus Outpatient Treatment\nA number of treatment options now exist for alcoholism. It is first important to determine whether inpatient or outpatient care would best benefit the individual. A variety of treatment options exist that do not require overnight stay in a hospital. Structured programs exist that involve anywhere from a couple of hours a day for several days a week to 20 or more hours per week (sometimes called partial hospitalization) of monitoring. Withdrawal and subsequent abstinence monitoring using outpatient visits to a doctor is occasionally tried for select, low-risk patients.\nInpatient care may also be performed in a general or psychiatric hospital or in a center dedicated to treatment of alcohol and other substance abuse. Factors that indicate a need for this type of treatment include:\nCoexisting medical or psychiatric disorder\nDelirium tremens\nPotential harm to selves or others\nFailure to respond to conservative treatments\nDisruptive home environment\nA typical inpatient regimen may include the following stages:\nA physical and psychiatric work-up for any physical or mental disorders\nDetoxification -- this phase involves initiating abstinence, managing withdrawal symptoms and complications, and ensuring that the patient remains in treatment\nOn-going treatment with medications in some cases\nPsychotherapy, usually cognitive behavioral therapy\nAn introduction to AA\nSome -- but not all -- studies have reported better success rates with inpatient treatment of patients with alcoholism. However, newer studies strongly suggest that alcoholism can be effectively treated in outpatient settings.\nThe new approach to outpatient treatment uses 'medical management' -- a disease management approach that is used for chronic illnesses such as diabetes. With medical management, patients receive regular 20-minute sessions with a health care provider. The provider monitors the patient's medical condition, medication, and alcohol consumption.\nA medical management approach generally involves one or both of the following:\nDrug treatment with naltrexone (ReVia, Vivitrol)\nBehavioral counseling with a therapy technique called combined behavioral intervention (CBI)\nOutpatient Treatment Options. People with mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms are usually treated as outpatients. Treatments are similar to those in inpatient situations and include:\nPsychotherapy or counseling\nMedications that target brain chemicals involved in addiction\nSocial support groups such as AA\nCognitive therapies\nQuitting smoking (smoking interferes with the brain's recovery from alcoholism)\nInvolvement of family and other significant people in patient's life\nAfter-Care and Work Therapy. After-care employs services that help alcoholics maintain sobriety. For example, in some cities, sober-living houses provide residences for people who are trying to stay sober. They do not offer formal treatment services, but the people living there offer each other support and maintain an abstinent environment.\nFactors That Predict Success or Failure after Treatment\nAbout 25% of people are continuously abstinent following treatment, and another 10% use alcohol moderately and without problems. Relapse is common and intensive and prolonged treatment is important for successful recovery, whether the patient is treated within or outside a treatment center.\nCertain factors play a role in success or failure. Patients from low-income groups tend to have worse results in general. Their difficulties are often intensified by lack of insurance, low self-esteem, and minimal social support.\nTreating People Who Have Both Alcoholism and Health Problems\nSevere alcoholism is often complicated by the presence of serious medical illnesses. People with alcoholism should try at least to maintain a healthy diet and take vitamin supplements. Such deficiencies are a major cause of health problems in people with alcoholism. Women are particularly endangered.\nA program called integrated outpatient treatment (IOT) may be specifically helpful for medically ill alcoholics. The patient visits a clinic once a month and receives both intensive alcohol treatment and a physical check-up, which includes tracking factors, such as liver function, that are affected by drinking.\nTreating People Who Have Both Alcoholism and Mental Illness\nTreatment for patients with both alcoholism and mental illness is particularly difficult. The greater the psychiatric distress a person is experiencing, the more the person is tempted to drink, particularly in negative situations.\nThere has been some concern that self-help programs, such as AA, are not effective for patients with dual diagnoses of mental illness and alcoholism, because the focus of the organization is on addiction, not psychiatric problems. Studies, however, have reported that they are also effective in many of these patients. (AA may not be as helpful for people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.)\nNewer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are proving to be very useful complements to AA or counseling sessions. Anti-anxiety medications are also available for people with anxiety. People with alcoholism and more severe problems such as schizophrenia or severe bipolar disorder may require other types of medications.\nBack to Top\nTreatment for Alcohol Withdrawal\nWhen a person with alcoholism stops drinking, withdrawal symptoms begin within 6 - 48 hours and peak about 24 - 35 hours after the last drink. During this period, the inhibition of brain activity caused by alcohol is abruptly reversed. Stress hormones are overproduced, and the central nervous system becomes overexcited. Common symptoms include:\nAnxiety\n"}, {"score": 470.37103, "uuid": "ac423038-f540-5f6e-99bb-a6d899f08d50", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1402wb-47-07117", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/698115f059259110VgnVCM1000005220720a____", "page_rank": 1.1888124e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Alcoholism Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "It increases the risk for ulcers, particularly <em>in</em> people taking the painkillers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as <em>aspirin</em> <em>or</em> <em>ibuprofen</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Complications of Alcoholism\nChronic alcoholism causes many severe health problems. These include:\nLiver Disorders. The liver is particularly endangered by alcoholism. Between 10 - 20% of people who drink heavily (five or more drinks a day) develop cirrhosis, a progressive and irreversible scarring of the liver that can eventually be fatal.\nGastrointestinal Problems. Alcoholism increases the risk for inflammation of the esophagus ('food pipe'), and stomach ulcers. It can also lead to swollen veins (varices) in the esophagus. Violent vomiting can produce tears in the junction between the stomach and esophagus. Alcoholism can also cause serious acute and chronic inflammation of the pancreas.\nHeart Disease. Excessive drinking has many negative effects on heart health. Alcohol is a toxin that damages the heart muscle. In fact, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for alcoholics. Alcohol abuse increases levels of triglycerides (unhealthy fats) and increases the risks for high blood pressure, heart failure, and stroke.\nCancer. Alcoholism increases the risk for mouth, throat, esophageal, gastrointestinal, liver, colorectal, and breast cancers.\nNeurological Problems. Chronic alcohol abuse can impair so-called \"executive functions,\" which include problem solving, mental flexibility, memory, and attention. Vitamin B12 deficiencies can lead to peripheral neuropathy and other nerve damage.\nDiabetes. Heavy drinking is associated with obesity, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. In addition, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia, a drop in blood sugar.\nSkin, Muscle, and Bone Disorders. Severe alcoholism is associated with osteoporosis (loss of bone density), muscular deterioration, skin sores, and itching.\nReproductive Problems. Alcoholism can contribute to erectile dysfunction in men and infertility in women. Even moderate amounts of alcohol can have damaging effects on a developing fetus.\nLung Problems. Patients who abuse alcoholism have a greater risk for developing severe pneumonia.\nBack to Top\nIntroduction\nAlcoholism is a chronic, progressive, and often fatal disease. It is a primary disorder and not a symptom of other diseases or emotional problems. The chemistry of alcohol allows it to affect nearly every type of cell in the body, including those in the central nervous system. After prolonged exposure to alcohol, the brain becomes dependent on it. The severity of this disease is influenced by factors such as genetics, psychology, culture, and response to physical pain.\nAlcoholism, alcohol dependence, and alcohol abuse are associated with the following:\nThe only indication of early alcoholism may be the unpleasant physical responses to withdrawal that occur during even brief periods of abstinence.\nAlcoholics have little or no control over the quantity they drink or the duration or frequency of their drinking.\nAlcoholics are preoccupied with drinking, deny their own addiction, and continue to drink even though they are aware of the dangers.\nOver time, some alcoholics become tolerant to the effects of drinking and require more alcohol to become intoxicated, creating the illusion that they can \"hold their liquor.\"\nAlcoholics may have blackouts after drinking and have frequent hangovers that cause them to miss work and other normal activities.\nAlcoholics might drink alone and start their drinking early in the day.\nAlcoholics periodically quit drinking or switch from hard liquor to beer or wine, but these periods rarely last.\nSevere alcoholics often have a history of accidents, marital and work instability, and alcohol-related health problems.\nEpisodic violent and abusive incidents involving spouses and children and a history of unexplained or frequent accidents are often signs of drug or alcohol abuse.\nAlcoholism can develop insidiously, and often there is no clear line between problem drinking and alcoholism. Eventually alcohol dominates thinking, emotions, and actions and becomes the primary means through which a person can deal with people, work, and life.\nDefinition of Alcohol Use and Abuse\nIn addition to alcohol dependence, alcohol use is defined by levels of harm that it may be causing. This information is useful to determine possible interventions at earlier stages. The following categories of alcohol use and abuse use a definition of one drink as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces (a jigger) of 90-proof liquor.\nModerate Drinking. Moderate drinking, particularly red wine, appears to offer health benefits. Moderate drinking is defined as equal to or less than two drinks a day for men and one drink a day for women.\nHazardous (Heavy) Drinking. Hazardous drinking puts people at risk for adverse health events. People who are heavy drinkers consume:\nMore than 14 drinks per week, or four to five drinks at one sitting, for men\nMore than seven drinks per week, or three drinks at one sitting, for women\nFrequent intoxication\nHarmful Drinking. Drinking is considered harmful when alcohol consumption has actually caused physical or psychological harm. This is determined by:\nClear evidence that alcohol is responsible for such harm.\nThe nature of that harm can be identified.\nAlcohol consumption has persisted for at least a month or has occurred repeatedly for the past year.\nCertain people are at much higher risk for harmful drinking, such as older individuals with high blood pressure or those taking medications for arthritis or pain.\nAlcohol Abuse. People with alcohol abuse have one or more of the following alcohol-related problems over a period of 1 year:\nFailure to fulfill work or personal obligations\nRecurrent use in potentially dangerous situations\nProblems with the law\nContinued use in spite of harm being done to social or personal relationships\nAlcohol Dependence. People who are alcohol dependent have three or more of the following alcohol-related problems over a year:\nIncreased amounts of alcohol are needed to produce an effect\nWithdrawal symptoms or drinking alcohol is used to avoid these symptoms\nDrinks more over a given period than intended\nUnsuccessful attempts to quit or cut down\nGives up significant leisure or work activities\nContinues to drink in spite of the knowledge of its physical or psychological harm to oneself or others\nTwo-thirds of those with alcohol dependence continued to be dependent on alcohol after 5 years.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nAbout 90% of adults in the U.S. drink alcohol. Every day, more than 700,000 Americans are being treated for alcoholism. In addition, up to half of American men have problems that are caused by alcohol.\nCategories of Alcoholic Types\nSome researchers have categorized people with alcoholism as Type 1 or Type 2.\nType 1 individuals are more often women. They typically become alcoholic at a later age, have less severe symptoms or fewer psychiatric problems, and have a better outlook on life than those classified as type 2.\nType 2 people are more likely to be male. They tend to become alcoholic at an early age and have a high family risk for alcoholism, more severe symptoms, and a negative outlook on life.\nNot only do these two groups tend to respond differently to psychotherapeutic approaches, but they may also respond differently to medications.\nAge\nDrinking in Adolescence. About half of under-age Americans have used alcohol. About 2 million people ages 12 - 20 are considered heavy drinkers, and 4.4 million are binge drinkers. Anyone who begins drinking in adolescence is at risk for developing alcoholism. The earlier a person begins drinking, the greater the risk. A survey of over 40,000 adults indicated that among those who began drinking before age 14, nearly half had become alcoholic dependent by the age of 21. In contrast, only 9% of people who began drinking after the age of 21 developed alcoholism.\nYoung people at highest risk for early drinking are those with a history of abuse, family violence, depression, and stressful life events. People with a family history of alcoholism are also more likely to begin drinking before the age of 20 and to become alcoholic. Such adolescent drinkers are also more apt to underestimate the effects of drinking and to make judgment errors, such as going on binges or driving after drinking, than young drinkers without a family history of alcoholism.\nDrinking in the Elderly Population. Although alcoholism usually develops in early adulthood, the elderly are not exempt. In fact, doctors may overlook alcoholism when evaluating elderly patients, mistakenly attributing the signs of alcohol abuse to the normal effects of the aging process.\nAlcohol also affects the older body differently. People who maintain the same drinking patterns as they age can easily develop alcohol dependency without realizing it. It takes fewer drinks to become intoxicated, and older organs can be damaged by smaller amounts of alcohol than those of younger people. Also, up to one-half of the 100 most prescribed drugs for older people react adversely with alcohol. Medications used for arthritis or pain pose a particular danger for interaction with alcohol.\nGender\nMost alcoholics are men, but the incidence of alcoholism in women has been increasing over the past 30 years. Studies indicate that about 7% of men and 2.5% of women abuse alcohol. However, studies suggest that women are more vulnerable than men to many of the long-term consequences of alcoholism. For example, women are more likely than men to develop alcoholic hepatitis and to die from cirrhosis, and women are more vulnerable to the brain cell damage caused by alcohol.\nHistory of Abuse\nIndividuals who were abused as children have a higher risk for substance abuse later on. In one study, 72% of women and 27% of men with substance abuse disorders reported physical or sexual abuse or both. They also had worse response to treatment than those without such a history.\nEthnicity\nOverall, there is no difference in alcoholic prevalence among African-Americans, Caucasians, and Hispanic-Americans. Some population groups, however, such as Native Americans, have an increased incidence of alcoholism while others, such as Jewish and Asian Americans, have a lower risk. Although the biological or cultural causes of such different risks are not known, certain people in these population groups may have a genetic susceptibility or invulnerability to alcoholism because of the way they metabolize alcohol.\nPsychiatric and Behavioral Disorders\nPsychiatric Disorders. Severely depressed or anxious people are at high risk for alcoholism, smoking, and other forms of addiction. Likewise, a large proportion of alcohol-dependent people suffer from an accompanying psychiatric or substance abuse disorder. Either anxiety or depression may increase the risk for self-medication with alcohol. Depression is the most common psychiatric problem in people with alcoholism or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is very common in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\nSpecific anxiety disorders, such as panic disorders and social phobia, may pose particular risks for alcohol and substance abuse. Social phobia causes an intense fear of being publicly scrutinized and humiliated. Panic disorders cause intense anxiety and panic attacks. People with these disorders may use alcohol as a way to become less inhibited in public situations or to calm feelings of panic. While anxiety disorders are found in about 15% of adults overall, over 50% of people with alcohol abuse problems suffer from these conditions. People who have anxiety disorders are more likely to resume drinking after treatment for alcohol dependence. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #28: Anxiety .]\nLong-term alcoholism itself may cause chemical changes that produce anxiety and depression. In fact, a study on elderly people with depression reported that when even moderate drinkers reduced consumption, their mood improved. Studies also indicate that alcohol use may promote panic attacks. It is not always clear, then, whether people with emotional disorders are self-medicating with alcohol, or whether alcohol itself is producing mood swings.\nBehavioral Disorders and Lack of Impulse Control. Studies are also finding that alcoholism is strongly related to impulsive, excitable, and novelty-seeking behavior, and such patterns are established early on. Children who later become alcoholics or who abuse drugs are more likely to have less fear of new situations than others, even if there is a greater risk for harm than in nonalcoholics. Specifically, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition that shares these behaviors, have a higher risk for alcoholism in adulthood. The risk is especially high in children with ADHD and conduct disorder.\nSocioeconomic Factors\nBack to Top\nComplications\nAlcoholism reduces life expectancy by 10 - 12 years. Although studies indicate that adults who drink moderately (about one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men) have a lower mortality rate than their nondrinking peers, their risk for untimely death increases with heavier drinking. The earlier a person begins drinking heavily, the greater their chance of developing serious illnesses later on. Once one becomes dependent on alcohol, it is very difficult to quit.\nAlcoholism and Early Death\nAlcohol can affect the body in so many ways that researchers have a hard time determining exactly what the consequences are from drinking. Heavy drinking is associated with earlier death. However, it is not just from a higher risk of the more common serious health problems, such as heart attack, heart failure, diabetes, lung disease, or stroke. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to many problems that can increase the risk for death:\nPeople who drink regularly have a higher rate of death from injury or violence.\nAlcohol overdose can lead to death. This is a particular danger for adolescents who may want to impress their friends with their ability to drink alcohol but cannot yet gauge its effects. However, alcohol overdose doesn't only occur from any one heavy drinking incident, but may also occur from a constant infusion of alcohol in the bloodstream.\nSevere withdrawal and delirium tremens. Delirium tremens occurs in about 5% of alcoholics. It includes progressively severe withdrawal symptoms and altered mental states. In some cases, it can be fatal.\nFrequent, heavy alcohol use directly harms many areas in the body and produce dangerous health conditions (liver damage, pancreatitis, anemia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, nerve damage, and impotence).\nAlcohol abusers who need surgery have an increased risk of postoperative complications, including infections, bleeding, insufficient heart and lung functions, and problems with wound healing. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms after surgery may impose further stress on the patient and hinder recuperation.\nThe Effects of Hangover\nAlthough not traditionally thought of as a medical problem, hangovers have significant consequences that include changes in liver function, hormonal balance, and mental functioning and an increased risk for depression and cardiac events. Hangovers can impair job performance, increasing the risk for mistakes and accidents. Interestingly, hangovers are generally more common in light-to-moderate drinkers than heavy and chronic drinkers, suggesting that binge drinking can be as threatening as chronic drinking. Any man who drinks more than five drinks or any woman who has more than three drinks is at risk for a hangover.\nAccidents, Suicide, and Murder\nAlcohol plays a large role in accidents, suicide, and crime:\nAlcohol plays a major role in more than half of all automobile fatalities.\nAlcohol-related automobile accidents are the leading causes of death in young people.\nFewer than two drinks can impair the ability to drive. Even one drink may double the risk of injury, and more than four drinks increases the risk by 11 times.\nAlcoholism is the primary diagnosis in one-quarter of all people who commit suicide.\nAlcohol is implicated in over half of all murders.\nDomestic Violence\nAlcoholic households are less cohesive and have more conflicts, and their members are less independent and expressive than households with nonalcoholic or recovering alcoholic parents. Domestic violence is a common consequence of alcohol abuse.\nEffect on Women. A serious risk factor for injury from domestic violence may be a history of alcohol abuse in her male partner.\nEffect on Children. Alcoholism in parents also increases the risk for violent behavior and abuse toward their children. Children of alcoholics tend to do worse academically than others, have a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, and stress and lower self-esteem than their peers. In addition to their own inherited risk for later alcoholism, many children of alcoholics have serious coping problems that may last their entire life.\nAdult children of alcoholic parents are at higher risk for divorce and for psychiatric symptoms. One study concluded that the only events with greater psychological impact on children are sexual and physical abuse.\nIncreased Risk for Other Addictions\nResearchers are finding common genetic factors in alcohol and nicotine addiction, which may explain, in part, why alcoholics are often smokers. Alcoholics who smoke compound their health problems. More alcoholics die from tobacco-related illnesses, such as heart disease or cancer, than from chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or other conditions that are more directly tied to excessive drinking. Abuse of other substance is also common among alcoholics.\nLiver Disorders\nAlcoholic Hepatitis and Cirrhosis. Alcohol is absorbed in the small intestine and passes directly into the liver, where it becomes the preferred energy source. The liver, then, is particularly endangered by alcoholism. In the liver, alcohol converts to toxic chemicals, notably acetaldehyde, which trigger the production of immune factors called cytokines. In large amounts, these factors cause inflammation and tissue injury.\nEven moderate alcohol intake can produce pain in the upper right quarter of the abdomen -- a possible symptom of liver involvement. In many cases, such symptoms may be an indication of fatty liver or alcohol hepatitis, which are reversible liver conditions.\nBetween 10 - 20% of people who drink heavily (five or more drinks a day) develop cirrhosis, a progressive and irreversible scarring of the liver that can eventually be fatal. Alcoholic cirrhosis (also sometimes referred to as portal, Laennec's, nutritional, or micronodular cirrhosis) is the primary cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #75: Cirrhosis .]\nNot eating when drinking and consuming a variety of alcoholic beverages increase the risk for liver damage. Nevertheless, the amount of alcohol consumed and the patterns of drinking are only weak predictions of risk. Up to 90% of heavy drinkers do not develop advanced irreversible liver disease. Other risk factors have been identified that may increase the danger to the liver in heavy drinkers:\nObesity is a major factor for all stages of liver disease.\nWomen develop liver disease at lower quantities of alcohol intake than men.\nGenetic factors that regulate the immune responses also play role.\nHepatitis B and C. People with alcoholism tend to have lifestyles that put them at higher risk for hepatitis B and C, which are caused by viruses. Chronic forms of viral hepatitis pose risks for cirrhosis and liver cancer, and alcoholism significantly increases these risks. People with alcoholism should be immunized against hepatitis B. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. [For more information, see In-Depth Report #59: Hepatitis .]\nGastrointestinal Problems\nAlcoholism can cause many problems in the gastrointestinal tract. Violent vomiting can produce tears in the junction between the stomach and esophagus. It increases the risk for ulcers, particularly in people taking the painkillers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. It can also lead to swollen veins in the esophagus, called varices, which can lead to inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) and to bleeding.\nClick the icon to see an image of ulcer emergencies.\nAlcohol can contribute to serious acute and chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in people who are susceptible to this condition. There is some evidence of a higher risk for pancreatic cancer in people with alcoholism, although this higher risk may occur only in people who are also smokers.\nClick the icon to see an image of the pancreas.\nEffect on Heart Disease and Stroke\nModerate amounts (one to two drinks a day) of alcohol can improve some heart disease risk factors, such as increasing HDL ('good cholesterol') levels. However, at this time there is no definitive proof that moderate drinking improves overall health, and the American Heart Association does not recommend drinking alcoholic beverages solely to reduce cardiovascular risk.\nExcessive drinking clearly has negative effects on heart health. Alcohol is a toxin that damages the heart muscle. In fact, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for alcoholics. Alcohol abuse increases levels of triglycerides (unhealthy fats) and increases the risks for high blood pressure, heart failure, and stroke. In addition, the extra calories in alcohol can contribute to obesity, a major risk factor for many heart problems.\nClick the icon to see an image of the heart.\nCancer\nAlcohol abuse and dependence may increase the risk for certain type of cancers. In particular, heavy alcohol use appears to increase the risks for mouth, throat, esophageal, gastrointestinal, liver, and colorectal, cancers. Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. Although the additional risk is small, women who are at high risk for breast cancer should consider not drinking at all.\nEffects on the Lungs\nPneumonia. Over time, chronic alcoholism can cause severe reductions in white blood cells, which increase the risk for community-acquired pneumonia (pneumonia acquired outside of hospitals or nursing homes). When patients are inebriated they are also at risk for aspiration of mucus from the airways, causing pneumonia. Patients who abuse alcoholism have a greater risk for developing severe pneumonia. Doctors recommend that patients with alcohol dependence should receive an annual pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination. The initial signs of pneumococcal pneumonia are high fever, cough, and stabbing chest pains. Immediately contact your doctor if you experience these symptoms.\nClick the icon to see an image of pneumonia.\nSkin, Muscle, and Bone Disorders\nSevere alcoholism is associated with osteoporosis (loss of bone density), muscular deterioration, skin sores, and itching. Alcohol-dependent women seem to face a higher risk than men for damage to muscles, including muscles of the heart, from the toxic effects of alcohol.\nClick the icon to see an image of osteoporosis.\nEffects on Reproduction and Fetal Development\nSexual Function and Fertility. Alcoholism increases levels of the female hormone estrogen and reduces levels of the male hormone testosterone, factors that possibly contribute to erectile dysfunction and enlarged breasts in men and infertility in women. Such changes may also be responsible for the higher risks for absent periods and abnormal uterine bleeding in women with alcoholism.\nDrinking During Pregnancy and Effects on the Infant. Even moderate amounts of alcohol can have damaging effects on the developing fetus, including low birth weight and an increased risk for miscarriage. High amounts can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition that can cause mental and growth retardation. Although there is no specific amount of alcohol intake, the risk of developing the syndrome is increased depending on the time of alcohol exposure during pregnancy, a pattern of drinking (four or more drinks per occasion), and how often alcohol consumption occurs.\nEffect on Weight and Diabetes\nModerate alcohol consumption may help protect the hearts of adults with type 2 diabetes. Heavy drinking, however, is associated with obesity, which is a risk factor for this form of diabetes. In addition, alcohol can cause hypoglycemia, a drop in blood sugar, which is especially dangerous for people with diabetes who are taking insulin. Intoxicated diabetics may not be able to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia, a potentially hazardous condition.\nEffect on Central and Peripheral Nervous System and Mental Functioning\nDrinking too much alcohol can cause immediate mild neurologic problems in anyone, including insomnia and headache. Long-term alcohol use may even physically affect the brain. Depending on length and severity of alcohol abuse, neurologic damage may not be permanent, and abstinence nearly always leads to eventual recovery of normal mental function.\nEffect on Mental Functioning. Recent high alcohol use (within the last 3 months) is associated with some loss of verbal memory and slower reaction times. Over time, chronic alcohol abuse can impair so-called \"executive functions,\" which include problem solving, mental flexibility, short-term memory, and attention. These problems are usually mild to moderate and can last for weeks or even years after a person quits drinking. In fact, such persistent problems in judgment are possibly one reason for the difficulty in quitting. Alcoholic patients who have co-existing psychiatric or neurologic problems are at particular risk for mental confusion and depression.\nClick the icon to see an image of the nervous system.\nVitamin and Mineral Deficiencies\nPeople with alcoholism should be sure to take vitamin and mineral supplements. Even apparently well-nourished people with alcoholism may be deficient in important nutrients. Deficiencies in vitamin B are particular health risks in people with alcoholism. Other vitamin and mineral deficiencies, however, can also cause widespread health problems.\nFolate Deficiencies. Alcohol interferes with the metabolism of folate, a very important B vitamin, called folic acid when used as a supplement. Folate deficiencies can cause severe anemia. Deficiencies during pregnancy can lead to birth defects in the infant.\nWernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a serious consequence of severe thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency in alcoholism. Symptoms of this syndrome include severe loss of balance, confusion, and memory loss. Eventually, it can result in permanent brain damage and death. Once the syndrome develops, oral supplements have no effect, and only adequate and rapid intravenous vitamin B1 can treat this serious condition.\nPeripheral Neuropathy. Vitamin B12 deficiencies can also lead to peripheral neuropathy, a condition that causes pain, tingling, and other abnormal sensations in the arms and legs.\nDrug Interactions\nThe effects of many medications are strengthened by alcohol, while others are inhibited. Of particular importance is alcohol's reinforcing effect on anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications.\nAlcohol also interacts with many drugs used by people with diabetes. It interferes with drugs that prevent seizures or blood clotting. It increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in people taking aspirin or other nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ibuprofen and naproxen.\nChronic alcohol abusers have a particularly high risk for adverse side effects from consuming alcohol while taking certain antibiotics. These side effects include flushing, headache, nausea, and vomiting. In other words, taking almost any medication should preclude drinking alcohol.\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nEven when people with alcoholism experience withdrawal symptoms, they nearly always deny the problem, leaving it up to co-workers, friends, or relatives to recognize the symptoms and to take the first steps toward encouraging treatment. Denial, in fact, may be an important warning signal for alcoholism.\nFamily members cannot always rely on a doctor to make an initial diagnosis. Although 15 - 30% of people who are hospitalized have alcoholism or alcohol dependence, doctors often fail to screen for the problem. In addition, doctors themselves often do not recognize the symptoms. Even when doctors identify an alcohol problem, however, they are frequently reluctant to confront the patient with a diagnosis that might lead to treatment for addiction.\nScreening Tests for Alcoholism\nA doctor who suspects alcohol abuse should ask the patient questions about current and past drinking habits to distinguish moderate from heavy, or hazardous, drinking. Screening tests for alcohol problems in older people should account for possible medical problems or medications that might place them at higher risk for hazardous drinking than younger individuals.\nA number of short screening tests are available, which a person can even take on their own. Because people with alcoholism often deny their problem or otherwise attempt to hide it, the tests are designed to elicit answers related to problems associated with drinking rather than the amount of liquor consumed or other specific drinking habits.\nCAGE Test. The CAGE test is an acronym for the following questions and is the quickest test:\nAttempts to CUT (C) down on drinking\nANNOYANCE (A) with criticisms about drinking\nGUILT (G) about drinking\nUse of alcohol as an EYE-OPENER (E) in the morning\nThis test and another called the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST) appear to be most useful in detecting possible alcoholism in white, middle-aged males.\nT-ACE Test. The T-ACE test is a four-question test that asks the following questions:\nDoes it TAKE (T) more than three drinks to make you feel high?\nHave you ever been ANNOYED (A) by people's criticism of your drinking?\nAre you trying to CUT DOWN (C) on drinking?\nHave you ever used alcohol as an EYE OPENER (E) in the morning?\nA positive response to two of these four questions is considered to indicate possible alcohol abuse or dependence.\nAUDIT Test. A more effective and important test for most people may be the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which is the only test specifically designed to identify hazardous or harmful drinking. It asks three questions about amount and frequency of drinking, three questions about alcohol dependence, and four questions about problems related to alcohol consumption.\nA Single-Question. One simple question may be as sensitive as the CAGE or AUDIT: \"When was the last time you had more than five drinks (for men) or four drinks (for women) in one day?\" An answer of \"within 3 months\" accurately identified about half of people who were problem drinkers. Problem drinking is defined as hazardous drinking within the last month or some alcohol-use disorder during the past year.\nOther Screening Tests. Other short screening tests are the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS).\nRuling out Other Problems\nSome symptoms of alcoholism may be attributed to other disorders, particularly in the elderly, where symptoms of confusion, memory loss, or falling may be attributed to the aging process alone. Heavy drinkers may be more likely to complain to their doctors about so-called somatization symptoms, which are vague ailments, such as joint pain, intestinal problems, or general weakness, that have no identifiable physical cause. Such complaints should signal the doctor to follow-up with screening tests for alcoholism.\nAlcoholism is particularly difficult to detect in elderly women. In fact, only 1% of older women who need treatment for alcoholism are diagnosed accurately and treated appropriately. Instead, they are often diagnosed with depression and may even be prescribed anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants that can have dangerous interactions with alcohol.\nTests for Related Medical Problems\nPhysical Examination. A physical examination and other tests should be performed to uncover any related medical problems.\nLaboratory Tests. Tests for alcohol levels in the blood are not useful for diagnosing alcoholism because they reflect consumption at only one point in time and not long-term usage. Certain blood tests, however, may provide biologic markers that suggest medical problems associated with alcoholism or indications of alcohol abuse:\nCarbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT). This compound is a marker for heavy drinking and can be helpful in monitoring patients for progress towards abstinence.\nGamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). This liver enzyme is very sensitive to alcohol and can be elevated after moderate alcohol intake and in chronic alcoholism.\nAspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransaminases (ALT). These are liver enzymes and are markers for liver damage.\nTestosterone. Male hormone levels in men with alcoholism may be low. (Such results sometimes persuade men with alcoholism to seek help.)\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV). This blood test measures the size of red blood cells, which increase in alcoholics with vitamin deficiencies.\nBack to Top\nTreatment for Alcoholism\nOnce a diagnosis of alcoholism is made, the next major step is getting the patient to seek treatment. The main reasons alcoholics do not seek treatment are:\nLack of confidence in successful therapies\nDenial of their own alcoholism\nSocial stigma attached to the condition and its treatment\nThe alcoholic patient and everyone involved should fully understand that alcoholism is a disease. Furthermore, the responses to this disease (need, craving, fear of withdrawal) are not character flaws but symptoms, just as pain or discomfort are symptoms of other illnesses. They should also realize that treatment is difficult and sometimes painful, just as are treatments for other life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, but that treatment is the only hope for a cure.\nInterventions by family members, employers, and therapists can be very effective in motivating a person to quit and in reducing drinking over the short term. Even brief interventions from a primary care doctor and self-help information can be helpful in reducing harmful drinking. Studies report, however, that only regular follow-up and reinforcement will sustain quit rates and possibly even improve survival rates.\nPersonal Intervention Meetings. The best approaches for motivating a patient to seek treatment are interventional group meetings between people with alcoholism and their friends and family members who have been affected by the alcoholic behavior. Using this approach, each person affected offers a compassionate but direct and honest report describing specifically how they have been hurt by their loved one's alcoholism. The family and friends should express their affection for the patient and their intentions for supporting the patient through recovery, but they must strongly and consistently demand that the patient seek treatment. Children may even be involved in this process, depending on their level of maturity and ability to handle the situation.\nEmployer Intervention. Employers can be particularly effective. Their approach should also be compassionate but strong, threatening the employee with loss of employment if they do not seek help. Some large companies provide access to inexpensive or free treatment programs for their workers. Studies suggest that such interventions are effective at helping the worker at least to cut back on drinking.\nOverall Treatment Goals\nThe ideal goals of long-term treatment by many doctors and organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) are total abstinence. Patients who secure total abstinence have better survival rates, mental health, and marriages, and they are more responsible parents and employees than those who continue to drink or relapse. To achieve this, the patient aims to avoid high-risk situations and replace the addictive patterns with satisfying, time-filling behaviors.\nBecause abstinence is so difficult to attain, however, many professionals choose to treat alcoholism as a chronic disease. In other words, patients should expect and accept relapse but should aim for as long a remission period as possible. Even merely reducing alcohol intake can lower the risk for alcohol-related medical problems.\nAA and other alcoholic treatment groups are greatly worried by treatment approaches that do not aim for strict abstinence, however. Many people with alcoholism are eager for any excuse to start drinking again. There is also no way to determine which people can stop after one drink and which ones cannot.\nEvidence strongly suggests that seeking total abstinence and avoiding high-risk situations are the optimal goal for people with alcoholism.\nInpatient Versus Outpatient Treatment\nA number of treatment options now exist for alcoholism. It is first important to determine whether inpatient or outpatient care would best benefit the individual. A variety of treatment options exist that do not require overnight stay in a hospital. Structured programs exist that involve anywhere from a couple of hours a day for several days a week to 20 or more hours per week (sometimes called partial hospitalization) of monitoring. Withdrawal and subsequent abstinence monitoring using outpatient visits to a doctor is occasionally tried for select, low-risk patients.\nInpatient care may also be performed in a general or psychiatric hospital or in a center dedicated to treatment of alcohol and other substance abuse. Factors that indicate a need for this type of treatment include:\nCoexisting medical or psychiatric disorder\nDelirium tremens\nPotential harm to selves or others\nFailure to respond to conservative treatments\nDisruptive home environment\nA typical inpatient regimen may include the following stages:\nA physical and psychiatric work-up for any physical or mental disorders\nDetoxification -- this phase involves initiating abstinence, managing withdrawal symptoms and complications, and ensuring that the patient remains in treatment\nOn-going treatment with medications in some cases\nPsychotherapy, usually cognitive behavioral therapy\nAn introduction to AA\nSome -- but not all -- studies have reported better success rates with inpatient treatment of patients with alcoholism. However, newer studies strongly suggest that alcoholism can be effectively treated in outpatient settings.\nThe new approach to outpatient treatment uses 'medical management' -- a disease management approach that is used for chronic illnesses such as diabetes. With medical management, patients receive regular 20-minute sessions with a health care provider. The provider monitors the patient's medical condition, medication, and alcohol consumption.\nA medical management approach generally involves one or both of the following:\nDrug treatment with naltrexone (ReVia, Vivitrol)\nBehavioral counseling with a therapy technique called combined behavioral intervention (CBI)\nOutpatient Treatment Options. People with mild-to-moderate withdrawal symptoms are usually treated as outpatients. Treatments are similar to those in inpatient situations and include:\nPsychotherapy or counseling\nMedications that target brain chemicals involved in addiction\nSocial support groups such as AA\nCognitive therapies\nQuitting smoking (smoking interferes with the brain's recovery from alcoholism)\nInvolvement of family and other significant people in patient's life\nAfter-Care and Work Therapy. After-care employs services that help alcoholics maintain sobriety. For example, in some cities, sober-living houses provide residences for people who are trying to stay sober. They do not offer formal treatment services, but the people living there offer each other support and maintain an abstinent environment.\nFactors That Predict Success or Failure after Treatment\nAbout 25% of people are continuously abstinent following treatment, and another 10% use alcohol moderately and without problems. Relapse is common and intensive and prolonged treatment is important for successful recovery, whether the patient is treated within or outside a treatment center.\nCertain factors play a role in success or failure. Patients from low-income groups tend to have worse results in general. Their difficulties are often intensified by lack of insurance, low self-esteem, and minimal social support.\nTreating People Who Have Both Alcoholism and Health Problems\nSevere alcoholism is often complicated by the presence of serious medical illnesses. People with alcoholism should try at least to maintain a healthy diet and take vitamin supplements. Such deficiencies are a major cause of health problems in people with alcoholism. Women are particularly endangered.\nA program called integrated outpatient treatment (IOT) may be specifically helpful for medically ill alcoholics. The patient visits a clinic once a month and receives both intensive alcohol treatment and a physical check-up, which includes tracking factors, such as liver function, that are affected by drinking.\nTreating People Who Have Both Alcoholism and Mental Illness\nTreatment for patients with both alcoholism and mental illness is particularly difficult. The greater the psychiatric distress a person is experiencing, the more the person is tempted to drink, particularly in negative situations.\nThere has been some concern that self-help programs, such as AA, are not effective for patients with dual diagnoses of mental illness and alcoholism, because the focus of the organization is on addiction, not psychiatric problems. Studies, however, have reported that they are also effective in many of these patients. (AA may not be as helpful for people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.)\nNewer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are proving to be very useful complements to AA or counseling sessions. Anti-anxiety medications are also available for people with anxiety. People with alcoholism and more severe problems such as schizophrenia or severe bipolar disorder may require other types of medications.\nBack to Top\nTreatment for Alcohol Withdrawal\nWhen a person with alcoholism stops drinking, withdrawal symptoms begin within 6 - 48 hours and peak about 24 - 35 hours after the last drink. During this period, the inhibition of brain activity caused by alcohol is abruptly reversed. Stress hormones are overproduced, and the central nervous system becomes overexcited. Common symptoms include:\nAnxiety\n"}, {"score": 480.6448, "uuid": "20e296ee-4be7-5d57-b0f2-53058a24deb6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1014wb-61-21456", "target_hostname": "childrens.advil.com", "target_uri": "http://childrens.advil.com/childrens-advil-suspension", "page_rank": 1.6252907e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "Children's Advil&reg; Suspension | Children's Advil&reg;", "snippet": "This product <em>is</em> intended for use <em>in</em> <em>children</em> ages 2 years - 11 years. * relieves minor aches and pains due to the common cold, flu, sore throat, headaches and toothaches Allergy alert: <em>Ibuprofen</em> may cause a severe allergic reaction, especially <em>in</em> people allergic to <em>aspirin</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "This is the most current labeling information, and may differ from labels on product packaging.

Symptoms may include loss of interest in your usual activities, insomnia or excessive sleeping, a change in weight or appetite, constant fidgeting or a slowdown in movement, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and repeated thoughts of suicide.\nLike the antidepressant medications Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft, Celexa is thought to work by boosting serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin, one of the nervous system's primary chemical messengers, is known to elevate mood.\nOnline Canadian Drugstore is the alternative to costly prescription drugs. We will deliver the medications\u00c2\u00a0to your door at the price they cost in Canada. What is the most important information I should know about citalopram?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You may have an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior at the start of treatment with an antidepressant medication, especially if you are under 18 years old. Talk with your doctor about this risk. While you are taking citalopram you will need to be monitored for worsening symptoms of depression and/ or suicidal thoughts during the first weeks of treatment, or whenever your dose is changed. In addition to you watching for changes in your own symptoms, your family or other caregivers should be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your doctor will need to check you at regular visits for at least the first 12 weeks of treatment.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Contact your doctor promptly if you have any of the following side effects, especially if they are new symptoms or if they get worse: mood changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, irritability, agitation, aggressiveness, severe restlessness, mania (mental and/ or physical hyperactivity), thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Do not take citalopram together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate). You must wait at least 14 days after stopping an MAOI before you can take citalopram. After you stop taking citalopram, you must wait at least 14 days before you start taking an MAOI.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Some antidepressants may cause serious or life-threatening lung problems in newborn babies whose mothers take the medication during pregnancy. However, you may have a relapse of depression if you stop taking your antidepressant during pregnancy. If you are planning a pregnancy, or if you become pregnant while taking citalopram, do not stop taking the medication without first talking to your doctor.\nHow should I take this medicine?\nTake citalopram tablets by mouth. Follow the directions on the prescription label. Swallow the tablets with a drink of water. Citalopram can be taken with or without food. Take your doses at regular intervals. Do not take your medicine more often than directed. Do not stop taking except on your prescriber or health care\nCelexa Oral Side Effects\nNausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, diarrhea, drowsiness, dizziness, trouble sleeping, dry mouth, muscle/joint pain, fatigue, or yawning may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\nRemember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\nTell your doctor immediately if any of these serious side effects occur: changes in sexual ability/desire, increased sweating, persistent nausea/vomiting, uncontrolled movements (tremor), unusual or severe mental/mood changes, weight changes.\nTell your doctor immediately if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur: black stools, change in frequency of menstrual periods, \"coffee-ground\" vomit, confusion, easy bruising/bleeding, fast heartbeats, seizures, vision problems.\nFor males, in the very unlikely event you have a painful or prolonged erection lasting 4 or more hours, stop using this drug and seek immediate medical attention, or permanent problems could occur.\nA serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include: rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing.\nIf you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\nCELEBREX is a prescription medicine for:\nRelief of the joint pain, swelling, and stiffness of osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a type of arthritis caused by wear and tear on bones and joints\nRelief of the joint pain, swelling, and stiffness of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease that attacks healthy joint tissue, starting a process of inflammation and joint damage\nManagement of acute pain in adults (such as pain from strains and sprains) or pain after surgery\nTreatment of primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual cramps)\nRelief of signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, a painful form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis usually strikes young adults. It can cause inflammation, pain and stiffness in the shoulders, knees, hips, ribs and feet\nThe most important fact about this drug\nAlthough Celebrex is easy on the stomach, it still poses some degree of risk--especially if you've had a stomach ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding in the past. If you've ever had such problems, make sure the doctor is aware of it. And be sure to alert the doctor if you develop any digestive problems or black, tarry stools.\nWhat is the most important information you should know about Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Recent information suggests a possible increased risk for heart attack and stroke in patients taking Celebrex. The relevance of this information is still not known. Ask your doctor if Celebrex is right for you.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Do not take Celebrex without first talking to your doctor if you have experienced asthma, hives, or an allergic reaction after taking a sulfa-based medication such as sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra, Gantanol, and others) or sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin); aspirin; or another NSAID such as valdecoxib (Bextra), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, and others), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Anaprox), ketoprofen (Orudis KT, Orudis, Oruvail), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam), diflunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine, Lodine XL), fenoprofen (Nalfon), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), indomethacin (Indocin), ketorolac (Toradol), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), oxaprozin (Daypro), piroxicam (Feldene), sulindac (Clinoril), or tolmetin (Tolectin). You may experience a similar reaction to Celebrex.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Notify your doctor immediately if you develop abdominal pain, tenderness, or discomfort; nausea; bloody vomit; bloody, black, or tarry stools; unexplained weight gain; swelling or water retention; fatigue or lethargy; a skin rash; itching; yellowing of the skin or eyes;\"flu-like\" symptoms; or unusual bruising or bleeding. These symptoms could be early signs of dangerous side effects.\nWhat makes CELEBREX different?\nCELEBREX works to relieve arthritis pain by targeting a certain enzyme in the body. An enzyme is a protein that causes chemical changes in other substances in the body. The enzyme that CELEBREX targets is called COX-2. The COX-2 enzyme plays a key role in causing both pain and inflammation.\nThe body also makes an enzyme called COX-1. This enzyme helps protect the lining of the stomach. Most pain relievers work by blocking the actions of both the COX-1 and COX-2.\nCELEBREX is different because, when taken at suggested doses, it targets the COX-2 enzyme, but not the COX-1. For this reason, doctors refer to CELEBREX as a COX-2\u00e2\u0080\u0093specific inhibitor\nDavid's Canadian Drug Store Inform You\nHow to take this medication?\nFor best results, take Celebrex regularly, exactly as prescribed. You can take it with or without food.\n--If you miss a dose...\nTake it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the one you missed and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.\n--Storage instructions...\nStore at room temperature.\nWhat should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Recent information suggests a possible increased risk for heart attack and stroke in patients taking Celebrex.

This means that it is not known whether it will harm an unborn baby. Celebrex should not be taken late in pregnancy (the third trimester) because it may affect the formation of the baby's heart. Do not take Celebrex without first talking to your doctor if you are pregnant.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 It is not known whether Celebrex passes into breast milk. Do not take Celebrex without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If you are over the age of 65 years, you may be more likely to experience side effects from Celebrex. You may require a lower dosage or special monitoring during your therapy.\nHow CELEBREX Works\nCELEBREX works to relieve arthritis pain by targeting a certain enzyme in the body. An enzyme is a protein that causes chemical changes in other substances in the body. The enzyme that CELEBREX targets is called COX-2. The COX-2 enzyme plays a key role in causing both pain and inflammation.\nThe body also makes an enzyme called COX-1. This enzyme helps protect the lining of the stomach. Most pain relievers work by blocking the actions of both the COX-1 and COX-2.\nCELEBREX is different because, when taken at suggested doses, it targets the COX-2 enzyme, but not the COX-1.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking Celebrex.\nMore common side effects may include:\nAbdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, indigestion, nausea, respiratory infection, sinus inflammation\nLess common side effects may include:\nBack pain, dizziness, gas, insomnia, rash, runny nose, sore throat, swelling\nRare side effects may include:\nAllergic reactions, anxiety, belching, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, blood infections, blurred vision, bone disorders, breast pain, breast problems, bronchitis, cataracts, chest pain, colitis, conjunctivitis (pinkeye), constipation, coughing, cysts, dark-tarry stools, deafness, depression, dermatitis, diabetes, difficult urination, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, drowsiness, dry mouth, dry skin, earache, ear infection, ear ringing, esophageal perforation, eye infection, eye pain, fainting, fatigue, fever, flu symptoms, fungal infection, gallstones, gangrene, general swelling, glaucoma (pressure in the eye), hair loss, heart failure, heart irregularities, hemorrhoids, hepatitis, hernia of the stomach, herpes infection, hives, hot flashes, increased appetite, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased muscle tone, increased urination, infection, inflammation of the digestive tract, inflammation of the bladder, inflammation of the blood vessels, intestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction or perforation, itching, jaundice, joint pain or inflammation, kidney problems, laryngitis, leg cramps, liver problems, loss of appetite, loss of balance, low blood sugar, menstrual disorders, migraine headache, mouth ulcers, muscle ache, nail disorders, neck stiffness, nerve pain, nervousness, nosebleeds, pain, painful urination, pancreatitis, phlebitis, pneumonia, poor coordination, prostate problems, severe diarrhea, severe skin rash and peeling, skin reaction due to sunlight, skin sensitivity, skin tingling, stroke, suicide, sweating, swollen face and throat, taste disturbances, tendonitis, tiredness, tooth disorders, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, vaginal problems, vomiting, weakness, weight gain\nWhat you shouldavoid while taking Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 There are no restrictions on food, beverages, or activity while taking Celebrex unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\nWhat happens if you miss a dose?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed and take only the next regularly scheduled dose as directed. Do not take a double dose of this medication unless your doctor directs otherwise.\n\u00c2 What are the most common side effects of CELEBREX?\nAll medicines have possible side effects. Although CELEBREX is usually well-tolerated, in clinical trials some common side effects were indigestion, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In studies, the percentage of patients who stopped taking CELEBREX due to side effects was similar to the percentage of patients who were taking a placebo (a sugar pill) and stopped because of side effects.\nWhy should this drug not be prescribed?\nDo not take Celebrex if you are allergic to sulfonamide drugs such as sulfadiazine, sulfisoxazole, Gantanol, and Thiosulfil. Also avoid Celebrex if you've ever suffered an asthma attack, face and throat swelling, or skin eruptions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. If you find that you are allergic to Celebrex, you will not be able to use it.\nAre there other side effects?\nCELEBREX may increase the chance of serious heart problems such as heart attacks or strokes which can be fatal. Serious skin reactions or stomach problems such as bleeding can occur without warning and may be fatal. As always, patients should discuss their individual health history with their doctors to understand these risks.\nSpecial warnings about this medication\nRemember to tell your doctor about any stomach ulcers or bleeding you've had in the past. Also alert your doctor if you develop any digestive problems, swelling, or rash.\nIf you have asthma, use Celebrex with caution. It could trigger an attack, especially if you are also sensitive to aspirin.\nIf you are taking a steroid medication for your arthritis, do not discontinue it abruptly when you begin therapy with Celebrex. Celebrex is not a substitute for such drugs.\nCelebrex has been known to cause kidney or liver problems, particularly in people with an existing condition. If you have such a disorder, take Celebrex with caution. If you develop symptoms of liver poisoning, stop taking the drug and see your doctor immediately. Warning signs include nausea, fatigue, itching, yellowish skin, pain in the right side of the stomach, and flu-like symptoms.\nIf you are prone to anemia (loss of red blood cells), make sure the doctor knows about it. Celebrex occasionally fosters this problem.\nCelebrex sometimes causes water retention, which can aggravate swelling, high blood pressure, and heart failure. Use this drug with caution if you have any of these conditions.\nThere is no proof that Celebrex reduces the odds of cancer in people who take the drug for FAP. Although Celebrex can reduce the number of growths, you'll still need the other treatments and frequent checkups that this condition requires.\nWhat other drugs will affect Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Before taking Celebrex, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following drugs:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 aspirin or another salicylate (form of aspirin) such as salsalate (Disalcid), choline salicylate-magnesium salicylate (Trilisate, Tricosal, others), and magnesium salicylate (Doan's, Bayer Select Backache Formula, others);\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an over-the-counter cough, cold, allergy, or pain medicine that contains aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or ketoprofen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a diuretic (water pill) such as furosemide (Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDiuril, others), chlorothiazide (Diuril, others), chlorthalidone (Hygroton, Thalitone), and others;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) such as benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), quinapril (Accupril), and others;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a steroid medicine such as prednisone (Deltasone and others), methylprednisolone (Medrol and others), prednisolone (Prelone, Pediapred, and others), and others;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as warfarin (Coumadin);\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid, others); or\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 fluconazole (Diflucan).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You may not be able to take Celebrex, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Drugs other than those listed here may also interact with Celebrex. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist before taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products.\nHow to Take CELEBREX\nCELEBREX makes it easy for your doctor to customize your treatment to fit your individual treatment needs. For most people, one CELEBREX works hard all day and night to help relieve your arthritis pain and can be taken as needed for relief from acute pain. It targets the pain, inflammation, and stiffness that's part of arthritis. CELEBREX is available in 100-mg and 200-mg capsules. CELEBREX is also available in a 400-mg capsule. Your doctor will find the dosage that's right for your pain. CELEBREX should always be taken exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Taking CELEBREX on a regular basis will help it work better against your arthritis pain.\nWhen to take CELEBREX\nCELEBREX can be taken with or without food at any time of the day. You may find that if you take it at the same time every day, you'll be less likely to skip a dose by mistake. If you do forget to take a dose, don't double up. Taking too much of any medication at one time can present a health risk. Wait and take it at your next regularly scheduled time. If you have questions, be sure to call your doctor. It's important to take the time to talk with your doctor or pharmacist about how you should take CELEBREX.\nPossible food and drug interactions when taking this medication\nIf Celebrex is taken with certain other drugs, the effects of either could be increased, decreased, or altered. It is especially important to check with your doctor before combining Celebrex with the following:\nACE-inhibitors (a type of blood pressure and heart medication, including such drugs as Capoten, Vasotec, and Prinivil)\nBlood thinning agents such as Coumadin\nFluconazole (Diflucan)\nLithium (Eskalith, Lithobid)\nThiazide diuretics (water pills) such as hydrochlorothiazide and Dyazide\nIf you take low-dose aspirin to protect against heart attack, you can continue taking it with Celebrex. Using aspirin increases your risk of stomach ulcers or bleeding, but Celebrex does not have aspirin's protective effect on the heart.\nWho Can Take CELEBREX\nCELEBREX can be taken by adults suffering from arthritis pain, inflammation, and stiffness. It can also be taken for relief from acute pain. Some examples of acute pain include pain from strains and sprains or pain after surgery. Sometimes CELEBREX is prescribed to relieve painful menstrual cramps.\nWhat to do if you are pregnant or nursing?\nNo studies of CELEBREX in pregnant women have been performed. CELEBREX should be used during pregnancy only if you and your doctor decide that the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy should not take CELEBREX. The effects of CELEBREX on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.\nYou should not take CELEBREX if you are breast-feeding because CELEBREX is passed into human milk. Limited data from one subject indicates that CELEBREX is also passed in human milk. Because many drugs are passed in human milk, a decision should be made whether to stop nursing or to stop taking CELEBREX.\n\u00c2 Special information if you are pregnant or breastfeeding\nCelebrex can harm a developing baby if taken during the third trimester, and its safety earlier in pregnancy has not been confirmed. Take it during pregnancy only if you feel the risk is justified.\nIt's possible that Celebrex makes its way into breast milk (scientists aren't sure), and it could cause serious reactions in a nursing infant. If this drug is essential to your health, your doctor may advise you to discontinue breastfeeding.\nWhy is this drug prescribed?\nCelebrex is prescribed for acute pain, menstrual cramps, and the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is the first of a new class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) called \"COX-2 inhibitors.\" Like older NSAIDs such as Motrin and Naprosyn, Celebrex is believed to fight pain and inflammation by inhibiting the effect of a natural enzyme called COX-2. Unlike the older medications, however, it does not interfere with a similar substance, called COX-1, which exerts a protective effect on the lining of the stomach. Celebrex is therefore less likely to cause the bleeding and ulcers that sometimes accompany sustained use of the older NSAIDs.\nCelebrex has also been found to reduce the number of colorectal polyps (growths in the wall of the lower intestine and rectum) in people who suffer from the condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited tendency to develop large numbers of colorectal polyps that eventually become cancerous.\nMost important fact about this drug\nAlthough Celebrex is easy on the stomach, it still poses some degree of risk--especially if you've had a stomach ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding in the past. If you've ever had such problems, make sure the doctor is aware of it. And be sure to alert the doctor if you develop any digestive problems or black, tarry stools.\nRecommended dosage\nOsteoarthritis\nThe recommended daily dose is 200 milligrams, taken as a single dose or in 100-milligram doses twice a day.\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nThe recommended dose is 100 to 200 milligrams twice a day.\nAcute Pain and Menstrual Cramps\nThe recommended starting dose is 400 milligrams, followed by an additional 200 milligrams if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dosage is 200 milligrams twice a day.\nFamilial Adenomatous Polyposis\nThe recommended dose is 400 milligrams twice a day with food.\nDosage is typically cut in half for people with moderate liver problems.\n\u00c2 OVERDOSE\nNo overdoses of CELEBREX were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.\nPatients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. No information is available regarding the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein binding (>97%) dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\nMore About Overdosage\nAny medication taken in excess can have serious consequences. If you suspect an overdose, seek medical attention immediately.\nSymptoms of Celebrex overdose may include:\nBreathing difficulties, coma, drowsiness, gastrointestinal bleeding, high blood pressure, kidney failure, nausea, sluggishness, stomach pain, vomiting\nWhy is this drug prescribed?\nCelebrex is prescribed for acute pain, menstrual cramps, and the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is the first of a new class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) called \"COX-2 inhibitors.\" Like older NSAIDs such as Motrin and Naprosyn, Celebrex is believed to fight pain and inflammation by inhibiting the effect of a natural enzyme called COX-2. Unlike the older medications, however, it does not interfere with a similar substance, called COX-1, which exerts a protective effect on the lining of the stomach. Celebrex is therefore less likely to cause the bleeding and ulcers that sometimes accompany sustained use of the older NSAIDs.\nCelebrex has also been found to reduce the number of colorectal polyps (growths in the wall of the lower intestine and rectum) in people who suffer from the condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited tendency to develop large numbers of colorectal polyps that eventually become cancerous.\n\u00c2\nDavid's Canadian Drug Store - PRECAUTIONS\nGeneral: CELEBREX cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.\nThe pharmacological activity of CELEBREX in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\nHepatic Effects: Borderline elevations of one or more liver associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including CELEBREX (see ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 post-marketing experience). In controlled clinical trials of CELEBREX, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for CELEBREX and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking CELEBREX and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.\nA patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with CELEBREX. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), CELEBREX should be discontinued.\nHematological Effects: Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving CELEBREX. In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with CELEBREX and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with CELEBREX should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. CELEBREX does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and does not inhibit platelet aggregation at indicated dosages (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\u00e2\u0080\u0094Platelets).\nPreexisting Asthma: Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, CELEBREX should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.\nWho should not take CELEBREX?\nYou should not take CELEBREX if you:\nAre allergic to celecoxib, the active ingredient in CELEBREX\nHave had allergic reactions to certain drugs called sulfonamides\nHave experienced asthma, hives, or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)\nAre in late pregnancy\nAre breast-feeding\nAre having or have recently had a certain kind of heart surgery called coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\nWe will not be held responsible for misuse of prescription drugs or misinformation on this website.

Talk with your doctor about this risk. While you are taking citalopram you will need to be monitored for worsening symptoms of depression and/ or suicidal thoughts during the first weeks of treatment, or whenever your dose is changed. In addition to you watching for changes in your own symptoms, your family or other caregivers should be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Your doctor will need to check you at regular visits for at least the first 12 weeks of treatment.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Contact your doctor promptly if you have any of the following side effects, especially if they are new symptoms or if they get worse: mood changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, irritability, agitation, aggressiveness, severe restlessness, mania (mental and/ or physical hyperactivity), thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Do not take citalopram together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine (Parnate). You must wait at least 14 days after stopping an MAOI before you can take citalopram. After you stop taking citalopram, you must wait at least 14 days before you start taking an MAOI.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Some antidepressants may cause serious or life-threatening lung problems in newborn babies whose mothers take the medication during pregnancy.

RA is an autoimmune disease that attacks healthy joint tissue, starting a process of inflammation and joint damage\nManagement of acute pain in adults (such as pain from strains and sprains) or pain after surgery\nTreatment of primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual cramps)\nRelief of signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, a painful form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis usually strikes young adults. It can cause inflammation, pain and stiffness in the shoulders, knees, hips, ribs and feet\nThe most important fact about this drug\nAlthough Celebrex is easy on the stomach, it still poses some degree of risk--especially if you've had a stomach ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding in the past. If you've ever had such problems, make sure the doctor is aware of it. And be sure to alert the doctor if you develop any digestive problems or black, tarry stools.\nWhat is the most important information you should know about Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Recent information suggests a possible increased risk for heart attack and stroke in patients taking Celebrex. The relevance of this information is still not known. Ask your doctor if Celebrex is right for you.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Do not take Celebrex without first talking to your doctor if you have experienced asthma, hives, or an allergic reaction after taking a sulfa-based medication such as sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra, Gantanol, and others) or sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin); aspirin; or another NSAID such as valdecoxib (Bextra), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, and others), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, Anaprox), ketoprofen (Orudis KT, Orudis, Oruvail), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam), diflunisal (Dolobid), etodolac (Lodine, Lodine XL), fenoprofen (Nalfon), flurbiprofen (Ansaid), indomethacin (Indocin), ketorolac (Toradol), meloxicam (Mobic), nabumetone (Relafen), oxaprozin (Daypro), piroxicam (Feldene), sulindac (Clinoril), or tolmetin (Tolectin).

These symptoms could be early signs of dangerous side effects.\n\u00c2 What makes CELEBREX different?\nCELEBREX works to relieve arthritis pain by targeting a certain enzyme in the body. An enzyme is a protein that causes chemical changes in other substances in the body. The enzyme that CELEBREX targets is called COX-2. The COX-2 enzyme plays a key role in causing both pain and inflammation.\nThe body also makes an enzyme called COX-1. This enzyme helps protect the lining of the stomach. Most pain relievers work by blocking the actions of both the COX-1 and COX-2.\nCELEBREX is different because, when taken at suggested doses, it targets the COX-2 enzyme, but not the COX-1. For this reason, doctors refer to CELEBREX as a COX-2\u00e2\u0080\u0093specific inhibitor.\nDavid's Canadian Drug Store Inform You\nHow to take this medication?\nFor best results, take Celebrex regularly, exactly as prescribed. You can take it with or without food.\n--If you miss a dose...\nTake it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the one you missed and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.\n--Storage instructions...\nStore at room temperature.\nWhat should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Recent information suggests a possible increased risk for heart attack and stroke in patients taking Celebrex.

This means that it is not known whether it will harm an unborn baby. Celebrex should not be taken late in pregnancy (the third trimester) because it may affect the formation of the baby's heart. Do not take Celebrex without first talking to your doctor if you are pregnant.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 It is not known whether Celebrex passes into breast milk. Do not take Celebrex without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If you are over the age of 65 years, you may be more likely to experience side effects from Celebrex.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue taking Celebrex.\nMore common side effects may include:\nAbdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, indigestion, nausea, respiratory infection, sinus inflammation\nLess common side effects may include:\nBack pain, dizziness, gas, insomnia, rash, runny nose, sore throat, swelling\nRare side effects may include:\nAllergic reactions, anxiety, belching, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, blood infections, blurred vision, bone disorders, breast pain, breast problems, bronchitis, cataracts, chest pain, colitis, conjunctivitis (pinkeye), constipation, coughing, cysts, dark-tarry stools, deafness, depression, dermatitis, diabetes, difficult urination, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, drowsiness, dry mouth, dry skin, earache, ear infection, ear ringing, esophageal perforation, eye infection, eye pain, fainting, fatigue, fever, flu symptoms, fungal infection, gallstones, gangrene, general swelling, glaucoma (pressure in the eye), hair loss, heart failure, heart irregularities, hemorrhoids, hepatitis, hernia of the stomach, herpes infection, hives, hot flashes, increased appetite, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased muscle tone, increased urination, infection, inflammation of the digestive tract, inflammation of the bladder, inflammation of the blood vessels, intestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction or perforation, itching, jaundice, joint pain or inflammation, kidney problems, laryngitis, leg cramps, liver problems, loss of appetite, loss of balance, low blood sugar, menstrual disorders, migraine headache, mouth ulcers, muscle ache, nail disorders, neck stiffness, nerve pain, nervousness, nosebleeds, pain, painful urination, pancreatitis, phlebitis, pneumonia, poor coordination, prostate problems, severe diarrhea, severe skin rash and peeling, skin reaction due to sunlight, skin sensitivity, skin tingling, stroke, suicide, sweating, swollen face and throat, taste disturbances, tendonitis, tiredness, tooth disorders, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, vaginal problems, vomiting, weakness, weight gain\nWhat you shouldavoid while taking Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 There are no restrictions on food, beverages, or activity while taking Celebrex unless otherwise directed by your doctor.\nWhat happens if you miss a dose?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the dose you missed and take only the next regularly scheduled dose as directed. Do not take a double dose of this medication unless your doctor directs otherwise.\n\u00c2 What are the most common side effects of CELEBREX?\nAll medicines have possible side effects. Although CELEBREX is usually well-tolerated, in clinical trials some common side effects were indigestion, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In studies, the percentage of patients who stopped taking CELEBREX due to side effects was similar to the percentage of patients who were taking a placebo (a sugar pill) and stopped because of side effects.\nWhy should this drug not be prescribed?\nDo not take Celebrex if you are allergic to sulfonamide drugs such as sulfadiazine, sulfisoxazole, Gantanol, and Thiosulfil. Also avoid Celebrex if you've ever suffered an asthma attack, face and throat swelling, or skin eruptions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. If you find that you are allergic to Celebrex, you will not be able to use it.\nAre there other side effects?\nCELEBREX may increase the chance of serious heart problems such as heart attacks or strokes which can be fatal. Serious skin reactions or stomach problems such as bleeding can occur without warning and may be fatal. As always, patients should discuss their individual health history with their doctors to understand these risks.\nSpecial warnings about this medication\nRemember to tell your doctor about any stomach ulcers or bleeding you've had in the past. Also alert your doctor if you develop any digestive problems, swelling, or rash.\nIf you have asthma, use Celebrex with caution. It could trigger an attack, especially if you are also sensitive to aspirin.\nIf you are taking a steroid medication for your arthritis, do not discontinue it abruptly when you begin therapy with Celebrex. Celebrex is not a substitute for such drugs.\nCelebrex has been known to cause kidney or liver problems, particularly in people with an existing condition. If you have such a disorder, take Celebrex with caution. If you develop symptoms of liver poisoning, stop taking the drug and see your doctor immediately. Warning signs include nausea, fatigue, itching, yellowish skin, pain in the right side of the stomach, and flu-like symptoms.\nIf you are prone to anemia (loss of red blood cells), make sure the doctor knows about it. Celebrex occasionally fosters this problem.\nCelebrex sometimes causes water retention, which can aggravate swelling, high blood pressure, and heart failure. Use this drug with caution if you have any of these conditions.\nThere is no proof that Celebrex reduces the odds of cancer in people who take the drug for FAP. Although Celebrex can reduce the number of growths, you'll still need the other treatments and frequent checkups that this condition requires.\nWhat other drugs will affect Celebrex?\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Before taking Celebrex, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following drugs:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 aspirin or another salicylate (form of aspirin) such as salsalate (Disalcid), choline salicylate-magnesium salicylate (Trilisate, Tricosal, others), and magnesium salicylate (Doan's, Bayer Select Backache Formula, others);\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an over-the-counter cough, cold, allergy, or pain medicine that contains aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or ketoprofen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a diuretic (water pill) such as furosemide (Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDiuril, others), chlorothiazide (Diuril, others), chlorthalidone (Hygroton, Thalitone), and others;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) such as benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), quinapril (Accupril), and others;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 a steroid medicine such as prednisone (Deltasone and others), methylprednisolone (Medrol and others), prednisolone (Prelone, Pediapred, and others), and others;\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 an anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as warfarin (Coumadin);\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid, others); or\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 fluconazole (Diflucan).\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 You may not be able to take Celebrex, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you are taking any of the medicines listed above.\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Drugs other than those listed here may also interact with Celebrex. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist before taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines including vitamins, minerals, and herbal products.\nHow to Take CELEBREX\nCELEBREX makes it easy for your doctor to customize your treatment to fit your individual treatment needs. For most people, one CELEBREX works hard all day and night to help relieve your arthritis pain and can be taken as needed for relief from acute pain. It targets the pain, inflammation, and stiffness that's part of arthritis. CELEBREX is available in 100-mg and 200-mg capsules. CELEBREX is also available in a 400-mg capsule. Your doctor will find the dosage that's right for your pain. CELEBREX should always be taken exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Taking CELEBREX on a regular basis will help it work better against your arthritis pain.\nWhen to take CELEBREX\nCELEBREX can be taken with or without food at any time of the day. You may find that if you take it at the same time every day, you'll be less likely to skip a dose by mistake. If you do forget to take a dose, don't double up. Taking too much of any medication at one time can present a health risk. Wait and take it at your next regularly scheduled time. If you have questions, be sure to call your doctor. It's important to take the time to talk with your doctor or pharmacist about how you should take CELEBREX.\nPossible food and drug interactions when taking this medication\nIf Celebrex is taken with certain other drugs, the effects of either could be increased, decreased, or altered. It is especially important to check with your doctor before combining Celebrex with the following:\nACE-inhibitors (a type of blood pressure and heart medication, including such drugs as Capoten, Vasotec, and Prinivil)\nBlood thinning agents such as Coumadin\nFluconazole (Diflucan)\nLithium (Eskalith, Lithobid)\nThiazide diuretics (water pills) such as hydrochlorothiazide and Dyazide\nIf you take low-dose aspirin to protect against heart attack, you can continue taking it with Celebrex. Using aspirin increases your risk of stomach ulcers or bleeding, but Celebrex does not have aspirin's protective effect on the heart.\nWho Can Take CELEBREX\nCELEBREX can be taken by adults suffering from arthritis pain, inflammation, and stiffness. It can also be taken for relief from acute pain. Some examples of acute pain include pain from strains and sprains or pain after surgery. Sometimes CELEBREX is prescribed to relieve painful menstrual cramps.\nWhat to do if you are pregnant or nursing?\nNo studies of CELEBREX in pregnant women have been performed. CELEBREX should be used during pregnancy only if you and your doctor decide that the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy should not take CELEBREX. The effects of CELEBREX on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown.\nYou should not take CELEBREX if you are breast-feeding because CELEBREX is passed into human milk. Limited data from one subject indicates that CELEBREX is also passed in human milk. Because many drugs are passed in human milk, a decision should be made whether to stop nursing or to stop taking CELEBREX.\nSpecial information if you are pregnant or breastfeeding\nCelebrex can harm a developing baby if taken during the third trimester, and its safety earlier in pregnancy has not been confirmed. Take it during pregnancy only if you feel the risk is justified.\nIt's possible that Celebrex makes its way into breast milk (scientists aren't sure), and it could cause serious reactions in a nursing infant. If this drug is essential to your health, your doctor may advise you to discontinue breastfeeding.\nWhy is this drug prescribed?\nCelebrex is prescribed for acute pain, menstrual cramps, and the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is the first of a new class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) called \"COX-2 inhibitors.\" Like older NSAIDs such as Motrin and Naprosyn, Celebrex is believed to fight pain and inflammation by inhibiting the effect of a natural enzyme called COX-2. Unlike the older medications, however, it does not interfere with a similar substance, called COX-1, which exerts a protective effect on the lining of the stomach. Celebrex is therefore less likely to cause the bleeding and ulcers that sometimes accompany sustained use of the older NSAIDs.\nCelebrex has also been found to reduce the number of colorectal polyps (growths in the wall of the lower intestine and rectum) in people who suffer from the condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited tendency to develop large numbers of colorectal polyps that eventually become cancerous.\nMost important fact about this drug\nAlthough Celebrex is easy on the stomach, it still poses some degree of risk--especially if you've had a stomach ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding in the past. If you've ever had such problems, make sure the doctor is aware of it. And be sure to alert the doctor if you develop any digestive problems or black, tarry stools.\nRecommended dosage\nOsteoarthritis\nThe recommended daily dose is 200 milligrams, taken as a single dose or in 100-milligram doses twice a day.\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nThe recommended dose is 100 to 200 milligrams twice a day.\nAcute Pain and Menstrual Cramps\nThe recommended starting dose is 400 milligrams, followed by an additional 200 milligrams if needed on the first day. On subsequent days, the recommended dosage is 200 milligrams twice a day.\nFamilial Adenomatous Polyposis\nThe recommended dose is 400 milligrams twice a day with food.\nDosage is typically cut in half for people with moderate liver problems.\nOVERDOSE\nNo overdoses of CELEBREX were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. Symptoms following acute NSAID overdoses are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.\nPatients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdose. There are no specific antidotes. No information is available regarding the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein binding (>97%) dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose. Emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in children) and/or osmotic cathartic may be indicated in patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion with symptoms or following a large overdose. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.\n\u00c2 More About Overdosage\nAny medication taken in excess can have serious consequences. If you suspect an overdose, seek medical attention immediately.\nSymptoms of Celebrex overdose may include:\nBreathing difficulties, coma, drowsiness, gastrointestinal bleeding, high blood pressure, kidney failure, nausea, sluggishness, stomach pain, vomiting\nWhy is this drug prescribed?\nCelebrex is prescribed for acute pain, menstrual cramps, and the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is the first of a new class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) called \"COX-2 inhibitors.\" Like older NSAIDs such as Motrin and Naprosyn, Celebrex is believed to fight pain and inflammation by inhibiting the effect of a natural enzyme called COX-2. Unlike the older medications, however, it does not interfere with a similar substance, called COX-1, which exerts a protective effect on the lining of the stomach. Celebrex is therefore less likely to cause the bleeding and ulcers that sometimes accompany sustained use of the older NSAIDs.\nCelebrex has also been found to reduce the number of colorectal polyps (growths in the wall of the lower intestine and rectum) in people who suffer from the condition called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited tendency to develop large numbers of colorectal polyps that eventually become cancerous.\n\u00c2 David's Canadian Drug Store - PRECAUTIONS\nGeneral: CELEBREX cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.\nThe pharmacological activity of CELEBREX in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\nHepatic Effects: Borderline elevations of one or more liver associated enzymes may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, and notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure (some with fatal outcome) have been reported with NSAIDs, including CELEBREX (see ADVERSE REACTIONS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 post-marketing experience). In controlled clinical trials of CELEBREX, the incidence of borderline elevations (greater than or equal to 1.2 times and less than 3 times the upper limit of normal) of liver associated enzymes was 6% for CELEBREX and 5% for placebo, and approximately 0.2% of patients taking CELEBREX and 0.3% of patients taking placebo had notable elevations of ALT and AST.\nA patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be monitored carefully for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with CELEBREX. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), CELEBREX should be discontinued.\nHematological Effects: Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving CELEBREX. In controlled clinical trials the incidence of anemia was 0.6% with CELEBREX and 0.4% with placebo. Patients on long-term treatment with CELEBREX should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. CELEBREX does not generally affect platelet counts, prothrombin time (PT), or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and does not inhibit platelet aggregation at indicated dosages (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\u00e2\u0080\u0094Platelets).\nPreexisting Asthma: Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, CELEBREX should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.\nWho should not take CELEBREX?\nYou should not take CELEBREX if you:\nAre allergic to celecoxib, the active ingredient in CELEBREX\nHave had allergic reactions to certain drugs called sulfonamides\nHave experienced asthma, hives, or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)\nAre in late pregnancy\nAre breast-feeding\nAre having or have recently had a certain kind of heart surgery called coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\nWe will not be held responsible for misuse of prescription drugs or misinformation on this website.

Concerning findings include:\nAltered mental status (confused, less responsive)\nAppearance of being dehydrated, especially if the person is unable to drink fluids\nFast breathing (more than 30 breaths per minute)\nHeart rate greater than 120 beats per minute\nSystolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg\nTemperature greater than 104 \u00b0F\nLaboratory and X-ray Findings. Laboratory findings that are of concern include:\nElevated blood sugar\nFluid in the sac around the lung (on chest x-ray)\nLow oxygen in the blood\nLow sodium levels\nPoor kidney function\nSignificant anemia (hematocrit less than 30%)\nPatients with very few of these risks often can be discharged with outpatient care only. This determination can often be made with a simple physical examination and history. Sometimes a patient only needs to be hospitalized for 24 hours for observation.\nPatients with higher scores on these assessment tests often have many risk factors and usually are hospitalized.\nWhen possible, treatment of community-acquired pneumonia should be started within 4 hours of admission to the emergency room or hospital to reduce the chances of mortality and decrease the amount of time a patient needs to spend in the hospital.\nHome care may be possible, even in severe cases, when there is good support and available home nursing services. Often, caregivers can even be trained to administer intravenous antibiotics and chest therapy to patients at home.\nHome Treatment\nThe following tips are suggested:\nDrink plenty of liquids.\nDo not suppress a cough. Coughing is an important reflex for clearing the lungs. Some doctors advise taking expectorants, such as guaifenesin (Breonesin, Glycotuss, Glytuss, Hytuss, Naldecon Senior EX, Robitussin) to loosen mucus. However, there is no proof that any of these products make much difference in a patient's outcome.\nMild pain can be treated with aspirin (in adults only), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\nFor severe pain, codeine or another stronger pain reliever may be prescribed. It should be noted, however, that codeine and other narcotics suppress coughing, so they should be used with care in pneumonia. Such pain relievers often require monitoring.\nA laboratory study reported that aromatic oils containing oregano, thyme, and rosewood destroyed S. pneumoniae. It is not known whether they have any effect on pneumonia in people.\nPractice chest therapy.\nHospitalization Guidelines\nTreatment. If the pneumonia is severe enough for hospitalization, the standard treatment is intravenous antibiotics for 5 - 8 days. In cases of uncomplicated pneumonia, many patients may need only 2 or 3 days of intravenous antibiotics followed by oral therapy. Antibiotics taken by mouth are prescribed when the patient has improved substantially or leaves the hospital.\nITSA/ATS guidelines recommend that patients admitted to the hospital (but not the ICU) be treated with fluoroquinolones or a beta-lactam plus a macrolide (preferably cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and ampicillin).\nDuration of Stay. Patients should remain in the hospital until all their vital signs are stable. Most patients become stabilized in 3 days. Many experts use seven variables to measure stability and to determine whether the patient can go home:\nTemperature. Some experts believe that patients can go home when their temperature drops to 101 \u00b0F. Stricter criteria require that it be at or close to 98.6 \u00b0F.\nRespiration rate. Goal is a normal breathing rate, although expert opinion differs on the degree of normality required for discharge.\nHeart rate. Goal is 100 beats per minute or less.\nBlood pressure. Goal is systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater.\nOxygenation. Goal is determined by the physician.\nThe ability to eat. Goal is regular appetite.\nMental function. Goal is normal.\nPatients or their families should discuss these criteria with their doctor.\nChest Therapy\nChest therapy using incentive spirometry, rhythmic inhalation and coughing, and chest tapping are all important techniques to loosen the mucus and move it out of the lungs. It should be used both in the hospital and during recovery at home.\nIncentive Spirometry. The patient uses an incentive spirometer at regular intervals to improve breathing and loosen sputum. The spirometer is a hand-held clear plastic device that includes a breathing tube and a container with a movable gauge. The patient exhales and then inhales forcefully through the tube, using the pressure of the inhalation to raise the gauge to the highest level possible.\nRhythmic Breathing and Coughing. During recovery, the patient performs rhythmic breathing and coughing every 4 hours:\nBefore starting the breathing exercise, the patient should tap lightly on the chest to loosen mucus in the lung. If available, a caregiver should also tap on the patient's back.\nThe patient inhales rhythmically and deeply three or four times.\nThe patient then coughs as deeply as possible with the goal of producing sputum.\nBack to Top\nMedications\nDozens of antibiotics are available for treating pneumonia, but selecting the best drug is sometimes difficult. Patients with pneumonia need an antibiotic that is effective against the organism causing the disease. When the organism is unknown, \"empiric therapy\" is given, meaning the doctor chooses which antibiotic is likely to work based on factors such as the patient's age, health, and severity of the illness.\nIn determining the appropriate antibiotic, the physician must first answer a number of questions:\nHow severe is the pneumonia? Mild-to-moderate cases can be treated at home with oral antibiotics. Severe pneumonia usually needs intravenous antibiotics administered in the hospital.\nIf the organism causing the pneumonia is not known, was the disorder community- or hospital-acquired? Different organisms are usually involved in each setting, and the physician can use this information to guess the most likely organism causing the pneumonia.\nIf the organism is known, is it typical or atypical? Community-acquired pneumonias, for example, are usually caused by the typical bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis, which were previously treated with related antibiotics. These antibiotics do not treat organisms such as legionella, mycoplasma, or chlamydia. These organisms are generally treated with a macrolide or possibly a newer quinolone.\nDoes the patient have an impaired immune system? Antibiotics used to treat such patients may differ from those used in patients with healthy immune systems.\nOnce an antibiotic has been chosen, there are still difficulties:\nIndividuals respond differently to the same antibiotic, depending on their age, health, size, and other factors.\nPatients can be allergic to certain antibiotics, thus requiring alternatives.\nPatients may have strains of bacteria that are resistant to certain antibiotics.\nAntibiotic Treatments for Community-Acquired Pneumonia\nJoint guidelines issued in 2007 by the Infectious Disease Society of America and the American Thoracic Society (ITSA/ATS) recommend that mild CAP in otherwise healthy patients be treated with oral macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin).\nMany patients with heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or other co-existing conditions may still be treated as outpatients. However, they should be given a fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levofloxacin) or a beta-lactam (preferably high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate), plus a macrolide, unless they live in an area with high S. pneumoniae resistance to macrolides.\nResearch has not pinpointed an exact duration of antibiotic therapy. Current recommendations call for 7 - 10 days of treatment for S. pneumoniae and 10 - 14 days for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. However, some research suggests that patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia may be successfully treated with 7 days or less of antibiotics. The shorter treatment may increase patient tolerance, and improve the likelihood that patients will stick to the treatment regimen. It will also help limit the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the different types of antibiotics, see the \"Antibiotic Classes\" section below.\nMany cases of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by S. pneumoniae -- Gram-positive bacteria that usually respond to antibiotics known as beta-lactams (which include penicillin), and to macrolides. However, resistant strains of S. pneumoniae are increasingly common. Most resistant strains respond to fluoroquinolines such as levofloxacin (Levaquin), gemifloxacin (Factive), or moxifloxacin (Avelox). Another common cause of community-acquired pneumonia is H. influenzae.\nIn addition, other important causes of CAP, particularly in younger people, are atypical bacteria, which respond to macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin), ketolides, or newer fluoroquinolones.\nAntibiotic treatment for CAP is determined by a number of factors, including:\nThe patient's history of antibiotic therapy\nCo-existing diseases (such as COPD, diabetes, and heart failure)\nWhether the patient is well enough to be treated at home or requires hospitalization or nursing home care.\nTreatment options can include a single drug, such as levofloxacin or doxycycline, or combination treatment, such as a macrolide administered with a beta-lactam.\nAntibiotics taken by mouth are generally enough for patients whose CAP is mild enough to be treated at home. Intravenous antibiotics are required for hospitalized patients with CAP. Antibiotic therapy should be given for a minimum of 5 days -- longer if the patient still has a fever and more than one sign of continuing severe illness.\nAntibiotic Treatments for Hospital-Acquired (Nosocomial) Pneumonia\nA broad range of antibiotics is available for treating hospital-acquired pneumonias. Factors that may determine the choice of an antibiotic include:\nImmune status\nPatterns of antibiotic resistance within a particular hospital or community\nRecent antibiotic usage\nType of bacteria causing the pneumonia\nUse of ventilators\nTreatment of Viral Infections\nThere are not as many choices for treating viral pneumonia. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have been the recommended drugs for influenza A or B infections, but many strains of influenza A have become resistant. Their use is only recommended if they are started in the first 48 hours of symptoms. Taken early, these medications may be effective in reducing symptoms and duration of illness. [See In-Depth Report #94: Colds and influenza . ]\nPatients with viral pneumonias are at risk for what are called \"superinfections,\" which generally refers to a secondary bacterial infection, usually caused by S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, or H. influenzae. Doctors most commonly recommend treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, cefuroxime, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if these secondary infections occur.\nPatients with pneumonia caused by varicella-zoster and herpes simplex viruses are usually admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous acyclovir for 7 days.\nNo antiviral drugs have been proven effective in adults with RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, the SARS coronavirus, or hantavirus. Treatment is largely supportive, with patients receiving oxygen and ventilator therapy as needed.\nTreatment of RSV in Children. Ribavarin is the first treatment approved for RSV pneumonia, although it has only modest benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends this drug for children who are at high risk for serious complications of RSV.\nSide Effects of Antibiotics\nMost antibiotics have the following side effects (although specific antibiotics may have other side effects or fewer of the standard ones):\nAllergic reactions (most commonly with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa). These reactions can range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe -- even life-threatening -- anaphylactic shock.\nInfection with Clostridium difficile, the bacteria responsible for causing severe diarrhea, inflammation of the colon (colitis), and abdominal pain (with overuse of antibiotics). This condition can be fatal.\nInteractions with certain drugs, including some over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Patients should inform their physician of all medications and OTC preparations they are taking and of any drug allergies they might have.\nStomach problems (most common side effect).\nVaginal infections. Taking acidophilus supplements or eating yogurt with active acidophilius cultures may help restore healthy bacteria that reduce the risk for such infections.\nAntibiotic and Antiviral Drug Classes\nBeta-Lactams\nBeta-lactam antibiotics share common chemical features. They include penicillins, cephalosporins, and some newer similar medications. They interfere with bacterial cell walls.\nPenicillins. Penicillin was the first antibiotic. There are many forms of this still-important drug:\nNatural penicillins include penicillin G (for intravenous use) and V (for oral use).\nPenicillin derivatives called aminopenicillins, particularly amoxicillin (Amoxil, Polymox, Trimox, Wymox, or any generic formulation), are now the most common penicillins used. Amoxicillin is inexpensive and, at one time, was highly effective against S. pneumoniae. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to amoxicillin has increased significantly, both among S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Ampicillin is similar and is an alternative to amoxicillin, but requires more doses and has more severe gastrointestinal side effects.\nAmoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) is a type of penicillin that works against a wide variety of bacteria. An extended-release form has been approved for treating adults with community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacterial strains that have become partially resistant to penicillin.\nAntistaphylococcal penicillins were developed to treat Staphylococcus aureus. The standard drug was methicillin, but it is no longer used routinely, due to very high rates of resistance in hospital-acquired pneumonias. Resistance in community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus is also increasing. Alternatives include vancomycin and linezolid. There are also other options for this type of bacteria.\nPenicillins used against Pseudomonas aeruginosa include ticarcillin and piperacillin. Piperacillin is more effective than ticarcillin.\nMany people have a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin, but research suggests that the allergy may not occur again in a significant number of adults. Skin tests are available to help determine if those with a history of penicillin allergies could use these important antibiotics.\nCephalosporins. Most of these antibiotics are not very effective against bacteria that have developed resistance to penicillin. They are classed according to their generation:\nFirst generation includes cephalexin (Keflex), cefadroxil (Duricef, Ultracef), and cephradine (Velosef).\nSecond generation includes cefaclor (Ceclor), cefuroxime (Ceftin), cefprozil (Cefzil), and loracarbef (Lorabid).\nThird generation includes cefpodoxime (Vantin), cefdinir (Omnicef) cefditoren (Sprectracef), cefixime (Suprax), and ceftibuten (Cedex). Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) is an injected cephalosporin. These are effective against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria.\nOther Beta-Lactam Agents. Carbapenems include meropenem (Merrem), biapenem, faropenem, ertapenem (Invanz) and combinations (imipenem/cilastatin [Primaxin]). These drugs are used to treat a wide variety of bacteria. They are now used for serious hospital-acquired infections and for bacteria that have become resistant to other beta-lactams. Imipenem has serious side effects when used alone, so it is given in combination with cilastatin to offset these adverse effects. The newer drugs are less toxic, although they may not be as effective.\nSanfetrinem, a new beta-lactam antibiotic known as a trinem, is proving to be effective against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis.\nCeftobiprole is an investigational beta-lactam for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria. Other anti-MRSA beta-lactams in development include:\nCS-023/RO-4908463, a carbapenem\nFluoroquinolones\nFluoroquinolones (quinolones) interfere with bacteria's genetic material to prevent them from reproducing.\nCiprofloxacin (Cipro), a second-generation quinolone, remains the most potent quinolone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is not very effective against Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\"Respiratory\" quinolones are currently the most effective drugs available for a wide range of bacteria. Such drugs include levofloxacin (Levaquin) and gemifloxacin (Factive). Some of the newer fluoroquinolones only need to be taken once a day.\nThe fourth-generation quinolones moxifloxacin (Avelox) and clinafloxacin (which is still under development) are proving to be effective against anaerobic bacteria.\nS. pneumoniae -- strains resistant to the \"respiratory\" quinolones are uncommon in the U.S., but resistance is dramatically increasing.\nMany quinolones cause side effects, including:\nNervous system, mental, and heart problems\nSensitivity to light\nPregnant women should not take these medications. The drugs also enhance the potency of oral anti-clotting drugs.\nMacrolides, Azalides, and Ketolides\nMacrolides and azalides also affect the genetics of bacteria. These medications include:\nAzithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax)\nErythromycin\nRoxithromycin (Rulid)\nThese antibiotics are effective against atypical bacteria such as mycoplasma and chlamydia. Macrolides are also used in some cases for S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, but there is increasing bacterial resistance to these antibiotics. All but erythromycin are effective against H. influenzae. Macrolide-resistance rates doubled between 1995 and 1999 as more and more children were being treated with these antibiotics. Some research suggests these drugs may reduce the risk of a first heart attack in some patients by reducing inflammation in the blood vessels.\nExtended-release (ER) azithromycin (Zmax) is the first anti-pneumonia antibiotic that can be given in a single dose. It is effective against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria. Studies have shown the results to be equal to those achieved with 7 days of levofloxacin or clarithromycin ER in patients with CAP. A single-dose antibiotic decreases the likelihood that a patient will stop taking the antibiotic early, which rapidly contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\nKetolides. Ketolides are a new class of antibiotic drugs. They are derived from erythromycin and were developed to combat bacteria that have become resistant to macrolides. Telithromycin (Ketek), the first antibiotic in the ketolide class, was approved by the FDA in 2004 for treating community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\nIn February 2007, the FDA withdrew approval of Ketek for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The agency decided that the serious risks of telithromycin outweigh its benefits for sinusitis treatment. The decision followed several 2006 reports of patient deaths due to severe liver damage.\nTelithromycin is still approved for the treatment of CAP, but the drug carries a black box warning noting the potentially serious side effects, including:\nLiver failure\nNerve and muscle (neuromuscular) problems\nVision problems\nBecause of these side effects, telithromycin is only approved for patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin- or macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Other treatments are as effective, and are safer.\nTetracyclines\nTetracyclines inhibit the growth of bacteria. They include doxycycline, tetracycline, and minocycline. They can be effective against S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, but bacteria that are resistant to penicillin are also often resistant to doxycycline. The side effects of tetracyclines include:\nBurning in the throat\nTooth discoloration\nAminoglycosides\nAminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, amikacin) are given by injection for very serious bacterial infections. They can be given only in combination with other antibiotics. Some are available in inhaled forms or by applying a solution directly to mucus membranes, skin, or body cavities. They can have very serious side effects, including:\nBalance problems\nKidney damage\nLincosamides\nLincosamides prevent bacteria from reproducing. The most common lincosamide is clindamycin (Cleocin). This antibiotic is useful against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, but not against H. influenzae.\nGlycopeptides\nGlycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) are used for Staphylococcus aureu s infections that have become resistant to standard antibiotics. The drug can be taken by mouth or given intravenously. The latest generation of glycopeptides, a derivative of vancomycin, is called telavancin. In studies of hospital-acquired pneumonia, it has shown promise for the treatment of Gram-positive pneumonia.\nTrimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Cotrim, Septra) is less expensive than amoxicillin. It is particularly useful for adults with mild bacterial upper respiratory infections who are allergic to penicillin. The drug is no longer effective against certain streptococcal strains. It should not be used in patients whose infections occur after dental work, or in people who are allergic to sulfa drugs. Allergic reactions can be very serious.\nOxazolidinone\nLinezolid (Zyvox) is the first antibacterial drug in a new class of man-made antibiotics called oxazolidinones. It has been shown to work against certain aerobic Gram-positive bacteria.\nOther Medications\nInhaled polymyxin, a drug used in cystic fibrosis patients, is showing some effectiveness against pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas and klebsiella.\nBack to Top\nSurgery\nAlthough most patients with pneumonia do not need invasive therapy, it may be necessary in patients with abscesses, empyema, or certain other complications.\nThoracotomy\nThoracotomy is the standard surgery for pneumonia. It requires general anesthesia and an incision to open the chest and view the lungs. This procedure allows the surgeon to remove dead or damaged lung tissue. In severe cases, the entire lobe of the lung is removed. This is called a lobectomy. Remaining healthy lung tissue re-expands after surgery to make up for tissue that has been removed.\nChest Tubes\nChest tubes are used to drain infected pleural fluid. Tubes are not typically required for pneumonia or abscesses. The tubes are inserted after the patient is given a local anesthetic. They remain in place for 2 - 4 days, and are removed in one quick movement. This can be very distressing, although some patients experience no discomfort. Complications of chest tubes include:\nAccidental injury to the lung\nFluid build-up within the lung if the pleural fluid is removed too rapidly\nInfection\nPerforation of the diaphragm\nRemoving the chest tubes may cause the lung to collapse. In this case, a chest tube may be needed to inflate the lung.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent serious respiratory infections such as pneumonia is to avoid sick people (if possible), and to practice good hygiene. [See In-Depth Report #94: Colds and influenza .]\nGood Hygiene and Preventing Transmission\nColds and flu are spread primarily from infected people who cough or sneeze. A very common method for transmitting a cold is by shaking hands. Research has found that washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of viral respiratory illnesses. Always wash your hands before eating and after going outside. Using ordinary soap is sufficient. Alcohol-based gels are also effective for everyday use, and may even kill cold viruses. If extreme hygiene is required, use alcohol-based rinses.\nAntibacterial soaps add little protection, particularly against viruses. In fact, one study suggested that common liquid dishwashing soaps are up to 100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Wiping surfaces with a solution that contains one part bleach to 10 parts water is very effective at killing viruses.\nChanging Hospital Practices\nBacteria abound in hospitals and long-term care facilities, and are particularly able to cause disease in areas with the sickest patients, such as intensive care units. Health care facilities are changing many of their practices and educating physicians, nurses, and therapists on how to reduce the likelihood of transmitting bacteria.\nVaccines\nViral Influenza Vaccines (Flu Shot)\nDescription of Vaccines. Vaccines against the flu (or a \"flu shot\") use inactivated (not live) viruses. They are designed to provoke the immune system to attack antigens contained on the surface of the virus. Antigens are foreign molecules that the immune system recognizes and targets for attack.\nTiming and Effectiveness of the Vaccine. Ideally, people should get a flu shot every October or November. However, it may take longer for a full supply of the vaccine to reach certain locations. In such cases, high-risk groups should get vaccinated first.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting the flu should have a flu vaccine.\nOlder children and adults require only a single shot each year. However, children under age 9 may need two shots given 1 month apart the first time they receive the flu vaccine, or if they have not previously received two doses during a flu season.\nSome people have a higher risk of the disease.\nThe following people should get a flu vaccine every year:\nChildren ages 6 months to 18 years\nChildren over age 5 who have a higher risk for serious illness\nHousehold contacts and caregivers of children or adults with high-risk conditions (breastfeeding women may receive the vaccine)\nYou should be vaccinated each year if you:\nAre age 50 or older\nHave chronic lung or heart disease\nHave sickle cell anemia or other inherited blood disease (hemoglobinopathy)\nLive in a nursing home or extended-care facility\nLive with people who have chronic health problems\nHave kidney disease, anemia, severe asthma, diabetes, or chronic liver disease\nHave a weakened immune system (including those with cancer or HIV/AIDS)\nReceive long-term treatment with steroids for any condition\nAre a pregnant woman\nAre a woman who will be pregnant during flu season\nThe flu shot is encouraged for:\nHealth care providers\nPeople who have in-home contact with children who are younger than age 5\nPeople who provide essential community services\nPeople living in dormitories or other crowded conditions\nAny adult age 18 - 50 who wants to reduce his or her chance of getting influenza\nPneumococcal Vaccines\nThe pneumococcal vaccine protects against S. pneumoniae bacteria, the most common cause of respiratory infections. There are two effective vaccines available:\n23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax, Pnu-Immune) for adults\n7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) for infants and young children\nExperts are now recommending that more people, including healthy elderly people, be given the pneumococcal vaccine, particularly in light of the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nClick the icon to see an image of pneumococcal pneumonia.\nPneumococcal Vaccine in Young Children. The pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) is very effective in children. Routine vaccination with the PCV7 vaccine began in 2000. The vaccine cut the rate of infant hospitalizations for pneumonia by a third between 1997 - 1999 and 2006. Possibly due to \"herd immunity,\" pneumonia-related hospital admissions in adults ages 18 - 39 also dropped by more than 25%.\nEvidence suggests that this vaccination, plus the vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae (an important cause of meningitis), have led to 25,000 fewer cases of serious bacterial infections each year.\nThe pneumococcal vaccine is now recommended by many experts for all children up to age 2. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) has now been added to the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule. The pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) is very effective in children. Studies are suggesting that it prevents common ear infections, as well as serious infections such as pneumonia.\nThe recommended schedule of immunization for Prevnar (PCV7) is four doses, given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 - 15 months of age. Infants starting immunization between 7 and 11 months should have three doses. Children starting their vaccinations between 12 and 23 months need only two doses. Those who are over 2 years old need only one dose.\nPneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine in Older Children and Adults. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is proving to help reduce the rate of pneumonia in older children and adults. Its benefits for adults are unclear.\nStill, pneumonia is declining among adults, which may be due to fewer infections transmitted from vaccinated young children.\nThe vaccine is recommended for:\nHigh-risk people age 2 or older (this includes persons with heart disease, all lung diseases except asthma, kidney disease, alcoholism, diabetes, cirrhosis, and leaks of cerebrospinal fluid)\nEveryone ages 65 and older\nThose with sickle cell disease\nThose who have had their spleen removed\nPersons who live in nursing homes (extended-care facilities)\nPersons who live in any institution where there are people with chronic health problems\nPersons with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as cancer, HIV, or organ transplantation\nPersons who receive long-term medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants), including steroids\nAlaskan natives and certain Native American populations\nA single dose of the vaccine is given by injection. One dose works for most people. However, re-vaccination is recommended for people over age 65 who received their first dose before age 65 and more than 5 years ago. Other high-risk people, including those with a weakened immune system or spleen problems may also need a second dose. You should speak with your doctor about specific reasons for vaccination and revaccination.\nBecause the vaccine is inactive, it is safe for pregnant women and people with immune problems. In fact, when the vaccine is given to pregnant women, it may actually protect their infants against certain respiratory infections.\nProtection lasts for more than 6 years in most people, although it may wear off faster in elderly people than in younger adults. Anyone at risk for serious pneumonia should be revaccinated 6 years after the first dose, including those who were vaccinated before age 65. Later booster doses, however, are not recommended.\nPreventing Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Pneumonia in Children\nA simple way to help prevent RSV infection is to wash your hands often, especially before touching your baby. It is important to make sure that other people, especially caregivers, take precautions to avoid giving RSV to your baby. The following simple steps can help protect your baby:\nInsist that others wash their hands with warm water and soap before touching your baby.\nHave others avoid contact with the baby if they have a cold or fever. It may be helpful for them to wear a mask.\nBe aware that kissing the baby can spread RSV infection.\nTry to keep young children away from your baby. RSV is very common among young children, and easily spreads from child to child.\nDo not smoke inside your house, car, or anywhere near your baby. Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of RSV illness.\nPrevention of RSV. Two medications have been approved for protecting high-risk children against RSV pneumonia:\nPalivizumab (Synagis) is known as a monoclonal antibody, a genetically engineered antibody that targets the RSV virus. It is given by an injection into the muscle. Early studies of motavizumab, another monoclonal antibody in development, also show that it protects against RSV.\nRSV immune globulin (RespiGam) is made up of antibodies to RSV that are taken from the blood of healthy infants. RespiGam is given as a shot.\nVitamins\nAlthough some research supports the use of vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia, most research says it's too early to recommend vitamin C supplements for the general population. These supplements may be helpful for pneumonia patients who are deficient in the vitamin, however.\n"}, {"score": 450.29105, "uuid": "a51f95b8-4092-5d29-b4e2-b02fa947f9e2", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0604wb-63-27134", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/TestsandProcedures/item/Pneumonia", "page_rank": 1.2366407e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Pneumonia Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "<em>what</em> follow-up and preventive care are needed Whether patients are treated <em>at</em> home <em>or</em> admitted to the hospital, receiving their first dose of antibiotics quickly improves the outcome of the illness and the speed <em>at</em> which they get <em>better</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Findings on a Physical Exam. Concerning findings include:\nAltered mental status (confused, less responsive)\nAppearance of being dehydrated, especially if the person is unable to drink fluids\nFast breathing (more than 30 breaths per minute)\nHeart rate greater than 120 beats per minute\nSystolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg\nTemperature greater than 104 \u00b0F\nLaboratory and X-ray Findings. Laboratory findings that are of concern include:\nElevated blood sugar\nFluid in the sac around the lung (on chest x-ray)\nLow oxygen in the blood\nLow sodium levels\nPoor kidney function\nSignificant anemia (hematocrit less than 30%)\nPatients with very few of these risks often can be discharged with outpatient care only. This determination can often be made with a simple physical examination and history. Sometimes a patient only needs to be hospitalized for 24 hours for observation.\nPatients with higher scores on these assessment tests often have many risk factors and usually are hospitalized.\nWhen possible, treatment of community-acquired pneumonia should be started within 4 hours of admission to the emergency room or hospital to reduce the chances of mortality and decrease the amount of time a patient needs to spend in the hospital.\nHome care may be possible, even in severe cases, when there is good support and available home nursing services. Often, caregivers can even be trained to administer intravenous antibiotics and chest therapy to patients at home.\nHome Treatment\nThe following tips are suggested:\nDrink plenty of liquids.\nDo not suppress a cough. Coughing is an important reflex for clearing the lungs. Some doctors advise taking expectorants, such as guaifenesin (Breonesin, Glycotuss, Glytuss, Hytuss, Naldecon Senior EX, Robitussin) to loosen mucus. However, there is no proof that any of these products make much difference in a patient's outcome.\nMild pain can be treated with aspirin (in adults only), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\nFor severe pain, codeine or another stronger pain reliever may be prescribed. It should be noted, however, that codeine and other narcotics suppress coughing, so they should be used with care in pneumonia. Such pain relievers often require monitoring.\nA laboratory study reported that aromatic oils containing oregano, thyme, and rosewood destroyed S. pneumoniae. It is not known whether they have any effect on pneumonia in people.\nPractice chest therapy.\nHospitalization Guidelines\nTreatment. If the pneumonia is severe enough for hospitalization, the standard treatment is intravenous antibiotics for 5 - 8 days. In cases of uncomplicated pneumonia, many patients may need only 2 or 3 days of intravenous antibiotics followed by oral therapy. Antibiotics taken by mouth are prescribed when the patient has improved substantially or leaves the hospital.\nITSA/ATS guidelines recommend that patients admitted to the hospital (but not the ICU) be treated with fluoroquinolones or a beta-lactam plus a macrolide (preferably cefotaxime or ceftriaxone and ampicillin).\nDuration of Stay. Patients should remain in the hospital until all their vital signs are stable. Most patients become stabilized in 3 days. Many experts use seven variables to measure stability and to determine whether the patient can go home:\nTemperature. Some experts believe that patients can go home when their temperature drops to 101 \u00b0F. Stricter criteria require that it be at or close to 98.6 \u00b0F.\nRespiration rate. Goal is a normal breathing rate, although expert opinion differs on the degree of normality required for discharge.\nHeart rate. Goal is 100 beats per minute or less.\nBlood pressure. Goal is systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater.\nOxygenation. Goal is determined by the physician.\nThe ability to eat. Goal is regular appetite.\nMental function. Goal is normal.\nPatients or their families should discuss these criteria with their doctor.\nChest Therapy\nChest therapy using incentive spirometry, rhythmic inhalation and coughing, and chest tapping are all important techniques to loosen the mucus and move it out of the lungs. It should be used both in the hospital and during recovery at home.\nIncentive Spirometry. The patient uses an incentive spirometer at regular intervals to improve breathing and loosen sputum. The spirometer is a hand-held clear plastic device that includes a breathing tube and a container with a movable gauge. The patient exhales and then inhales forcefully through the tube, using the pressure of the inhalation to raise the gauge to the highest level possible.\nRhythmic Breathing and Coughing. During recovery, the patient performs rhythmic breathing and coughing every 4 hours:\nBefore starting the breathing exercise, the patient should tap lightly on the chest to loosen mucus in the lung. If available, a caregiver should also tap on the patient's back.\nThe patient inhales rhythmically and deeply three or four times.\nThe patient then coughs as deeply as possible with the goal of producing sputum.\nBack to Top\nMedications\nDozens of antibiotics are available for treating pneumonia, but selecting the best drug is sometimes difficult. Patients with pneumonia need an antibiotic that is effective against the organism causing the disease. When the organism is unknown, \"empiric therapy\" is given, meaning the doctor chooses which antibiotic is likely to work based on factors such as the patient's age, health, and severity of the illness.\nIn determining the appropriate antibiotic, the physician must first answer a number of questions:\nHow severe is the pneumonia? Mild-to-moderate cases can be treated at home with oral antibiotics. Severe pneumonia usually needs intravenous antibiotics administered in the hospital.\nIf the organism causing the pneumonia is not known, was the disorder community- or hospital-acquired? Different organisms are usually involved in each setting, and the physician can use this information to guess the most likely organism causing the pneumonia.\nIf the organism is known, is it typical or atypical? Community-acquired pneumonias, for example, are usually caused by the typical bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis, which were previously treated with related antibiotics. These antibiotics do not treat organisms such as legionella, mycoplasma, or chlamydia. These organisms are generally treated with a macrolide or possibly a newer quinolone.\nDoes the patient have an impaired immune system? Antibiotics used to treat such patients may differ from those used in patients with healthy immune systems.\nOnce an antibiotic has been chosen, there are still difficulties:\nIndividuals respond differently to the same antibiotic, depending on their age, health, size, and other factors.\nPatients can be allergic to certain antibiotics, thus requiring alternatives.\nPatients may have strains of bacteria that are resistant to certain antibiotics.\nAntibiotic Treatments for Community-Acquired Pneumonia\nJoint guidelines issued in 2007 by the Infectious Disease Society of America and the American Thoracic Society (ITSA/ATS) recommend that mild CAP in otherwise healthy patients be treated with oral macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin).\nMany patients with heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or other co-existing conditions may still be treated as outpatients. However, they should be given a fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, or levofloxacin) or a beta-lactam (preferably high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate), plus a macrolide, unless they live in an area with high S. pneumoniae resistance to macrolides.\nResearch has not pinpointed an exact duration of antibiotic therapy. Current recommendations call for 7 - 10 days of treatment for S. pneumoniae and 10 - 14 days for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. However, some research suggests that patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia may be successfully treated with 7 days or less of antibiotics. The shorter treatment may increase patient tolerance, and improve the likelihood that patients will stick to the treatment regimen. It will also help limit the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.\nFor a more detailed discussion of the different types of antibiotics, see the \"Antibiotic Classes\" section below.\nMany cases of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by S. pneumoniae -- Gram-positive bacteria that usually respond to antibiotics known as beta-lactams (which include penicillin), and to macrolides. However, resistant strains of S. pneumoniae are increasingly common. Most resistant strains respond to fluoroquinolines such as levofloxacin (Levaquin), gemifloxacin (Factive), or moxifloxacin (Avelox). Another common cause of community-acquired pneumonia is H. influenzae.\nIn addition, other important causes of CAP, particularly in younger people, are atypical bacteria, which respond to macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin), ketolides, or newer fluoroquinolones.\nAntibiotic treatment for CAP is determined by a number of factors, including:\nThe patient's history of antibiotic therapy\nCo-existing diseases (such as COPD, diabetes, and heart failure)\nWhether the patient is well enough to be treated at home or requires hospitalization or nursing home care.\nTreatment options can include a single drug, such as levofloxacin or doxycycline, or combination treatment, such as a macrolide administered with a beta-lactam.\nAntibiotics taken by mouth are generally enough for patients whose CAP is mild enough to be treated at home. Intravenous antibiotics are required for hospitalized patients with CAP. Antibiotic therapy should be given for a minimum of 5 days -- longer if the patient still has a fever and more than one sign of continuing severe illness.\nAntibiotic Treatments for Hospital-Acquired (Nosocomial) Pneumonia\nA broad range of antibiotics is available for treating hospital-acquired pneumonias. Factors that may determine the choice of an antibiotic include:\nImmune status\nPatterns of antibiotic resistance within a particular hospital or community\nRecent antibiotic usage\nType of bacteria causing the pneumonia\nUse of ventilators\nTreatment of Viral Infections\nThere are not as many choices for treating viral pneumonia. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have been the recommended drugs for influenza A or B infections, but many strains of influenza A have become resistant. Their use is only recommended if they are started in the first 48 hours of symptoms. Taken early, these medications may be effective in reducing symptoms and duration of illness. [See In-Depth Report #94: Colds and influenza . ]\nPatients with viral pneumonias are at risk for what are called \"superinfections,\" which generally refers to a secondary bacterial infection, usually caused by S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, or H. influenzae. Doctors most commonly recommend treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, cefuroxime, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if these secondary infections occur.\nPatients with pneumonia caused by varicella-zoster and herpes simplex viruses are usually admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous acyclovir for 7 days.\nNo antiviral drugs have been proven effective in adults with RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, the SARS coronavirus, or hantavirus. Treatment is largely supportive, with patients receiving oxygen and ventilator therapy as needed.\nTreatment of RSV in Children. Ribavarin is the first treatment approved for RSV pneumonia, although it has only modest benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends this drug for children who are at high risk for serious complications of RSV.\nSide Effects of Antibiotics\nMost antibiotics have the following side effects (although specific antibiotics may have other side effects or fewer of the standard ones):\nAllergic reactions (most commonly with medications derived from penicillin or sulfa). These reactions can range from mild skin rashes to rare but severe -- even life-threatening -- anaphylactic shock.\nInfection with Clostridium difficile, the bacteria responsible for causing severe diarrhea, inflammation of the colon (colitis), and abdominal pain (with overuse of antibiotics). This condition can be fatal.\nInteractions with certain drugs, including some over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Patients should inform their physician of all medications and OTC preparations they are taking and of any drug allergies they might have.\nStomach problems (most common side effect).\nVaginal infections. Taking acidophilus supplements or eating yogurt with active acidophilius cultures may help restore healthy bacteria that reduce the risk for such infections.\nAntibiotic and Antiviral Drug Classes\nBeta-Lactams\nBeta-lactam antibiotics share common chemical features. They include penicillins, cephalosporins, and some newer similar medications. They interfere with bacterial cell walls.\nPenicillins. Penicillin was the first antibiotic. There are many forms of this still-important drug:\nNatural penicillins include penicillin G (for intravenous use) and V (for oral use).\nPenicillin derivatives called aminopenicillins, particularly amoxicillin (Amoxil, Polymox, Trimox, Wymox, or any generic formulation), are now the most common penicillins used. Amoxicillin is inexpensive and, at one time, was highly effective against S. pneumoniae. Unfortunately, bacterial resistance to amoxicillin has increased significantly, both among S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Ampicillin is similar and is an alternative to amoxicillin, but requires more doses and has more severe gastrointestinal side effects.\nAmoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) is a type of penicillin that works against a wide variety of bacteria. An extended-release form has been approved for treating adults with community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacterial strains that have become partially resistant to penicillin.\nAntistaphylococcal penicillins were developed to treat Staphylococcus aureus. The standard drug was methicillin, but it is no longer used routinely, due to very high rates of resistance in hospital-acquired pneumonias. Resistance in community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus is also increasing. Alternatives include vancomycin and linezolid. There are also other options for this type of bacteria.\nPenicillins used against Pseudomonas aeruginosa include ticarcillin and piperacillin. Piperacillin is more effective than ticarcillin.\nMany people have a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin, but research suggests that the allergy may not occur again in a significant number of adults. Skin tests are available to help determine if those with a history of penicillin allergies could use these important antibiotics.\nCephalosporins. Most of these antibiotics are not very effective against bacteria that have developed resistance to penicillin. They are classed according to their generation:\nFirst generation includes cephalexin (Keflex), cefadroxil (Duricef, Ultracef), and cephradine (Velosef).\nSecond generation includes cefaclor (Ceclor), cefuroxime (Ceftin), cefprozil (Cefzil), and loracarbef (Lorabid).\nThird generation includes cefpodoxime (Vantin), cefdinir (Omnicef) cefditoren (Sprectracef), cefixime (Suprax), and ceftibuten (Cedex). Ceftriaxone (Rocephin) is an injected cephalosporin. These are effective against a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria.\nOther Beta-Lactam Agents. Carbapenems include meropenem (Merrem), biapenem, faropenem, ertapenem (Invanz) and combinations (imipenem/cilastatin [Primaxin]). These drugs are used to treat a wide variety of bacteria. They are now used for serious hospital-acquired infections and for bacteria that have become resistant to other beta-lactams. Imipenem has serious side effects when used alone, so it is given in combination with cilastatin to offset these adverse effects. The newer drugs are less toxic, although they may not be as effective.\nSanfetrinem, a new beta-lactam antibiotic known as a trinem, is proving to be effective against S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis.\nCeftobiprole is an investigational beta-lactam for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria. Other anti-MRSA beta-lactams in development include:\nCS-023/RO-4908463, a carbapenem\nFluoroquinolones\nFluoroquinolones (quinolones) interfere with bacteria's genetic material to prevent them from reproducing.\nCiprofloxacin (Cipro), a second-generation quinolone, remains the most potent quinolone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is not very effective against Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\"Respiratory\" quinolones are currently the most effective drugs available for a wide range of bacteria. Such drugs include levofloxacin (Levaquin) and gemifloxacin (Factive). Some of the newer fluoroquinolones only need to be taken once a day.\nThe fourth-generation quinolones moxifloxacin (Avelox) and clinafloxacin (which is still under development) are proving to be effective against anaerobic bacteria.\nS. pneumoniae -- strains resistant to the \"respiratory\" quinolones are uncommon in the U.S., but resistance is dramatically increasing.\nMany quinolones cause side effects, including:\nNervous system, mental, and heart problems\nSensitivity to light\nPregnant women should not take these medications. The drugs also enhance the potency of oral anti-clotting drugs.\nMacrolides, Azalides, and Ketolides\nMacrolides and azalides also affect the genetics of bacteria. These medications include:\nAzithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax)\nErythromycin\nRoxithromycin (Rulid)\nThese antibiotics are effective against atypical bacteria such as mycoplasma and chlamydia. Macrolides are also used in some cases for S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, but there is increasing bacterial resistance to these antibiotics. All but erythromycin are effective against H. influenzae. Macrolide-resistance rates doubled between 1995 and 1999 as more and more children were being treated with these antibiotics. Some research suggests these drugs may reduce the risk of a first heart attack in some patients by reducing inflammation in the blood vessels.\nExtended-release (ER) azithromycin (Zmax) is the first anti-pneumonia antibiotic that can be given in a single dose. It is effective against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria. Studies have shown the results to be equal to those achieved with 7 days of levofloxacin or clarithromycin ER in patients with CAP. A single-dose antibiotic decreases the likelihood that a patient will stop taking the antibiotic early, which rapidly contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\nKetolides. Ketolides are a new class of antibiotic drugs. They are derived from erythromycin and were developed to combat bacteria that have become resistant to macrolides. Telithromycin (Ketek), the first antibiotic in the ketolide class, was approved by the FDA in 2004 for treating community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\nIn February 2007, the FDA withdrew approval of Ketek for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The agency decided that the serious risks of telithromycin outweigh its benefits for sinusitis treatment. The decision followed several 2006 reports of patient deaths due to severe liver damage.\nTelithromycin is still approved for the treatment of CAP, but the drug carries a black box warning noting the potentially serious side effects, including:\nLiver failure\nNerve and muscle (neuromuscular) problems\nVision problems\nBecause of these side effects, telithromycin is only approved for patients with mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin- or macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Other treatments are as effective, and are safer.\nTetracyclines\nTetracyclines inhibit the growth of bacteria. They include doxycycline, tetracycline, and minocycline. They can be effective against S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis, but bacteria that are resistant to penicillin are also often resistant to doxycycline. The side effects of tetracyclines include:\nBurning in the throat\nTooth discoloration\nAminoglycosides\nAminoglycosides (gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, amikacin) are given by injection for very serious bacterial infections. They can be given only in combination with other antibiotics. Some are available in inhaled forms or by applying a solution directly to mucus membranes, skin, or body cavities. They can have very serious side effects, including:\nBalance problems\nKidney damage\nLincosamides\nLincosamides prevent bacteria from reproducing. The most common lincosamide is clindamycin (Cleocin). This antibiotic is useful against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, but not against H. influenzae.\nGlycopeptides\nGlycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) are used for Staphylococcus aureu s infections that have become resistant to standard antibiotics. The drug can be taken by mouth or given intravenously. The latest generation of glycopeptides, a derivative of vancomycin, is called telavancin. In studies of hospital-acquired pneumonia, it has shown promise for the treatment of Gram-positive pneumonia.\nTrimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Cotrim, Septra) is less expensive than amoxicillin. It is particularly useful for adults with mild bacterial upper respiratory infections who are allergic to penicillin. The drug is no longer effective against certain streptococcal strains. It should not be used in patients whose infections occur after dental work, or in people who are allergic to sulfa drugs. Allergic reactions can be very serious.\nOxazolidinone\nLinezolid (Zyvox) is the first antibacterial drug in a new class of man-made antibiotics called oxazolidinones. It has been shown to work against certain aerobic Gram-positive bacteria.\nOther Medications\nInhaled polymyxin, a drug used in cystic fibrosis patients, is showing some effectiveness against pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas and klebsiella.\nBack to Top\nSurgery\nAlthough most patients with pneumonia do not need invasive therapy, it may be necessary in patients with abscesses, empyema, or certain other complications.\nThoracotomy\nThoracotomy is the standard surgery for pneumonia. It requires general anesthesia and an incision to open the chest and view the lungs. This procedure allows the surgeon to remove dead or damaged lung tissue. In severe cases, the entire lobe of the lung is removed. This is called a lobectomy. Remaining healthy lung tissue re-expands after surgery to make up for tissue that has been removed.\nChest Tubes\nChest tubes are used to drain infected pleural fluid. Tubes are not typically required for pneumonia or abscesses. The tubes are inserted after the patient is given a local anesthetic. They remain in place for 2 - 4 days, and are removed in one quick movement. This can be very distressing, although some patients experience no discomfort. Complications of chest tubes include:\nAccidental injury to the lung\nFluid build-up within the lung if the pleural fluid is removed too rapidly\nInfection\nPerforation of the diaphragm\nRemoving the chest tubes may cause the lung to collapse. In this case, a chest tube may be needed to inflate the lung.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent serious respiratory infections such as pneumonia is to avoid sick people (if possible), and to practice good hygiene. [See In-Depth Report #94: Colds and influenza .]\nGood Hygiene and Preventing Transmission\nColds and flu are spread primarily from infected people who cough or sneeze. A very common method for transmitting a cold is by shaking hands. Research has found that washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of viral respiratory illnesses. Always wash your hands before eating and after going outside. Using ordinary soap is sufficient. Alcohol-based gels are also effective for everyday use, and may even kill cold viruses. If extreme hygiene is required, use alcohol-based rinses.\nAntibacterial soaps add little protection, particularly against viruses. In fact, one study suggested that common liquid dishwashing soaps are up to 100 times more effective than antibacterial soaps in killing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Wiping surfaces with a solution that contains one part bleach to 10 parts water is very effective at killing viruses.\nChanging Hospital Practices\nBacteria abound in hospitals and long-term care facilities, and are particularly able to cause disease in areas with the sickest patients, such as intensive care units. Health care facilities are changing many of their practices and educating physicians, nurses, and therapists on how to reduce the likelihood of transmitting bacteria.\nVaccines\nViral Influenza Vaccines (Flu Shot)\nDescription of Vaccines. Vaccines against the flu (or a \"flu shot\") use inactivated (not live) viruses. They are designed to provoke the immune system to attack antigens contained on the surface of the virus. Antigens are foreign molecules that the immune system recognizes and targets for attack.\nTiming and Effectiveness of the Vaccine. Ideally, people should get a flu shot every October or November. However, it may take longer for a full supply of the vaccine to reach certain locations. In such cases, high-risk groups should get vaccinated first.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting the flu should have a flu vaccine.\nOlder children and adults require only a single shot each year. However, children under age 9 may need two shots given 1 month apart the first time they receive the flu vaccine, or if they have not previously received two doses during a flu season.\nSome people have a higher risk of the disease.\nThe following people should get a flu vaccine every year:\nChildren ages 6 months to 18 years\nChildren over age 5 who have a higher risk for serious illness\nHousehold contacts and caregivers of children or adults with high-risk conditions (breastfeeding women may receive the vaccine)\nYou should be vaccinated each year if you:\nAre age 50 or older\nHave chronic lung or heart disease\nHave sickle cell anemia or other inherited blood disease (hemoglobinopathy)\nLive in a nursing home or extended-care facility\nLive with people who have chronic health problems\nHave kidney disease, anemia, severe asthma, diabetes, or chronic liver disease\nHave a weakened immune system (including those with cancer or HIV/AIDS)\nReceive long-term treatment with steroids for any condition\nAre a pregnant woman\nAre a woman who will be pregnant during flu season\nThe flu shot is encouraged for:\nHealth care providers\nPeople who have in-home contact with children who are younger than age 5\nPeople who provide essential community services\nPeople living in dormitories or other crowded conditions\nAny adult age 18 - 50 who wants to reduce his or her chance of getting influenza\nPneumococcal Vaccines\nThe pneumococcal vaccine protects against S. pneumoniae bacteria, the most common cause of respiratory infections. There are two effective vaccines available:\n23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumovax, Pnu-Immune) for adults\n7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) for infants and young children\nExperts are now recommending that more people, including healthy elderly people, be given the pneumococcal vaccine, particularly in light of the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nClick the icon to see an image of pneumococcal pneumonia.\nPneumococcal Vaccine in Young Children. The pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) is very effective in children. Routine vaccination with the PCV7 vaccine began in 2000. The vaccine cut the rate of infant hospitalizations for pneumonia by a third between 1997 - 1999 and 2006. Possibly due to \"herd immunity,\" pneumonia-related hospital admissions in adults ages 18 - 39 also dropped by more than 25%.\nEvidence suggests that this vaccination, plus the vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae (an important cause of meningitis), have led to 25,000 fewer cases of serious bacterial infections each year.\nThe pneumococcal vaccine is now recommended by many experts for all children up to age 2. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) has now been added to the Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule. The pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar or PCV7) is very effective in children. Studies are suggesting that it prevents common ear infections, as well as serious infections such as pneumonia.\nThe recommended schedule of immunization for Prevnar (PCV7) is four doses, given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 - 15 months of age. Infants starting immunization between 7 and 11 months should have three doses. Children starting their vaccinations between 12 and 23 months need only two doses. Those who are over 2 years old need only one dose.\nPneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine in Older Children and Adults. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is proving to help reduce the rate of pneumonia in older children and adults. Its benefits for adults are unclear.\nStill, pneumonia is declining among adults, which may be due to fewer infections transmitted from vaccinated young children.\nThe vaccine is recommended for:\nHigh-risk people age 2 or older (this includes persons with heart disease, all lung diseases except asthma, kidney disease, alcoholism, diabetes, cirrhosis, and leaks of cerebrospinal fluid)\nEveryone ages 65 and older\nThose with sickle cell disease\nThose who have had their spleen removed\nPersons who live in nursing homes (extended-care facilities)\nPersons who live in any institution where there are people with chronic health problems\nPersons with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as cancer, HIV, or organ transplantation\nPersons who receive long-term medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants), including steroids\nAlaskan natives and certain Native American populations\nA single dose of the vaccine is given by injection. One dose works for most people. However, re-vaccination is recommended for people over age 65 who received their first dose before age 65 and more than 5 years ago. Other high-risk people, including those with a weakened immune system or spleen problems may also need a second dose. You should speak with your doctor about specific reasons for vaccination and revaccination.\nBecause the vaccine is inactive, it is safe for pregnant women and people with immune problems. In fact, when the vaccine is given to pregnant women, it may actually protect their infants against certain respiratory infections.\nProtection lasts for more than 6 years in most people, although it may wear off faster in elderly people than in younger adults. Anyone at risk for serious pneumonia should be revaccinated 6 years after the first dose, including those who were vaccinated before age 65. Later booster doses, however, are not recommended.\nPreventing Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Pneumonia in Children\nA simple way to help prevent RSV infection is to wash your hands often, especially before touching your baby. It is important to make sure that other people, especially caregivers, take precautions to avoid giving RSV to your baby. The following simple steps can help protect your baby:\nInsist that others wash their hands with warm water and soap before touching your baby.\nHave others avoid contact with the baby if they have a cold or fever. It may be helpful for them to wear a mask.\nBe aware that kissing the baby can spread RSV infection.\nTry to keep young children away from your baby. RSV is very common among young children, and easily spreads from child to child.\nDo not smoke inside your house, car, or anywhere near your baby. Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of RSV illness.\nPrevention of RSV. Two medications have been approved for protecting high-risk children against RSV pneumonia:\nPalivizumab (Synagis) is known as a monoclonal antibody, a genetically engineered antibody that targets the RSV virus. It is given by an injection into the muscle. Early studies of motavizumab, another monoclonal antibody in development, also show that it protects against RSV.\nRSV immune globulin (RespiGam) is made up of antibodies to RSV that are taken from the blood of healthy infants. RespiGam is given as a shot.\nVitamins\nAlthough some research supports the use of vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia, most research says it's too early to recommend vitamin C supplements for the general population. These supplements may be helpful for pneumonia patients who are deficient in the vitamin, however.\n"}, {"score": 444.9121, "uuid": "e941943f-ca93-5a62-8a15-2574553491d6", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0301wb-63-06422", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/DiseasesandConditions/item/Shingles+and+chickenpox+%28Varicella-zost", "page_rank": 1.1857029e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Shingles and chickenpox (Varicella-zoster virus) Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Studies suggest significant pain relief <em>in</em> patients with PHN and reduction <em>in</em> the use of opioids.

The vaccine can prevent chickenpox or reduce the severity of the illness if it is used within 3 days, and possibly up to 5 days, after exposure to the infection.\nThe childhood chickenpox vaccine can also be given as part of a combination vaccine (Proquad) that combines measles, mumps, rubella (together called MMR), and varicella in one product. However, recent data indicate that combining varicella and MMR vaccinations into one shot doubles the risk for febrile (fever-related) seizures in children ages 12 - 24 months compared to giving separate MMR and varicella injections. Parents should consider the lower risk associated with separate injections.\nRecommendations for the Chickenpox Vaccine in Children\nIn 2007, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) revised the immunization schedule for the chickenpox vaccine. The new schedule recommends that children receive TWO doses of the chickenpox vaccine with:\nThe first dose administered when the child is 12 - 15 months years of age, and\nThe second dose administered when the child is 4 - 6 years of age\nFor children who have previously received one dose of the chickenpox vaccine, the ACIP recommends that they receive a 'catch-up' second dose during their regular doctor's visit. This second dose can be given at any time as long as it is at least 3 months after the first dose. Experts pushed for the new second-dose policy due to a number of recent chickenpox outbreaks among previously vaccinated schoolchildren.\nChildren most at risk for having chickenpox after having been vaccinated only one time are ages 8 - 12 years and have generally been vaccinated at least 5 years before their current chickenpox infection.\nRecommendations for the Chickenpox Vaccine in Adults\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that every healthy adult without a known history of chickenpox be vaccinated. Adults should receive 2 doses of the vaccine, 4 - 8 weeks apart. Adults in the following groups should especially consider vaccination:\nThose with high risk of exposure or transmission (hospital or day care workers, parents of young children)\nPeople in contact with those who have compromised immune systems\nNonpregnant women of childbearing age\nInternational travelers\nAs with other live-virus vaccines, the chickenpox vaccine is not recommended for:\nWomen who are pregnant or who may become pregnant within 30 days of vaccination.\nPeople whose immune systems are compromised by disease or drugs (such as after organ transplantation). Experts report that the vaccine is safe in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Certain children who are HIV-positive may be candidates for the vaccine. An inactivated chickenpox vaccine may be safe for patients undergoing bone marrow transplants when given before and after the operation.\nPatients who cannot be vaccinated but who are exposed to chickenpox receive immune globulin antibodies against varicella virus. This helps prevent complications of the disease if they become infected.\nSide Effects of the Varicella (Chickenpox) Vaccine\nDiscomfort at the Injection Site. Fewer than 80% of vaccine recipients have pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site.\nSevere Side Effects. Only about 5% of adverse reactions are serious. These reactions include seizures, pneumonia, anaphylactic reaction, encephalitis, Stevens-Johnsons syndrome, neuropathy, herpes zoster, and blood abnormalities.\nRisk of Transmission. The vaccine may produce a mild rash within about a month of the vaccination, which can transmit chickenpox to others. Individuals who have recently been vaccinated should avoid close contact with anyone who might be susceptible to severe complications from chickenpox until the risk for a rash passes.\nLater Infection. Months or even years after the vaccination, some people develop a mild infection called modified varicella-like syndrome (MVLS). The condition appears to be less contagious and has fewer complications than naturally acquired chickenpox.\nShingles Vaccine\nIn 2006, a shingles vaccine was approved for use in the United States. The zoster vaccine (Zostavax) is a stronger version of the chickenpox vaccine. Study results suggest that the zoster vaccine can prevent about half of all shingles cases and two-thirds of postherpetic neuralgia cases. The CDC recommends that all adults age 60 years and older who have intact immune systems should receive this vaccine.\nVaricella-Zoster Immune Globulin\nVaricella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIG) is a substance that triggers an immune response against the varicella-zoster virus. It is used to protect high-risk patients who are exposed to chickenpox. Such groups include:\nPregnant women with no history of chickenpox\nNewborn infants whose mothers had signs or symptoms of chickenpox around the time of delivery (5 days before to 2 days after)\nPremature infants\nImmunocompromised children and adults with no antibodies to VZV\nRecipients of bone-marrow transplants (even if they have had chickenpox)\nPatients with a debilitating disease (even if they have had chickenpox)\nFor these patients, VariZIG should be given within 96 hours of exposure to someone with chickenpox. (Note: VariZIG is a new formulation of an older drug called VZIG, which is no longer being produced.)\nBack to Top\nDiagnosis\nBoth chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster) can usually be diagnosed by symptoms alone. If a diagnosis is still unclear after a physical examination, diagnostic tests may be required.\nRuling out Other Disorders\nEither variation of the virus may be confused with other disorders.\nRuling out Disorders that Resemble Chickenpox. Chickenpox, particularly in early stages, may be confused with herpes simplex (the disorder more commonly referred to as \"herpes\"), or impetigo, insect bites, and scabies.\nRuling out Disorders that Resemble Shingles. The early prodrome stage of shingles can cause severe pain on one side of the lower back, chest, or abdomen before the rash appears. It therefore may be mistaken for disorders, such as gallstones, that cause acute pain in internal organs.\nIn the active rash stage, shingles may be confused with herpes simplex, particularly in young adults, if the blisters occur on the buttocks or around the mouth. Herpes simplex, however, does not usually generate chronic pain.\nA diagnosis may be difficult if herpes zoster takes a non-typical course in the face, such as with Bell's palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome, or if it affects the eye or causes fever and delirium.\nTest to Identify the Virus\nIn most cases of chickenpox and shingles, the symptoms alone are enough for a health care provider to make a diagnosis. If the symptoms are not straightforward in some patients, such as those who are immunosuppressed, the doctor performs one or more additional tests to detect the virus itself. The tests usually aim to distinguish between varicella-zoster and herpes simplex viruses.\nVirus Culture. A viral culture uses specimens taken from the blister, fluid in the blister, or sometimes spinal fluid. They are sent to a laboratory, where it takes 1 - 14 days to detect the virus in the preparation made from the specimen. It is also sometimes used in vaccinated patients to determine if a varicella-like infection is caused by a natural virus or by the vaccine. This test is useful, but it is sometimes difficult to recover the virus from the samples.\nImmunofluorescence Assay. Immunofluorescence is a diagnostic technique used to identify antibodies to a specific virus. In the case of herpes zoster, the technique uses ultraviolet rays applied to a preparation composed of cells taken from the zoster blisters. The specific characteristics of the light as seen through a microscope will identify the presence of the antibodies. This test is less expensive than a culture, more accurate, and results are faster.\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques use a piece of the DNA of the virus, which is then replicated millions of times until the virus is detectable. This technique is expensive but is useful for unusual cases, such as identifying infection in the central nervous system.\nBack to Top\nTreatment for Chickenpox\nAcetaminophen. Patients with chickenpox do not have to stay in bed unless fever and flu symptoms are severe. To relieve discomfort, a child can take acetaminophen (Tylenol), with doses determined by the doctor. A child should never be given aspirin, or medications containing aspirin, as aspirin increases the risk for a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome.\nSoothing Baths. Frequent baths are particularly helpful in relieving itching, when used with preparations of finely ground (colloidal) oatmeal. Commercial preparations (Aveeno) are available in drugstores, or one can be made at home by grinding or blending dry oatmeal into a fine powder. Use about 2 cups per bath. The oatmeal will not dissolve, and the water will have a scum. Adding baking soda (1/2 - 1 cup) to a bath may also help.\nLotions. Patients can apply calamine lotion and similar over-the-counter preparations to the blisters to help dry them out and soothe the skin.\nAntihistamines. For severe itching, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is useful and may help children sleep.\nPreventing Scratching. Small children may have to wear mittens so that they don't scratch the blisters and cause a secondary infection. All patients with varicella, including adults, should have their nails trimmed short.\nAcyclovir for Chickenpox\nAcyclovir is an antiviral drug that may be used in adult varicella patients or those of any age with a high risk for complications and severe forms of chickenpox. The drug may also benefit smokers with chickenpox, who are at higher than normal risk for pneumonia. Some experts recommend its use for children who catch chickenpox from other family members because such patients are at risk for more serious cases. To be effective, oral acyclovir must be taken within 24 hours of the onset of the rash. Early intravenous administration of acyclovir is an essential treatment for chickenpox pneumonia.\nTreatment for an Acute Shingles Attack\nThe treatment goals for an acute attack of herpes zoster include:\nReduce pain\nHasten healing of blisters\nPrevent the disease from spreading\nOver-the-counter (OTC) remedies are often effective in reducing the pain of an attack. Antiviral drugs (acyclovir and others), oral corticosteroids, or both are sometimes given to patients with severe symptoms, particularly if they are older and at risk for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In addition, psychological therapies aimed at coping and reducing the effects of pain may be useful.\nHome Remedies for Shingles\nApplied Cold. Cold compresses soaked in Burrow's solution (an OTC remedy) and cool baths may help relieve the blisters. It is important not to break blisters as this can cause infection. Experts advise against warm treatments, which can intensify itching. Patients should wear loose clothing and use clean loose gauze coverings over the affected areas.\nItch Relief. In general, to prevent or reduce itching, home treatments are similar to those used for chickenpox. Patients can try antihistamines (particularly Benadryl), oatmeal baths, and calamine lotion.\nOver-the-Counter Pain Relievers. For an acute shingles attack, patients may take over-the-counter pain relievers:\nChildren should take acetaminophen. (Shingles is very rare in children.)\nAdults may take aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil or other brands). These remedies, however, are not very effective for postherpetic neuralgia.\nNucleoside Analogues and Other Antiviral Drugs\nNucleoside Analogues. The best class of drugs developed against varicella-zoster are those known as nucleoside, or guanosine, analogues. These medicines block viral reproduction. None of these drugs can actually destroy the virus and cure the disease, but they can significantly reduce the severity of the attack, hasten healing, and reduce the duration. They may also reduce the risk of postherpetic neuralgia.\nThese anti-viral drugs are usually taken for 7 days. Ideally they should be started within 72 hours of the onset of infection. The earlier they are given the more effective these drugs are, but they can be helpful even if treatment is started after 3 days. Combinations of antiviral therapy with other drugs, such as tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsant drugs, are under investigation\nAcyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex) are approved for shingles. Acyclovir is the oldest, most studied of these drugs, but either famciclovir (Famvir) or valacyclovir (Valtrex), which are both metabolized into acyclovir, are now preferred to treat herpes zoster in most patients because they require fewer daily doses than the five doses needed with acyclovir.\nBecause herpes zoster tends to resolve fairly quickly in young adults, these drugs are more important for patients at greatest risk for complications or persistent pain. They include:\nElderly people\nThose with infections that threaten the eye\nPatients who are HIV positive or immunocompromised in other ways\nPatients whose infection covers a larger-than-average surface area of the skin\nThose with very severe pain\nThese drugs appear to have little or no harmful effect on healthy cells and can penetrate most body tissues, including cerebrospinal fluid. Evidence to date suggests that they are safe during pregnancy.\nPossible side effects of nucleoside analogues include rash, headache, fatigue, tremor, nausea and vomiting. Seizures are a very rare side effect. Patients with AIDS or other diseases that compromise the immune system are at increased risk for kidney damage and blood clots. Patients with suppressed immune systems are also more likely to have viral resistance to these drugs. These drugs are safe to take during pregnancy.\nFoscarnet. Foscarnet (Foscavir) is a powerful antiviral drug known as a pyrophosphate analogue. It is used in cases of VZV strains that have become resistant to acyclovir and similar drugs. Administered intravenously, the drug can have toxic effects. It can impair kidney function (which is reversible) and cause seizures. Fever, nausea, and vomiting are common side effects. It can also cause ulcers on genital organs. As with other drugs, it does not cure shingles.\nBrivudin. Brivudin (Helpin, Zostex), another antiviral drug, is not available in the U.S. It needs to be taken only once a day.\nOral Corticosteroids\nOral corticosteroids, including prednisolone or prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory medications. They have some benefit for reducing pain in the first 2 weeks or so of an attack, when used with acyclovir or another nucleoside analogue. (They are not recommended without a nucleoside analogue.) They also may be helpful for improving symptoms of Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Corticosteroids do not appear to prevent a further shingles attack or reduce the risk for PHN. Side effects of corticosteroids can be severe, and patients should take oral steroids at as low a dose, and for as short a time, as possible. (Injected or intravenous steroids, however, may offer specific relief for PHN without significant side effects.)\nBack to Top\nTreatment for Postherpetic Neuralgia\nPostherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is difficult to treat. Once PHN develops, a patient may need a multidisciplinary approach that involves a pain specialist, psychiatrist, primary care physician, and other health care providers.\nIn 2004, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) issued treatment guidelines for postherpetic neuralgia based on an extensive review of published studies. The AAN recommends:\nTricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, maprotiline)\nAnticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin)\n"}, {"score": 444.81033, "uuid": "f83ba6e4-4977-54fe-8bfe-bddd8c062827", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1403wb-36-02678", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Shingles+and+chickenpox+%28Varicella-zost", "page_rank": 1.1710777e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Shingles and chickenpox (Varicella-zoster virus) Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "Studies suggest significant pain relief <em>in</em> patients with PHN and reduction <em>in</em> the use of opioids.

The AAN recommends:\nTricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, maprotiline)\nAnticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin)\n"}, {"score": 449.6914, "uuid": "8fbefded-bb61-5a54-8ac1-932c481f11b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0407wb-82-28178", "target_hostname": "www.healthmegamall.com", "target_uri": "http://www.healthmegamall.com/prodList-A-Z-of-Pain_C704.htm", "page_rank": 1.1732213e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "A-Z of Pain <em>at</em> HealthMegaMall.com", "snippet": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including <em>aspirin</em> and <em>ibuprofen</em>) are widely prescribed and sometimes called non-narcotic <em>or</em> non-opioid analgesics.

It may be the fiery sensation of a burn moments after your finger touches the stove. Or it's a dull ache above your brow after a day of stress and tension. Or you may recognize it as a sharp pierce in your back after you lift something heavy.\nIt is pain. In its most benign form, it warns us that something isn't quite right, that we should take medicine or see a doctor. At its worst, however, pain robs us of our productivity, our well-being, and, for many of us suffering from extended illness, our very lives. Pain is a complex perception that differs enormously among individual patients, even those who appear to have identical injuries or illnesses.\nIn 1931, the French medical missionary Dr. Albert Schweitzer wrote, \"Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even death itself.\" Today, pain has become the universal disorder, a serious and costly public health issue, and a challenge for family, friends, and health care providers who must give support to the individual suffering from the physical as well as the emotional consequences of pain.\nA Brief History of Pain\nAncient civilizations recorded on stone tablets accounts of pain and the treatments used: pressure, heat, water, and sun. Early humans related pain to evil, magic, and demons. Relief of pain was the responsibility of sorcerers, shamans, priests, and priestesses, who used herbs, rites, and ceremonies as their treatments.\nThe Greeks and Romans were the first to advance a theory of sensation, the idea that the brain and nervous system have a role in producing the perception of pain. But it was not until the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance-the 1400s and 1500s-that evidence began to accumulate in support of these theories. Leonardo da Vinci and his contemporaries came to believe that the brain was the central organ responsible for sensation. Da Vinci also developed the idea that the spinal cord transmits sensations to the brain.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the study of the body-and the senses-continued to be a source of wonder for the world's philosophers. In 1664, the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes described what to this day is still called a \"pain pathway.\" Descartes illustrated how particles of fire, in contact with the foot, travel to the brain and he compared pain sensation to the ringing of a bell.\nIn the 19th century, pain came to dwell under a new domain-science-paving the way for advances in pain therapy. Physician-scientists discovered that opium, morphine, codeine, and cocaine could be used to treat pain. These drugs led to the development of aspirin, to this day the most commonly used pain reliever. Before long, anesthesia-both general and regional-was refined and applied during surgery.\n\"It has no future but itself,\" wrote the 19th century American poet Emily Dickinson, speaking about pain. As the 21st century unfolds, however, advances in pain research are creating a less grim future than that portrayed in Dickinson\u0092s verse, a future that includes a better understanding of pain, along with greatly improved treatments to keep it in check.\nThe Two Faces of Pain: Acute and Chronic\nWhat is pain? The International Association for the Study of Pain defines it as: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.\nIt is useful to distinguish between two basic types of pain, acute and chronic, and they differ greatly.\nAcute pain, for the most part, results from disease, inflammation, or injury to tissues. This type of pain generally comes on suddenly, for example, after trauma or surgery, and may be accompanied by anxiety or emotional distress. The cause of acute pain can usually be diagnosed and treated, and the pain is self-limiting, that is, it is confined to a given period of time and severity. In some rare instances, it can become chronic.\nChronic pain is widely believed to represent disease itself. It can be made much worse by environmental and psychological factors. Chronic pain persists over a longer period of time than acute pain and is resistant to most medical treatments. It can\u0097and often does\u0097cause severe problems for patients.\nThe A to Z of Pain\nHundreds of pain syndromes or disorders make up the spectrum of pain. There are the most benign, fleeting sensations of pain, such as a pin prick. There is the pain of childbirth, the pain of a heart attack, and the pain that sometimes follows amputation of a limb. There is also pain accompanying cancer and the pain that follows severe trauma, such as that associated with head and spinal cord injuries. A sampling of common pain syndromes follows, listed alphabetically.\nArachnoiditis is a condition in which one of the three membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, called the arachnoid membrane, becomes inflamed. A number of causes, including infection or trauma, can result in inflammation of this membrane. Arachnoiditis can produce disabling, progressive, and even permanent pain.\nArthritis. Millions of Americans suffer from arthritic conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and gout. These disorders are characterized by joint pain in the extremities. Many other inflammatory diseases affect the body's soft tissues, including tendonitis and bursitis.\nBack pain has become the high price paid by our modern lifestyle and is a startlingly common cause of disability for many Americans, including both active and inactive people. Back pain that spreads to the leg is called sciatica and is a very common condition (see below). Another common type of back pain is associated with the discs of the spine, the soft, spongy padding between the vertebrae (bones) that form the spine. Discs protect the spine by absorbing shock, but they tend to degenerate over time and may sometimes rupture. Spondylolisthesis is a back condition that occurs when one vertebra extends over another, causing pressure on nerves and therefore pain. Also, damage to nerve roots is a serious condition, called radiculopathy, that can be extremely painful. Treatment for a damaged disc includes drugs such as painkillers, muscle relaxants, and steroids; exercise or rest, depending on the patient's condition; adequate support, such as a brace or better mattress and physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the damaged portion of the disc and return it to its previous condition, especially when it is pressing a nerve root. Surgical procedures include discectomy, laminectomy, or spinal fusion.\nBurn pain can be profound and poses an extreme challenge to the medical community. First-degree burns are the least severe; with third-degree burns, the skin is lost. Depending on the injury, pain accompanying burns can be excruciating, and even after the wound has healed patients may have chronic pain at the burn site.\nCentral pain syndrome-see \"Trauma\" below.\nCancer pain can accompany the growth of a tumor, the treatment of cancer, or chronic problems related to cancer's permanent effects on the body. Fortunately, most cancer pain can be treated to help minimize discomfort and stress to the patient.\nHeadaches affect millions of Americans. The three most common types of chronic headache are migraines, cluster headaches, and tension headaches. Each comes with its own telltale brand of pain.\nMigraines are characterized by throbbing pain and sometimes by other symptoms, such as nausea and visual disturbances. Migraines are more frequent in women than men. Stress can trigger a migraine headache, and migraines can also put the sufferer at risk for stroke.\nCluster headaches are characterized by excruciating, piercing pain on one side of the head; they occur more frequently in men than women.\nTension headaches are often described as a tight band around the head.\nHead and facial pain can be agonizing, whether it results from dental problems or from disorders such as cranial neuralgia, in which one of the nerves in the face, head, or neck is inflamed. Another condition, trigeminal neuralgia (also called tic douloureux), affects the largest of the cranial nerves and is characterized by a stabbing, shooting pain.\nMuscle pain can range from an aching muscle, spasm, or strain, to the severe spasticity that accompanies paralysis. Another disabling syndrome is fibromyalgia, a disorder characterized by fatigue, stiffness, joint tenderness, and widespread muscle pain. Polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis are painful disorders characterized by muscle inflammation. They may be caused by infection or autoimmune dysfunction and are sometimes associated with connective tissue disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\nMyofascial pain syndromes affect sensitive areas known as trigger points, located within the body's muscles. Myofascial pain syndromes are sometimes misdiagnosed and can be debilitating. Fibromyalgia is a type of myofascial pain syndrome.\nNeuropathic pain is a type of pain that can result from injury to nerves, either in the peripheral or central nervous system. Neuropathic pain can occur in any part of the body and is frequently described as a hot, burning sensation, which can be devastating to the affected individual. It can result from diseases that affect nerves (such as diabetes) or from trauma, or, because chemotherapy drugs can affect nerves, it can be a consequence of cancer treatment. Among the many neuropathic pain conditions are diabetic neuropathy (which results from nerve damage secondary to vascular problems that occur with diabetes); reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, which can follow injury; phantom limb and post-amputation pain, which can result from the surgical removal of a limb; postherpetic neuralgia, which can occur after an outbreak of shingles; and central pain syndrome, which can result from trauma to the brain or spinal cord.\nReflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, or RSDS, is accompanied by burning pain and hypersensitivity to temperature. Often triggered by trauma or nerve damage, RSDS causes the skin of the affected area to become characteristically shiny. In recent years, RSDS has come to be called complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS); in the past it was often called causalgia.\nRepetitive stress injuries are muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or other daily activities. They include:\nwriter's cramp, which affects musicians and writers and others,\ncompression or entrapment neuropathies, including carpal tunnel syndrome, caused by chronic overextension of the wrist and\ntendonitis or tenosynovitis, affecting one or more tendons.\nSciatica is a painful condition caused by pressure on the sciatic nerve, the main nerve that branches off the spinal cord and continues down into the thighs, legs, ankles, and feet. Sciatica is characterized by pain in the buttocks and can be caused by a number of factors. Exertion, obesity, and poor posture can all cause pressure on the sciatic nerve. One common cause of sciatica is a herniated disc.\nShingles and other painful disorders affect the skin. Pain is a common symptom of many skin disorders, even the most common rashes. One of the most vexing neurological disorders is shingles or herpes zoster, an infection that often causes agonizing pain resistant to treatment. Prompt treatment with antiviral agents is important to arrest the infection, which if prolonged can result in an associated condition known as postherpetic neuralgia. Other painful disorders affecting the skin include:\nvasculitis, or inflammation of blood vessels;\nother infections, including herpes simplex;\nskin tumors and cysts, and\ntumors associated with neurofibromatosis, a neurogenetic disorder.\nSports injuries are common. Sprains, strains, bruises, dislocations, and fractures are all well-known words in the language of sports. Pain is another. In extreme cases, sports injuries can take the form of costly and painful spinal cord and head injuries, which cause severe suffering and disability.\nSpinal stenosis refers to a narrowing of the canal surrounding the spinal cord. The condition occurs naturally with aging. Spinal stenosis causes weakness in the legs and leg pain usually felt while the person is standing up and often relieved by sitting down.\nSurgical pain may require regional or general anesthesia during the procedure and medications to control discomfort following the operation. Control of pain associated with surgery includes presurgical preparation and careful monitoring of the patient during and after the procedure.\nTemporomandibular disorders are conditions in which the temporomandibular joint (the jaw) is damaged and/or the muscles used for chewing and talking become stressed, causing pain. The condition may be the result of a number of factors, such as an injury to the jaw or joint misalignment, and may give rise to a variety of symptoms, most commonly pain in the jaw, face, and/or neck muscles. Physicians reach a diagnosis by listening to the patient's description of the symptoms and by performing a simple examination of the facial muscles and the temporomandibular joint.\nTrauma can occur after injuries in the home, at the workplace, during sports activities, or on the road. Any of these injuries can result in severe disability and pain. Some patients who have had an injury to the spinal cord experience intense pain ranging from tingling to burning and, commonly, both. Such patients are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures and touch. For these individuals, a touch can be perceived as intense burning, indicating abnormal signals relayed to and from the brain. This condition is called central pain syndrome or, if the damage is in the thalamus (the brain's center for processing bodily sensations), thalamic pain syndrome. It affects as many as 100,000 Americans with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amputated limbs, spinal cord injuries, and stroke. Their pain is severe and is extremely difficult to treat effectively. A variety of medications, including analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and electrical stimulation, are options available to central pain patients.\nVascular disease or injury-such as vasculitis or inflammation of blood vessels, coronary artery disease, and circulatory problems-all have the potential to cause pain. Vascular pain affects millions of Americans and occurs when communication between blood vessels and nerves is interrupted. Ruptures, spasms, constriction, or obstruction of blood vessels, as well as a condition called ischemia in which blood supply to organs, tissues, or limbs is cut off, can also result in pain.\nHow is Pain Diagnosed?\nThere is no way to tell how much pain a person has. No test can measure the intensity of pain, no imaging device can show pain, and no instrument can locate pain precisely. Sometimes, as in the case of headaches, physicians find that the best aid to diagnosis is the patient's own description of the type, duration, and location of pain. Defining pain as sharp or dull, constant or intermittent, burning or aching may give the best clues to the cause of pain. These descriptions are part of what is called the pain history, taken by the physician during the preliminary examination of a patient with pain.\nPhysicians, however, do have a number of technologies they use to find the cause of pain. Primarily these include:\nElectrodiagnostic procedures include electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and evoked potential (EP) studies. Information from EMG can help physicians tell precisely which muscles or nerves are affected by weakness or pain. Thin needles are inserted in muscles and a physician can see or listen to electrical signals displayed on an EMG machine. With nerve conduction studies the doctor uses two sets of electrodes (similar to those used during an electrocardiogram) that are placed on the skin over the muscles. The first set gives the patient a mild shock that stimulates the nerve that runs to that muscle. The second set of electrodes is used to make a recording of the nerve's electrical signals, and from this information the doctor can determine if there is nerve damage. EP tests also involve two sets of electrodes-one set for stimulating a nerve (these electrodes are attached to a limb) and another set on the scalp for recording the speed of nerve signal transmission to the brain.\nImaging, especially magnetic resonance imaging or MRI, provides physicians with pictures of the body's structures and tissues. MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue.\nA neurological examination in which the physician tests movement, reflexes, sensation, balance, and coordination.\nX-rays produce pictures of the body's structures, such as bones and joints.\nReturn to top\nHow is Pain Treated?\nThe goal of pain management is to improve function, enabling individuals to work, attend school, or participate in other day-to-day activities. Patients and their physicians have a number of options for the treatment of pain; some are more effective than others. Sometimes, relaxation and the use of imagery as a distraction provide relief. These methods can be powerful and effective, according to those who advocate their use. Whatever the treatment regime, it is important to remember that pain is treatable. The following treatments are among the most common.\nAcetaminophen is the basic ingredient found in Tylenol\u00ae and its many generic equivalents. It is sold over the counter, in a prescription-strength preparation, and in combination with codeine (also by prescription).\nAcupuncture dates back 2,500 years and involves the application of needles to precise points on the body. It is part of a general category of healing called traditional Chinese or Oriental medicine. Acupuncture remains controversial but is quite popular and may one day prove to be useful for a variety of conditions as it continues to be explored by practitioners, patients, and investigators.\nAnalgesic refers to the class of drugs that includes most painkillers, such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. The word analgesic is derived from ancient Greek and means to reduce or stop pain. Nonprescription or over-the-counter pain relievers are generally used for mild to moderate pain. Prescription pain relievers, sold through a pharmacy under the direction of a physician, are used for more moderate to severe pain.\nAnticonvulsants are used for the treatment of seizure disorders but are also sometimes prescribed for the treatment of pain. Carbamazepine in particular is used to treat a number of painful conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia. Another antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, is being studied for its pain-relieving properties, especially as a treatment for neuropathic pain.\nAntidepressants are sometimes used for the treatment of pain and, along with neuroleptics and lithium, belong to a category of drugs called psychotropic drugs. In addition, anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines also act as muscle relaxants and are sometimes used as pain relievers. Physicians usually try to treat the condition with analgesics before prescribing these drugs.\nAntimigraine drugs include the triptans- sumatriptan (Imitrex\u00ae), naratriptan (Amerge\u00ae), and zolmitriptan (Zomig\u00ae)-and are used specifically for migraine headaches. They can have serious side effects in some people and therefore, as with all prescription medicines, should be used only under a doctor's care.\nAspirin may be the most widely used pain-relief agent and has been sold over the counter since 1905 as a treatment for fever, headache, and muscle soreness.\nBiofeedback is used for the treatment of many common pain problems, most notably headache and back pain. Using a special electronic machine, the patient is trained to become aware of, to follow, and to gain control over certain bodily functions, including muscle tension, heart rate, and skin temperature. The individual can then learn to effect a change in his or her responses to pain, for example, by using relaxation techniques. Biofeedback is often used in combination with other treatment methods, generally without side effects. Similarly, the use of relaxation techniques in the treatment of pain can increase the patient's feeling of well-being.\nCapsaicin is a chemical found in chili peppers that is also a primary ingredient in pain-relieving creams.\nChemonucleolysis is a treatment in which an enzyme, chymopapain, is injected directly into a herniated lumbar disc in an effort to dissolve material around the disc, thus reducing pressure and pain. The procedure's use is extremely limited, in part because some patients may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to chymopapain.\nChiropractic refers to hand manipulation of the spine, usually for relief of back pain, and is a treatment option that continues to grow in popularity among many people who simply seek relief from back disorders. It has never been without controversy, however. Chiropractic's usefulness as a treatment for back pain is, for the most part, restricted to a select group of individuals with uncomplicated acute low back pain who may derive relief from the massage component of the therapy.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy involves a wide variety of coping skills and relaxation methods to help prepare for and cope with pain. It is used for postoperative pain, cancer pain, and the pain of childbirth.\nCounseling can give a patient suffering from pain much needed support, whether it is derived from family, group, or individual counseling. Support groups can provide an important adjunct to drug or surgical treatment. Psychological treatment can also help patients learn about the physiological changes produced by pain.\nCOX-2 inhibitors (\"superaspirins\") may be particularly effective for individuals with arthritis. For many years scientists have wanted to develop the ultimate drug-a drug that works as well as morphine but without its negative side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by blocking two enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, both of which promote production of hormones called prostaglandins, which in turn cause inflammation, fever, and pain. Newer drugs, called COX-2 inhibitors, primarily block cyclooxygenase-2 and are less likely to have the gastrointestinal side effects sometimes produced by NSAIDs. On 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved two COX-2 inhibitors-rofecoxib (Vioxx\u00ae) and celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae). Although the long-term effects of COX-2 inhibitors are still being evaluated, they appear to be safe. In addition, patients may be able to take COX-2 inhibitors in larger doses than aspirin and other drugs that have irritating side effects, earning them the nickname \"superaspirins.\"\nElectrical stimulation, including transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS), implanted electric nerve stimulation, and deep brain or spinal cord stimulation, is the modern-day extension of age-old practices in which the nerves of muscles are subjected to a variety of stimuli, including heat or massage. Electrical stimulation, no matter what form, involves a major surgical procedure and is not for everyone, nor is it 100 percent effective. The following techniques each require specialized equipment and personnel trained in the specific procedure being used:\nTENS uses tiny electrical pulses, delivered through the skin to nerve fibers, to cause changes in muscles, such as numbness or contractions. This in turn produces temporary pain relief. There is also evidence that TENS can activate subsets of peripheral nerve fibers that can block pain transmission at the spinal cord level, in much the same way that shaking your hand can reduce pain.\nPeripheral nerve stimulation uses electrodes placed surgically on a carefully selected area of the body. The patient is then able to deliver an electrical current as needed to the affected area, using an antenna and transmitter.\nSpinal cord stimulation uses electrodes surgically inserted within the epidural space of the spinal cord. The patient is able to deliver a pulse of electricity to the spinal cord using a small box-like receiver and an antenna taped to the skin.\nDeep brain or intracerebral stimulation is considered an extreme treatment and involves surgical stimulation of the brain, usually the thalamus. It is used for a limited number of conditions, including severe pain, central pain syndrome, cancer pain, phantom limb pain, and other neuropathic pains.\nExercise has come to be a prescribed part of some doctors' treatment regimes for patients with pain. Because there is a known link between many types of chronic pain and tense, weak muscles, exercise-even light to moderate exercise such as walking or swimming-can contribute to an overall sense of well-being by improving blood and oxygen flow to muscles. Just as we know that stress contributes to pain, we also know that exercise, sleep, and relaxation can all help reduce stress, thereby helping to alleviate pain. Exercise has been proven to help many people with low back pain. It is important, however, that patients carefully follow the routine laid out by their physicians.\nHypnosis, first approved for medical use by the American Medical Association in 1958, continues to grow in popularity, especially as an adjunct to pain medication. In general, hypnosis is used to control physical function or response, that is, the amount of pain an individual can withstand. How hypnosis works is not fully understood. Some believe that hypnosis delivers the patient into a trance-like state, while others feel that the individual is simply better able to concentrate and relax or is more responsive to suggestion. Hypnosis may result in relief of pain by acting on chemicals in the nervous system, slowing impulses. Whether and how hypnosis works involves greater insight-and research-into the mechanisms underlying human consciousness.\nIbuprofen is a member of the aspirin family of analgesics, the so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see below). It is sold over the counter and also comes in prescription-strength preparations.\nLow-power lasers have been used occasionally by some physical therapists as a treatment for pain, but like many other treatments, this method is not without controversy.\nMagnets are increasingly popular with athletes who swear by their effectiveness for the control of sports-related pain and other painful conditions. Usually worn as a collar or wristwatch, the use of magnets as a treatment dates back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. While it is often dismissed as quackery and pseudoscience by skeptics, proponents offer the theory that magnets may effect changes in cells or body chemistry, thus producing pain relief.\nNarcotics (see Opioids, below).\nNerve blocks employ the use of drugs, chemical agents, or surgical techniques to interrupt the relay of pain messages between specific areas of the body and the brain. There are many different names for the procedure, depending on the technique or agent used. Types of surgical nerve blocks include neurectomy; spinal dorsal, cranial, and trigeminal rhizotomy; and sympathectomy, also called sympathetic blockade.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including aspirin and ibuprofen) are widely prescribed and sometimes called non-narcotic or non-opioid analgesics. They work by reducing inflammatory responses in tissues. Many of these drugs irritate the stomach and for that reason are usually taken with food. Although acetaminophen may have some anti-inflammatory effects, it is generally distinguished from the traditional NSAIDs.\nOpioids are derived from the poppy plant and are among the oldest drugs known to humankind. They include codeine and perhaps the most well-known narcotic of all, morphine. Morphine can be administered in a variety of forms, including a pump for patient self-administration. Opioids have a narcotic effect, that is, they induce sedation as well as pain relief, and some patients may become physically dependent upon them. For these reasons, patients given opioids should be monitored carefully; in some cases stimulants may be prescribed to counteract the sedative side effects. In addition to drowsiness, other common side effects include constipation, nausea, and vomiting.\nPhysical therapy and rehabilitation date back to the ancient practice of using physical techniques and methods, such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation, in the treatment of certain conditions. These may be applied to increase function, control pain, and speed the patient toward full recovery.\nPlacebos offer some individuals pain relief although whether and how they have an effect is mysterious and somewhat controversial. Placebos are inactive substances, such as sugar pills, or harmless procedures, such as saline injections or sham surgeries, generally used in clinical studies as control factors to help determine the efficacy of active treatments. Although placebos have no direct effect on the underlying causes of pain, evidence from clinical studies suggests that many pain conditions such as migraine headache, back pain, post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, and depression sometimes respond well to them. This positive response is known as the placebo effect, which is defined as the observable or measurable change that can occur in patients after administration of a placebo. Some experts believe the effect is psychological and that placebos work because the patients believe or expect them to work. Others say placebos relieve pain by stimulating the brain's own analgesics and setting the body's self-healing forces in motion. A third theory suggests that the act of taking placebos relieves stress and anxiety-which are known to aggravate some painful conditions-and, thus, cause the patients to feel better. Still, placebos are considered controversial because by definition they are inactive and have no actual curative value.\nR.I.C.E.-Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation-are four components prescribed by many orthopedists, coaches, trainers, nurses, and other professionals for temporary muscle or joint conditions, such as sprains or strains. While many common orthopedic problems can be controlled with these four simple steps, especially when combined with over-the-counter pain relievers, more serious conditions may require surgery or physical therapy, including exercise, joint movement or manipulation, and stimulation of muscles.\nSurgery, although not always an option, may be required to relieve pain, especially pain caused by back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries. Surgery may take the form of a nerve block or it may involve an operation to relieve pain from a ruptured disc. Surgical procedures for back problems include discectomy or, when microsurgical techniques are used, microdiscectomy, in which the entire disc is removed; laminectomy, a procedure in which a surgeon removes only a disc fragment, gaining access by entering through the arched portion of a vertebra; and spinal fusion, a procedure where the entire disc is removed and replaced with a bone graft. In a spinal fusion, the two vertebrae are then fused together. Although the operation can cause the spine to stiffen, resulting in lost flexibility, the procedure serves one critical purpose: protection of the spinal cord. Other operations for pain include rhizotomy, in which a nerve close to the spinal cord is cut, and cordotomy, where bundles of nerves within the spinal cord are severed. Cordotomy is generally used only for the pain of terminal cancer that does not respond to other therapies. Another operation for pain is the dorsal root entry zone operation, or DREZ, in which spinal neurons corresponding to the patient's pain are destroyed surgically. Because surgery can result in scar tissue formation that may cause additional problems, patients are well advised to seek a second opinion before proceeding. Occasionally, surgery is carried out with electrodes that selectively damage neurons in a targeted area of the brain. These procedures rarely result in long-term pain relief, but both physician and patient may decide that the surgical procedure will be effective enough that it justifies the expense and risk. In some cases, the results of an operation are remarkable. For example, many individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia who are not responsive to drug treatment have had great success with a procedure called microvascular decompression, in which tiny blood vessels are surgically separated from surrounding nerves.\n"}, {"score": 449.02432, "uuid": "3d2ab9b7-c6c7-52f9-9005-c67d10152b8b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0505wb-80-31263", "target_hostname": "www.consultantlive.com", "target_uri": "http://www.consultantlive.com/medications/motrin-suspension", "page_rank": 1.1739784e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "Motrin Suspension - Consultant Live", "snippet": "By 6 hours, <em>children</em> treated with <em>ibuprofen</em> 5mg&#x2F;kg tended to have recurrence of <em>fever</em>, whereas <em>children</em> treated with <em>ibuprofen</em> 10 mg&#x2F;kg still had significant <em>fever</em> reduction <em>at</em> 8 hours.", "explanation": null, "document": "Source: DailyMed , U.S. National Library of Medicine; Updated 09/09\nMotrin Suspension\nSuspension (0045-0448) ibuprofen 100 milligram in 5 milliliter\nIndications\nCarefully consider the potential benefits and risks of MOTRIN Suspension and other treatment options before deciding to use MOTRIN Suspension.

Doses should be given so as not to disturb the child's sleep pattern.\nJuvenile Arthritis: The recommended dose is 30 to 40 mg/kg/day divided into three to four doses (see Individualization of Dosage ). Patients with milder disease may be adequately treated with 20 mg/kg/day.\nIn patients with juvenile arthritis, doses above 50 mg/kg/day are not recommended because they have not been studied and doses exceeding the upper recommended dose of 40 mg/kg/day may increase the risk of causing serious adverse events. The therapeutic response may require from a few days to several weeks to be achieved. Once a clinical effect is obtained, the dosage should be lowered to the smallest dose of MOTRIN needed to maintain adequate control of symptoms.\nPediatric patients receiving doses above 30 mg/kg/day or if abnormal liver function tests have occurred with previous NSAID treatments should be carefully followed for signs and symptoms of early liver dysfunction.\nADULTS\nPrimary Dysmenorrhea: For the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, beginning with the earliest onset of such pain, MOTRIN Suspension should be given in a dose of 400 mg every 4 hours, as necessary, for the relief of pain.\nRheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis: Suggested dosage: 1200-3200 mg daily (300 mg q.i.d. or 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.). Individual patients may show a better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset potential increased risk.\nIndividualization of Dosage: The dose of MOTRIN Suspension should be tailored to each patient, and may be lowered or raised from the suggested doses depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.\nOne fever study showed that, after the initial dose of MOTRIN Suspension, subsequent doses may be lowered and still provide adequate fever control.\nIn a situation when low fever would require the MOTRIN Suspension 5 mg/kg dose in a child with pain, the dose that will effectively treat the predominant symptom should be chosen.\nIn chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to MOTRIN Suspension therapy is sometimes seen in a few days to a week, but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.\nPatients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses than do patients with osteoarthritis. The smallest dose of MOTRIN Suspension that yields acceptable control should be employed.\nMOTRIN Suspension may be used in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids.\nOverdosage\nThe toxicity of ibuprofen overdose is dependent upon the amount of drug ingested and the time elapsed since ingestion, though individual response may vary, which makes it necessary to evaluate each case individually. Although uncommon, serious toxicity and death have been reported in the medical literature with ibuprofen overdosage. The most frequently reported symptoms of ibuprofen overdose include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy and drowsiness. Other central nervous system symptoms include headache, tinnitus, CNS depression and seizures. Metabolic acidosis, coma, acute renal failure and apnea (primarily in very young children) may rarely occur. Cardiovascular toxicity, including hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, also have been reported.\nThe treatment of acute ibuprofen overdose is primarily supportive. Management of hypotension, acidosis and gastrointestinal bleeding may be necessary. In cases of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied through ipecac-induced emesis or lavage. Emesis is most effective if initiated within 30 minutes of ingestion. Orally administered activated charcoal may help in reducing the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen.\nIn children, the estimated amount of ibuprofen ingested per body weight may be helpful to predict the potential for development of toxicity although each case must be evaluated. Ingestion of less than 100 mg/kg is unlikely to produce toxicity. Children ingesting 100 to 200 mg/kg may be managed with induced emesis and a minimal observation time of four hours. Children ingesting 200 to 400 mg/kg of ibuprofen should have immediate gastric emptying and at least four hours observation in a health care facility. Children ingesting greater than 400 mg/kg require immediate medical referral, careful observation and appropriate supportive therapy. Ipecac-induced emesis is not recommended in overdoses greater than 400 mg/kg because of the risk for convulsions and the potential for aspiration of gastric contents.\nIn adult patients the history of the dose reportedly ingested does not appear to be predictive of toxicity. The need for referral and follow-up must be judged by the circumstances at the time of the overdose ingestion. Symptomatic adults should be carefully evaluated, observed and supported.\nContraindications\nMOTRIN Suspension is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen.\nMOTRIN Suspension should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDS have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS \u2013 Anaphylactoid Reactions, and PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Preexisting Asthma ).\nMOTRIN Suspension is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS ).\nWarnings\nBoxed Warning\nCardiovascular Risk\nNSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk (see WARNINGS ).\nMOTRIN Suspension is contraindicated for the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see WARNINGS ).\nGastrointestinal Risk\nNSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events (see WARNINGS ).\nCARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS\nCardiovascular Thrombotic Events\nClinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious GI events (see GI WARNINGS ).\nTwo large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).\nHypertension\nNSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\nCongestive Heart Failure and Edema\nFluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. MOTRIN Suspension should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.\nGastrointestinal Effects \u2013 Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation\nNSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.\nNSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\nRenal Effects\nLong-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.\nAdvanced Renal Disease\nNo information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of MOTRIN Suspension in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with MOTRIN Suspension is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If MOTRIN Suspension therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions\nAs with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to MOTRIN Suspension. MOTRIN Suspension should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Preexisting Asthma ). Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs.\nSkin Reactions\nNSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, can cause serious skin adverse events such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.\nPregnancy\nIn late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, MOTRIN should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\nSpecial Precautions\nGeneral\nMOTRIN Suspension cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.\nThe pharmacological activity of MOTRIN Suspension in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.\nHepatic Effects\nBorderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including MOTRIN Suspension. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.\nA patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with MOTRIN Suspension. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), MOTRIN Suspension should be discontinued.\nHematological Effects\nAnemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including MOTRIN Suspension, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.\nIn two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreased hemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease in hemoglobin of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1% of 193 patients on 1600 mg ibuprofen daily (osteoarthritis), and in 22.8% of 189 patients taking 2400 mg of ibuprofen daily (rheumatoid arthritis). Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum creatinine levels were also observed in these studies.\nNSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving MOTRIN Suspension who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.\nPreexisting Asthma\nPatients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, MOTRIN Suspension should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.\nAseptic Meningitis\nAseptic meningitis, with fever and coma, has been observed on rare occasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probably more likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported in patients who do not have an underlying chronic disease.\nDiabetics\nMOTRIN Suspension contains 0.3 g sucrose and 1.6 calories per mL, or 1.5 g sucrose and 8 calories per teaspoon, which should be taken into consideration when treating diabetic patients with this product.\nInformation for Patients:\nPatients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.\nMOTRIN Suspension, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization, and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects ).\nMOTRIN Suspension, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization or even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation ).\nMOTRIN Suspension, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS, and TEN, which may result in hospitalizations and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash or contact their physicians as soon as possible.\nPatients should promptly reports signs and symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.\nPatients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritis, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.\nPatients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS ).\nIn late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, MOTRIN Suspension should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\nLaboratory Tests\nBecause serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and a chemistry profile checked periodically. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.) or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, MOTRIN Suspension should be discontinued.\nDrug Interactions\nACE-inhibitors\nReports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.\nAspirin\nAs with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of IBUPROFEN and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.\nDiuretics\nClinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that MOTRIN Suspension can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects ), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.\nLithium\nIbuprofen produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance of lithium was decreased by 19% during this period of concomitant drug administration. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when MOTRIN and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. (Read circulars for lithium preparation before use of such concurrent therapy.)\nMethotrexate\nNSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.\nWarfarin\nSeveral short-term controlled studies failed to show that MOTRIN tablets significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of other clotting factors when administered to individuals on warfarin-type anticoagulants. However, because bleeding has been reported when MOTRIN tablets and other NSAIDs have been administered to patients on warfarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautious when administering MOTRIN tablets to patients on anticoagulants. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.\nPregnancy\nTeratogenic Effects \u2013 Pregnancy Category C\nReproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Motrin should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nNonteratogenic Effects\nBecause of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus), use during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) should be avoided.\nLabor and Delivery\nIn rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayed parturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of MOTRIN Suspension on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Therefore, administration of MOTRIN Suspension is not recommended during labor and delivery.\nNursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from MOTRIN suspension, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nPediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness of MOTRIN Suspension in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Clinical Studies ). Dosing of MOTRIN Suspension in children 6 months or older should be guided by their body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).\nGeriatric Use\nAs with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older).\nAdverse Drug Reactions\nIn patients taking MOTRIN or other NSAIDs, the most frequently reported adverse experiences occurring in approximately 1-10% of patients are: Abnormal renal function, anemia, dizziness, edema, elevated liver enzymes, fluid retention, gastrointestinal experiences (including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, flatulence, heartburn, nausea, vomiting), headaches, increased bleeding time, nervousness, pruritus, rashes (including maculopapular) and tinnitus.\nAdditional adverse experiences reported occasionally include:\nBody as a whole -\n"}], [{"score": 442.39496, "uuid": "ed5bf72e-0bb1-5d35-95da-d101c7a9ed58", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-06-14158", "target_hostname": "www.nccn.net", "target_uri": "http://www.nccn.net/~wwithin/fever.htm", "page_rank": 1.1822942e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "Vaccination Information &amp; Choice Network -", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> Fear of <em>Fever</em> Hurting Our <em>Children</em>? by Edda West, VRAN, Canada <em>Fever</em> <em>in</em> <em>Children</em> - A Blessing <em>in</em> Disguise By Linda B.

It found no evidence that the prophylactic use of antipyretics has any effect in reducing the incidence of febrile convulsions. The second review assessed 12 studies of the effects of paracetamol for treating children in relation to fever clearance time, febrile convulsions and resolution of associated symptoms. It also found no evidence that the use of prophylactic paracetamol influenced the risk of febrile convulsions.\nEvidence summary\nLimited evidence was found regarding the use of antipyretic medications in the promotion of wellbeing, activity, eating and drinking, and no evidence of cost-effectiveness. One study suggested that parents could identify some improvement in activity and alertness after the administration of paracetamol, but not in mood, comfort, appetite or fluid intake. There is no evidence that the use of antipyretic agents reduces the incidence of febrile convulsions.\nGDG translation The GDG noted that, from the evidence, antipyretic agents do not appear to be effective in the prevention of febrile convulsions.

Not all of the world panics at fever.............\nBelow is a (quick) translation, by one of my list members, of the official policy guidelines for Dutch family doctors in case of fever in children, given by their organisation and published on internet.\nI have added the Fahrenheit degrees\nOfficial guidelines for Dutch family doctors in case of fever in children:\n- A realistic notion about fever will make it more easy for parents to deal with children having fever.\n- In general, fever does not need treatment.\n- Actively lowering the body temperature is not neccessary. Applying cold compresses and cold sponging of the child is not meaningful.\n- In principle, no antipyretics are given. Antipyretics do not fight the disease and at best will make the child feel a bit better.\n- Fever is qualified as a rectal temperature above 38 degrees C. (100.4 degree Fahrenheit)\n-There are no injurious effects of fever below 41.7 degrees C. (107.06 degree Fahrenheit)\n- Fever is a useful bodily reaction. If the heat is allowed to drain away, fever will not rise above 41.7 degrees C. (107.06 degree Fahrenheit)\n- The increase of the body temperature seems to be important in fighting the disease.\n- If the fever is not treated, this does not mean the temperature will keep rising.\n- The main reason for taking the temperature is knowing whether or not there is a fever.\n- There is no use in measuring each change. It is sufficient to take the temperature once a day.\n- Parents should not wake their child to take the temperature.\n- Temperature should be measured per rectum. Other ways are not reliable.\n- Observing the child and registering changes in the childs behaviour are more important than frequently measuring the temperature.\n- The extent to which the child is sick is far more important than the temperature of the fever.\nHomeopathic Treatment of a Child with Fever\nHomeopathy works very well in treating an ill child with a fever. We aren't treating the fever. We aren't trying to make the fever go down. We are treating the child looking at all the symptoms present including the fever. The remedy helps the child to heal and the fever goes when the healing happens and the fever is no longer needed\nFind the ONE remedy that matches the symptom picture best. If these lists aren't complete enough, may need to consult a homeopath, take one of my classes, or find other remedy lists\nFevers In Children do NOT go by her dosage information - use the information I post at the end of this section as to how to give a remedy for a minor acute illness or first aid\nFevers (Homeopathic Remedies)\nHe errs on the side of caution in the paragraphs in the first part of the page. See above for info on that. He is way to cautious in my opinion here - \"Any fever that is over 101 F for more than a sort period of time needs to be assessed by a medical professional. Any fever that rises suddenly to high temperatures, such 103 to 104, needs immediate professional help, as this can be a sign of a serious condition. The remedies given here are for simple, uncomplicated fever, as any other type of fever may need professional attention.\"\nI don't agree that 103 or 104 needs professional help unless prolonged fever and no progress being made or other serious symptoms. You have to make your own decision on that.\nI post this information for the remedy pictures he lists\nAgain, find the one remedy that matches the symptom picture the best, especially paying attention to the emotional state of the child while ill\nAdministering Homeopathic Remedies\nPut your dry pillules, tablets, in water to administer - see below\nBest not to take them dry.

Do not treat for chronic or recurring things on your own or with 30C.\nDO NOT go by what is on the bottle (heaven only knows why fda or whatever makes them say that stuff)\nYou can give just a dry pillule, but it appears to work better to give in water (aqueous solution) and be able to succuss it between doses - but in a pinch, give as dry.

Rather than broken bones, accidents and injuries, the most common reasons for ER visits are ear infections, colds and fever.\n\"You can always tell it's cold season by who's coming to the ER,\" says Dr. Kim Gush of Village Pediatrics of Chapel Hill. \"From 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., parents come in with children who have a cough and sore throat.\"\nWhy the ER?\nThe convenience of the ER and the difficulty for parents to leave work are two reasons. But the leading reason is that parents aren't sure when to worry or what to do.1 They often simply want reassurance about their child's health.\nWhen should parents worry?\n\"Unless your child is having difficulty breathing -- that is, your child is struggling to catch their breath or is breathing rapidly -- your child's cold is better off being cared for at home than going to the ER,\" says Dr. Gush. \"We simply don't have effective medicines for the common cold viruses.\"\n\"If your child is otherwise healthy, you don't need to see the doctor unless your child's had a cough that has lasted more than two weeks, a fever (100.4\u00b0 -104\u00b0 F) that has lasted for one week, or a fever that was getting better and now has gotten worse. Those are signs that your child may have a bacterial infection rather than a viral one. In those cases, an antibiotic may help.\"\nIf parents aren't sure, they should call their child's primary healthcare provider or \"Medical Home\" rather than going to the ER. A Medical Home can be a doctor's office, a community clinic or a local health department. A Medical Home is where the staff knows the child and the child's health history and where parents can get answers to their questions.\nWhat should parents do?\n\"Our bodies are built with a remarkable immune system. It can't prevent a viral infection, but it can fight one rather efficiently. Fever and discomfort can be treated with ibuprofen (Motrin\u00ae) and acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae), but never aspirin. With rest and plenty of liquids -- such as water, broth or diluted juice -- most children will be able to get rid of their colds, middle ear inflammation and fevers on their own.\"\nHowever, the best way to deal with viral infections is to avoid them in the first place. Parents can help by reminding children to wash their hands and to cover their nose and mouth when they cough or sneeze. A flu shot for children older than 6 months is recommended and will either prevent the flu or lessen the severity of symptoms.\n"}, {"score": 441.69446, "uuid": "5fd826e6-b330-5749-8edd-c68c5bccda98", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500wb-95-19233", "target_hostname": "nccn.net", "target_uri": "http://nccn.net/~wwithin/fever.htm", "page_rank": 1.1790099e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Vaccination Information &amp; Choice Network -", "snippet": "<em>Is</em> Fear of <em>Fever</em> Hurting Our <em>Children</em>? by Edda West, VRAN, Canada <em>Fever</em> <em>in</em> <em>Children</em> - A Blessing <em>in</em> Disguise By Linda B.

If these lists aren't complete enough, may need to consult a homeopath, take one of my classes, or find other remedy lists\nFevers In Children do NOT go by her dosage information - use the information I post at the end of this section as to how to give a remedy for a minor acute illness or first aid\nFevers (Homeopathic Remedies)\nHe errs on the side of caution in the paragraphs in the first part of the page. See above for info on that. He is way to cautious in my opinion here - \"Any fever that is over 101 F for more than a sort period of time needs to be assessed by a medical professional. Any fever that rises suddenly to high temperatures, such 103 to 104, needs immediate professional help, as this can be a sign of a serious condition. The remedies given here are for simple, uncomplicated fever, as any other type of fever may need professional attention.\"\nI don't agree that 103 or 104 needs professional help unless prolonged fever and no progress being made or other serious symptoms. You have to make your own decision on that.\nI post this information for the remedy pictures he lists\nAgain, find the one remedy that matches the symptom picture the best, especially paying attention to the emotional state of the child while ill\nAdministering Homeopathic Remedies\nPut your dry pillules, tablets, in water to administer - see below\nBest not to take them dry. The vital force of the body does better if you put them in water and then raise the potency a little each time. The vital force doesn't do as well with the same potency over and over and that is the way you would do it if you used them dry\nPRINT this out and keep handy with your remedies.\nGenerally I suggest you use 30C (unless you have completed a course with me, then I suggest 200C). Do not treat for chronic or recurring things on your own or with 30C.\nDO NOT go by what is on the bottle (heaven only knows why fda or whatever makes them say that stuff)\nYou can give just a dry pillule, but it appears to work better to give in water (aqueous solution) and be able to succuss it between doses - but in a pinch, give as dry. (for an infant crush if possible or just put in a little water in a cup and let melt and then give.) But best to give in the way I describe below.\nBEST to give as an aqueous solution - one or two pillules/tablets in water\nPut ONE pillule or tablet in 6 oz of water (use purified, filtered water if possible) in a water bottle used only for this\nLet dissolve or sit for at least 5 minutes (the remedy coats the pillule which is sucrose or the tablet which is lactose)\nShake just a little\nTake one teaspoon out of water bottle and give to the person. Have person hold in their mouth for a few seconds if possible.\nWait.\nUse a plastic spoon (if you use a metal spoon, save it for use only for this person while being treated. After person well and not using it any longer, boil it in water for 5 minutes before it is washed and used for other things\nYou basically give 1 dose of 1 remedy and wait........\na. If improvement, don't give anymore\nb. If improvement and then same symptoms come back - give another dose of same\n1. to give another dose, take the water bottle you have and succuss it - this is strong downward thrusts from about 2 feet up - like a judge hitting a gavel do this 10 times on a book or something (you are succussing to slight raise the potency of what you have started with - it seems that the vital force does better with a little higher potency each time, than the same potency)\n2. give another teaspoon out of this\n3. if using a cup and not a water bottle - better to use water bottle though - stir briskly 10 times and give one teaspoon\nc. If improvement and new symptoms that are really a problem and body can't deal with itself - research and find what the new remedy should be (will sometimes use one remedy and shift things and then need a different to finish up)\nd. If no improvement on one dose of 30c in water, repeat it in 20-30 minutes; if no improvement on one dose if 200c in water, repeat it in 1 hour can do this 2 or 3 times with 200C or 30C. if no improvement after that probably wrong remedy\nImprovement you may see first is in mental/emotional symptoms, or sleep, or general well being, or thirst or appetite - then the physical symptoms may improve later If you are using 6X or something, may have to repeat oftener than a 30 C as the energy 'gets used up', in a way.\nIf you get near the end of the bottle, keep at least one teaspoon in there and add 6 ozs more of water to keep it going, as you have been raising the potency each time and don't want to start over. Mostly you will never get to this point as you will only be repeating 3 or 4 times. Don't need to refrigerate unless keeping overnight and usually this will not be the case.\nThrow all away at the end once treatment is over or not needing this remedy for this illness any longer\n"}, {"score": 438.3909, "uuid": "1c597609-2660-590e-b21d-24e19169d6af", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0608wb-57-34556", "target_hostname": "www.tamu.edu", "target_uri": "http://www.tamu.edu/emergency/procedures/flu/flu-FAQ.html", "page_rank": 1.2020656e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "Questions and Answers - Influenza - Emergency Procedures - Texas A&amp;M", "snippet": "This should be determined without the use of <em>fever</em>-<em>reducing</em> medications (any medicine that contains <em>ibuprofen</em> <em>or</em> acetaminophen).

To date, the highest number of cases of 2009 H1N1 flu have been confirmed among people 5-24 years old. They are also at risk of getting seasonal influenza.\nIs Texas A&M adequately prepared to handle the 2009-2010 flu season?\nYes. Campus preparations are firmly in place for what health officials anticipate will be an active season worldwide for both the seasonal flu and the H1N1 virus. However, efforts to fully combat the spread of the illness can't be successful without the help of all students, faculty and staff. As has been widely reported, flu can be spread easily from person to person. Therefore, university officials are taking steps to reduce the spread of flu. However, we need the entire Aggie Family to help us accomplish this by taking a few precautions - get a seasonal flu shot, practice good hand-washing procedures, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and cover your cough. We continue to work closely with the local, state and federal health officials to monitor flu conditions and make decisions about the best steps to take concerning our institution. We will keep you updated with new information as it becomes available to us. For now, we are doing everything we can to keep Texas A&M operating as usual.\nWhat steps should Texas A&M students, faculty and staff take to stay healthy and keep from spreading the flu?\nHere are four important ways faculty, students and staff can stay healthy and keep from getting sick with flu or spreading the flu. They should:\nPractice good hand hygiene. They should wash their hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.\nPractice respiratory etiquette. The main way flu spreads is from person to person in droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, so it's important that people cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze. If they don't have a tissue, they should cough or sneeze into their elbow or shoulder, not their hands.\nStay home if they are sick. Stay home or in their place of residence for at least 24 hours after they no long have a fever.\nTalk to their health care providers about whether they should be vaccinated. Students, faculty and staff who want protection from the flu are encouraged to get vaccinated for seasonal flu. Also students, faculty and staff who are at higher risk for flu complications from 2009 H1N1 flu should consider getting the H1N1 vaccine. People at higher risk for 2009 H1N1 flu complications include pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes). For more information about priority groups for vaccination, visit www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/acip.htm .\nStudents, faculty and staff should take personal responsibility to help slow the spread of the flu virus. By practicing these steps, they can keep from getting sick from flu and help protect others from getting the flu.\nContamination and Cleaning\nWith the growing concern about the spread of the virus, efforts have intensified campus-wide to help ensure the safety of the Aggie family. Custodial Services has implemented supplemental cleaning protocols to help ensure that you are as well protected as possible during the flu season. In highly trafficked areas, custodians are using sanitizing wipes to frequently clean water fountains, door knobs and handles, elevator buttons, handrails, glass, trim on doors and light switches. Also, restrooms and classrooms are being policed and cleaned more frequently than usual. Residence Hall staff will be wiping down common areas frequently with disinfectants. Students, faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to consider adopting a similar practice in their organizations to help prevent the spread of flu.\nSymptoms\nWhat are the symptoms of seasonal flu and the 2009 H1N1 flu?\nSymptoms of flu include fever or chills and cough or sore throat. In addition, symptoms of flu can include runny nose, body aches, headache, tiredness, diarrhea or vomiting.\nHow do I recognize a fever or signs of a fever?\nA fever is a temperature that is equal to or greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius when taken with a thermometer. Look for these possible signs of fever: if he or she feels very warm, has a flushed appearance, or is sweating or shivering.\nHow do I know if someone has 2009 H1N1 flu or seasonal flu?\nIt will be very hard to tell if someone who is sick has 2009 H1N1 flu or seasonal flu. Public health officials and medical authorities will not be recommending laboratory tests. Anyone who has the symptoms of flu-like illness should stay home and not go to work.\nWhat fever-reducing medications can students, faculty and staff take when sick?\nFever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be given to people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years of age who has flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome.\nPrevention\nWhat steps are Texas A&M officials taking to keep sick students, faculty and staff from spreading flu?\nStrongly encouraging sick students, faculty and staff to stay home and away from other people until at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have flushed appearance or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen).\nSick students are advised to return home for the recommended self-isolation period. Residence Life or the Commandant's staff will identify appropriate housing accommodations for ill students in the event that self-isolation is not possible and/or a student cannot return home. Non-corps students should contact their Resident Advisor or Hall Director and corps students should contact the Commandant's staff if they believe that they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.\nSick students with private rooms are asked to remain in their own rooms and receive care and meals from one person, if possible.\nIf students are ill, arrangements for food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) can be made by printing out a Sick Tray Request Form found at http://diningservices.tamu.edu/sicktrays.stm and having a friend take the completed form, along with the sick student's ID, to a dining center for food pick-up. The Sick Tray Request form authorizes a friend to use the sick student's ID to pick up food for them.\nOfficials are establishing a method for maintaining contact with students who are sick.\nThere will be on-going communication to instruct students, faculty and staff to promptly seek medical attention if they have a medical condition that places them at higher risk of flu-related complications, are concerned about their illness or develop severe symptoms. Severe symptoms include increased fever, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, fast breathing, bluish skin color, vomiting, dizziness or confusion.\nWhat is self-isolation?\nSelf-isolation is when sick people stay home and away from other people until they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have flushed appearance, or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen). During the period of self-isolation, sick people should limit contact with others and try to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from people. If close contact cannot be avoided, sick people should wear a surgical mask when they are around other people, if they can tolerate it.\nDuring current flu conditions, people who are sick should stay home and away from other people until at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever or signs of a fever. If flu conditions become more severe, those who are sick should stay at their home, dormitory or residence hall for at least 7 days, even if symptoms go away sooner. People who are still sick after 7 days should continue to stay home until at least 24 hours after symptoms have gone away.\nWho should receive a flu vaccination?\nVaccines will be available this year to protect against seasonal flu. Children 6 months through 18 years of age, people of any age with chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, heart disease, or diabetes) and everyone age 50 and older should be vaccinated against seasonal flu as early as possible. The 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine became available in the fall of 2009. Certain groups at higher risk for complications from this flu are advised to get the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine as soon as possible. These groups include:\npregnant women\npeople who live with and care for children younger than 6 months of age\nhealthcare and emergency medical services personnel\npeople between the ages of 6 months and 24 years (this includes most students attending institutions of higher education)\npeople ages 25-64 years of age who have chronic health conditions (such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes) or compromised immune systems.\nWill Texas A&M provide vaccinations for seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu?\nYes. Students are strongly encouraged to get the seasonal flu shot for fall 2009, available from Student Health Services for $18.00. Please call (979) 458-8250 to schedule an appointment. The H1N1 vaccination also will be offered to students when it becomes available.\nPeople at Higher Risk for Complications\nWhich students, faculty and staff are at higher risk for complications from flu?\nAnyone can get the flu (even healthy people) and anyone can have serious problems from the flu. Students, faculty and staff should be encouraged to talk with their health care provider to determine if they are at higher risk for flu complications, especially if they have been in close contact with others who are sick with flu or flu-like illness.\nSome groups are at higher risk for complications from the flu. These include children younger than 5 years of age, pregnant women, people of any age with chronic health conditions (such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease) and people 65 years of age and older.\nWhat actions should pregnant students, faculty or staff take to protect themselves from the flu?\nPregnant women should follow the same guidance as the general public related to staying home when sick, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and routine cleaning. Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from flu and, like all people at higher risk, should speak with their health care provider as soon as possible if they develop flu-like symptoms. Early treatment with antiviral flu medicines is recommended for pregnant women who have the flu; these medicines are most effective when started within the first 48 hours of feeling sick.\nPregnant women should know that they are part of the first priority group to receive the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine. Seasonal flu vaccine is also recommended for pregnant women and can be given at any time during pregnancy.\nIf You Are Sick - STUDENTS\nWhat should students living on campus do if they get the flu?\nStudents with flu-like illness should remain at home - except if they need to seek medical care - and should not go to class, student organization meetings, or other events until at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have a flushed appearance, or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen).\nIf students get sick, and live on campus or in the Bryan-College Station area, they are advised to return to their local residence for the recommended self-isolation period. Students should not use the university bus system or other forms of public transportation if they are ill. Additionally, students should avoid driving long distances while ill.\nResidence Life staff or the Commandant's Office will identify appropriate housing accommodations for ill students in the event that self-isolation is not possible and/or a student cannot return home. Non-corps students should notify their Resident Advisor or Hall Director and corps students should notify the Commandant's Office if they believe that they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.\nContact the Dial-a-Nurse 24-hour Nurse Advice Line at 979-458-8379 for advice about whether to seek medical evaluation and/or how to care for yourself. Antiviral medications, if started within the first 48 hours of onset of symptoms, may reduce the length of illness. Antiviral medications are appropriate for some, but not all, persons with flu-like symptoms.\nArrangements for food (breakfast, lunch and dinner) can be made by printing out a Sick Tray Request Form found at http://diningservices.tamu.edu/sicktrays.stm and having a friend take the completed form, along with the sick student's ID, to a dining center for food pick up. The Sick Tray Request form authorizes a friend to use the sick student's ID to pick up food for them.\nAlso, if students are going to miss class due to illness, it is important to communicate directly with their instructor through his/her preferred means of communication.\nWhat fever-reducing medications can students take when sick?\nFever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be given to people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years of age who have flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome.\nWhat steps should I take if my roommate is sick with the flu?\nYou should limit your contact with your sick roommate and try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from him or her.\nIf close contact cannot be avoided, your sick roommate should wear a surgical mask, if tolerable, when he or she is around you and other people.\nYou should frequently clean commonly-touched surfaces.\nHow long should students with the flu stay at home or in their residence?\nUnder current flu conditions, students with flu-like symptoms should stay home for at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have a flushed appearance, or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen). The sick person may decide to stop taking fever-reducing medicines as he or she begins to feel better. This person should continue to monitor his or her temperature until it has been normal for 24 hours.\nIf flu conditions become more severe, the sick person should stay home or in this or her residence for 7 days. A person who is still sick after 7 days should stay home until 24 hours after the symptoms have gone away. In addition, this longer period should be used in healthcare settings and may be considered anywhere a high number of people at higher risk for complications from flu may be exposed, such as childcare facilities. Sick people should stay at home or in their residence, except to go to the health care provider's office, and they should avoid contact with others. Keeping people with a fever at home may reduce the number of people who get infected with the flu virus. Because high body temperatures are linked with higher amounts of virus, people with a fever may be more contagious.\nWhat is Texas A&M's policy regarding sick leave for students?\nMost importantly, if students are experiencing flu-like symptoms, please stay home - except if you need to seek medical care - and do not go to class , student organization meetings, or other events until your fever is gone for a 24-hour period without fever- reducing medication. The Aggie Honor Code and the Student Rules (Rule 7) apply to students who, because of illness, may need to makeup absences, exams or assignments. During this flu season, we likely will not be able to require a medical professional to verify a flu-like illness for an excused medical absence. Faculty members are encouraged to err on the side of caution and will use their judgment regarding proper documentation for absenteeism. Students will not be penalized if they act responsibly.\nStudents who have the flu are strongly encouraged to be proactive in communicating with their instructors using the instructor's prescribed method of communication. Also, faculty members have been urged to reiterate how they want their students to contact them - telephone, email, etc. - if they must miss a class.\nStudent Health Services has posted a form on its website, titled \"Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class for Influenza-like Illness.\" This form will be considered as sufficient documentation for class absences related to influenza-like illness. The form and more information about how to use the form can be found at http://flu.tamu.edu .\nWhat should international students do if classes are suspended at a U.S. institution of higher education they are attending?\nInternational students should follow all flu recommendations their institutions make for students. If classes are suspended during severe flu conditions, international students and others who do not have easy access to alternative housing should stay on campus. Students should try to limit contact with other people. Institutions should plan to continue education through distance-based learning methods for students who remain on campus as well as those who leave to go home.\nParent of a sick student\nAs a parent of a student who attends Texas A&M, should I bring them home?\nIf possible, residential students with flu-like illness whose families live near the Bryan-College Station area should go home to self-isolate. They should return home in a way that limits contact with others as much as possible. For example, travel by private car or taxi would be preferable over use of public transportation. They should stay away from other people until at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have a flushed appearance or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen).\nShould my child who is a student at Texas A&M get antiviral medicine if they get sick?\nParents should make sure their child knows if he or she is at higher risk for flu complications. People at higher risk for flu complications, including students, faculty and staff with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes), who become sick with flu-like illness should call their health care provider as soon as possible to determine if they need antiviral treatment. Early treatment with antiviral medicines often can prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Parents should encourage sick students who are at higher risk for flu complications to seek early treatment. Antiviral medicines are not given to all people during flu season because most people get better on their own, over-use can promote antiviral-resistant viruses and administration of antiviral medicines can cause adverse reactions in some people.\nIf You Are Sick - Faculty & Staff\nWhat should faculty and staff do if they get the flu?\nMost importantly, if you are sick, please stay home - except to seek medical care - and do not go to work or class until you have been without a fever for 24 hours without taking a fever-reducing medication. We ask that you notify your supervisor immediately if you become ill with flu-like symptoms and ensure that your leave records are as up-to-date as possible. If you come to work sick, you may be required to take leave if your supervisor determines that continued work could potentially create a significant risk to co-workers and other Texas A&M employees.\nWhat fever-reducing medications can faculty and staff take when sick?\nFever-reducing medications are medicines that contain acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Motrin). These medicines can be given to people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their pain. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years of age who have flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called Reye's syndrome.\nWhat is Texas A&M's policy regarding sick leave for employees?\nIt is important that Texas A&M System regulations regarding sick leave ( PDF ) be followed. As stated in the regulation and in an effort to ease the burden on health care providers, if an employee is ill for more than three days with the flu, supervisors and/or managers are permitted to allow the employee to provide a written statement of the facts concerning the illness without requiring a doctor's note. However, based on the specific situation, supervisors and/or managers may require documentation by the physician for any illness of more than three days.\nHow long should faculty and staff member with the flu stay at home or in their residence?\nUnder current flu conditions faculty and staff with flu-like symptoms should stay home for at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever (100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) or signs of a fever (have chills, feel very warm, have a flushed appearance, or are sweating). This should be determined without the use of fever-reducing medications (any medicine that contains ibuprofen or acetaminophen). The sick person may decide to stop taking fever-reducing medicines as he or she begins to feel better. This person should continue to monitor his or her temperature until it has been normal for 24 hours.\nIf flu conditions become more severe, the sick person should stay home or in their residence for 7 days. A person who is still sick after 7 days should stay home until 24 hours after the symptoms have gone away. In addition, this longer period should be used in healthcare settings and may be considered anywhere a high number of people at higher risk for complications from flu may be exposed, such as childcare facilities.\nSick people should stay at home or in their residence except to go to the health care provider's office, and they should avoid contact with others. Keeping people with a fever at home may reduce the number of people who get infected with the flu virus. Because high body temperatures are linked with higher amounts of virus, people with a fever may be more contagious.\nInternational Travel\nWhat should I do if I'm planning to travel abroad?\nAnyone planning international travel should check with the U.S. Department of State ( http://www.state.gov/ ) for the most current travel alerts, and be familiar with the university's international travel guidelines and resources .\n"}, {"score": 437.27988, "uuid": "273d8f26-a451-5946-a83e-379aa61ff31f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0409wb-18-21872", "target_hostname": "swedishcovenant.org", "target_uri": "http://swedishcovenant.org/health-library/article/d03439a1", "page_rank": 1.1784063e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Health Library | Swedish Covenant Hospital", "snippet": "It works by <em>reducing</em> substances <em>in</em> the body that cause pain, <em>fever</em>, and inflammation.

Aspirin can cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called Reye's syndrome in children.\nYou should not use this medication if you are allergic to acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, or caffeine, or if you have liver disease, stomach or intestinal bleeding, a history of asthma or severe allergic reaction to aspirin or an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug).\nDo not use this medication without first talking to your doctor if you drink more than three alcoholic beverages per day or if you have had alcoholic liver disease (cirrhosis). You may not be able to use acetaminophen.\nAsk a doctor or pharmacist about using acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine if you have asthma or seasonal allergies, fever with a stiff neck, a stomach ulcer or pain, heartburn, a bleeding or blood clotting disorder, diabetes, or gout.\nDo not use more of this medication than is recommended. An overdose of acetaminophen can cause serious harm. The maximum amount of acetaminophen for adults is 1 gram (1000 mg) per dose and 4 grams (4000 mg) per day.\nStop using this medication and call your doctor at once if you have any symptoms of liver damage or bleeding in your stomach or intestines. Symptoms of liver damage include nausea, stomach pain, low fever, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Symptoms of stomach bleeding include weakness or fainting, bloody or tarry stools, and coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.\nAvoid drinking alcohol while you are taking this medication. Alcohol may increase your risk of stomach bleeding while taking aspirin, or liver damage while taking acetaminophen.\nDo not use any other over-the-counter cough, cold, allergy, pain, menstrual symptom, or fever medication without first asking your doctor or pharmacist. Acetaminophen (sometimes abbreviated as \"APAP\"), aspirin, and caffeine are contained in many combination medicines. If you use certain products together you may accidentally use too much of a certain drug.\nWhat is acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine?\nAcetaminophen is a pain reliever and a fever reducer.\nAspirin is in a group of drugs called salicylates (sa-LIS-il-ates). It works by reducing substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.\nCaffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It relaxes muscle contractions in blood vessels to improve blood flow.\nThe combination of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine is used to treat pain caused by tension headaches, migraine headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, arthritis, toothaches, the common cold, or nasal congestion.\nAspirin should be used for cardiovascular conditions only under the supervision of a doctor.\nAcetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine may also be used for other purposes not listed in this medication guide.\nWhat should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine?\nAspirin should not be given to a child or teenager who has a fever, especially if the child also has flu symptoms or chicken pox.

However, a persistent immune response to chronic infections in the mouth is believed to play a major role in gum destruction.\nBacterial Culprits\nReachers have found more than 350 species of microorganisms in the typical healthy mouth. Periodontal infections are linked to fewer than 5% of these species. Healthy and disease-causing bacteria can generally be grouped into two categories:\nThe harmless or helpful bacteria are usually known as gram positive aerobic bacteria.\nIn periodontal disease, the bacterial balance shifts over to gram negative anaerobic bacteria. Inflammatory disease and injury cannot develop without these bacteria.\nFollowing are some of the bacteria most implicated in periodontal disease and bone loss:\nActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. These two bacteria appear to be particularly likely to cause aggressive periodontal disease. Both P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, along with multiple deep pockets in the gum, are associated with resistance to standard treatments for gum disease. P. gingivalis may double the risk for serious gum disease. P. gingivalis produces enzymes, such as one called arginine-specific cysteine proteinase, that may disrupt the immune system and lead to subsequent periodontal connective tissue destruction.\nBacteroides forsythus is also strongly linked to periodontal disease.\nOther bacteria associated with periodontal disease are Treponema denticola, T. socranskii, and P. intermedia. These bacteria, together with P. gingivalis, are frequently present at the same sites, and are associated with deep periodontal pockets.\nSome bacteria are related to gingivitis, but not plaque development. They include various streptococcal species.\nThe Autoimmune and Inflammatory Response\nEvidence indicates that periodontal disease is an autoimmune disorder, in which immune factors in the body attack the person's own cells and tissue -- in this case, those in the gum. It appears to work like this:\nThe bacteria that form plaque and tartar release toxins that stimulate the immune system to overproduce powerful infection-fighting factors called cytokines.\nOrdinarily, cytokines are important for healing. In excess, however, they can cause inflammation and severe damage.\nIn addition, white blood cells produced by the immune response to bacteria also release a family of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which break down connective tissue.\nStudies suggest that this inflammatory response may have damaging effects not only in the gums but also in organs throughout the body, including the heart.\nViral Causes\nCertain herpes viruses (herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox and shingles) are known causes of gingivitis. Other herpes viruses (cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr) may also play a role in the onset or progression of some types of periodontal disease, including aggressive and severe chronic periodontal disease. All herpes viruses go through an active phase followed by a latent phase and possibly reactivation.\nThese viruses may cause periodontal disease in different ways, including release of tissue-destructive cytokines, overgrowth of periodontal bacteria, suppressing immune factors, and initiation of other disease processes that lead to cell death.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nMore than 75% of American adults have some form of gum disease, but according to a major survey, only 60% have any significant knowledge about the problem. Gum inflammation and ulcers are common, and not all people with these problems develop periodontal disease. Still, about 30% of people are genetically susceptible to periodontal disease. Other factors also put individuals at higher risk.\nOral Environment\nLack of Oral Hygiene. Lack of oral hygiene encourages bacterial buildup and plaque formation.\nSugar and Acid. The bacteria that cause periodontal disease thrive in acidic environments. Therefore, eating sugars and other foods that increase the acidity in the mouth increase bacterial counts.\nPoorly Contoured Restorations. Poorly contoured restorations (fillings or crowns) that provide traps for debris and plaque can also contribute to its formation.\nAnatomical Tooth Abnormalities. Abnormal tooth structure can increase the risk.\nWisdom Teeth. Wisdom teeth, also called third molars, can be a major breeding ground for the bacteria that cause periodontal disease. In fact, for patients in their 20s, periodontal disease is most likely to occur around the wisdom teeth. Periodontitis can occur in wisdom teeth that have broken through the gum as well as teeth that are impacted (buried). Periodontal disease can also be present even in patients with wisdom teeth who do not have any symptoms. Adolescents and young adults with wisdom teeth should have a dentist check for signs of periodontal disease.\nAge\nChildren and Adolescents. Gingivitis, in varying degrees, is nearly a universal finding in children and adolescents. In rare genetic cases, children and adolescents are subject to destructive forms of the disease. Researchers have also observed some of the organisms seen in periodontal disease in young children without signs of gum problems. Healthy children, however, do not generally harbor two primary periodontal bacteria, P. gingivalis and T. denticola. The disease is also uncommon in teenagers.\nAdults. As people age, the risk for periodontal disease increases. Over half of American adults have gingivitis surrounding 3 - 4 teeth, and 30% have significant periodontal disease surrounding 3 - 4 teeth. In a study of people over 70 years old, 86% had at least moderate periodontitis, and over a quarter of them had lost their teeth.\nFemale Hormones\nAbout three-quarters of periodontal office visits are made by women, even though women tend to take better care of their teeth than men. Female hormones affect the gums, and women are particularly susceptible to periodontal problems. Hormone-influenced gingivitis appears in some adolescents, in some pregnant women, and is occasionally a side effect of birth control medication.\nBefore Menstruation. Gingivitis may flare up in some women a few days before they menstruate, when progesterone levels are high. Gum inflammation may also occur during ovulation. Progesterone dilates blood vessels causing inflammation, and blocks the repair of collagen, the structural protein that supports the gums.\nPregnancy. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can aggravate existing gingivitis, which typically worsens around the second month and reaches a peak in the eighth month. Pregnancy does not cause gum disease, and simple preventive oral hygiene can help maintain healthy gums. Any pregnancy-related gingivitis usually resolves within a few months of delivery. Because periodontal disease can increase the risk for low-weight infants and cause other complications, it is important for pregnant women to see a dentist.\nOral Contraceptives. Some studies report that oral contraceptives containing the synthetic progesterone desogestrel (but not dienogest, another common progesterone) increase the risk for periodontal disease.\nMenopause. Estrogen deficiency after menopause reduces bone mineral density, which can lead to bone loss. Bone loss is associated with both periodontal disease and osteoporosis. Bone loss in the alveolar bone (which holds the tooth in place) may be a major predictor of tooth loss in postmenopausal women. Periodontal disease is the main cause of alveolar bone loss. During menopause, some women may also develop a rare condition called menopausal gingivostomatitis, in which the gums are dry, shiny, and bleed easily. Women may also experience abnormal tastes and sensations (such as salty, spicy, acidic, and burning) in the mouth.\nFamily Factors\nPeriodontal disease often occurs in members of the same family. Genetics, intimacy, hygiene, or a mixture of factors may be responsible. Studies have found that children of parents with periodontitis are 12 times more likely to have the bacteria thought to be responsible for causing plaque and, eventually, periodontal disease.\nGenetic Factors. Genetic factors may play the critical role in half the cases of periodontal disease. Up to 30% of the population may have some genetic susceptibility to periodontal disease.\nIntimacy. Intimate partners and spouses of people with periodontal disease may also be at risk. Researchers have found that the bacteria P. gingivalis may be contagious after exposure to an infected person over a long period of time. There is no risk from short exposure, such as after a fast kiss or when sharing an eating utensil.\nSmoking and Nicotine\nSmoking is the single major preventable risk factor for periodontal disease. The habit can cause bone loss and gum recession even in the absence of periodontal disease. A number of studies indicate that smoking and nicotine increase inflammation by reducing oxygen in gum tissue and triggering an over-production of immune factors called cytokines (specifically ones called interleukins). In excess, cytokines are harmful to cells and tissue.\nFurthermore, when nicotine combines with oral bacteria, such as P. gingivalis, the effect produces even greater levels of cytokines and eventually leads to periodontal connective tissue breakdown. Smokers may be more than 10 times more likely than nonsmokers to harbor the bacteria that cause periodontal disease and are also more likely to have advanced periodontal disease.\nThe risk of periodontal disease increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Smoking cigars and pipes carries the same risks as smoking cigarettes. Exposure to secondhand smoke may also be associated with an increased risk for developing periodontal disease, according to one study. Fortunately, when smokers quit, their periodontal health gradually recovers to a state comparable to that of nonsmokers.\nSome research also indicates that regular cannabis (marijuana) smoking also increases the risk of periodontal disease.\nDiseases Associated with Periodontal Disease\nDiabetes. Much evidence exists on the link between type 1 and 2 diabetes and periodontal disease. Diabetes causes changes in blood vessels, and high levels of specific inflammatory chemicals such as interleukins, that significantly increase the chances of periodontal disease. High levels of triglycerides (which are common in type 2 diabetes) also appear to impair periodontal health. Obesity, common in people with type 2 diabetes, may also predispose a person to gum disease. Controlling both type 1 and 2 diabetes may help reduce periodontal problems. For children with diabetes, good oral hygiene should begin at a young age.\nOsteoporosis and Osteonecrosis. Osteoporosis (loss of bone density) has been associated with periodontal disease in postmenopausal women.\nThere have been a few reports of osteonecrosis (bone decay) of the jaw in patients who take oral bisphosphonate drugs such as alendronate (Fosamax). However, almost all cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bisphosphonate drugs occur during or after the use of intravenous bisphosphonates, usually given as part of treatment for bone cancer or other cancers that have spread to the bone. Symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaw include loose teeth, exposed jawbone, pain or swelling in the jaw, gum infections, and poor healing of the gums.\nAs a precaution, the American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that patients who are prescribed or are to receive bisphosphonate drugs get a thorough dental exam before beginning drug therapy, or as soon as possible after beginning therapy. The ADA also recommends that patients who take oral bisphosphonate drugs should discuss with their dentists any potential risks from dental procedures (such as extractions and implants) that involve the jawbone. In any case, be sure to inform your dentist if you are taking a bisphosphonate drug. Your dentist or oral surgeon may need to take special precautions when performing dental surgery.\nHerpes-Related Gingivitis. Herpes virus is a common cause of gingivitis in children and has become increasingly common in adults. It typically starts out with a purplish color and \"boggy\" sensation in the gums. Multiple blisters may form across the mucus membranes in the mouth and gums, followed by ulcers. They usually resolve in 7 - 14 days.\nHIV-Associated Gingivitis. HIV-associated gingivitis has been reported in 15 - 50% of patients with HIV or AIDS. HIV-positive individuals harbor larger numbers of periodontal bacteria (candida albicans, P. gingivalis, black-pigmented anaerobic rods, and A. actinomycetemcomitans) than people without HIV. Severe pain is characteristic, along with odor, spontaneous bleeding, ulcers, and swollen, bright red gums. The inflammation never recedes, but halitosis and acute episodes can be managed by conventional cleaning treatments. Its severest form, known as necrotizing stomatitis, can be diagnostic for AIDS. In addition to bleeding, the gums in the front of the mouth are a yellowish-gray color, and bone thrusts out.\nAutoimmune Diseases. Autoimmune conditions (Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, CREST syndrome) have been associated with a higher incidence of periodontal disease. Some research suggests that periodontal disease may even play some causal role. Still, more research is needed to determine a definitive association between these diseases.\nOther Diseases. People with tuberculosis, syphilis, Wegener's granulomatosis, amyloidosis, and many genetic disorders are also at higher risk for periodontitis.\nVitamin C Deficiencies\nVitamin C helps the body repair and maintain connective tissue, and its antioxidant effects are important in the presence of tissue-destroying oxidants in periodontal disease. Research indicates that vitamin C deficiency contributes to periodontal disease. Vitamin C levels are especially depleted in smokers. Eating citrus fruits high in vitamin C (such as grapefruit) may be helpful for patients with periodontitis.\nClick the icon to see an image of the sources of vitamin C.\nEthnic, Socioeconomic, and Geographic Factors\nDental disease is most likely to affect the poor. Children and the elderly suffer the worst oral care, and ethnic minorities follow. In the United States, the lack of access to dental insurance is a contributing factor.\nDrug-Induced Gingivitis\nGingival overgrowth can be a side effect of nearly 20 different drugs, most commonly phenytoin (Dilantin), cyclosporine (Sandimmune), and a short-acting form of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Procardia).\nOther Causes of Gum Inflammation\nSeveral other conditions can also cause gum inflammation, and some have been associated with periodontal disease. They include:\nMouth breathing\nPsychologic stress. Stress can affect the immune system. Some studies suggest that stress can influence the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, like periodontitis.\nAlcohol abuse. One study reported a higher incidence of periodontal disease, tooth decay, and possibly precancerous areas in patients who abuse alcohol.\nCanker sores (aphthous ulcers)\nClick the icon to see an image of a canker sore.\nSelf-injury in psychologically disturbed patients\nHereditary gingival fibromatosis. A rare genetic disease associated with both gum overgrowth and hairiness. It is often associated with gingivitis and periodontal disease.\nDesquamative gingivitis. With this condition the outer layer of the gum tissue desquamates (peels away), exposing an acutely red surface. It usually occurs as a result of an allergic reaction or of skin diseases such as lichen planus, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris. This condition generally resolves when the underlying problem is treated. It is fairly common in middle-aged women.\nBack to Top\nComplications\nThe ultimate outcome of uncontrolled periodontal disease is tooth loss. As the destructive factors cause the breakdown of bone and connective tissue, teeth lose their anchor.\nBad Breath\nA much less severe but nevertheless distressing problem caused by periodontal disease is bad breath, although coatings on the tongue may contribute more to bad breath than periodontal disease.\nHeart Disease and Stroke\nStudies have reported that people who have heart disease have a 1.5 - 4 times increased risk for periodontal disease. (The risk is highest for patients with extensive gum disease, bleeding from every tooth.) Acute coronary syndrome, high blood pressure (hypertension), and high cholesterol have also been associated with periodontal disease.\nPeriodontal disease has also been linked to stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD). The more severe the periodontitis, the greater the risk for heart problems. However, it is still not clear whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for stroke or a marker that reflects various risk factors common to both conditions.\nAn inflammatory response may be the common element. This is an over-reaction of the immune system that causes injury to tissues in the body. Patients with heart conditions and periodontal disease may have elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which indicates inflammation is present. Some research indicates that this inflammatory response can also cause injury in the arteries supplying blood to the heart.\nOther evidence suggests that the periodontal disease bacteria themselves -- particularly P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia, and streptococci species -- may be associated with thicker carotid arteries (a predictor of heart attack and stroke), regardless of C-reactive protein levels. It is still not clear if periodontal disease actually causes heart disease.\nIt is also not clear if treating gum disease can reduce the risks of heart disease and improve health outcomes for patients with periodontal disease and vascular heart problems. Studies have been mixed, but research is ongoing.\nEffect on Diabetes\nDiabetes is not only a risk factor for periodontal disease -- periodontal disease itself can worsen diabetes and make it more difficult to control blood sugar.\nEffect on Respiratory Disease\nBacteria that reproduce in the mouth can also be carried into the airways in the throat and lungs, increasing the risks for respiratory diseases and worsening chronic lung conditions, such as emphysema.\nClick the icon to see an image of emphysema.\nEffect on Pregnancy\nMany studies strongly indicate that bacterial infections that cause moderate-to-severe periodontal disease in pregnant women can increase the risk for premature delivery and low birth weight infants. The more severe the infection, the greater the risk to the baby. Research indicates that bacteria from gum disease and tooth decay may trigger the same factors in the immune system, which can then cause premature dilation and contractions.\nWomen should have a periodontal examination before becoming pregnant or as soon as possible thereafter. Because women with diabetes are at higher risk for periodontal disease, it is especially important that they see a dentist early in pregnancy. Doctors are still not sure if treating periodontal disease can improve birth outcomes. In any case, periodontal treatment is safe for pregnant women.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nHealthy habits and good oral hygiene are critical in preventing gum disease. Regular and effective tooth brushing and mouth washing, however, are effective only above and slightly below the gum line. Once periodontal disease develops, more intensive treatments are needed.\nDietary Changes\nIt is important to reduce both the quantity and, in particular, the frequency of sugar intake. Avoid snacks and drinks with sugar (other than natural sugars found in fruits and vegetables). Eat sugar-containing foods with meals, ideally followed by brushing. Since fruit juices can also cause tooth erosion in children, parents should emphasize milk and water.\nQuitting Smoking\nSmoking plays a significant role in many cases of chronic periodontal disease. For smokers, quitting is one of the most important steps toward regaining periodontal health.\nFluoride Treatments\nFluoride treatment in children has helped to account for the decline in periodontal disease in adults. Because fluoride prevents decay, back molars, which keep the teeth in place, are spared, and are thus less vulnerable to bacteria. Even before teeth first erupt, babies' gums should be wiped clean with a bit of gauze bearing a dab of fluoride toothpaste. Supplementation with fluoride tablets or drops may be recommended for children 6 months or older who drink unfluoridated water or who are at risk for dental problems. A prescription from the child's pediatrician or dentist is required.\nSome dentists recommend a fluoride gel for adult patients who are still at risk for tooth decay or sensitivity, but extra fluoride is generally not necessary for adults who use fluoride toothpaste.\nDental Examinations\nPeriodontitis is a silent disease. People with the disease rarely experience pain and may not be aware of the problem. A periodontal examination by a general dentist once or twice a year should reveal any incipient or progressive problems. A full mouth series of x-rays is advised every 2 - 3 years. This will alert the dentist to early bone loss and other disorders of the oral cavity.\nDentists now often perform Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR) using a probe to measure gum pockets. Previously performed only by periodontists, this procedure is now encouraged as part of a regular dental examination. The dentist will identify any areas where deep pocketing has occurred, where the health of the gingiva appears compromised, and where there is undue mobility of teeth. It is the general dentist's responsibility to identify periodontal disease and inform the patient. If the condition is severe, the dentist may want to refer the patient to a periodontist.\nDaily Dental Care\nCorrect tooth brushing, mouth cleansing, and flossing should be everyone's defense against periodontal disease. (However, good hygiene is probably not enough to prevent periodontal disease in many people. Regular visits to a dentist are extremely important, especially for high-risk individuals.)\nBrushing Guidelines. The following are some recommendations for brushing:\nUse a soft-bristled brush that fits the size and shape of your mouth. Place the brush where the gum meets the tooth, with bristles resting along each tooth at a 45-degree angle.\nPlace the brush where the gum meets the tooth, with bristles resting along each tooth at a 45-degree angle.\nMove the brush back and forth gently. Use short (tooth-wide) strokes.\nBegin by brushing the outer tooth surfaces, followed by the inner tooth surfaces, and then the chewing surfaces of the teeth.\nFor the inside surfaces of the front teeth, gently use the tip of the brush in an up-and-down stroke.\nBrush your tongue to help remove additional bacteria.\nFlossing should finish the process. A mouthwash may also be used.\nIf brushing after each meal is not possible, rinsing the mouth with water after eating can reduce bacteria by 30%.\nToothbrushes. A vast assortment of brushes of varying sizes and shapes are available, and each manufacturer makes its claim for the benefits of a particular brush. Look for the American Dental Association (ADA) seal on both electric and regular brushes.\nIn spite of the wide variety of nonelectric toothbrushes, both in shape and bristle design, a study of eight brands found no significant differences in effectiveness among them.\nElectric toothbrushes, particularly those with a stationary grip and revolving tufts of bristles, can be advantageous for some people with physical disabilities. Electric toothbrushes with heads that move back and forth up to thousands of times a minute remove significantly more plaque than ordinary brushes. Even more high-tech brushes are now available that use sound waves to remove plaque.\nIn general, studies have reported no differences between electric and manual toothbrushes in their ability to remove plaque. However, if a regular toothbrush works, it isn't necessary to buy an expensive electric one.\nFor individuals with average dexterity, a four- or five-rowed, soft, nylon-bristled toothbrush is sufficient. The most important factor in buying any toothbrush, electric or manual, is to choose one with a soft head. Soft bristles get into crevices easier and do not irritate the gums, thereby reducing the risk of exposing teeth below the gum line compared to hard brushes.\nToothbrushes should be replaced every 1 - 3 months. Not only do they become breeding grounds for bacteria, but the worn bristles are less effective at removing plaque.\nToothpaste. The objective of a good toothpaste is to reduce the development of plaque and eliminate periodontal-causing microorganisms without destroying the organisms that are important for a healthy mouth. All brands should show ADA approval. Even a good toothpaste, however, cannot be delivered past 3 mm below the gum line, where periodontitis develops.\nToothpastes are a combination of abrasives, binders, colors, detergents, flavors, fluoride, humectants, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners. Avoid highly abrasive toothpastes, especially for individuals whose gums have receded.\nIngredients contained in toothpastes may include:\nFluoride. Most commercial toothpastes contain fluoride, which both strengthens tooth enamel against decay and enhances remineralization of the enamel. Fluoride also inhibits acid-loving bacteria, especially after eating, when the mouth is more acidic. This antibacterial activity may help control plaque.\nTriclosan. Triclosan is an anti-bacterial substance that may help reduce mild gingivitis.\nMetal salts. Metal salts, such as stannous and zinc, serve mostly as anti-bacterial substances in toothpastes. Stannous fluoride gel toothpastes do not reduce plaque, however, even though they have some effect against the bacteria that cause it, but slightly reduce gingivitis.\nPeroxide and baking soda. Toothpastes with these ingredients claim to have a whitening action, but while they may help remove stains there is little evidence they whiten the actual color of the teeth. In addition, these substances appear to offer no benefits against gum disease.\nAntibacterial sugar substitutes (xylitol), and detergents (delmopinol)\nMouthwashes. The American Dental Association recommends (in addition to daily brushing and flossing) antimicrobial mouthwash to help prevent and reduce plaque and gingivitis, and fluoride mouthwashes to help provide additional protection against tooth decay.\nChlorhexidine (Peridex or PerioGard) is an antimicrobial mouthwash available by prescription only. It reduces plaque by 55% and gingivitis by 30 - 45%. Patients should rinse for 1 minute twice daily. They should wait at least 30 minutes (and preferably 2 hours) between brushing and rinsing since chlorhexidine can be inactivated by certain compounds in toothpastes. It has a bitter taste. It also binds to tannins, which are in tea, coffee, and red wine, so it has tendency to stain teeth in people who drink these beverages. Studies are mixed as to its effectiveness for preventing or reducing periodontal disease.\nListerine is another antimicrobial mouthwash. It is composed of essential oils and is available over the counter. It reduces plaque and gingivitis, when used for 30 seconds twice a day. It leaves a burning sensation in the mouth that most people better tolerate after a few days of use. The usual regimen is to rinse twice a day. (Listerine PocketPaks, which are strips that dissolve on the tongue, have no proven effects on plague and gingivitis.)\nMouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium (Scope, Cepacol) have moderate antimicrobial effect on plaque, but only if they are used an hour after brushing. None are as effective as Listerine or chlorhexidine, but they may still have some value for people who cannot tolerate the other mouthwashes.\nMouthwashes containing stannous fluoride and amine fluoride (Meridol) are moderately effective, but are also not as effective as effective as Listerine or chlorhexidine.\nFluoride mouthwashes (Act) are helpful in preventing cavities.\nMouthwashes that contain alcohol are dangerous for children and should be kept away from them.\nFlossing. The use of dental floss, either waxed or unwaxed, is critical in cleaning between the teeth where the toothbrush bristles cannot reach. In spite of this, nearly two-thirds of people do not floss.\nTo floss correctly, the following steps may be helpful:\nBreak off about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around the middle finger of one hand and the rest around the other middle finger.\nHold the floss between the thumbs and forefingers and gently guide and rub it back and forth between the teeth.\nWhen it reaches the gum line, the floss should be curved around each tooth and slid gently back and forth against the gum.\nFinally, rub gently up and down against the tooth. Repeat with each tooth, including the outside of the back teeth.\nIf, on repeated flossing attempts, the floss becomes shredded or cannot be removed easily from between the teeth, a rough crown or overhanging filling may be the cause. In such cases, the restoration should be redone. Such areas create spaces for the collection of food debris, plaque, and calculus.\nHere are some tips in choosing the right floss or flossing device:\nUse a floss that does not shred or break.\nAvoid a very thin floss, which can cut the gum if brought down with too much force or not guided along the side of the tooth.\nA floss threader is an invaluable aid for the person who has bridgework. Made of plastic, it looks like a needle with a huge eye, or loop. A piece of floss is threaded into the loop, which can then be inserted between the bridge and the gum. The floss that is carried through with it can then be used to clean underneath the false tooth or teeth and along the sides of the abutting teeth.\nAnother handy device for cleaning under bridges is a Proxabrush, which is an interdental cleaner. This is a tiny narrow brush that can be worked in between the natural teeth and around the attached false tooth or teeth.\nSpecial toothpicks such as Stim-U-Dent may be effective for wide spaces between teeth but should never replace flossing. Standard toothpicks should never be used for regular hygiene.\nElectronic products, such as water piks, are also helpful. These devices are expensive but may improve flossing compliance.\nProducing Saliva and Drinking Water. Saliva is important for diluting the toxins created by plaque. Drinking at least 7 glasses of water a day helps reduce inflammation in the mouth by producing more saliva. Increasing water intake is particularly important as one ages, when less saliva is produced.\n"}, {"score": 434.77536, "uuid": "c3dbf2a5-a753-5c9d-ad14-9da3b3653360", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0605wb-19-03161", "target_hostname": "www.myoptumhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.myoptumhealth.com/portal/ADAM/item/Periodontal+disease", "page_rank": 1.1734056e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Periodontal disease Information <em>at</em> myOptumHealth", "snippet": "[Taking a common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as <em>aspirin</em> <em>or</em> <em>ibuprofen</em> (Advil) along with doxycycline, may enhance the effectiveness of this treatment.]", "explanation": null, "document": "Back to Top\nCauses\nPeriodontal disease is marked by bacterial overgrowth. However, a persistent immune response to chronic infections in the mouth is believed to play a major role in gum destruction.\nBacterial Culprits\nReachers have found more than 350 species of microorganisms in the typical healthy mouth. Periodontal infections are linked to fewer than 5% of these species. Healthy and disease-causing bacteria can generally be grouped into two categories:\nThe harmless or helpful bacteria are usually known as gram positive aerobic bacteria.\nIn periodontal disease, the bacterial balance shifts over to gram negative anaerobic bacteria. Inflammatory disease and injury cannot develop without these bacteria.\nFollowing are some of the bacteria most implicated in periodontal disease and bone loss:\nActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. These two bacteria appear to be particularly likely to cause aggressive periodontal disease. Both P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, along with multiple deep pockets in the gum, are associated with resistance to standard treatments for gum disease. P. gingivalis may double the risk for serious gum disease. P. gingivalis produces enzymes, such as one called arginine-specific cysteine proteinase, that may disrupt the immune system and lead to subsequent periodontal connective tissue destruction.\nBacteroides forsythus is also strongly linked to periodontal disease.\nOther bacteria associated with periodontal disease are Treponema denticola, T. socranskii, and P. intermedia. These bacteria, together with P. gingivalis, are frequently present at the same sites, and are associated with deep periodontal pockets.\nSome bacteria are related to gingivitis, but not plaque development. They include various streptococcal species.\nThe Autoimmune and Inflammatory Response\nEvidence indicates that periodontal disease is an autoimmune disorder, in which immune factors in the body attack the person's own cells and tissue -- in this case, those in the gum. It appears to work like this:\nThe bacteria that form plaque and tartar release toxins that stimulate the immune system to overproduce powerful infection-fighting factors called cytokines.\nOrdinarily, cytokines are important for healing. In excess, however, they can cause inflammation and severe damage.\nIn addition, white blood cells produced by the immune response to bacteria also release a family of enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which break down connective tissue.\nStudies suggest that this inflammatory response may have damaging effects not only in the gums but also in organs throughout the body, including the heart.\nViral Causes\nCertain herpes viruses (herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox and shingles) are known causes of gingivitis. Other herpes viruses (cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr) may also play a role in the onset or progression of some types of periodontal disease, including aggressive and severe chronic periodontal disease. All herpes viruses go through an active phase followed by a latent phase and possibly reactivation.\nThese viruses may cause periodontal disease in different ways, including release of tissue-destructive cytokines, overgrowth of periodontal bacteria, suppressing immune factors, and initiation of other disease processes that lead to cell death.\nBack to Top\nRisk Factors\nMore than 75% of American adults have some form of gum disease, but according to a major survey, only 60% have any significant knowledge about the problem. Gum inflammation and ulcers are common, and not all people with these problems develop periodontal disease. Still, about 30% of people are genetically susceptible to periodontal disease. Other factors also put individuals at higher risk.\nOral Environment\nLack of Oral Hygiene. Lack of oral hygiene encourages bacterial buildup and plaque formation.\nSugar and Acid. The bacteria that cause periodontal disease thrive in acidic environments. Therefore, eating sugars and other foods that increase the acidity in the mouth increase bacterial counts.\nPoorly Contoured Restorations. Poorly contoured restorations (fillings or crowns) that provide traps for debris and plaque can also contribute to its formation.\nAnatomical Tooth Abnormalities. Abnormal tooth structure can increase the risk.\nWisdom Teeth. Wisdom teeth, also called third molars, can be a major breeding ground for the bacteria that cause periodontal disease. In fact, for patients in their 20s, periodontal disease is most likely to occur around the wisdom teeth. Periodontitis can occur in wisdom teeth that have broken through the gum as well as teeth that are impacted (buried). Periodontal disease can also be present even in patients with wisdom teeth who do not have any symptoms. Adolescents and young adults with wisdom teeth should have a dentist check for signs of periodontal disease.\nAge\nChildren and Adolescents. Gingivitis, in varying degrees, is nearly a universal finding in children and adolescents. In rare genetic cases, children and adolescents are subject to destructive forms of the disease. Researchers have also observed some of the organisms seen in periodontal disease in young children without signs of gum problems. Healthy children, however, do not generally harbor two primary periodontal bacteria, P. gingivalis and T. denticola. The disease is also uncommon in teenagers.\nAdults. As people age, the risk for periodontal disease increases. Over half of American adults have gingivitis surrounding 3 - 4 teeth, and 30% have significant periodontal disease surrounding 3 - 4 teeth. In a study of people over 70 years old, 86% had at least moderate periodontitis, and over a quarter of them had lost their teeth.\nFemale Hormones\nAbout three-quarters of periodontal office visits are made by women, even though women tend to take better care of their teeth than men. Female hormones affect the gums, and women are particularly susceptible to periodontal problems. Hormone-influenced gingivitis appears in some adolescents, in some pregnant women, and is occasionally a side effect of birth control medication.\nBefore Menstruation. Gingivitis may flare up in some women a few days before they menstruate, when progesterone levels are high. Gum inflammation may also occur during ovulation. Progesterone dilates blood vessels causing inflammation, and blocks the repair of collagen, the structural protein that supports the gums.\nPregnancy. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can aggravate existing gingivitis, which typically worsens around the second month and reaches a peak in the eighth month. Pregnancy does not cause gum disease, and simple preventive oral hygiene can help maintain healthy gums. Any pregnancy-related gingivitis usually resolves within a few months of delivery. Because periodontal disease can increase the risk for low-weight infants and cause other complications, it is important for pregnant women to see a dentist.\nOral Contraceptives. Some studies report that oral contraceptives containing the synthetic progesterone desogestrel (but not dienogest, another common progesterone) increase the risk for periodontal disease.\nMenopause. Estrogen deficiency after menopause reduces bone mineral density, which can lead to bone loss. Bone loss is associated with both periodontal disease and osteoporosis. Bone loss in the alveolar bone (which holds the tooth in place) may be a major predictor of tooth loss in postmenopausal women. Periodontal disease is the main cause of alveolar bone loss. During menopause, some women may also develop a rare condition called menopausal gingivostomatitis, in which the gums are dry, shiny, and bleed easily. Women may also experience abnormal tastes and sensations (such as salty, spicy, acidic, and burning) in the mouth.\nFamily Factors\nPeriodontal disease often occurs in members of the same family. Genetics, intimacy, hygiene, or a mixture of factors may be responsible. Studies have found that children of parents with periodontitis are 12 times more likely to have the bacteria thought to be responsible for causing plaque and, eventually, periodontal disease.\nGenetic Factors. Genetic factors may play the critical role in half the cases of periodontal disease. Up to 30% of the population may have some genetic susceptibility to periodontal disease.\nIntimacy. Intimate partners and spouses of people with periodontal disease may also be at risk. Researchers have found that the bacteria P. gingivalis may be contagious after exposure to an infected person over a long period of time. There is no risk from short exposure, such as after a fast kiss or when sharing an eating utensil.\nSmoking and Nicotine\nSmoking is the single major preventable risk factor for periodontal disease. The habit can cause bone loss and gum recession even in the absence of periodontal disease. A number of studies indicate that smoking and nicotine increase inflammation by reducing oxygen in gum tissue and triggering an over-production of immune factors called cytokines (specifically ones called interleukins). In excess, cytokines are harmful to cells and tissue.\nFurthermore, when nicotine combines with oral bacteria, such as P. gingivalis, the effect produces even greater levels of cytokines and eventually leads to periodontal connective tissue breakdown. Smokers may be more than 10 times more likely than nonsmokers to harbor the bacteria that cause periodontal disease and are also more likely to have advanced periodontal disease.\nThe risk of periodontal disease increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Smoking cigars and pipes carries the same risks as smoking cigarettes. Exposure to secondhand smoke may also be associated with an increased risk for developing periodontal disease, according to one study. Fortunately, when smokers quit, their periodontal health gradually recovers to a state comparable to that of nonsmokers.\nSome research also indicates that regular cannabis (marijuana) smoking also increases the risk of periodontal disease.\nDiseases Associated with Periodontal Disease\nDiabetes. Much evidence exists on the link between type 1 and 2 diabetes and periodontal disease. Diabetes causes changes in blood vessels, and high levels of specific inflammatory chemicals such as interleukins, that significantly increase the chances of periodontal disease. High levels of triglycerides (which are common in type 2 diabetes) also appear to impair periodontal health. Obesity, common in people with type 2 diabetes, may also predispose a person to gum disease. Controlling both type 1 and 2 diabetes may help reduce periodontal problems. For children with diabetes, good oral hygiene should begin at a young age.\nOsteoporosis and Osteonecrosis. Osteoporosis (loss of bone density) has been associated with periodontal disease in postmenopausal women.\nThere have been a few reports of osteonecrosis (bone decay) of the jaw in patients who take oral bisphosphonate drugs such as alendronate (Fosamax). However, almost all cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bisphosphonate drugs occur during or after the use of intravenous bisphosphonates, usually given as part of treatment for bone cancer or other cancers that have spread to the bone. Symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaw include loose teeth, exposed jawbone, pain or swelling in the jaw, gum infections, and poor healing of the gums.\nAs a precaution, the American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that patients who are prescribed or are to receive bisphosphonate drugs get a thorough dental exam before beginning drug therapy, or as soon as possible after beginning therapy. The ADA also recommends that patients who take oral bisphosphonate drugs should discuss with their dentists any potential risks from dental procedures (such as extractions and implants) that involve the jawbone. In any case, be sure to inform your dentist if you are taking a bisphosphonate drug. Your dentist or oral surgeon may need to take special precautions when performing dental surgery.\nHerpes-Related Gingivitis. Herpes virus is a common cause of gingivitis in children and has become increasingly common in adults. It typically starts out with a purplish color and \"boggy\" sensation in the gums. Multiple blisters may form across the mucus membranes in the mouth and gums, followed by ulcers. They usually resolve in 7 - 14 days.\nHIV-Associated Gingivitis. HIV-associated gingivitis has been reported in 15 - 50% of patients with HIV or AIDS. HIV-positive individuals harbor larger numbers of periodontal bacteria (candida albicans, P. gingivalis, black-pigmented anaerobic rods, and A. actinomycetemcomitans) than people without HIV. Severe pain is characteristic, along with odor, spontaneous bleeding, ulcers, and swollen, bright red gums. The inflammation never recedes, but halitosis and acute episodes can be managed by conventional cleaning treatments. Its severest form, known as necrotizing stomatitis, can be diagnostic for AIDS. In addition to bleeding, the gums in the front of the mouth are a yellowish-gray color, and bone thrusts out.\nAutoimmune Diseases. Autoimmune conditions (Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, CREST syndrome) have been associated with a higher incidence of periodontal disease. Some research suggests that periodontal disease may even play some causal role. Still, more research is needed to determine a definitive association between these diseases.\nOther Diseases. People with tuberculosis, syphilis, Wegener's granulomatosis, amyloidosis, and many genetic disorders are also at higher risk for periodontitis.\nVitamin C Deficiencies\nVitamin C helps the body repair and maintain connective tissue, and its antioxidant effects are important in the presence of tissue-destroying oxidants in periodontal disease. Research indicates that vitamin C deficiency contributes to periodontal disease. Vitamin C levels are especially depleted in smokers. Eating citrus fruits high in vitamin C (such as grapefruit) may be helpful for patients with periodontitis.\nClick the icon to see an image of the sources of vitamin C.\nEthnic, Socioeconomic, and Geographic Factors\nDental disease is most likely to affect the poor. Children and the elderly suffer the worst oral care, and ethnic minorities follow. In the United States, the lack of access to dental insurance is a contributing factor.\nDrug-Induced Gingivitis\nGingival overgrowth can be a side effect of nearly 20 different drugs, most commonly phenytoin (Dilantin), cyclosporine (Sandimmune), and a short-acting form of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Procardia).\nOther Causes of Gum Inflammation\nSeveral other conditions can also cause gum inflammation, and some have been associated with periodontal disease. They include:\nMouth breathing\nPsychologic stress. Stress can affect the immune system. Some studies suggest that stress can influence the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, like periodontitis.\nAlcohol abuse. One study reported a higher incidence of periodontal disease, tooth decay, and possibly precancerous areas in patients who abuse alcohol.\nCanker sores (aphthous ulcers)\nClick the icon to see an image of a canker sore.\nSelf-injury in psychologically disturbed patients\nHereditary gingival fibromatosis. A rare genetic disease associated with both gum overgrowth and hairiness. It is often associated with gingivitis and periodontal disease.\nDesquamative gingivitis. With this condition the outer layer of the gum tissue desquamates (peels away), exposing an acutely red surface. It usually occurs as a result of an allergic reaction or of skin diseases such as lichen planus, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, bullous pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris. This condition generally resolves when the underlying problem is treated. It is fairly common in middle-aged women.\nBack to Top\nComplications\nThe ultimate outcome of uncontrolled periodontal disease is tooth loss. As the destructive factors cause the breakdown of bone and connective tissue, teeth lose their anchor.\nBad Breath\nA much less severe but nevertheless distressing problem caused by periodontal disease is bad breath, although coatings on the tongue may contribute more to bad breath than periodontal disease.\nHeart Disease and Stroke\nStudies have reported that people who have heart disease have a 1.5 - 4 times increased risk for periodontal disease. (The risk is highest for patients with extensive gum disease, bleeding from every tooth.) Acute coronary syndrome, high blood pressure (hypertension), and high cholesterol have also been associated with periodontal disease.\nPeriodontal disease has also been linked to stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD). The more severe the periodontitis, the greater the risk for heart problems. However, it is still not clear whether periodontal disease is a risk factor for stroke or a marker that reflects various risk factors common to both conditions.\nAn inflammatory response may be the common element. This is an over-reaction of the immune system that causes injury to tissues in the body. Patients with heart conditions and periodontal disease may have elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which indicates inflammation is present. Some research indicates that this inflammatory response can also cause injury in the arteries supplying blood to the heart.\nOther evidence suggests that the periodontal disease bacteria themselves -- particularly P. gingivalis, T. denticola, T. forsythia, and streptococci species -- may be associated with thicker carotid arteries (a predictor of heart attack and stroke), regardless of C-reactive protein levels. It is still not clear if periodontal disease actually causes heart disease.\nIt is also not clear if treating gum disease can reduce the risks of heart disease and improve health outcomes for patients with periodontal disease and vascular heart problems. Studies have been mixed, but research is ongoing.\nEffect on Diabetes\nDiabetes is not only a risk factor for periodontal disease -- periodontal disease itself can worsen diabetes and make it more difficult to control blood sugar.\nEffect on Respiratory Disease\nBacteria that reproduce in the mouth can also be carried into the airways in the throat and lungs, increasing the risks for respiratory diseases and worsening chronic lung conditions, such as emphysema.\nClick the icon to see an image of emphysema.\nEffect on Pregnancy\nMany studies strongly indicate that bacterial infections that cause moderate-to-severe periodontal disease in pregnant women can increase the risk for premature delivery and low birth weight infants. The more severe the infection, the greater the risk to the baby. Research indicates that bacteria from gum disease and tooth decay may trigger the same factors in the immune system, which can then cause premature dilation and contractions.\nWomen should have a periodontal examination before becoming pregnant or as soon as possible thereafter. Because women with diabetes are at higher risk for periodontal disease, it is especially important that they see a dentist early in pregnancy. Doctors are still not sure if treating periodontal disease can improve birth outcomes. In any case, periodontal treatment is safe for pregnant women.\nBack to Top\nPrevention\nHealthy habits and good oral hygiene are critical in preventing gum disease. Regular and effective tooth brushing and mouth washing, however, are effective only above and slightly below the gum line. Once periodontal disease develops, more intensive treatments are needed.\nDietary Changes\nIt is important to reduce both the quantity and, in particular, the frequency of sugar intake. Avoid snacks and drinks with sugar (other than natural sugars found in fruits and vegetables). Eat sugar-containing foods with meals, ideally followed by brushing. Since fruit juices can also cause tooth erosion in children, parents should emphasize milk and water.\nQuitting Smoking\nSmoking plays a significant role in many cases of chronic periodontal disease. For smokers, quitting is one of the most important steps toward regaining periodontal health.\nFluoride Treatments\nFluoride treatment in children has helped to account for the decline in periodontal disease in adults. Because fluoride prevents decay, back molars, which keep the teeth in place, are spared, and are thus less vulnerable to bacteria. Even before teeth first erupt, babies' gums should be wiped clean with a bit of gauze bearing a dab of fluoride toothpaste. Supplementation with fluoride tablets or drops may be recommended for children 6 months or older who drink unfluoridated water or who are at risk for dental problems. A prescription from the child's pediatrician or dentist is required.\nSome dentists recommend a fluoride gel for adult patients who are still at risk for tooth decay or sensitivity, but extra fluoride is generally not necessary for adults who use fluoride toothpaste.\nDental Examinations\nPeriodontitis is a silent disease.

The most important factor in buying any toothbrush, electric or manual, is to choose one with a soft head. Soft bristles get into crevices easier and do not irritate the gums, thereby reducing the risk of exposing teeth below the gum line compared to hard brushes.\nToothbrushes should be replaced every 1 - 3 months. Not only do they become breeding grounds for bacteria, but the worn bristles are less effective at removing plaque.\nToothpaste. The objective of a good toothpaste is to reduce the development of plaque and eliminate periodontal-causing microorganisms without destroying the organisms that are important for a healthy mouth. All brands should show ADA approval. Even a good toothpaste, however, cannot be delivered past 3 mm below the gum line, where periodontitis develops.\nToothpastes are a combination of abrasives, binders, colors, detergents, flavors, fluoride, humectants, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners. Avoid highly abrasive toothpastes, especially for individuals whose gums have receded.\nIngredients contained in toothpastes may include:\nFluoride. Most commercial toothpastes contain fluoride, which both strengthens tooth enamel against decay and enhances remineralization of the enamel. Fluoride also inhibits acid-loving bacteria, especially after eating, when the mouth is more acidic. This antibacterial activity may help control plaque.\nTriclosan. Triclosan is an anti-bacterial substance that may help reduce mild gingivitis.\nMetal salts. Metal salts, such as stannous and zinc, serve mostly as anti-bacterial substances in toothpastes. Stannous fluoride gel toothpastes do not reduce plaque, however, even though they have some effect against the bacteria that cause it, but slightly reduce gingivitis.\nPeroxide and baking soda. Toothpastes with these ingredients claim to have a whitening action, but while they may help remove stains there is little evidence they whiten the actual color of the teeth. In addition, these substances appear to offer no benefits against gum disease.\nAntibacterial sugar substitutes (xylitol), and detergents (delmopinol)\nMouthwashes. The American Dental Association recommends (in addition to daily brushing and flossing) antimicrobial mouthwash to help prevent and reduce plaque and gingivitis, and fluoride mouthwashes to help provide additional protection against tooth decay.\nChlorhexidine (Peridex or PerioGard) is an antimicrobial mouthwash available by prescription only. It reduces plaque by 55% and gingivitis by 30 - 45%. Patients should rinse for 1 minute twice daily. They should wait at least 30 minutes (and preferably 2 hours) between brushing and rinsing since chlorhexidine can be inactivated by certain compounds in toothpastes. It has a bitter taste. It also binds to tannins, which are in tea, coffee, and red wine, so it has tendency to stain teeth in people who drink these beverages. Studies are mixed as to its effectiveness for preventing or reducing periodontal disease.\nListerine is another antimicrobial mouthwash. It is composed of essential oils and is available over the counter. It reduces plaque and gingivitis, when used for 30 seconds twice a day. It leaves a burning sensation in the mouth that most people better tolerate after a few days of use. The usual regimen is to rinse twice a day. (Listerine PocketPaks, which are strips that dissolve on the tongue, have no proven effects on plague and gingivitis.)\nMouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium (Scope, Cepacol) have moderate antimicrobial effect on plaque, but only if they are used an hour after brushing. None are as effective as Listerine or chlorhexidine, but they may still have some value for people who cannot tolerate the other mouthwashes.\nMouthwashes containing stannous fluoride and amine fluoride (Meridol) are moderately effective, but are also not as effective as effective as Listerine or chlorhexidine.\nFluoride mouthwashes (Act) are helpful in preventing cavities.\nMouthwashes that contain alcohol are dangerous for children and should be kept away from them.\nFlossing. The use of dental floss, either waxed or unwaxed, is critical in cleaning between the teeth where the toothbrush bristles cannot reach. In spite of this, nearly two-thirds of people do not floss.\nTo floss correctly, the following steps may be helpful:\nBreak off about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around the middle finger of one hand and the rest around the other middle finger.\nHold the floss between the thumbs and forefingers and gently guide and rub it back and forth between the teeth.\nWhen it reaches the gum line, the floss should be curved around each tooth and slid gently back and forth against the gum.\nFinally, rub gently up and down against the tooth. Repeat with each tooth, including the outside of the back teeth.\nIf, on repeated flossing attempts, the floss becomes shredded or cannot be removed easily from between the teeth, a rough crown or overhanging filling may be the cause. In such cases, the restoration should be redone. Such areas create spaces for the collection of food debris, plaque, and calculus.\nHere are some tips in choosing the right floss or flossing device:\nUse a floss that does not shred or break.\nAvoid a very thin floss, which can cut the gum if brought down with too much force or not guided along the side of the tooth.\nA floss threader is an invaluable aid for the person who has bridgework. Made of plastic, it looks like a needle with a huge eye, or loop. A piece of floss is threaded into the loop, which can then be inserted between the bridge and the gum. The floss that is carried through with it can then be used to clean underneath the false tooth or teeth and along the sides of the abutting teeth.\nAnother handy device for cleaning under bridges is a Proxabrush, which is an interdental cleaner. This is a tiny narrow brush that can be worked in between the natural teeth and around the attached false tooth or teeth.\nSpecial toothpicks such as Stim-U-Dent may be effective for wide spaces between teeth but should never replace flossing. Standard toothpicks should never be used for regular hygiene.\nElectronic products, such as water piks, are also helpful. These devices are expensive but may improve flossing compliance.\nProducing Saliva and Drinking Water. Saliva is important for diluting the toxins created by plaque. Drinking at least 7 glasses of water a day helps reduce inflammation in the mouth by producing more saliva. Increasing water intake is particularly important as one ages, when less saliva is produced.\n"}]]}
