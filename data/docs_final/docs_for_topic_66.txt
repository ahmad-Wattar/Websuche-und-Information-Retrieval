How they work and what they cost are part of what is reviewed. Other aspects, which are equally important, are: what are the disadvantages and what is the success rate.\nBefore I give an overview I want to state emphatically that any diet which restricts certain foods is not healthy and usually doesn't succeed in the long run. If you want information on diets that work, you can read more in my hubs or on my losing weight blog. I also want to state that any diet which focuses on calorie control will always work, no matter what kid of diet it is. How long it may work is what you should probably ask, and will I be able to follow the plan forever. When you have lost your weight, if you do not maintain your eating habits (ie focusing on calorie control), the weight will pile back on. And if you did not maintain any strenght or weight training while dieting, you lost valuable muscle, which further increases your risk to gain additional weight. WIth that being said I'll get off my soapbox! =)\nThe South Beach Diet Supercharged: Faster Weight Loss and Better Health for Life\n104 customer reviews all 4 plus stars (mostly 5 stars) Five years ago, with the publication of The South Beach Diet, renowned Miami cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston set out to change the way America eats. Now he has an even more ambitious goal: to change the way America lives by helping Americans become fitter as well as thinner and healthier\u2026for life. In the all-new The South Beach Diet Supercharged, Dr. Agatston shows you how to rev up your metabolism and lose weight faster while following the proven healthy eating principles of the original diet: choose good carbs, good fats, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Collaborating with Dr. Joseph Signorile, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Miami, Dr. Agatston presents a cutting-edge, three-phase workout that perfectly complements the three phases of the diet itself. Based on the latest exercise science, this ease-into-it fitness program combines low- and high-intensity interval exercise (with a focus on walking) and functional core body-toning exercises. The result: you'll look fitter and you'll burn more fat and calories all day--even at rest. Also included is the latest nutritional research on how specific foods high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a host of phytonutrients help keep you healthy; new and expanded lists of Foods to Enjoy; taste-tempting Meal Plans for phases 1 and 2; and dozens of easy-to-prepare new recipes, including Eggs Frijoles, Chock-Full-of-Veggies Chili, Roasted Tomato Soup, Homestyle Turkey Meatloaf, and South Beach Diet Tiramisu. In every chapter you'll find inspiring success stories from real-life South Beach dieters and plenty of effective weight loss tips. And as an added bonus, Dr. Agatston answers the questions you've most often asked him about the diet since the original book was published.\nAmazon Price: $7.99\nList Price: $25.95\nThe South Beach Diet Quick and Easy Cookbook: 200 Delicious Recipes Ready in 30 Minutes or Less\n165 Reviews 5 star: 125 4 star: 30 The 30-minute time limit for preparing dinner, popular with Rachael Ray and a host of other cookbook authors, has finally been South Beachified. It's just in time for dieters who've grown bored (or impatient) with The South Beach Diet Cookbook and offers easy recipes that help dieters stay on track. The recipes span all courses, including desserts. Most impressive are the entr\u00e9es and salads, particularly in their ability to riff on familiar dishes: witness Spaghetti with White Clam Sauce, Chicken and Avocado Salad, and South Beach Classic Burger. Even more inventive fare, such as Thai Shrimp Soup with Lime and Cilantro, is still homey. Adding to the book's unthreatening feel is its idiosyncrasies. It favors certain spices (cilantro, black pepper), vegetables (asparagus, zucchini) and meats and fish (chicken and shrimp). The ingredient glossary is surprisingly enticing, and the introductory material explains modern eating habits and makes the South Beach Diet highly sensible. Photos. (Oct.)

This cookbook is designed for Weight Watchers' 1\u20222\u20223 Success program: points are assigned to foods based on fat, fiber, and calories, and your daily point allowance is based on your current weight. So you can eat what you want, as long as you don't go over your allotted points. The better your food choices, the more you can eat before you run out of points. Recipes are varied and cover the whole gamut: sauces; breads; soups; meat, chicken, fish, and vegetarian entrees; pasta; vegetable, grain, and potato side dishes; and, of course, desserts. The recipes are more healthful but not drastically different from foods you and your family enjoy now. Many are familiar comfort foods, such as Pizza, Oven \"Fried\" Chicken, Beef Stew, Tuna Noodle Casserole, Chocolate Layer Cake, and Cheesecake. Internationally inspired favorites include Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), Orange-Flavored Fajitas, Moo Shu Chicken, Tandoori Haddock, and Senegalese Peanut Soup. The nutritional breakdown for each recipe is more complete than in most cookbooks, and includes calories, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrate, fiber, protein, calcium, and Weight Watchers' points. --Joan Price --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nAmazon Price: $1.56\nKashi GOLEAN Crunch!

While most calorie counting diets require a numeric counting of calories, weight watchers focuses its power through point systems. You have a set amount of points and each food you eat has a point value. Typically, an overweight person starts off with 25-27 points.Each meal is approximately 3-7 points (depending on the meal). There is a specific formula for the program, but I won't detail it here. For the money it is one of the best diets to lose weight available.\nThe cost: There is a $50 join fee, plus a registration fee (varies by region sometimes the registration is free). Once you pay the join and registration fee you pay a weekly or monthly fee to attend meetings. Generally this fee is in place to cover the cost of meeting places. I'm sure that there is profit made, however, there are no additional costs. Weekly fee ranges are from $10-$15 depending on region. Additionally, you have the choice of using weight watchers food during your weight loss journey. I happen to love the food so I buy it because it tastes good.\nDisadvantages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Weight Watchers can be costly for some people. I can't really find much else to say that is bad. This program follows the rules of successful weight loss, including promoting exercise. You get points for exercising (meaning you get to eat more, always a plus for me!)\nThe South Beach Diet\nThis system revolves around cutting carbs from the diet, or at least what it terms as unhealthy carbs. I don't find any diets that limit a specific food to be healthy, but thats me. Maybe it's because I love bread. Oh man do I love bread. Anyway, if you're not a big fan of white and processed breads, this may be the diet for you. It actually promotes pretty healthy eating in terms of specificity. Meaning the carbs you're allowed to eat are \u201chealthy\u201d. Me, I'm a processed food girl and no way can I live on brown rice (ugh). I do like brown breads better than whites tho, at least I'd get that aspect. It's up to the individual to decide if this is one of the good diets to lose weight.\nCosts: Not much besides the books.\nDisadvantages : Cutting specific foods from a diet will not help maintain a healthy lifestyle, unless you have no proclivity to eat those foods.\nAtkins Diet\nSeriously not one of the best diets to lose weight! I'm sorry but there is nothing about this diet that screams healthy to me. Supposedly this diet works by forcing your body to burn fat since you eat no carbs. If you're looking for a healthy diet that doesn't include carbs, choose the South Beach instead of this monstrosity. Besides allowing almost every kind of fat, it doesn't allow almost any fruits and most veggies. That is some serious fiber deficiencies for anyone that doesn't eat beans.\nCosts: Your health for one. But other than that just the money you shell out for the book\nDisadvantages: You can't eat any carbs ie: no sugar, no bread, no fruit. Lets you eat plenty of fat, not very good for the heart. You get to add a few fruits and veggies towards the end of the beginning, but too little too late in my opinion. This is not a diet to lose weight!\nCalorie Counting\nBasically weighing and measuring your food and using a book or online feature to calculate the number of calories, fat, protein, carbs and fiber, you're consuming per day. The idea is to keep your consumption in normal ranges. With the portion sizes of today's food, it is almost impossible to visually understand the amount of calories a person can eat in a day. Today a person can eat a McDonald's meal for the entire caloric needs for that day. You may be surprised how much you eat when you start counting.\nCosts: A food scale is helpful, but not necessary. There are free online calculators. You may want to invest in a calorie counting book.\nDisadvantages: There aren't any. This is actually the most proven long term successful diets to lose weight available. There is a version of it in all the successful stories, including The Biggest Loser and Weight Watchers.\nQuite simply calorie counting is the best diet to lose weight, it is also one of the\u00c2\u00a0healthy diets to lose weight, Weight Watchers is another.\nHappy dieting folks\nIf you want to know more about a specific diet, leave me a comment and I'll research it for a while. In the meantime the best diets to lose weight, are the ones you plan to follow.\n"}, {"score": 2151.9553, "uuid": "6394bd4d-46f4-57a6-97f9-99f101cf0b21", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1500tw-48-02314", "target_hostname": "lite987.com", "target_uri": "http://lite987.com/whats-the-best-way-to-lose-weight/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "What\u2019s <em>the</em> <em>Best</em> Way <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>?", "snippet": "Thinking of trying <em>the</em> latest fad <em>diet</em> or trendy supplements <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em>?

The question most overweight people ask is whether or not an acai berry diet is really the best way to lose weight and healthy. Despite the truths, half-truths, and multiple claims about the effectiveness of this diet, the fact remains that acai is indeed an effective supplement when combined with the best foods for weight loss, but it is not an alternative to them.\nIt will be difficult for you and me to make sense of the often confusing or unsubstantiated claims made by producers of different weight loss supplements. In a way, this applies to the many marketers of the acai berry diet, too. However, the little, purple berries are anti-oxidant rich and possess potent healing and other proven weight loss properties. But you must know that acai itself is a weight loss supplement. It should neither be viewed as a magical formula to lose weight, as it may be perceived by some, nor should it be categorized as one of the best foods for weight loss. Yes, to many people who have used the acai berry diet, it has proven to be the best way to lose weight.\nAs to the effectiveness of the acai berry diet, tested and true, works reasonably well. What\u2019s more important, however, is to clear any misconceptions you may have about the diet. Here's how it works, and why. In essence, this diet acts as a weight loss aid by triggering incremental reductions in your appetite over time. It also accelerates your body\u2019s metabolism and makes it perform more efficiently. As such, it will help you burn up excess caloric intake. The combination of the two makes it, according to some, the best way to lose weight.\nAs is the case with all other reputable, weight loss diets and programs, the acai berry diet cannot deliver appreciable results on its own. Combining it with a regimen of daily physical exercises, combined with a healthy, low-fat diet is also essential. Of course, this may be easier said than done, but if you are resolute in your commitment to lose weight, and prepared to stay the course, the only person that can prevent you from losing weight is YOU. So, if you decide to go with an acai berry diet, stick with it. But make sure to incorporate the best foods for weight loss into your normal diet, drink plenty of water, and exercise regularly. This is what makes the diet work; this is how it can help you lose weight.\nWhile the market is saturated with weight loss pills, capsules, and myriad other so called, \u201cinstant weight loss\u201d programs, supplements and formulas, the acai berry diet is certainly worth a try.\nTags\n"}, {"score": 2087.3147, "uuid": "fd74787f-fbe4-5bed-a8d8-972598ffdc1b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1113wb-23-27466", "target_hostname": "www.lunchboxdiet.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.lunchboxdiet.co.uk/weight-loss-tips/how-to-lose-weight-fast-by-grazing/", "page_rank": 1.1832747e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "How <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast By GrazingThe Lunch Box <em>Diet</em> \u2013 <em>Best</em> <em>Diet</em> For Healthy", "snippet": "Doesn\u2019t Have <em>to</em> be a Nightmare for Dieters o Fun Exercise Vs Goal Specific Exercise Delivering Optimum <em>Results</em> o 4 Ways <em>To</em> Stop Falling Off <em>The</em> Wagon &amp; Ride <em>The</em> Easy Journey <em>To</em> Your Ideal <em>Weight</em> o <em>The</em> <em>Best</em> <em>Diet</em> For You in 2012 \u2013 Simon\u2019s 6 Point Superslim Checklist o My Top Tips, Gym Secrets &amp; Little", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nThe world of weight loss seems to be full of confusion. The basic concept we are taught about dieting is that a low calorie diet is the key to losing weight. This notion is being challenged more and more these days.\nMost people think that simply limiting the amount of food they eat will make them lose weight fast. For many people however, this does not work. In this article you will learn how to lose weight by grazing and why it\u2019s so good for losing weight.\nThe vital piece of the puzzle that most people are missing is that how they eat is just as important as what they eat. Common eating patterns for the majority of people include eating three large meals every day until they are full. This method of eating can be detrimental to weight loss.\nWhat is Grazing?\nGrazing is a way of eating that spreads out your food intake into smaller chunks. So, rather than just eating 3 large meals each day, you have a smaller breakfast, lunch and dinner and then eat small snacks in between.\nSome people already graze without knowing it, but do it in a very unhealthy way. This means that in between meals they snack on things like chocolate bars and packets of crisps.\nWhen grazing is done right and you snack on healthy foods rather than crisps and chocolate, it can be very effectively for helping you to lose weight fast.\nBenefits of Grazing\nThere are several health benefits that you gain from grazing healthily:\nIt keeps your metabolism moving fast\nIt prevents hunger and overindulgent eating\nStabilizes your blood sugar\nReduces cravings for comfort foods\nFills you with energy all day long\nSpeeds up weight loss\nHow Grazing Makes You Lose Wight\nGrazing has a completely different effect on your body than if you were to eat large meals. Usually when people eat large meals, they eat until they are full and can\u2019t eat any more.\nDoing this is almost like expanding your stomach. At every meal time, you need larger amount of\u00a0 food to compensate for what you haven\u2019t eaten since your last meal.\u00a0 Being as your stomach expects lots of food every time you eat, it needs more room to store it all. Thus, you put on weight.\nGrazing has a different effect. Eating smaller amounts of foods more frequently makes it easier for your body to digest and it puts your metabolism into constant action. This is necessary if you want to lose weight.\nEvery time you eat a meal, it is important not to eat so much food that you feel full. If you eat until you are full it is like putting a speed bump in front of your metabolism. To keep your metabolism moving fast, you need to keep your meals small.\nWhat to Eat\nYour between-meal snacks should contain as many natural foods as possible.\nWhen food is eaten it gets converted into glucose (blood sugar) so the body can use it as energy. Natural unprocessed foods release energy slowly, while unhealthy foods like crisps and chips release energy quickly.\nWhen foods get converted into glucose quickly, the body reacts and releases a lot of insulin. Insulin converts sugars into fat and thus prevents the body from burning it.\nEating natural foods helps to maintain your blood sugar levels and gives you stable insulin levels. This means your body won\u2019t burn fat so quickly and you will be able to lose weight fast.\nGrazing Tips\nIdeally, your between-meal snacks will contain lots of vegetables. Vegetables contain an abundance of vitamins, minerals and nutrients that your body needs to stay healthy. If you have the chance, you can prepare various salads to snack on throughout the day as part of a healthy diet .\nYou could prepare a different fresh salad each day and carry it in a lunch box when you go to work. You can make things fun and create a new original salad every day.\nIf you are really not used to eating vegetables you should try to bring them into your diet gradually. For instance, start by eating just two or three new salads a week, and then start eating more. Chances are you will gradually begin to enjoy various kinds of vegetables.\nYou could also carry a snack pack with you to work including quick and easy healthy snacks to eat if you don\u2019t much time at hand.\nIf you really don\u2019t want to eat veggies all day then stick to natural healthy alternatives. Always choose healthy pieces of fruit, cereal bars, dried fruit or nuts over things like chocolate bars and crisps.\nA Balanced Diet\nWhile you will receive an abundance of goodness from vegetables, your diet also needs other good food sources to provide a healthy balance of protein, fat and carbohydrates. Include things like salmon, chicken breast, lean pork, tofu and boiled eggs in your diet for a good source of protein.\nComplex carbohydrates are contained in foods like brown pasta, brown rice, rice crackers and wholemeal bread. Carbs can help supply your body with sustained energy.\nAllow yourself to have your favourite treats every now and then. Treats shouldn\u2019t be eliminated from you diet all together because you may lose the will power to stick to your eating plan. Consider treats as a reward for the times when you have stuck to your diet well.\nAlso, be sure to drink lots of water and exercise regularly. Water flushes toxins out of the body and keeps energy levels high, while exercise can provide that extra boost you need to lose weight faster.\nGrazing is being recognised more and more these days as a vital component to successful weight loss. For many people, learning the proper way to eat throughout a day is the missing piece of the puzzle they were looking for. Whilst eating healthy meals is obviously very important for losing weight, the frequency and size of your meals is just as vital.\nUntil the birth of The Lunch Box Diet many people found the grazing principle difficult but now there\u2019s a complete system with recipes, plans all ready to go and you can get started by putting in your details below.

What are your results? How effective are the diets that you have tried in helping you to lose those extra pounds permanently? What is the best and fast weight loss diet?\nYou see, with so many types of weight loss diets out there in the market, you must have wondered which one is effective and which ones simply do not work at all. Furthermore, all weight loss diet programs have their supporters and detractors, so is going on a fast weight loss diet a healthy way to slim down and lose weight? Or you are simply confused and do not know which diet is for you?\nCarbohydrate rotation is best weight loss diet?\nI will not be discussing the controversies or the pros and cons of each diet program, but instead will attempt to let you know what to expect when you have decided to go on a certain type of diet.\nTherefore, this article will explore what is the Carb Rotation Diet and I will write about other popular diets such as the Atkins Diet, Zone Diet, Dr Sears Diet, the Mediterranean Diet and others in future articles for your comparison and consideration.\nLow carbohydrate vegetable salad\nWhat Is Carb Rotation Diet?\nThe Carbohydrate Rotation Diet was created by a respectable dietitian called Jayson Hunter who has developed many diet programs for men and women over the years before coming up with the Carb Rotation Diet which he thought is the most suitable for people looking for a balanced weight loss diet.The diet program's main focus is on the consumption of lean meats, nutrient-rich vegetables and fruits, fiber-rich high glycemic carbohydrates, healthy fats and of course, plenty of water.\nThe Carb Rotation Diet is to be followed for 30 days and weight loss up to 15 pounds within the period can be achieved safely and healthily. The diet evolves around the principle of alternating between a high, low and no carbohydrate consumption by eating from carefully selected groups of foods. This rotational method of carb consumption eventually also spin off many other carb rotation diet variations such as 5 days low carb and 2 days high carbs per week method amongst others.\nThe concept behind Carbo Rotation Diet is on the assumption that low carb alone diet may be detrimental to our health because low carb diets are thought to deprive the body of essential nutrients and energy forcing our bodies into self-preservation famine mode. Our body in this condition perceives itself as being in a starvation mode and automatically lowers the metabolism to conserve energy.\nThat is why people on these diets are often lethargic and will not be able to stay on the diet for long and give up pretty soon before their ideal weight is achieved (many low carb dieters claim otherwise, hence the controversies). However, the weight loss is very real and that is why low carb diets are very popular and much talked about as a fast weight loss diet. Despite the controversies, many people have succeeded in losing weight fast and effectively through low carb diets.\nOn the other hand, low fat diets have been around for a long time. A low fat diet is a deprivation diet where both good and bad fats are restricted and heavy emphasis is placed on high carbohydrates and moderate to low protein and fat intake. However, the drop out rate is just as high because the dieters gain back their original weight and God forbid, even more once their fat restrictions are relaxed thus a vicious cycle is created.\nHunter's theory is that our bodies need carbohydrates to provide fuel for energy for our daily activities. However, carbs promote insulin spikes, which in turn inhibit fat burning and even promote body fat storage. Protein on the other hand stimulates the production of a hormone called glucagons which promotes fat burning.\nSo, day one on the diet is the high carbs day so that the body has enough glycogen (stored carbohydrates) in its muscles and liver as energy for burning thus ratcheting up our metabolism for the day. Protein consumption on this day is moderate and fat is low.\nOn day two and three, carbohydrate intake is kept at medium to total elimination. Staying on this type of diet for a period longer than 3 days is thought by some to cause the metabolism to plummet and cause lethargy as well as promote fat gain. Therefore by rotating the carb intake everyday, you will keep the metabolism running at optimum level all day long.\nCarb Rotation dieters are encouraged to have 5 to 6 meals a day spaced out every 3 hours or so. This is also meant to keep the metabolism high at all time therefore promoting calorie burning throughout the day that you become a walking fat burner.\nAt this stage, I must emphasize that this article is a very simplified and summarized information on what the carb rotation diet is about. For your own health and permanent weight loss success, you must also find out the correct amount of calories you need for your weight and height, the selected food groups, how to optimize nutrient consumption, how to monitor your progress, what type of exercises to incorporate with the diet and how to maintain the diet after the initial phase and the emotional psychological aspect of the program as well.\nSo click this link for comprehensive information about Carb Rotation Diet by world renown weight loss expert and dietician, Jayson Hunter himself!\nWishing you all the best in choosing the most effective type of weight loss diet to achieve your fitness goals.\nSexy Body Diet is a weight loss diet for women developed by Jennifer Nicole Lee, an international female fitness model.

Pilates can be done in a number of different ways , such as Malibu Pilates .\u00a0 They can be done on your own with no aids whatsoever or they can be done in a group with the use of medicine balls and other exercise helpers.\u00a0 The realm of choice within Pilates is large and that is perhaps one of the big reasons as to why so many people have enjoyed this exercise form.\u00a0 It is a form of workout that has been embraced more by women than by men, but the truth of the matter is that anyone can utilize this particular form of exercise as a way to succeed and reach their weight loss goals.\nIf there is one thing worth pointing out about Pilates, it would have to be the low impact nature of the exercises utilized.\u00a0 It is one of the safest workouts around and that makes it particularly ideal for people that have not exercised in awhile and need something that will allow them to ease back into old good habits.\nHigh Intensity Interval Training\nHave you ever done something in such a way that you gave it your all for as long as you possibly could?\u00a0 This is basically the idea behind high intensity interval training .\u00a0 The explanation is actually right there in the name as this particular workout form combines two core concepts within many different exercise circles.\u00a0 High intensity means pushing the body well out of its comfort zone and really doing things that push it to the brink of collapse.\u00a0 Interval means alternating between different forms in an effort to make those forms more efficient and train the body to respond better to each.\u00a0 When you combine those two together, you get high intensity interval training.\nImagine running as fast as you thought you could for a minute and then walking for a minute after that, before repeating the entire exercise again.\u00a0 It is a simplistic example, but if you did both the running and the walking at a high effort level, you would be doing high intensity interval training.\u00a0 You can adapt the exercises to a number of different areas, but as long as you cycle through exercises in intervals, you will be putting the basic principles to use.\nCore Rhythms\nOne of the main reasons that people end up giving up on their workout goals is that they start losing sight of what they are doing.\u00a0 Workouts are by no means easy, but when a person is doing a workout they know that they are getting themselves into something that will push their endurance limits.\u00a0 When it stops being fun, which is pretty early for people that have not exercised rigorously in awhile, they tend to give up. Core Rhythms is a workout that attempts to solve that problem by making the workout process one that is as exciting as can be.\nHow do they do that?\u00a0 Well, they do it by introducing an element of dance into the workouts.\u00a0 Specifically, the workouts utilize Latin dance steps and can actually teach you how to dance in the Latin style.\u00a0 Therefore, these workouts will allow you to develop a skill that is fun to use while at the same time picking dance moves that work core muscle groups in your body and in doing so allow you to experience the same gains that you would from doing the straight workout exercises.\nWeightless Workout\nThe weightless workout concept is a relatively new one in modern bodybuilding, but it is one that has gained a lot of stream because of the fact that a lot of the recent research that has been done in this area has ended up pointing to the fact that the weightless workout seems to be the one that has the most results.\u00a0 It is also a workout form that does not require the purchase of a gym membership or any other particular tools (hence the term weightless) and for that reason is very popular amongst people that have just started into their weight loss regimes.\nThe basic idea behind this particular workout is that you are going to use isometric contractions within your body at maximum intensity in order to overload the muscles.\u00a0 Only exertions that stretch the maximum limits of what your muscles can do have the ability to expand them.\u00a0 If you choose something where you can do 20 reps, all you are doing is tiring your muscles out rather than expanding their abilities.\u00a0 One or two intense repetitions are a much better way of doing things and this is what isometrics (i.e. the weightless workout) are all about.\nP90X\nIf you are interested in getting aboard the train at P90X station, you should be warned that you are about to embark on a journey that will have you going as far as you think you can go and then going a bit farther when you are done.\u00a0 The aim of this workout regime is to get you totally fit in 90 days.\u00a0 In order to get to that goal however, you are going to have to sweat, flex, exert, hurt and then keep going because you still have 89 days left to go!\nP90X is a combination of 12 different workouts.\u00a0 These different exercises are all difficult to do, but the truth of the matter is that they produce results.\u00a0 If you actually manage to get through the 90 days of the workout having done everything correctly and without chickening out on any of the exercises, you will have a body so amazing that you might even surprise yourself at just what you were able to accomplish.\u00a0 Big effort for big reward is the motto of this workout and there are plenty of people around that like that particular deal.\u00a0 For this reason, P90X is a fitting way to round out the best seven workouts currently available.\nContour Abs\nThe contour abs model is essentially to exercise what the diet pill model is to dieting.\u00a0 Diet and exercise are the two main pillars of any serious attempt to lose weight, but in the modern world of scientifically created miracles, there are always ways that people can help themselves along in one or both of these areas.\u00a0 With dieting it is diet pills or fat burners and with exercise this is the contour abs system.\u00a0 The contour abs system is therefore a natural progression in terms of workout technology.\nThe contour abs system is at its heart a belt.\u00a0 What you do with that belt is essentially place it snug against your abs and turn on the electronic part of it.\u00a0 Then, you walk around with it during the way and let the electronic system within the belt sculpt your abs into a different shape.\u00a0 Over the course of the long term this will happen and if you combine those results with proper diet and exercise techniques, the results can be quite spectacular indeed.\u00a0 These results have been the major headline in many news outlets and that is why this system has become quite popular in recent times.\n"}, {"score": 2056.0618, "uuid": "3dc11e30-0830-573d-a4a3-362a859c5d58", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0709wb-98-03816", "target_hostname": "www.weightloss-hq.biz", "target_uri": "http://www.weightloss-hq.biz/weight-loss-reviews/lose-weight-on-the-morning-banana-diet.html", "page_rank": 1.1896261e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "<em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> On <em>The</em> Morning Banana <em>Diet</em>?", "snippet": "This is <em>the</em> primary reason as <em>to</em> why people are still looking for that perfect <em>diet</em> that suits them well.

Brought to you by weightloss-hq.biz\nThe Morning Banana Diet\nThe premise of the morning banana diet contains the basic diet plus some supplementary rules that you need to apply in order to give the diet the best chance of success.\u00a0 When you wake up in the morning, you need to start the day by eating a raw banana.\u00a0 Once you have done that, you need to wash it down with a glass of water at room-temperature.\u00a0 Once you have done those two things, the dieting portion of The Morning Banana Diet is essentially over. Those are the only instructions regarding the actual consumption of food that you will find in this diet.\nYou should follow us on twitter .\nHowever, there are also some supplementary rules that you should follow in order to make the diet as effective as possible.\u00a0 The first of these supplementary rules is that you need to avoid eating sweets for the whole day.\u00a0 You are allowed to eat one sweet snack between 3pm and 5pm each day, but you are not allowed to eat desserts with any of your meals and generally speaking it is frowned upon even to take advantage of that one opportunity in order to eat something sweet.\u00a0 Another supplementary rule is that you should avoid alcohol as much as possible while the final two rules regarding The Morning Banana Diet are that you should eat dinner before 8pm and go to bed before midnight.\u00a0 If you do all four of these things in addition to following the actual diet, proponents of the diet say that you will be giving yourself the best possible chance to see the best effects of the diet.\nExercise\nOne of the best things about this diet is the fact that you can actually exercise however you want to .\u00a0 There is a decidedly \"hands-off\" approach to exercise on the parts of the people that promote this diet, saying that exercise should not be done unless the dieter actually feels like they want to do it.\u00a0 It also points out that if exercisers want to work out while on this diet, they should only do so in ways that are minimally stressful.\u00a0 This idea of reducing stress as much as possible is a recurring theme in this diet and it is seen quite clearly in the recommendations for exercise made as part of The Morning Banana Diet.\nAdvantages\nThere are two main advantages to The Morning Banana Diet and they both have to do with the conditions for success that were laid out in the introduction.\u00a0 The Morning Banana Diet has been endorsed by many nutritionists on the basis that since bananas have a lot of starch in them, they have the ability to induce relaxation and feelings of calm safety in people that eat them.\u00a0 These feelings are said to be conducive to the fat burning prowess of the body and that is what makes the whole system work.\u00a0 Therefore, it does appear as though The Morning Banana Diet has the biological success potential.\nThe other advantage of course is that The Morning Banana Diet is extremely easy to follow.\u00a0 Anyone can easily consume a banana and a glass of water when they wake up in the morning and avoid one particular junk food throughout the rest of the day.\u00a0 With a little bit of prioritization, eating dinner before 8 and going to bed before midnight are also possible and when these easy points are added to the extremely laissez-faire attitude The Morning Banana Diet has towards exercise, it is quite easy to see that this is one of the easiest diets around to follow.\u00a0 If you can't stick to The Morning Banana Diet, chances are very good you can't stick to any diet; it is just that easy to follow.\nReception\nSo far, the reception of the diet has been very positive.\u00a0 It was initially devised by a pharmacist working in Japan for her husband and when the husband tried it, he had amazingly positive results.\u00a0 He endorsed the diet based on the low-stress approach it took to dieting and ever since then it is a diet that has been attempted and approved by many celebrities and other public figures.\u00a0 Once that happened, attitude to this diet exploded in the marketplace, with people all over the world clamoring for bananas so that they could make these things work.\u00a0 It has become especially successful in Japan where the trend started.\u00a0 It has in fact become so successful in Japan that bananas have actually fallen into short supply in the country with importers like Dole struggling to keep up with the demand for bananas that currently exists there.\nConclusion\nThere is no doubt that The Morning Banana Diet has the potential to work.\u00a0 There is also no doubt that it is a diet that is extremely easy to follow.\u00a0 However, do not let these two facts sidetrack you from the more important fact that a diet is only as good as the person that uses it.\u00a0 If you start cheating on the sweets and regularly go to sleep after midnight when you are on this diet, do not be surprised if it does nothing for you.\u00a0 If you want to seriously try The Morning Banana Diet out, make sure you give it a fair chance by actually following the diet and all four of the supplementary rules that were mentioned above.\n"}, {"score": 2026.9933, "uuid": "a5aee446-19b7-5c42-9c1a-90a8993ba3a1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1700tw-60-16475", "target_hostname": "www.dietchef.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.dietchef.co.uk/wedding-diets/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 89, "title": "Wedding <em>Diets</em> | <em>Diet</em> Chef | <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>", "snippet": "Even if you are not <em>the</em> bride and you want <em>to</em> look your <em>best</em> for <em>the</em> big day, this is a great and easy <em>diet</em> <em>to</em> follow.

Make a new list of the food you need and start stocking up on them in large quantities. Include vegetables, fruits, healthy snacks, mineral waters and vitamins and minerals supplements you may need.\nDiet Tip #3: Reward system\nWhy not Give yourself a pat on the back and create a reward system for your weight loss program. For instance, you may want to get yourself some new shoes, a new CD or even a new handbag if you reach a certain point in your weight loss efforts.\nDiet Tip #4: Healthy Breakfast\nBreakfast is the most important meal that you should never miss. Skipping breakfast means that you are programming your brain to think that your hungry starved and deprived, this will only cause you to feel lethargic and when the pressure is too much, you may decide to embark on an eating binge.

For long lasting effects and to boost the rate of your weight loss, this is one important activity you must include in your routine.

This helps to keep your bodily system working in perfect order, which is crucial to the success of your weight loss program.\nDiet Tip #7:Relaxation\nLast but not least is relaxation. This is important in any weight loss program and you should make relaxation a crucial part of your schedule. Meditation, relaxation and affirmations can help boost your confidence and make the process more enjoyable.\nIf you follow these seven best diet tips, you can start seeing results in your efforts to lose weight.

Meris on October 25, 2009\nImage by Gabriella Fabbri\nWEIGHT LOSS CAN BE BENEFICIAL OR DANGEROUS, IF NOT DONE CORRECTLY. Choose a weight loss program that works and guarantees long-term results. The best way to lose weight is through natural means. It is a slow process, but results in permanent weight loss. It is very, very safe because there are no side effects or permanent damage to any of your vital organs. A natural weight loss program is all about changing the rate of metabolism.\nNatural vs. Artificial Weight Loss Program\nA natural weight loss program consists of a combination of planned diet and physical exercise. It is this combination that hastens the process of natural weight loss. The diet should be balanced, high in nutrients and essential vitamins and minerals but low in fats and carbohydrates. Eat less, and when possible, exercise more. Your body will start to lose weight as long as it burns more energy than it can store.\nIn contrast, an artificial weight loss program usually uses some unnatural means, like pills, surgery, or crash diets. It is a quickfix approach that employs severe caloric restriction and suppression of some natural physiological functions, making the body react as though it were sick. Weight loss occurs within a short period of time, but what is really lost is water and not the fat, which is the real culprit of your condition. After the program, weight is easily regained as your body indulges in eating to recover the energy lost as a result suppressing some natural function of the body.\nNatural Weight Loss Program\nA natural weight loss program is based on the premise that body should continue what it naturally does to continue sustaining itself \u2013 viz. eat, move, sleep. Therefore, it should eat natural food, and perform physical work. Our modern way of living, however, deprives us of this opportunity to use it the way it is intended for. To solve this problem, exercises have been invented for different particular purposes.\nEat Natural Foods\nNatural weight loss program calls for eating foods in their natural state. It does not rely on caffeine, drugs or fad diets, but build new habits and awareness. Natural foods are not processed with any chemicals, hence are not unhealthful for you. Processed foods, such as those coming from the factories, are one of the major causes of excessive weight gain since these foods carries preservatives and various dyes. Adhere to natural foods only, and never ever go after processed food.\nEat Raw Foods\nTo reduce your weight using natural ways, you should stick with mostly uncooked food. It is basically eating raw plant-based foods. Eating raw meat is not advisable because it can cause severe illness due to various germs that remain unkilled. Cooking foods is known to destroy enzymes, as well as destroy or reduce many other nutrients. And so, eat all you want, as long as it is raw, and still enjoy weight loss.\nDo Not Skip Meals\nSkipping meals should not be resorted to, as this can be counterproductive to your weight loss program . Consistent calorie restriction will cause you to decrease your metabolism and gain rather than lose weight.\nExercise At Least Three Times a Week\nFor those who do not burn fat easily, the only way to improve the metabolism rate is to exercise. Choose an exercise program that is suitable for your fitness level, and will work for you. There are types of exercises that aim specifically for weight reduction.\nIn barbell training, for example, the technique to achieve weight loss is to carry light weights, with which you are able to perform at least 15 repetitions. Exercise the larger muscles groups. These muscles burn more fats and calories without having to train longer.\nHerbal Supplements to the Natural Weight Loss Program\nThe taking of herbal supplement can be part of your natural weight loss program . Usually, they come in the form of tablets or tea. These herbs help in the cleansing of the system that carry excess baggage due to unassimilated food. Herbal supplements should only be that \u2013 supplements. Never use these herbal remedies without taking advice from an expert.\nThe natural way is the best way to lose weight, and feel good about yourself at the same time. The natural way is there to help you look good on the outside, while cleaning your body up on the inside to make you feel 100% good all over. Using a natural weight loss plan may take time to reach your goal \u2013 maybe even a year. But in just one year from now you can enjoy being permanently healthy and trim! Consistency is the key.\nGrab a copy of a book or anything that contains lots of motivational techniques. Learn more about the science of weight loss from books written by expert authors.

The topic on weight loss is the most discussed one these days. Every other person is looking for a diet plan to burn some fat and have a fit body. However, not every body is lucky to find the right weight loss program. Some end up losing the spirit and stop it at all, without losing any calories, while some end up gaining some instead of losing. There are also some who lose so much weight that they are unable to be called healthy or fit. It is thus important to look for the perfect weight loss guides that are perfect and do well in long terms. This article focuses on some easy fitness tips that must be kept in mind when starting to lose weight.\nThe first thing you should consider is to consult your doctor regarding the fitness exercise programs you wish to go for. Ask them whether the program would be suitable for you or not. There are people with different stamina and with different lifestyles. Some fitness exercise programs may suit some, while they can turn up to be of no effect for others. Thus, it is important to ask your doctor before selecting any weight loss guides.\nTaking advice from the doctor is not enough always. If you chose to go for any program, make sure you check the fitness tips review, whether it is for a cheap fitness program or for an expensive one. It is not always necessary that a cheap fitness program wouldn\u2019t be worth. \u00a0Many times a cheap one could do better than an expensive one, and so it is important to go for the fitness tips review to check out what people have to say.\nYou may also ask few friends or other family members who had gone through a diet plan before, about some easy fitness tips. Experienced people would have more to tell you. Another most important thing that needs to be brought under consideration is that whether you are determined to lose weight or not. As mentioned above, many people just lose the spirit on the way and end up with nothing. You need to make up your mind that you are going to take the programs seriously and wouldn\u2019t give up in between. Commitment with yourself is an important thing to be successful in anything.\nWhichever program you go for, make sure your heart is satisfied about it. If everybody suggests you to go for one program, but your heart isn\u2019t convinced, listen to your heart. Follow what your heart says, because if you are not satisfied from inside, you won\u2019t get much benefit from it. After all, you are spending some money on the program, and working hard avoiding things that it forbids, and doing a number of exercises. All this hard work needs to show its result, and this can be done only if you do it with full satisfaction and determination.\nA look at the above mentioned easy fitness tips, would not only guide you in making the right decision, but will help you to get what you want. If you follow the above guidelines, you will surely end up with losing a few pounds, looking healthy, fit and smart.\n"}, {"score": 1936.4028, "uuid": "71bbf6ae-65b4-5711-8f13-ca1480c69775", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-13-30083", "target_hostname": "www.naturally-lose-weight-fast.com", "target_uri": "http://www.naturally-lose-weight-fast.com/quick-weight-loss-diets.html", "page_rank": 1.7162142e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Best</em> Quick <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Diets</em>", "snippet": "So here you are, evaluating 1000&#x27;s of different quick <em>weight</em> loss <em>diets</em> (<em>The</em> Atkins <em>diet</em>, South Beach, <em>Weight</em> Watchers, <em>The</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> <em>Diet</em>) all guaranteeing <em>to</em> help you <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> fast... ... but <em>the</em> truth is, 99% of them won&#x27;t <em>give</em> you lasting <em>results</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Best Quick Weight Loss Diets\nWhy is it that nearly all who use quick weight loss diets gain the weight\u00a0right back?\nUnfortunately it's the fact that the weight loss just doesn't seem to last that makes us dread dieting so much?\nI mean...\n... can you think of anything else in which someone would suffer through endless hours of discipline if they knew that all the work would be for nothing?\nLet's face it, if you can't have lasting weight loss , then what's the point of dieting?\nSo here you are, evaluating 1000's of different quick weight loss diets (The Atkins diet , South Beach , Weight Watchers , The Lose Weight Diet ) all guaranteeing to help you lose weight fast...\n... but the truth is, 99% of them won't give you lasting results.\nJust think about it...\nIf you finally make the decision to shed some pounds and spend the next weeks, even months, putting all of your effort into losing the weight, only to discover that once you finally quit dieting the weight comes right back, how will you feel?\nFrustrated to say the least.\nSo, how can you avoid the fate of your friends, relatives and everyone else you know who is stuck in the endless loop of losing weight and gaining it all right back again?\nBy remembering the following little secret...\nWeight loss is a lifestyle, not a product.\nThis simply means that you must find a diet that will easily and effortlessly fit into your everyday life. \u00a0A plan that you never have to give up, and you wouldn't want to because it's enjoyable and keeps you looking your best.\nThere are many quick weight loss diets out there, but please remember, you want to use one that will ensure lasting results.\nOne that will help you lose weight without hunger, calorie counting or skipping meals.\nBefore you go running off and try to find the \"perfect diet\", I encourage you to apply the information found in this website.\nYou should read at least three articles here each day for the next week because it will make losing weight much easier for you.\nYou Should Comment On This Article Below Because It's Easy\nGive Your Comment, Tip, Or Question A Brief Name Here (Like you're writing an Email Subject Line)\nEnter Your Comment, Tip, Or Question Text Here [ ? ]\nEntering your comment, tip or question is easy to do.

Weight loss tips, especially those tailor-made to your personal metabolism, introduce you to the best ways to lose weight, step-by-step. Making a diet plan and sticking to it is one of the best methods to successful weight loss.\nThe road to weight loss can be challenging; some of the most important personal aspects needed are commitment, patience, perseverance and finally, physical exercise in order to get the desired, triumphant results.\nHere are just a few methods that we feel could help make your weight loss project a positive and motivated experience.\nEat a healthy, light breakfast.\nWho doesn\u2019t like a lazy Sunday morning, with the newspaper, coffee and breakfast served with eggs? You might like soft-boiled, scrambled or fried eggs plus all the trimmings! Sounds like a piece of heaven doesn\u2019t it? But no matter how much you like them, the best way to lose weight is to either exclude eggs completely or minimize your daily egg intake to one per day. Eggs, while packed with protein, are also high in cholesterol. Being the first and most important meal of the day, breakfast will supply your body with tons of energy to start off the day, as well as kick-starting your metabolism. But just because breakfast is vitally important, does not mean it should be extraordinarily heavy.\nVary your diet plan options.\nDiets should be exciting, healthy and nourishing. Experimenting with a varying menu will help keep your motivation up and help you stick to the plan. Create diet plans for each week and vary the ingredients. There are plenty of yummy salad recipes; just watch those dressings! Try a mixed bean, potato, beetroot and carrot salad; tomato mixed with herbs from the garden or an in-season fresh fruit salad, for example. Alternate your menu choices every day to avoid getting bored.\nGreatly limit alcohol in your diet plans.\nI\u2019ll have a gin and tonic please. We all have opportunities for social or even business drinking, but it\u2019s far better to avoid alcohol altogether. If you must drink for appearances sake, just have one and sip it throughout the evening. While a single glass of red or white wine with dinner can be good for the digestion, beer, or wine to excess, definitely doesn\u2019t go hand in hand with the best way to lose weight; it is, in fact, extremely fattening and causes severe blood sugar spikes, which in turn causes food cravings. Additionally, make sure to skip the salty snacks and fattening foods that often accompany happy hour at the local bar.\nBalance carbs, proteins, fats and fiber.\nOnly 50 to 55 percent of your daily diet should be made up of carbohydrates, while proteins should be around 30 percent. Proteins help provide your body with necessary muscle and strength. Fats, preferably of the healthy variety, should consist of only about 15 to 20, and no more than 30 percent of your daily dietary intake. Fats, contrary to some beliefs, are necessary in moderation in order to keep your bodily systems, skin and hair healthy. Whole grain bread is filled with fiber and is far healthier than ordinary white bread. Introducing fiber like whole grains, beans and fruit into your diet plan will help your digestion and increase metabolism,\nEat more vegetables.\nThe vegetarian lifestyle isn\u2019t for everyone, but if it sounds tempting enough to try, it could be the best way for you, personally, to lose weight. There are many benefits to becoming a vegetarian. Most people will find that toxins are cleaned out of the body, that they have more energy and vitality and that their metabolism increases, leading to successful weight loss. If you are one of the many people who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to live without meat in your meals, consider eating more fish, chicken, turkey or other white meat alternatives. Most prepared meats, such as bacon, sausages or ham are fattening and should be limited or left well alone.\nChange your eating habits.\nThree square meals a day is a thing of the past and may be a contributing factor to why so many older Americans are overweight. The most proven and best way to lose weight is to eat smaller portions several times a day. By dividing the traditional 3 meals a day into 5 or 6 meals instead, the digestive system doesn\u2019t get overloaded. Food is broken down properly and your metabolism increases, providing a more natural way of losing weight successfully.\nCombining these diet plans with frequent physical exercise is the most successful diet plan for the best way to lose weight and remain healthy. It is even possible to regain health lost as a result of overeating or lack of exercise.\nThe best advice is to take baby steps. You didn\u2019t gain the weight overnight and you will not lose it that way either. Taking it one day at a time and celebrating your successes while minimizing your failures will see a fitter, healthier, future you.\nTags\n"}, {"score": 1918.832, "uuid": "1ba7ec09-6e98-5890-a5f7-317dd731f0a9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1808wb-62-14600", "target_hostname": "www.bestwritersplace.com", "target_uri": "http://www.bestwritersplace.com/amazon_store/item/0345531620", "page_rank": 1.1740919e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>The</em> Drop 10 <em>Diet</em>: Add <em>to</em> Your Plate <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>the</em> <em>Weight</em> | <em>Best</em> Writers Place", "snippet": "Get $120 Off Amazon Kindle DX - Featuring Large 9.7\u201d E Ink Display and Free 3G Wireless <em>The</em> Drop 10 <em>Diet</em>: Add <em>to</em> Your Plate <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>the</em> <em>Weight</em> <em>The</em> Drop 10 <em>Diet</em>: Add <em>to</em> Your Plate <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>the</em> <em>Weight</em> These days, we\u2019re constantly bombarded with trendy, restrictive <em>diets</em> that instruct us <em>to</em> \u201cEat only this", "explanation": null, "document": "The Drop 10 Diet: Add to Your Plate to Lose the Weight\nThe Drop 10 Diet: Add to Your Plate to Lose the Weight\nContinue Shopping or See your cart\nItem Description\nThese days, we\u2019re constantly bombarded with trendy, restrictive diets that instruct us to \u201cEat only this\u201d or \u201cGive up that\u201d\u2014diets that ultimately fail when you find that you can\u2019t sacrifice the foods you love.

But do you really need to go that low? The truth, experts say, is that you can weigh more than your ideal weight and still be healthy (not to mention happy).\nIf you\u2019re overweight, losing just 10% of your body weight is associated with a myriad of health benefits, including lowering blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar, and reducing your risk for heart disease. Not only that, experts say, but this kind of weight loss is easier to attain and maintain, setting you up for success in the long run.\nYour Weight \u201cSet Point\u201d\nJust as your body temperature is programmed to stay around 98.6 degrees, your body weight is naturally regulated to stay within a range of 10%-20%, says Thomas Wadden, PhD, director of the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders at University of Pennsylvania Medical School. This weight range is known as the \u201cset point.\u201d\nA complex set of hormones, chemicals, and hunger signals help your body naturally maintain your weight within this range, says American Dietetic Association spokeswoman Dawn Jackson Blatner, RD.\nIt is not just a matter of genetics, though. Your eating and exercise habits can also help to determine your set point.\n\u201cOvereating swamps the internal regulatory system, and, as a result, the set point increases \u2014 which is much easier to do than it is to lower it,\u201d says Wadden. The body adjusts to the higher weight and \u201cresets\u201d the set point to defend the new weight.\nIt is difficult, but not impossible, to set your range lower. \u201cWith changes in healthy eating and exercise behavior, you can lower your set point,\u201d says Blatner.\nThe 10% Solution to Weight Loss\nA recent book, Break Through Your Set Point: How to Finally Lose the Weight You Want and Keep It Off, by George Blackburn, MD, suggests that maintaining a 10% loss for six months to a year helps your body adjust to the lower weight and thus reset the set point.\nWadden explains that when you lose large amounts of weight at once, you set up an internal struggle and hormones like ghrelin spike to make you hungrier as your body tries to defend its comfortable range.\nInstead, experts recommend that you try losing 10% the old-fashioned way \u2014 by slowly changing eating and exercise behaviors \u2014 then maintain this new weight for a few months before trying to lose more.\u00a0 Not only will your body get the signal to lower its \u201cset point,\u201d but you\u2019ll give yourself a chance to get used to new food choices, smaller portions, and regular exercise.\n\u201cWhen patients lose 10% it may not be the pant size they want, but they start to realize how a little weight loss impacts their health in very positive ways,\u201d says Blatner. \u201cThey feel better, sleep better, have more energy or less joint pain, and some people are able to reduce medications.\u201d\nMost people overestimate how much weight they can realistically lose, which leads to frustration, says Blatner. To find your happy or healthy weight, Blatner suggests looking back on your weight history as an adult and identify a weight you were able to maintain naturally and fairly easily.\nAnd if you\u2019ve gained more than a few pounds since your wedding day, forget trying to fit into that bridal gown. \u201cAs you gain weight, you experience an increase in fat cell size and number, which will probably prevent you from getting back to your married weight,\u201d says Wadden.\nInstead of focusing on the numbers on the scale, Blatner suggests setting behavioral goals: \u201cEat breakfast every day, go for daily walks, eat more fruits and vegetables \u2014 when you set behavior goals, they are easier to accomplish and they make you feel good.\u201d \u00a0Stick with these behaviors for 3-6 months and they will become part of your life.\nBased on your current weight, eat about 10 calories per pound of nutritious food (low in fat, rich in lean protein, high in fiber), get regular exercise, and assess your weight after a month or so.\n\u201cYour weight will settle out and typically you will lose 10%, then hit a plateau, which is a good time to maintain the weight loss,\u201d says Wadden.\nAs you get to a healthy weight, you can go up to 12 calories per pound.\nTips for Weight Loss Success\nHere are some tips from Blatner for weight loss success:\nEat regular meals.\u00a0 People who eat regular meals consume fewer calories than those who eat irregular meals.\nUse a plate, sit down, and enjoy your meals. Folks who do this eat 43% smaller portions than those who eat out of containers or on the run, according to Blatner.\nGet at least 30 minutes of moderate activity each day.\nHow much and what you eat makes a big difference.\u00a0 Enjoy normal portions of foods that are high in fiber (fruits, veggies, whole grains) and rich in lean or low fat protein is the secret to feeling full.\nThink positive: Focus on the benefits of a healthier lifestyle rather than the scale.\n"}, {"score": 1873.149, "uuid": "53f4fd05-ae1b-58fa-9387-5ae128a172d9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0206wb-36-17340", "target_hostname": "www.personal-nutrition-guide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.personal-nutrition-guide.com/desperate-to-lose-weight.html", "page_rank": 1.1867081e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "Desperate <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>", "snippet": "I know it&#x27;s frustrating when you feel like you&#x27;re trying so hard <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> and you aren&#x27;t getting <em>the</em> <em>results</em> you want.

Sigh, there are so many things you have to consider when going on a fat loss diet, right? I mean, after all, if you don't know the exact nutrient content of what is going to be in your diet, there can't be any way that you could lose weight, correct?\nWrong! In fact, that couldn't be further from the truth. Losing weight effectively can be a simple affair, that is if you know how to and are determined enough to do so.\nThe truth is that when you want to lose weight effectively, safely, and easily, you only need to worry about one thing and one thing only. Restricting your calorie intake. That's the simple and hard truth.\nEvery diet out there is just simply variations on how to go about restricting calories consumption since different ways are easier or harder for different people depending on their personality and body type. But at the basic level, the only thing that matters is caloric restriction, also known as keeping a caloric deficit situation.\nWeight loss program\nLose Weight Now\nWhat is interesting about going on a simple, calorie restrictive diet without all the bells and whistles of all the fad diets that are out there is that while the name makes it seem hard, it is actually in many ways EASIER than a non-traditional style diet.\nWhy? Well, here are a few reasons making your own calorie restrictive diet is easier:\na) You still get to choose what you eat and when to eat them.\nb) You can still eat the foods you were eating before, only simply just less of them.\nc) You can easily measure your progress and see what the optimum level of caloric intake is necessary for your body to hit it's maximum fat loss potential.\nWith that being said, by only restricting your calories without changing your diet whatsoever does have some issues which need to be addressed.\nThe first problem is that while restricting calories will allow you to lose weight, no matter what you eat, the problem is that you will NOT necessarily be gaining the health benefits that you would be gaining if you completely change your diet.\nYou can lose weight eating junk foods like fries and chips, as long as you don't eat too much fries and chips - but it is certainly not the kind of diet that is going to make you feel good and healthy.\nThe second problem with not changing with what you are eating at all is that while you will lose weight, it will not give you best results for changing your body composition. There is a reason why the top athletes eat a specific kind of diet - because it heavily influences their results in competition.\nIf you want to get a great body shape, then it is very important that you eat healthy foods like whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meat and some dairy products. It is also important that while you are on a weight loss die t , that you focus on doing exercises to lose weight.\nIn conclusion, combining healthy eating while restricting your calories is the best and simplest way to go about losing weight and leading a strong, healthy lifestyle.\nBest Wishes\nRafi\nThis simple weight loss article is contributed by Rafi Bar-Lev.

And now I want to help you get the results you want with my Ultimate Weight Loss 5 CD easy-to-implement program.\nFor one-on-one personal treatment I charge up to $200 per hour... but you won't have to. And that's because now you can cost effectively use the same system that my clients and Marc successfully used - all in privacy of your own home that'll guide you into a peaceful and enjoyable relaxation while your subconscious mind receives positive suggestions for effective weight loss!\nOnce you do, you will\nGain a more positive attitude and take positive action!\nImprove your self esteem and become more confident!\nSleep better and feel happier!\nStop beating yourself up and live more focused in accomplishing every day tasks and goals!

Not to mention that clinical studies have proven time and time again that hypnosis is probably one of the most effective ways to find and release conflicts, depression, blocks and illness.\nSo if you're self motivated and want to stop smoking, make more money, find a lost object, take strokes off your golf game, be happier and effectively take control of your life and lose weight the right way then you may want to consider hypnosis.\nNow, it's important for you to understand that everything we experience, EVERYTHING, is a result of how we perceive and filter it in our mind. We choose our reality, our thoughts and our feelings. When you feel you no longer have a choice about how you think or feel, you're experiencing a block that may be created by an underlying emotional conflict.\nHypnosis can find and release the block, allowing you to have the freedom to think and free your mind which will allow you feel the way you want to and allow you to create the new you!\nI want to relax now and just think how you'll feel when you experience the life changing world of HYPNOSIS on your own... at your own pace... and in just 25 minutes a day with my Ultimate Weight Loss Program. But now you're wondering\nLosing Weight Easily, Effectively And Finally Keeping It Off!\nIn one clinical study, psychologists put 109 overweight individuals on a medically supervised weight-loss program. Some of the folks were given regular hypnosis and others were not. After about nine weeks, both these focus groups had lost the same amount of weight... but here's the part that should interest you:\nAt 8-month and 2-year intervals, the participants who received hypnosis had lost additional weight or kept their weight better... than those who didn't.\nSo now you see why countless people from all walks of life - from hundreds of countries - have used hypnosis so productively. And don't you agree that it's one thing to lose the weight - but isn't your dream to effectively keep it off, too?\nYou take care of your family's needs, don't you? Well, now it's time to take care of your own. So once you receive my Ultimate Weight Loss Program tell your spouse and kids that you're about to go on your own personal \"mini\" vacation.\nBecause this is your time NOW!\nAll you have to do is sit comfortably undisturbed for only 25 minutes a day with a pair of headphones on and drift off to a deep relaxation on and do nothing. That's it! Let your subconscious do all the work and you'll see how remarkably your behavior towards exercise and dieting changes automatically. And you'll accomplish this all without self-help meetings to attend or taking pills (that you might've bought off some late night infomercial.) So\nSTOP---\nthe merry go round of going from diet to diet and being disappointed with nothing happening!\nSTOP---\nlistening to every new \"weight loss\" guru that comes down the pike who announces that \"their\" diet is the only one you need!\nSTOP---\nletting your weight problems bring you down emotionally and spiritually and live the life you know you deserve... not tomorrow... not in the future... but NOW!\nAnd so I ask you what do you think it would cost right now to have you efficiently and once-and-for-all take control of your weight loss and keep those damn pounds off? $100.00 - $200.00.

Since then I have been training in and developing a range of brand new psychological techniques that finally bring this vital element into a weight loss programme. You need to change how you think. Whether you have the book and are here to claim your free downloads, or you are coming along to a workshop, I truly believe I have created a system that you can use to change your mind and your body - for good.

Never fear.", "explanation": null, "document": "Tweet\nYou need to eat to burn body fat. This is a fact: The first nutritional demand of your body is energy. Without adequate energy, your body will convert muscle protein into energy to feed your brain, nervous system and red blood cells.\nThese particular tissues do not possess the metabolic machinery to burn fat. They only burn carbohydrates. When your intake of carbohydrate falls below these tissues demand, the body begins to convert tissue protein into carbohydrate to meet their need. The net result is a loss of muscle tissue.\nYes, the scale may say you have lost \"weight\", but you have lost the very tissue that burns fat. Muscle tissue burns 70% of the fat in your body; so losing muscle sacrifices your ability to burn body fat.\nIn fact, the \"weight\" you lose on a diet can represent up to 10 to 20% of those pounds in muscle loss. This poor dieter will not only regain this weight, but then some. All because they have compromised their ability to burn body fat.\nThis is also why people gain weight as they age.\nAging causes muscle loss. So does inactivity. Have you heard of the saying\"Use it or lose it\"? This is true of your muscle.\nInactivity leads to muscle loss and muscle loss causes a lowered capacity to burn fat, so you wear more of it.\nThe bottom line is this: At any time, or for whatever reason, you lose your muscle; you lose your capacity to burn fat. Diets, aging and inactivity all lead to a decreased amount of muscle weight and an increased amount of fat tissue.\nNever fear. You can, at any time in your life, rebuild your muscle and teach it to burn fat.\nAerobic exercise rebuilds your muscle and teaches it to burn more fat. Eating right gives you the nutrients you need to make that muscle. The food pyramid outlines how to eat to get the nutrients you need, so let us deal more specifically with energy needs and where that energy needs to come from.\nIn order to burn just the fat and not the other lean tissue in your body, you need to meet your minimal energy requirement.\nIf you want to maintain your current weight, this level is found by multiplying your weight by 15.\nIf you want to lose weight, multiply your ideal weight by ten. For example, if your ideal weight is 140 pounds, your minimal energy requirement is 1400 calories.\nNext, you need to factor in the calories needed for exercise and activity. Very active people (those who exercise 3 hours or more a week) need to multiply their minimal requirement by 1.5. Moderately active individuals (those who exercise 1 to 3 hours per week) need to multiply their requirement by 1.2.\nSlugs need not factor in additional calories.\nFor those of us who move, let's cite an example: if you take 4 hours of aerobics classes per week and your ideal weight is 140 pounds, you need 2100 calories a day to keep your muscle and burn the fat.\nNow, where does that energy need to come from? It makes sense that if you want to burn the fat on your body; you do not want to be eating it in your food.\nLet's be perfectly clear about this. There are only two fates of fat in your diet: Fat is either burned by your muscle or it is deposited in your fat cells. If you are wanting to lose body fat, the solution is simple: Eat less and burn more.\nWhich leads to the debate: \"WHAT IS LESS?\"\nLess is 30% of your calorie intake. To find this amount of fat in grams; multiply your caloric requirement by .3 and divide the calories by nine. For example, 2100 calories times .3 is 630 calories, divided by nine leaves 70 grams of fat.\nWhen you consider a \"Double Western Cheeseburger Supreme\" has 70 grams of fat, you can appreciate the etiology of obesity in America. In fact, statistics show that one out of every three of us can qualify as overweight, so we have some work cut out for us in terms of the amount of fat in our diets.\nTake a look at the foods below and see where you can substitute one food for another to lower your fat intake:\nFood\n"}, {"score": 1770.8252, "uuid": "f6bab071-62c4-5535-b374-ceccf009b19e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-22-26433", "target_hostname": "blueberry.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp", "target_uri": "http://blueberry.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/moat/index.php?title=The_secrets_to_lose_weight_fast&printable=yes", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "<em>The</em> secrets <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> fast - MOATWiki", "snippet": "It can is not important just how much pounds you will need <em>to</em> shed, <em>the</em> <em>best</em> way <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> fast I will reveal can be quite efficient and is proven <em>to</em> dedicate yourself <em>to</em> long lasting fat loss.

That seems simple enough, but if were really that simple, none of us would have a weight problem. Too often we take drastic measures to see results -- diets, pills or those weird fitness gadgets on infomercials that promise instant success. Maybe you lose weight but what happens when you go off that diet or stop that crazy workout program? You gain it all back and more. The real secret to weight loss is to make small, lasting changes. The key is to forget about instant results and settle in for the long run.\nRules of Weight Loss\nTo lose one pound of fat , you must burn approximately 3500 calories over and above what you already burn doing daily activities. That sounds like a lot of calories and you certainly wouldn't want to try to burn 3500 calories in one day. However, by taking it step-by-step, you can determine just what you need to do each day to burn or cut out those extra calories. Below is a step by step process for getting started.\nCalculate your BMR (basal metabolic rate). Your BMR is the amount of calories your body needs to maintain basic bodily functions like breathing and digestion. This is the minimum number of calories you need to eat each day. Keep in mind that no calculator will be 100% accurate, so you may need to adjust these numbers as you learn more about your own metabolism .\nCalculate your activity level. For a week or so, keep an activity journal and use a calorie calculator to figure out how many calories you burn while sitting, standing, exercising, lifting weights, etc. throughout the day. Another, easier option is to wear a heart rate monitor that calculates calories burned. After a week, add your totals for each day and average them out to get a general idea of how many calories you burn each day.\nKeep track of how many calories you eat . For at least a week, enter and track your calories online (e.g., with Calorie Count ) or use a food journal to write down what you eat and drink each day. Be as accurate as possible, measuring when you need to or looking up nutritional information for restaurants, if you eat out. After a week, add your totals for each day and average them out to get a general idea of how many calories you eat each day.\nAdd it up. Take your BMR number and add your activity calories. Then subtract your food calories from that total. If you're eating more than your BMR + your activity calories, you're at risk for gaining weight.\nExample:\nMary's BMR is 1400 calories and she burns 900 calories with regular exercise, walking around and doing household chores. To maintain her weight, she should be eating 2300 calories (1400 + 900= 2300). However, after keeping a food journal, Mary finds that she's eating 2550 calories every day. By eating 250 more calories than her body needs, Mary will gain about a pound every 2-3 weeks.\nThis example shows how easy it is to gain weight without even knowing it. However, it's also easy to lose weight, even if the process itself can be slow. You can start by making small changes in your diet and activity levels and immediately start burning more calories than you're eating. If you can find a way to burn an extra 200 to 500 calories each day with both exercise and diet, you're on the right track. Try these ideas:\nInstead of...\n"}], [{"score": 1768.208, "uuid": "503e2002-1ea4-5b67-b31e-b404e82f323c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-22-26422", "target_hostname": "blueberry.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp", "target_uri": "http://blueberry.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/moat/index.php/The_secrets_to_lose_weight_fast", "page_rank": 1.3175526e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "<em>The</em> secrets <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> fast - MOATWiki", "snippet": "It can is not important just how much pounds you will need <em>to</em> shed, <em>the</em> <em>best</em> way <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> fast I will reveal can be quite efficient and is proven <em>to</em> dedicate yourself <em>to</em> long lasting fat loss.

After I put this plan into affect I was able to do all the things I wanted to, like go to a beach and actually just wear my trunks, instead of shirts upon shirts. I felt more comfortable with myself, and at the same time I had more energy to do other things with my family.\nI know if I can do it, you also can! I want to help all those that are just like me, looking for a weight loss plan that actually works and doesn\u2019t just take your money. That\u2019s why I have created the Weight Loss All-Star Program for all those wanting to lose weight, and keep the weight off.\nYou can grab the \u201cWeight Loss All Star\u201d eBook for a fraction of what it would cost you to go to the gym all year.

More Details Here >> 101 Weight Loss Tips\nRaw Food Diet Recipes & Meal Plans:\nAre You Planning To Start On a Raw Food Diet?\nRaw food diets can be a great way to not only lose weight but also led a much healthier, natural lifestyle in general.\nIn hundreds of thousands of cases, people who\u2019ve adopted a vegan diet of predominantly raw foods with minimal or no cooked starches as part of a healthful lifestyle (including regular exercise and adequate sleep), have lost excess weight, overcome illness, gained new vitality, and avoided the killer diseases which now plague our meat, bread, dairy, and junk-food eating society.\nMost raw food diets are plant-based, with at least 75% of the diet composed of raw food. Food examples include living on raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, rolled or flaked grains, and seaweeds. Some adherents may also eat cooked grains and legumes, fresh fish, and poultry. Remember, for the strict raw food diet, nothing should be heated over 116 degrees Fahrenheit. The fresh vitamins, active enzymes, organic minerals, soluble fiber, high water content, and easily digested fats and proteins in fruit and plant foods can help transform any sluggish, overweight meat eater into a slimmer and more dynamic person. Some raw food dieters can be classified as vegans.\nDon\u2019t believe everything you read about the raw food diet. Beware of misinformation in the raw food world. I took a course on \u201cwhole foods\u201d and learned about tremendous benefits of eating nothing but raw veggies, salads, fruit and fruit juices. Get the look and health you always wanted!\nThis short but valuable eBook is meant to give you a bird\u2019s eye view about this all-natural diet plan and provide some raw food diet recipes that you can try.

More Details Here >> Teenagers Weight Loss Secrets\nNatural Weight Loss:\nThere have been a lot of well publicized weight loss pills and pill combinations in recent years. Many have been proven to be unsafe for extended use while others have been proven to be downright deadly. When overweight patients ask their doctors for appetite suppressant pills, many times these doctors will quickly prescribe them and then fail to oversee their use or, even worse, they will fail to take their time to counsel their patients on the dangers of using these kinds of drugs.\nIt is very tempting to use diet pills in the quest for weight loss. Imagine the idea of just popping a little pill in and presto the weight is gone. Unfortunately, diet pills don\u2019t work like that. There really isn\u2019t a little magic pill. Unless a reduced calorie diet and exercise are used in conjunction with diet pills, the pills themselves will have no affect whatsoever on a person\u2019s weight.\nNatural weight loss occurs when your body burns more energy than it is supplied with. What I mean by that is that food is the body\u2019s energy source. That is what the purpose of food is basically. Energy is measured in calories so I\u2019m not advocating a calorie counting diet for you when I use the word \u2018calorie\u2019.\nOur Natural weight loss and Obesity Program is among the most effective natural weight loss programs available in the world. This natural weight loss plan is easy and affordable with whole foods and health drinks sold in stores; it is, without a doubt, the safest and best weight loss program.\nLose Weight With Green Tea Diet:\nEveryone knows that green tea is packed with health benefits.

If you drink green tea you can lower cholesterol and increase energy expenditure. Drinking green tea helps you to lose weight by boosting your metabolism, regulating your blood sugar and making you less hungry.\nDo you want to lose weight by SIMPLY drinking more GREAT TASTING Green Tea?\nSome people may think that green tea is the key to weight loss success, all by itself. Although, green tea is known to burn countless extra calories but just drinking green tea alone, without healthy diet and exercise, probably won\u2019t be enough. Ideally, green tea should be just one part of your overall diet and exercise plan.\nGreen tea can definitely help you lose weight. But from what I\u2019ve experienced some types of green tea diets are far more effective weight loss aids than others.\nIn this eBook discover all about Green Tea Weight Loss Diets \u2013 What is the best green tea to lose weight and when should you drink it?

Unless you keep your calorie intake in check, you can NEVER expect to lose weight. Unfortunately, most people find calorie counting a tedious and time-consuming task. This little report will tell you how to count calories in 5 EASY Steps and lose weight.\nUltimate Weight Loss Hypnosis Audio Program:\nUnless you happen to be one of the lucky few who can eat what they want and stay thin, then you, like me, have probably struggled to keep the pounds off as the years have gone by.\nWouldn\u2019t it be amazing if you could cause a permanent change in your biochemistry so that you no longer desired to over eat and consume unhealthy foods?\nThe answer lies in the behaviour core of your body, your subconscious mind.

More Details Here >> 101 Weight Loss Tips\nRaw Food Diet Recipes & Meal Plans:\nAre You Planning To Start On a Raw Food Diet?\nRaw food diets can be a great way to not only lose weight but also led a much healthier, natural lifestyle in general.\nIn hundreds of thousands of cases, people who\u2019ve adopted a vegan diet of predominantly raw foods with minimal or no cooked starches as part of a healthful lifestyle (including regular exercise and adequate sleep), have lost excess weight, overcome illness, gained new vitality, and avoided the killer diseases which now plague our meat, bread, dairy, and junk-food eating society.\nMost raw food diets are plant-based, with at least 75% of the diet composed of raw food. Food examples include living on raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, rolled or flaked grains, and seaweeds. Some adherents may also eat cooked grains and legumes, fresh fish, and poultry. Remember, for the strict raw food diet, nothing should be heated over 116 degrees Fahrenheit. The fresh vitamins, active enzymes, organic minerals, soluble fiber, high water content, and easily digested fats and proteins in fruit and plant foods can help transform any sluggish, overweight meat eater into a slimmer and more dynamic person. Some raw food dieters can be classified as vegans.\nDon\u2019t believe everything you read about the raw food diet. Beware of misinformation in the raw food world. I took a course on \u201cwhole foods\u201d and learned about tremendous benefits of eating nothing but raw veggies, salads, fruit and fruit juices. Get the look and health you always wanted!\nThis short but valuable eBook is meant to give you a bird\u2019s eye view about this all-natural diet plan and provide some raw food diet recipes that you can try. Everything you ever wanted to know about the raw food diets with delicious raw food recipes.\nTeenagers Weight Loss Secrets:\nIs your teen\u2019s success in the future at risk due to being overweight now?\nSelf esteem plays an important role in today\u2019s society, and being overweight can have a serious effect on your teen\u2019s mental well being. Your teen is far likelier to excel in adulthood if they are at or below their recommended body mass index.\nDon\u2019t waste your time and money on fad diets that never work\u2026Instead, grab the only source of quality information on teen weight loss done the right way! More Details Here >> Teenagers Weight Loss Secrets\nNatural Weight Loss:\nThere have been a lot of well publicized weight loss pills and pill combinations in recent years. Many have been proven to be unsafe for extended use while others have been proven to be downright deadly. When overweight patients ask their doctors for appetite suppressant pills, many times these doctors will quickly prescribe them and then fail to oversee their use or, even worse, they will fail to take their time to counsel their patients on the dangers of using these kinds of drugs.\nIt is very tempting to use diet pills in the quest for weight loss. Imagine the idea of just popping a little pill in and presto the weight is gone. Unfortunately, diet pills don\u2019t work like that. There really isn\u2019t a little magic pill. Unless a reduced calorie diet and exercise are used in conjunction with diet pills, the pills themselves will have no affect whatsoever on a person\u2019s weight.\nNatural weight loss occurs when your body burns more energy than it is supplied with. What I mean by that is that food is the body\u2019s energy source. That is what the purpose of food is basically. Energy is measured in calories so I\u2019m not advocating a calorie counting diet for you when I use the word \u2018calorie\u2019.\nOur Natural weight loss and Obesity Program is among the most effective natural weight loss programs available in the world. This natural weight loss plan is easy and affordable with whole foods and health drinks sold in stores; it is, without a doubt, the safest and best weight loss program.\nLose Weight With Green Tea Diet:\nEveryone knows that green tea is packed with health benefits.

But did you know it also burns fat and boosts your metabolism?\nChances are, you may have seen green tea flashed across the TV screen as an exciting new way to lose weight. If you drink green tea you can lower cholesterol and increase energy expenditure. Drinking green tea helps you to lose weight by boosting your metabolism, regulating your blood sugar and making you less hungry.\nDo you want to lose weight by SIMPLY drinking more GREAT TASTING Green Tea?\nSome people may think that green tea is the key to weight loss success, all by itself. Although, green tea is known to burn countless extra calories but just drinking green tea alone, without healthy diet and exercise, probably won\u2019t be enough. Ideally, green tea should be just one part of your overall diet and exercise plan.\nGreen tea can definitely help you lose weight. But from what I\u2019ve experienced some types of green tea diets are far more effective weight loss aids than others.\nIn this eBook discover all about Green Tea Weight Loss Diets \u2013 What is the best green tea to lose weight and when should you drink it? Where To Buy Green Tea? How to choose a high quality brand of green tea with cheapest price tags?

But, like most things, the devil is in the details. What about my evening walks or the aerobics? How does my age affect weight loss? Does it matter if I have a lot or a little to lose?\nThe math gets worse as you go.\nThat\u2019s why\u00a0I had a\u00a0software engineer create Weight Loss Oracle for me.

Or you can burn more calories through exercise than you gain by eating.\nWhen it comes to Weight Loss, calorie is everything. Unless you keep your calorie intake in check, you can NEVER expect to lose weight. Unfortunately, most people find calorie counting a tedious and time-consuming task. This little report will tell you how to count calories in 5 EASY Steps and lose weight.\nUltimate Weight Loss Hypnosis Audio Program:\nUnless you happen to be one of the lucky few who can eat what they want and stay thin, then you, like me, have probably struggled to keep the pounds off as the years have gone by.\nWouldn\u2019t it be amazing if you could cause a permanent change in your biochemistry so that you no longer desired to over eat and consume unhealthy foods?\nThe answer lies in the behaviour core of your body, your subconscious mind.

You are about to learn two simple secrets that will guarantee easy weight loss.\nThe first big secret:\nThe most powerful factor in weight loss\nHave you ever noticed this:\nPeople who have shed a lot of loose weight through successful dieting and exercise always want to encourage everyone else to lose weight. \u201cIf you want to lose weight,\u201d they say, \u201cI will show you how I did it.\u201d\nBut even though they tell this to all the overweight people they know, the \u201cfatties\u201d will always ignore the advice \u2014 unless one factor is present. And this is the biggest secret to weight loss. If this factor is present, any overweight person can lose weight easily.\nWhat is this secret? It is motivation.\nWhat is motivation?\nMotivation is the answer you give when someone says \u201cWhy do you want to lose weight?\u201d Do you have a strong reason?\nIf you desperately want to lose weight before your upcoming wedding, that is a powerful motivator. If your doctor has told you to lose weight or you will be dead in 12 months, that is a powerful motivator too.\nIf you want to lose 10 kilos before your wedding, or you are a jockey who needs to lose a couple of kilograms to ride in a big race, or you are an overweight actor who has landed a film role to play a skinnier person, you too have a powerful motivating factor.\nWhatever your reason, it must be a strong motivation for you to lose weight. Without it, you are not yet ready to lose weight. It's as simple as that. That's why not everyone who goes to weight-loss clinics or tries hypnosis loses weight. They are too content with their life as it is. Motivation is missing.\nOf course the motivation could simply be to lose weight so you will look better and find it easier to move around. Overweight adults often diet to lose weight to look more attractive or to get slimmer for their wedding, or to stop wrinkles . Overweight teens can feel shunned until they determine to lose weight.

If you have a powerful reason to lose weight, you will. It's as simple as that!\nGot motivation? Then read on for two easy weight-loss plans that will work for the rest of your life. (There are other tips in our Teen Topics section that may also help desperate adults: Easy ways to lose weight for overweight teens .)\nOne plan below lets you eat what you are already eating and slowly lose weight. This may be enough if you want to lose 10 kilograms before you get married in 12 months time. The other shows how breaking up your meals better and choosing good foods can help you lose weight more quickly.\nAnother big secret:\nPlan No.1: The \u201cnon-diet\u201d diet\nIf you are overweight and find it difficult to stick to weight-loss programs, try this \u201cnon-diet\u201d diet. We have never heard of a failure with this diet for those who genuinely make it part of their eating routine. It is natural, painless, and sensible.\nThe 10 per cent diet doesn't require a change in what you eat, just a slight change in how much you eat. It will help you steadily lose weight for as long as you like.\nIn the Bible, the practice of tithing (giving 10 per cent) was accepted as a responsibility toward God since the time of Abraham. The Hebrews gave 10 per cent of their livestock, grain, and fruits to the priests. Many Christians today follow this principle by giving 10 per cent of their income to the church.\nTithing helps others while instilling self-control, charity, and thoughtfulness in the giver.\nAvoid that last bite\nThe 10 per cent diet works in a similar way. It means you eat about 10 per cent less than you normally would. Take nine bites and leave the tenth. Cook nine spoonfuls instead of 10. Mentally divide your meal into 10 parts and give the tenth part to your dog (if one part looks bigger than the other nine, make sure the bigger one goes to the dog!)\nIt doesn't seem much, but after 10 days you will have eaten only nine days of your normal food intake. If you are getting married in 10 months' time, by the time your wedding arrives you will have eaten only nine months' supply of food and will have saved a whole month of food bills and will fit better into your wedding outfit. If you make sure you do even simple exercise (such as walking briskly or bike riding for 30 minutes) and cut down on foods loaded with fat or sugar, it may contribute another 10 per cent or more weight loss.\nThis easy way to lose weight makes you think before you eat. You don't cut down so much that you still feel hungry, yet you continue to eat what you eat now \u2014 if you want to. You can lose weight even more easily if you replace high-fat/high-sugar foods with low-fat/ low-sugar foods.\nSimply buy less, cook less, and eat less. You will feel better while you save money and watch that excess weight slip off to reveal the real thinner, lovelier you!\nPlan No.2:\nThe Eat More Meals Diet\nTo lose weight more quickly, you can follow the Eat More Meals Diet.\nThe Eat More Meals Diet changes your pattern of eating to give you healthier eating habits without leaving you hungry. It is designed to get you into the habit of eating for health instead of for pleasure.\nYou need to get out of your regular routine of having 3 big meals a day (with constant in-between snacks), or skipping meals to try to lose weight. Instead, plan 4 meals a day of better food that is filling enough to prevent you from wanting to snack.\nIt works like this. For the next 10 days, plan 4 meals a day made up from the following foods. Eat two or three of the items in each meal, but over the day try to get a variety \u2014 so you will be getting a good mixture of vitamins, fibre, protein, dairy, and nuts.\nSalad or cooked vegetables\nskinless chicken or chicken slices\nskinless turkey slices\n"}, {"score": 1727.6803, "uuid": "a270bd33-8690-5891-ba61-965ed2b0e4f3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0503wb-69-20018", "target_hostname": "www.creationtips.com", "target_uri": "http://www.creationtips.com//diet.html", "page_rank": 1.2148326e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>What</em> are <em>the</em> <em>best</em> ways <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em>?

If you make sure you do even simple exercise (such as walking briskly or bike riding for 30 minutes) and cut down on foods loaded with fat or sugar, it may contribute another 10 per cent or more weight loss.\nThis easy way to lose weight makes you think before you eat. You don't cut down so much that you still feel hungry, yet you continue to eat what you eat now \u2014 if you want to. You can lose weight even more easily if you replace high-fat/high-sugar foods with low-fat/ low-sugar foods.\nSimply buy less, cook less, and eat less. You will feel better while you save money and watch that excess weight slip off to reveal the real thinner, lovelier you!\nPlan No.2:\nThe Eat More Meals Diet\nTo lose weight more quickly, you can follow the Eat More Meals Diet.\nThe Eat More Meals Diet changes your pattern of eating to give you healthier eating habits without leaving you hungry. It is designed to get you into the habit of eating for health instead of for pleasure.\nYou need to get out of your regular routine of having 3 big meals a day (with constant in-between snacks), or skipping meals to try to lose weight. Instead, plan 4 meals a day of better food that is filling enough to prevent you from wanting to snack.\nIt works like this. For the next 10 days, plan 4 meals a day made up from the following foods. Eat two or three of the items in each meal, but over the day try to get a variety \u2014 so you will be getting a good mixture of vitamins, fibre, protein, dairy, and nuts.\nSalad or cooked vegetables\nskinless chicken or chicken slices\nskinless turkey slices\n"}, {"score": 1725.1436, "uuid": "b13b6b2c-25fd-51d1-8be0-8b8d9151d951", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1211wb-47-27539", "target_hostname": "blog.desidieter.com", "target_uri": "http://blog.desidieter.com/diet-and-nutrition/foods-that-boost-your-memory~1270107602.html", "page_rank": 1.1709549e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "<em>Diet</em> Plans, <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>, <em>Weight</em> Reducing <em>Diet</em>, <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Diet</em> Plans |", "snippet": "For more information on <em>diet</em>, nutrition, health, <em>weight</em> loss or fitness contact DesiDieter Health and <em>Diet</em> Experts.

Otherwise, you can definitely lose weight running. It is an efficient form of exercise. When I started my health kick about a year ago, I started by power walking on the tread mill and doing some pilates core work and push ups. When the weather turned nice, I started walking and then jogging. I would try to do intervals - starting with 1 min of jogging followed by 2 min of walking, but working my way up to sprinting and jogging intervals. Just doing this five days a week with my pilates and push ups helped me lose 25 pounds (I started at 150 pounds) and gave me great definition in my core and arms/shoulders. I was confident in a bikini for the the first time in a long time! Unfortunately, I started having hip pain and found out that I have hip dysplasia. Dr. advised me to switch to the elliptical, but I don't enjoy working out inside on a machine nearly so much. SO, yes you can burn calories, lose weight and get in great shape running! Whether you will be comfortable running on a regular basis with joint issues is another question. You will just have to try it!\nHAWTLIKEME\nPosts: 680\n2/17/11 2:25 P\nFirst let me say that I am by no means a fitness expert. I know only of what I speak through personal experience. That said, good for you that with your joint pain, you're finding ways to be fit!!\nMy experience with running (as a new runner) was that I DID actually build alot of muscle, so it must be strength training of some kind as well as great cardio. I was initially disappointed in the results on the scale though b/c, I was told, I was using alot more body fluids, water and blood to build the muscles, therefore the pounds did not come rushing off as I had hoped and thought they would. Eventually, though it was the Couch 25K program that kept me consistently losing and once I stopped running, my weight loss stalled.\nI now use the elliptical on really cold days when I don't want to get out there and I find that it is great cardio especially when I do intervals and it is a great way to torch calories for sure.\nSome other strength training that you could do would be for your core such as planks, push ups, crunches, bicycle etc. Sparkpeople fitness tracker has lots of demos of lots of different ST workouts. You can customize or use a pre-existing one.\nGood luck and above all else, have fun!!\nAMBERMARIE715\nPosts: 211\n2/17/11 1:56 P\nhello everyone.

And every pound you lose is one step closer to a slimmer, healthier you.\nWhatever your reason for wanting to shed excessive pounds, the benefits that come from maintaining a healthy weight cannot be over-emphasized. Disproportionate body weight contributes to a host of difficulties ranging from embarrassment and discomfort to illness and premature death that can be avoided by knowing the food-and-weight-loss facts and putting that knowledge into action.\nFor some, losing a little weight is a matter of vanity. For others it's truly a matter of life and death. Studies show that people who are 40% over what is considered \"normal weight\" based on criteria such as height, age and sex are twice as likely to die prematurely as a person of healthy weight.\nResults from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate an estimated 66 percent of adults in the United States are overweight or obese, a ten percent increase over the 1988-1994 study. These extensive studies suggest that overall weight-gain is on the increase.\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics' Health, United States, 2006, two-thirds of American adults are overweight and one-third are obese.\nWith the increasing number of tax-paying American lives at stake, the White House has launched an initiative to decrease these statistics to less than ten percent by the year 2010. We applaud the goal, but ask how they plan to accomplish it? Because even as you read these words, obesity is wreaking havok across America today. And it's taking a heavy toll:\nMen who are obese are more likely than non-obese men to develop cancer of the colon, rectum, or prostate. Women who are obese are more likely than non-obese women to develop cancer of the gall bladder, uterus, cervix, or ovaries. Obesity for either sex has also been linked to esophageal and other forms of cancer.\nThe problem with obesity is not just cosmetic - it is chronic - and besides cancer, obesity leads to a number of disabilities, illnesses and diseases.\nCheck out these simple facts:\nWaist Measurements\nThe simple test of measuring one's waist can reveal your chances of being a candidate for a myriad of diseases. For example, the tape measure can indicate the likelihood of a person becoming a Type II Diabetic:\nWomen = 35\" or more\nMen = 40\" or more\nAll you have to do is change your waist measurement (the horizontal area centered at the belly button) to less than 35\" for women and 40\" for men to dramatically improve your chances of avoiding the pitfalls that come from Type II Diabetes.\nLosing Only Ten Pounds Can Help!\nIf you only lose ten pounds of excessive weight, you will cut the chances of contracting cancer by 20-to-30 percent!\nLosing 10-to-20 Pounds!\nIf you lose 10-to-20 pounds of excessive weight, your chances of avoiding Diabetes altogether increase dramatically. Shedding 10-20 pounds also reduces your risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease. Lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol levels can work miracles.\nOne Pound Equals Four Pounds!\nFor every pound that you lose, you reduce the effective weight of four pounds of impact on your knees.

Even if you think you're being very good with your diet, it's easy to underestimate how many calories you're actually eating.\nResearch has found that most of us underestimate how much we're eating, especially when we eat out. One research paper published in JAMA mentioned a study in which 99% of over 190 adults underestimated calories in high-caloric food. For example, when assessing fettuccine alfredo or chicken fajitas, the subjects often underestimated calories by 463 to 956, a huge difference and one that could easily sabotage your weight loss goals .\nCareful scrutiny of your diet is the only way to know what you're really eating:\nDetermine how many calories you need - You can use The Food Guide Pyramid tools or an online calculator to determine how many calories you need.\nKeep a food diary - Use a printed form or an online tracking program, such as Calorie Count or FitWatch . Keep this diary every day for at least a week, being as specific as possible: Measure your portions , read food labels or access nutritional information if you're eating out.\nAnalyze your diet - Online tracking websites will often give you an overview of how many calories you're eating as well as a breakdown of different nutrients. You can also turn an objective eye to your overall eating habits and look for ways to cut calories . Could you eat out less? Find healthier substitutes for some of your staple foods like yogurt, bread, cheese and chips? Find new, low-calorie recipes ? You might even consider working with a registered dietician who can make more specific recommendations.\nKeep in mind that you may have to continue keeping a food diary every day to stay on track. Successful weight losers regularly monitor both their eating habits and weight to avoid gaining weight. It may seem like a hassle but, if you really want to lose weight , it's a must.\n"}, {"score": 1698.5973, "uuid": "84b05e10-f3fd-5c07-b1a1-1ef2584e3df4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-17-13816", "target_hostname": "allfreedietplans.com", "target_uri": "http://allfreedietplans.com/how-to-lose-20-pounds/", "page_rank": 1.4537955e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "How <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> 20 Pounds | Free <em>Diet</em> Plans &amp; Free <em>Diet</em> Programs &amp; <em>Weight</em> Loss", "snippet": "Don\u2019t forget that natural supplements are <em>best</em>.

This is where your weight goes up, down, up, down. Yes, I\u2019m sure you know how to lose 20 pounds, but can you keep them off?\nLosing 20 lbs is easy, but maintaining your ideal weight can be next to impossible for most people. So, how do you lose 20 pounds and keep them off?\nFad Diets Don\u2019t Work\nThere are possibly hundreds or even thousands of diets out there, but only a few really work. Some diets allow you to eat only one type of food. Other diets tell you to cut out carbohydrates, red meat or fats while letting you eat almost anything else.\nThese fad diets work for a while but before long the pounds you lost will be back with a vengeance. Oftentimes you gain more than you lost. These diets don\u2019t work in the long term because they\u2019re fads. And we know that fads never last.\nHow To Lose 20 Pounds\nChange your Lifestyle\nIf you want long-term results, you must change your lifestyle. You can start with a lifestyle change to lose 20 lbs in 3 months. That\u2019s a sensible weight loss plan that is easy for anyone to do.\nYour goal each month is to lose 6 to 7 pounds. That\u2019s 1 to 2 lbs per week. Women should consume at least 1,200 calories daily. Men need 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day. Your diet should provide enough calories and nutrients to function well and lose weight without sacrificing your overall health. You also need cardio and strength training exercises.\nChanging your lifestyle is a serious commitment but it is something you must do if you want to maintain a healthy and slim body. The following lifestyle changes will boost your metabolism while providing your body the energy it needs:\nEat frequently. This may seem counterintuitive but it really works. Having a small meal every four hours will increase your metabolism. Eat 4 to 6 meals a day, with a ratio of 60% carbohydrates, 30% proteins and 10% fats. And yes, your body needs fats for certain metabolic functions.\nExercise regularly. For best results, you need both aerobic and resistance exercises. Cardio exercise burns fat while resistance training builds muscle mass and increases your basal metabolism. You\u2019ll find it easier to lose 20 pounds.\nDrink plenty of water. Your body must be properly hydrated to function well. Drink at least 10 glasses of water a day. It\u2019s good for your health and will give your skin a healthy glow.\nGet enough rest. You need rest and sleep for your body to refresh and rebuild itself.\nTake supplements. You may have to take supplements to give your body the right nutrients that it needs. In addition to multivitamins, it may be a good idea to take detox formulas as well. Don\u2019t forget that natural supplements are best.\nLifestyle changes are necessary if you want to lose 20 pounds and maintain your ideal weight. It\u2019s the healthy and smart way to shed unwanted pounds and keep them off. Diets may help you lose weight but it takes a lifestyle change to have a healthier body.\n"}, {"score": 1696.0964, "uuid": "ab27c396-4016-51a5-a84b-247662a8de1d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1213wb-06-16363", "target_hostname": "www.desidieter.com", "target_uri": "http://www.desidieter.com/community/heart-health-and-cholesterol/5-foods-that-can-trigger-a-stroke.html", "page_rank": 1.2017993e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "<em>Diet</em> Plans, <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>, <em>Weight</em> Reducing <em>Diet</em>, <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Diet</em> Plans |", "snippet": "Although replacing sugary drinks with <em>diet</em> soda seems like a smart solution for keeping <em>weight</em> down -- a heart-healthy goal -- it turns out <em>diet</em> soda is likely a major bad guy when it comes <em>to</em> stroke.

The diet includes:\nBreakfast - Unlimited coffee or tea without sugar\nLunch and Dinner\n100 grams of meat such as veal, beef or chicken breast\nOne type of vegetable\nOne grissino or Melba toast\nAn apple, a handful of strawberries or one half of a grapefruit\nDays 24-26 - Dieters eat the same foods as with days 3-23, but they do not take the HCG diet drops\nHow HCG Drops and a Low Calorie Diet Work\nIn order to understand how the HCG diet works, you need to learn about HCG.\u00a0 HCG, or Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, is a hormone that is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. The hormone works to ensure the fetus gets ample food.\u00a0 In order to do this, it tells the brain to use stored fat as fuel. This fuel goes to the woman, while the food she ingests goes to the fetus.\u00a0 When a person who is not pregnant takes HCG, the body still burns the excess fat, which means the individual can live on far fewer calories than normal.\u00a0 Also, since the body is still getting its required amount of fuel, the dieter does not feel fatigued.\u00a0 He or she still has enough energy to go about a daily routine, which makes it easier to stay on track and lose weight.\nHCG Diet Drop Expectations\nNow that you understand how the HCG hormone can help you lose weight, you probably want to know what type of expectations you should have.\u00a0 According to HCG diet drop retailers, users can expect to shed approximately 40 pounds a month.\u00a0 Of course, results will vary based on the amount of excess weight someone carries.\nIt is also important to note that people must follow the 500-calorie diet in order to lose the weight. Simply using the HCG diet drops is not enough.\u00a0 The drops must work with the 500-calorie diet in order to achieve optimal results.\nIf traditional diets have not been able to get rid of your excess fat, you might want to try Dr. Simeons\u2019 HCG diet drops. The drops can give you an edge as you try to eliminate abnormal fat from your body.\nWhile we encourage everyone to exercise properly on any diet, the nature of the hcg diet is very extreme and it is possible to lose weight, and a lot of it, without exercising.\u00a0 As with any diet or fitness regimen, check with your doctor prior to beginning this program.\n"}, {"score": 1663.668, "uuid": "fae41e7c-5cc3-53d4-9663-c22c1fd84eb8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0304wb-71-23038", "target_hostname": "www.weightloss-hq.biz", "target_uri": "http://www.weightloss-hq.biz/weight-loss-reviews/the-master-cleanser-to-lose-weight-fast.html", "page_rank": 1.183802e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>The</em> Master Cleanser <em>To</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast", "snippet": "Click here <em>to</em> follow us on twitter and our facebook fan page. * Probiotics for <em>Weight</em> Loss : Does Probiotics help you <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>?", "explanation": null, "document": "Share\nThe Master Cleanser diet is a diet that detoxifies and cleanses your body while it stimulates the healthy growth of tissue.\u00a0 This is a great diet for becoming healthier, losing weight, and in some cases it may act as a treatment for certain health conditions.\u00a0 Cleansing your body with the Master Cleanser will definitely change your life!\nOverview\nThe Master Cleanser detox consists of a drink that is made from lemon or lime juice, maple syrup, red cayenne pepper, and warm water that is taken 8 \u2013 12 times a day.\u00a0 Also included in the regimen is an herbal laxative tea taken two times every day, and you aren't suppose to eat anything either.\u00a0 The Master Cleanser lemonade diet is used over a period of ten days, but there are also instances where you can use it for 40 or more, depending on your body's physical condition.\u00a0 It is recommended that you read Stanley Burroughs's The Master Cleanser before starting this diet. Recommended Reading: Lose 10 pounds in three days .\nYou should follow us on twitter .\nWhat This Diet Cleanses\nThe Master Cleanser aids in the purification of the liver by dissolving and eliminating congestion and toxins that have developed throughout your body.\u00a0 It also cleanses the digestive system and kidneys; purifies the cells and glands; and eliminates any hardened material and unusable waste in your muscles and joints.\nThe purpose of all of this is to aid in building a healthy blood stream; relieving irritation and pressure on your blood vessels, arteries, and nerves; as well as losing weight .\u00a0 When you rid your body of all the extra toxins, you are ridding your body of extra weight at the same time, and this will make you feel healthier overall.\nThe Master Cleanser Recipe\nCombine all of the following ingredients with 8 \u2013 10 ounces of warm purified water:\n2 tablespoons of lemon or lime juice (half lemon may be substituted)\n1 or 2 tablespoons of pure grade B maple syrup\none-tenth teaspoon of red cayenne pepper or to your taste\nNote:\u00a0 It is also okay to double the Master Cleanser ingredients to fill a thermos bottle to drink throughout the day.\nThe Master Cleanser Ingredients\nLemon juice that is freshly squeezed is a powerful cleanser and is high in vitamins as well.\u00a0 Lemons are also the only vegetable or fruit that contains anionic and cationic minerals.\u00a0 This fruit aids in loosening and breaking up mucus that is in your body.\u00a0 This mucus is one of the defenses of your body that protects itself from irritations.\u00a0 However, when there it too much of it, it will settle in one area and disease is a natural outcome of that.\u00a0 Lemons are also used in color therapy, because the color stimulates your body to beginning the cleansing process.\nThe red cayenne pepper is another main ingredient in the Master Cleanser recipe that breaks up the mucus, as well as acts like a cleanser for the circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems.\u00a0 This ingredient is used by herbalists for the treatment of many problems and for enhancing the effectiveness of various herbs .\nThe pure grade B maple syrup provides an unprocessed sugar that gives you energy.\u00a0 This unprocessed sugar still consists of many original nutrients, which include calcium, manganese, potassium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, copper, chlorine, and iron.\u00a0 Pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, and the vitamins A,C, B1, B2, and B6 are also present in the maple syrup. With the absence of these vitamins and minerals in processed sugars, the digestive system will derive them from your body so that it can metabolize the sugar.\u00a0 In the long run, if you eat too many processed foods, one of the first organs that is affected is the pancreas.\u00a0 This will often result in diabetes and, eventually, more deterioration of that organ.\nOther Recommended Drinks\nSince the Master Cleanser lemonade lacks fiber, it is recommended that you take an herbal laxative two times a day.\u00a0 This is going to help to get rid of the waste while it is being shed from the wall of your colon.\u00a0 Otherwise, this waste will stay in your body, making your tired and leading to other problems.\u00a0 The only other way to do this is by eating a diet that is high in fiber, but because you are not supposed to eat while using this regimen, the herbal laxative is the best alternative.\nIt is also recommended that you alternate the Master Cleanser diet recipe with some other rejuvenating drink two times a day in order to promote the process of healing and enhance your levels of energy.\u00a0 These can be taken mid-morning and -afternoon.\nThe Experience\nMany dieters who use the Master Cleanser detox will feel a beneficial and dramatic change in their body in only a short period of time.\u00a0 These benefits are better sleeping patterns, more energy, relieved pains, less tension, and thinking clearer.\u00a0 There are, however, a few discomforts that occur during the first 2 to 4 days, which include headaches, fatigue, body aches, and nausea in rare cases.\nWhat to Expect\nYour appetite and metabolism will become more normal, comfortably adjusting your body to the ideal weight for your natural size.\nYour levels of hormones will be restored in order for all of your body's cells to be charged with feel good and youth giving hormones.\nYou will naturally shift away from habits that are unhealthy without needing willpower.\nThe pounds of waste that have built up during your life will vanish in only 10 days while you detox and cleanse your whole body.\nAll of this is only the beginning of the benefits that you will receive from using the Master Cleanser.\n"}, {"score": 1687.4641, "uuid": "82579bff-864c-590a-b7e2-dd0b55d8bcc5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1907wb-99-25806", "target_hostname": "www.bestabworkouts.net", "target_uri": "http://www.bestabworkouts.net/weight-loss/the-diet-solution-review/", "page_rank": 1.2546169e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>The</em> <em>Diet</em> Solution Review \u2013 <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> And Eat <em>What</em> You Want?", "snippet": "Isabel also has personal experience struggling with <em>weight</em> loss and has dealt with severe diabetes within her family.

To see for yourself, check out The Diet Solution web page, here.\nBefore delving into the program, I\u2019d like to introduce the expert who developed it, De Los Rios, Isabel. You can see her picture here.\nA nutrition and exercise specialist, Isabel has 10 years of experience guiding people as they achieve their personal weight loss goals and overcome medical conditions like high cholesterol and diabetes.\nHer education is in nutrition and exercise psychology.\nIsabel also has personal experience struggling with weight loss and has dealt with severe diabetes within her family.\nThis is what drove her to find the best solutions for weight loss and health.\nYears Of Research And Real Life Success Stories\nIt took her 15 years of research and studying to come up with the diet solution.\nI have researched Isabel concerning her background and training, and found it quite remarkable. Other health \u201cexperts\u201d merely rehash main-stream ideas on dieting, and do not even approach her level of expertise.\nIsabel gets to the bottom of the issues, and presents the truth to her readers, after taking the time to thoroughly research her topic.\nIsabel has her own private facility in which she works personally with clients, overseeing their weight loss programs.\nTo this date she has worked with hundreds of clients to successfully lose weight and lead a healthier life.\nThe real life experience she has gained working with real clients, gave her experience applying the knowledge she gained through journal articles, books and other weight loss professionals.\nThe proof of her ability lies in the success of her clients and her own results as you can see here:\nBased On Solid Principles Not Fads\nIsabel\u2019s weight loss principles are not extreme, but they are sound. It is clear why they are effective when mainstream programs fail. Her principles are unique.\nThey do not repeat the same nutrition fads discussed and most other weight loss books and programs available.\nSo How Does It Work?\nThe first question you may have is \u201cWhat is The Diet Solution Program?\u201d\nIsabel firmly believes that it is the strongest instruction book for nutrition and weight loss available on the market today because of its comprehensive and detailed content.\nThe manual not only teaches the basic principles necessary to achieve your personal ideal weight, it also provides plans for meals, recipes and grocery lists, to help you along the way.\nThe program focuses on making healthy eating a lifestyle, not an exercise in enduring hunger. Those who have attempted to lose weight know that in order to stick with it, the program must become a lifestyle.\nCreate A Healthy Life Style Of Your Own\nThis is the best thing about The Diet Solution; it shows you how to develop your own new healthy lifestyle without having to stick to a grueling eating schedule.\nIsabel clearly explains how to combine delicious foods for optimum health sustained weight loss.\nWeight loss is the main goal of the program, but an excellent side effect enjoyed by all participants is improved energy and vitality.\nFollowing the program results in decreased in blood sugar levels, reduced cholesterol levels, heightened energy, improved digestive comfort and clearer skin.\nThese are just several of the benefits many experience while on the program.\nI have personally used Isabel\u2019s program and I highly recommend it to others who have struggled with losing weight including a work friend who is following it right now.\nI've managed to not only lose weight but keep putting on muscle from my workouts in the gym, something a lot of people say can't be done.\nWhy This System Appealed To Me\n1 - Something I Could Stick With\nI wanted to find a plan to help me lose weight but also get healthy. I did not want to feel like I was starving or be limited to only tasteless foods.\nDiet likes this just never work, you end up giving up on them after a while and go right back to eating un healthy again, and in the worse case gaining back even more weight.\nThis program provided exactly what I was looking for. It showed me how to lose weight and maintain my ideal weight in a healthy way while giving me enough energy to keep my workout plan.\n2 - Save Me Time\nLike all good things in life, this program does require some effort on your part in order to succeed. The good news is, Isabel has already done much of the hard work for you.\nIt's tough to find the time to even write down a good meal plan for yourself, I know I always procrastinate on mine.\u00a0 So it was great to see all the mean plans shes included, this saves a lot of time and gets you eating better right away.\n3 - Cuts Through Mis-Information\nI also like how she tackles some common weight loss myths, which is why I started this site in the first place.\nFor instance here's a video she did on why eating fat doesn't necessarily make you fat, something most people would never think about:\nWhy Eating Fat Doesn't Always Make You Fat\n"}, {"score": 1686.5586, "uuid": "94317eba-ae32-5edc-8128-641fe81def3c", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0403wb-61-16056", "target_hostname": "nutiva.com", "target_uri": "http://nutiva.com/articles/tag/lose-weight/", "page_rank": 1.1724983e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>lose</em> <em>weight</em>", "snippet": "Nutiva&#x27;s approach preserves as much of <em>the</em> oil&#x27;s natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you <em>the</em> <em>best</em> <em>results</em> for any use.

The body likes slow changes in terms of food and exercise.\nFor example, someone who hasn't exercised for years shouldn't rush into running miles a day or pounding the treadmill. Not only will the struggle to do so leave you feeling disheartened and demotivated, you're also far more likely to injure yourself and set your fitness levels back further.\nThe same goes for people who suddenly start starving themselves. Diets that severely restrict calories or the types of food 'allowed' can lead you to be deficient in the nutrients and vitamins that your body needs.\nSo, if you need to lose weight, what should you do?\nEnergy needs and weight loss\nYour body uses food for energy. It stores any excess energy as fat. This means if you eat more food than your body needs for daily activities and cell maintenance, you'll gain weight.\nTo lose weight, you need to get your body to use up these stores of fat. The most effective way to do this is to:\nreduce the amount of calories you eat\nincrease your levels of activity.\nThis is why experts talk about weight loss in terms of diet and exercise.\nIntroduce changes gradually\nSmall changes can make a big difference. One extra biscuit a week can lead you to gain 5lb a year \u2013 cut that biscuit out of your diet and you'll lose the same amount.\nYou're also more likely to stick to, say, swapping full-fat milk for semi-skimmed or making time for breakfast each morning than a diet that sets rules for all foods.\nYou should think of weight loss in terms of permanently changing your eating habits. While weight-loss goals are usually set in term of weeks, the end game is to sustain these changes over months and years, ie lifestyle change for life.\nIncrease your activity levels\nSomeone who increases the amount they exercise, but maintains the same diet and calorie intake, will almost certainly lose weight.\nNo matter if you hate gyms \u2013 even light exercise, such as a short 20 minute walk, will be beneficial if done most days of the week.\nEvery single time you exercise more than usual, you burn calories and fat.\nThere are lots of ways to increase the amount of activity you do. Team sports, racket sports, aerobics classes, running , walking , swimming and cycling will all improve your fitness levels.\nFind something you enjoy that's easy for you to do in terms of location and cost. You're then more likely to build it into your routine and continue to exercise, despite inevitably missing the odd session through holidays, family commitments, etc.\nGet out and about at the weekend. Leave your car on the drive and walk to the shops. Try to incorporate longer walks into outings to the park, coast or countryside and take a picnic, so you're in control of what you are going to eat that day.\nEvery extra step you take helps. Always use the stairs instead of the lift, or get off the bus a stop before the usual one and walk the rest of the way.\nUse commercial breaks between TV-programmes to stand up and do exercise, or consider using an exercise bicycle in the living room while watching your favourite programme.\nReduce your calorie intake\nDoctors use BMI to assess weight.\nA BMI of 18.5 to 25 is healthy.\nIf you have a BMI of more than 25, you're overweight.\nOver 30 is obese.\nOver 40 is morbidly obese.\nTo calculate your BMI, you'll need to know your weight in kilos and your height in metres, then follow the example below.\n1. Multiply your height by itself, eg 1.7x1.7= 2.89.\n2. Divide your weight (eg 80kg) by this figure.\n3. 80 \u00f7 2.89= 27.7.\n27.7 is the BMI.\nIf you're overweight, you can't continue with your current eating habits if you really want to lose weight.\nIt's not possible to reduce body fat while eating lots of food, cakes and sweets. This doesn't mean you can never have any treats, but you need to learn how to limit these foods to small quantities \u2013 say, for special occasions.\nIn terms of weight-loss, you can get your body to use up existing stores of fat by eating less and making healthier choices.\nThis doesn't mean crash diet (anything less than 1500 calories), which usually ends up with you either getting weaker or giving up in desperation. Quick-fix diets can lead to a yo-yoing effect of drastic weight loss followed by weight gain, resulting in a vicious cycle.\nThere are no shortcuts to losing weight in a healthy and reasonable way.\nEating 300 to 500 calories less per day should lead to a loss of between one and two pounds per week. This is a realistic target. It may seem slow, but it would add up to a weight loss of more than three stone in a year.\nFat contains the most amount of calories out of all the food types ( protein , carbohydrates ), so a good way to achieve this is to cut down on fatty foods and eat more wholegrain bread, fruit and vegetables.\nBelow are ways to reduce calorie intake without having to alter your diet significantly.\nReplace fizzy drinks and fruit cordials with water .\nSwap whole milk for semi-skimmed, or semi-skimmed for skimmed.\nEat less lunch than usual. For example, make your own sandwich and limit the use of margarine or butter and full-fat mayonnaise (store-bought sandwiches often contain both).\nStop taking sugar in tea and coffee.\nHave smaller portions of the food you enjoy.\nAvoid having a second helping at dinner.\nCut out unhealthy treats \u2013 such as confectionary, sugary biscuits and crisps between meals.\nCut down on alcohol intake.\nAll these things will influence your health in a positive way.\nFinally, don't be tempted to skip breakfast \u2013 or any meal to lose weight. While skipping a meal will reduce your calorie intake for that hour, it will leave you much hungrier later on.\nNot only are you likely to overeat to compensate, but you'll often make bad choices to fill the gap: a cereal bar is not as healthy as a bowl of cereal or as filling, leading you to 'need' something extra for lunch.\nIrregular eating habits also disrupt your body's metabolism, which makes it harder to lose weight in the first place.\nWrite down your plan\nFood diary\nIf you're not sure what's wrong with your diet, try keeping a daily diary of everything you eat and drink.\nYou can use a notebook or an online diary .\nAt the end of the week, review your entries for problem areas.\nLook out for processed foods, alcohol, fast food, roasts, creamy sauces and fried foods.\nIf your diet seems largely healthy, look at portion sizes.\nIf you're not sure what's meant by 'healthy diet', read our series on nutrition .\nOnce you've decided on what changes you're going to make, write them down. For example:\nWeek 1\nExercise : one 20 minute walk every lunch hour.\nAlcohol: none in the week, two small glasses of wine on Friday, Saturday, Sunday.\nFood: no chocolate or biscuits in the week, choose healthy snacks such as fruit, trim all fat from meat, eat no fried or fast food.\nMy weight loss plan: Week: _____ My weight: _____\nTargets\n"}, {"score": 1674.2675, "uuid": "50efe23c-b3ba-5407-a910-d9950f3444d4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0903wb-09-01847", "target_hostname": "www.natural-weight-loss-myths-revealed.com", "target_uri": "http://www.natural-weight-loss-myths-revealed.com/drink-water-to-lose-weight.html", "page_rank": 3.1441614e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Drink Water <em>to</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>", "snippet": "(<em>The</em> Smaller <em>The</em> Percentage, <em>The</em> More Fat You Have...)&quot; &quot;This Body-Fat-Water-Scale Shows Your Relationship Between Fat and Water...&quot; &quot;A Juice <em>Diet</em> -- <em>The</em> <em>Best</em> Way <em>To</em> Drink Water <em>To</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>...&quot; Your story will appear on a Web page exactly <em>the</em> way you enter it here.", "explanation": null, "document": "Return from \"Drink Water To Lose Weight\" to \"Natural Weight Loss Home Page\"\nPay It Forward!\nWill you help a friend or loved one by sharing this information with them?

After 30 days I lost 11 LBS and was able to get back into my favorite pair of jeans. After 60 days I lost a total of 16 LBS. After 120 days, the weight is still off, my skin looks much better, and I actually have energy at 2pm in the afternoon! Lol\nPeople always ask me what\u2019s different and it really boils down to the education that I received from Yegyan. He put facts behind his food & nutrient recommendations so that I began to WANT to eat healthier foods instead of just forcing myself.\nIt\u2019s been a lifestyle change and I couldn\u2019t be happier to have officially said goodbye to the old (overweight) Nick.\nYegyan, thank you for all of your hard work and for our new friendship.\nNick Unsworth\nI hired Yegyan to help me with general health and energy.

Liberty, Tacoma, WA\nWhen I first started changing my diet a week ago, I couldn't believe it. I definitely started to feel the difference.\nMy mind was clearer. It felt like a fog was lifted. My energy was increased.\nI wasn't dragging myself around to do things. I had a lot more energy.\nEven my hair improved. It wasn't as dry as it was before I changed the way I was eating. It has a lot more body and not as frizzy and it was. I was using a special conditioner to make it less dry and frizzy. I don't have to use that anymore.\nMy skin is different also. I have been told so many times by a lot of people that I look younger. I even notice it myself. I don't look so worn out anymore. My skin has a different look to it. It seems like my wrinkles are not as pronounced. The rest of my body isn't as dry as it was, I don't use half of the lotions I did before.\nI have lost ten pounds and 1 inch of my thighs and hips. My life is changing for the better. I haven't even started to exercise yet. But I don't feel that it will be as hard as it would have been if I didn't change my diet. I'll update you with my results.\nThank you so much for all of your help and the knowledge that you are giving me. What a difference a diet can make in your life.\nI think once you get the knowledge on how food affects your body, the easier it is to change the way you eat. Knowledge it half the battle.\nSo many people eat the wrong way because they have been given bad information. There are a lot of people on diets that are really not eating the right way or eating the right things. They seem to gain the weight right back the minute they stop the diet. They feel hungry all of the time and get tempted constantly by the things they can't eat.\nWell I don't feel deprived. I don't feel hungry and I haven't been tempted by anything, which is unusual for me.\nNobody ate more sugar and sweets than I did. I was always putting a cookie in my mouth. Eating chocolate or cake any chance I got. I thought it gave me more energy. I don't need that anymore. I never thought I would not want any sweets, but I don't. I feel satisfied, which is a great feeling.\nFeb 2 2009\nFollow up \u2026.\nYe Gyan, I am now down to 128lbs from 156lbs!! You're great!! I can now wear anything I want!!

THIS IS FUN\nIf people dont belive it they can email me.\nE. Powell, WA\nAt 48 years old, I had spent the better part of 25 years running, working out, eating healthy food, and taking care of my body. Being somewhat of an exercise junkie, I was certain I had all the answers.\nI was frustrated that my body was stuck in a state of \u201cI\u2019m not budging, just try and make me.\u201d I can honestly say that I thought I knew exactly what I was supposed to be doing for myself and for my health, however, I was working in vain. What I wanted was completely eluding me.\nI thought that at 48 I finally had the time, the space and the energy to have the body that I wanted, and dammit, I was going to get it.\nI tried to tweak my diet and exercise routines in every way I could think of, but nothing was working.\nAlthough I was keeping up a rigorous routine of daily exercising and relatively (at least that is what I thought) healthy eating, nothing was changing.\nIn addition to not feeling as fit as I should have been for how hard I was working, I literally had zero energy\nYegyan\u2019s approach to diet, exercise and overall health and well-being are unlike anyone else\u2019s. I have read countless books on diet and exercise. I have had personal trainers and diet coaches.\nHowever, I have never felt as good or, in my opinion, looked as good as I feel and look today after following Yegyan\u2019s advice and approach to repairing the body by correcting hormonal imbalances through nutrition and proper exercise.\nI have lost those stubborn 6 pounds, 8% body fat and 12 inches overall. I am overwhelmed with excitement, not just because I look so much better, but more importantly, because I actually FEEL so much better. I feel more alive, more alert, more energetic, more rested, and healthier than ever.\nL. Quintanilla, Aliso Viejo, CA\nI listened to what you had to say about exercising and now can understand what I am doing wrong.\nI have lost inches .... Thank you for helping me to understand that.\nChuckey Tacoma,WA\nEVERYBODY was asking me what am i doing!!! and that i lost a lot of weight YAY!!!!!\ntoday , my in laws came over for lunch .... it\u2019s amazing how i could finally control my cravings that easy. THANK YOU YEGYAAAAAAAAAAAN!!\nH. Abdul Rhiyad, Saudi Arabia\nBefore I met Yegyan, I had been working out at the gym, but struggled to lose 10 pounds over a period of many months.\nWhen Yegyan and I talked about that, he explained that my heart rate should not go over 126 while working out in order to be burning fat. I had had no idea, so prior to that I had been working as hard as I could push it, out to 135 and even 140 and believing I was doing the best thing possible to lose weight in a healthy manner.\nAs soon as I began to keep my heart rate under 126 and increase the length of workouts as he had also suggested, the next 10 pounds came off much more quickly, and I was a believer!\nThank you Yegyan, for helping me to restore myself to fitness.\u201d\nMelody Haines\nThank you so much for your consults and training. I read your book and though I was doing everything correct but the weight loss stopped even though other other symptoms like energy, sleep, flexibility relaxation were still improving.\nAfter doing the coaching with you for 4 months I realized that there is more to this than meets the eye. You were able to spot many things that were giving me trouble. Better yet, you told me in advance what I would be running into. Not generally, but specifically me. From your experience you were able to tell me I would have a hard time with something and sure enough it was a brick wall.\nThen you walked me through it every single day for three weeks straight.\nThere is no way you can put everything in a book.\nI have reached my goal and know I have given myself the greatest gift - long-term health and knowledge.\nPlease put this email on your site!\nL.Sanders\n"}, {"score": 1672.6158, "uuid": "6e9899aa-de15-5e5c-8828-0537f4eea26f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-31-14241", "target_hostname": "www.mohrresults.com", "target_uri": "http://www.mohrresults.com/tag/goal-setting/", "page_rank": 1.1850118e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "Goal Setting | <em>Weight</em> Loss Experts | <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Permanently | Mohr <em>Results</em>", "snippet": "Loss Experts | <em>Weight</em> Loss Coaches | <em>Best</em> <em>Weight</em> Loss Resource Copyright 2009 Mohr <em>Results</em>, Inc.", "explanation": null, "document": "8 Reasons Why You Keep Falling Off the Diet Wagon\nI was talking to a friend of mine the other night, Tom Venuto, fellow \"New Jersian\" \u2026 and, no, Snookie did not come up anywhere in our conversation.\u00a0 Tom is the author of the bestselling book \"The Body Fat Solution\" (that you can find in any major book store) and many #1 ebooks over the years as well.\u00a0 Most notably, Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle.\nWhile talking, of course the conversation went to training and nutrition, and Tom mentioned he had a great article to share, so today we wanted to give him the floor (or the blog) rather than reinvent the wheel.\n____________________________\n8 Reasons Why You Keep Falling Off the Diet Wagon\nBy: Tom Venuto\nClearly, we have an obesity problem in America and many other countries across our planet. Yet, I propose that we do not have a weight loss problem today. In case you\u2019re confused at this apparent contradiction, consider these statistics:\nAccording to a study from Oxford University published in the International Journal of Obesity, within 3 to 5 years, about 80 percent of all \u2018weight losers\u2019 have regained the lost weight, and often gained back a little extra.\nAccording to research by the National Weight Control Registry, that relapse rate may be as high as 95 percent.\nFor comparison, relapse rates for drug, alcohol and tobacco dependency have been reported in the range of 50-90%.\nThis means that lots and lots of people have \u201csuccessfully\u201d lost weight. But not many have kept it off. Therefore, we don\u2019t have a weight loss problem, we have a weight-relapse problem; we have a \u201cnot sticking with it\u201d problem. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\nIn fact, the fall and subsequent weight-regain usually doesn\u2019t take years. Many people have abandoned their new year\u2019s resolutions within weeks. By the time the Super Bowl party rolls around, their diet is history!\nIf this is true, then shouldn\u2019t we put more of our attention onto figuring out why you haven\u2019t been sticking with your program, and what you should do about it?\nI put together this new list (below) of the top 8 reasons why you fall off the wagon.\nRather than worrying about the minutiae of your diet plan, like whether you should be on low carb or high carb, Mediterranean or Okinawan, vegetarian or meat eater, I propose that if you simply focus on these 8 issues, you\u2019ll start getting more lasting results.\nHow? By being able to stick with whichever plan you decided was best for you! After all, even if you have the best nutrition program in the world \u2013 on paper \u2013 it doesn\u2019t do you much good if you can\u2019t stick with it in practice!\nTHE 8 REASONS\n1. No focus: you didn\u2019t set goals, you didn\u2019t put your goals in writing, and/or you didn\u2019t stay focused on your goals daily (by reading them, affirming them, looking at a vision board, etc.)\n2. No priorities: you may have set a goal, but you didn\u2019t put it on or near the top of your priorities list. For example, your goal is six pack abs, but drinking beer and eating fast food on the weekend is higher on your priorities list than having a flat stomach.\n3. No support system: you tried to go at it alone; no buddy system, training partners, family, spouse, friends, mentors or coaches to turn to for information and emotional support when the going got tough.\n4. No Accountability: you didn\u2019t keep score for your own accountability \u2013 with a progress chart, weight record, measurements, food journal, training journal, and you didn\u2019t set up external accountability (ie, report to someone else or show your results to someone else)\n5. No patience: you were only thinking short term and had unrealistic expectations. You expected 10 pounds a week or 5 pounds a week or 3 pounds a week, so the first week you lost \u201conly\u201d 1 or 2 pounds or hit a plateau, you gave up.\n6. No planning: you winged it. You walked into the gym without having a workout in hand, on paper, you didn\u2019t plan your workouts into your weekly schedule; you didn\u2019t have a menu on paper, you didn\u2019t make time (so instead you made excuses, like \u201cI\u2019m too busy\u201d)\n7. No balance: your diet or training program was too extreme. You went the all or nothing, \u201cI want it now\u201d route instead of the moderate, slow-and-steady wins the race route.\n8. No personalization: your nutrition or training program was the wrong one for you. It might have worked for someone else, but it didn\u2019t suit your schedule, personality, lifestyle, disposition or body type.\nSo there you have it \u2013 8 reasons why most people fall off the wagon! Have you been making these mistakes? If so, the solutions are clear and simple: focus, prioritize, get support, be accountable, be patient, plan, balance and personalize.\nTrain hard and expect success,\nTom Venuto\nwww.BurnTheFat.com\n_____________________________\nTom has such a great approach to fat loss \u2014 down to earth, practical, and strategies that get REAL results!\nHe\u2019s actually letting you try his bestselling ebook, Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle , for just $4.95\nMake sure you check it out \u2014 pretty sweet deal for sure!\nEat to Win!!\nTeam Mohr\nPS: The trial offer won\u2019t be up for long \u2014 >>> Burn the Fat for just $4.95\nPPS: There\u2019s just a few weeks left until Beach Season *officially* starts >>> Look your best for beach season!\n"}, {"score": 1671.3994, "uuid": "f264de94-cec7-5bbc-8de7-4bfc2d7ae308", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0705wb-54-06967", "target_hostname": "www.weight-loss-center.net", "target_uri": "http://www.weight-loss-center.net/diet_programs.html", "page_rank": 1.8490423e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "<em>Weight</em> Loss Programs - <em>Best</em> <em>Diets</em> - <em>Weight</em> Loss Program Reviews", "snippet": "Barry Sears, is based around <em>the</em> principle of harnessing <em>the</em> powerful, drug-like effects food has on your body. <em>Weight</em> Watchers is one of <em>the</em> <em>best</em> known <em>diets</em> around.

This is no surprise when we are surrounded by quick-fix, unhealthy diet programs. If you do a diet that\u2019s not healthy, it is almost guaranteed you will end up gaining all the pounds you lost and maybe even more.\nFad diets are the kind of regimens where you consume a restrictive diet or some wired combination of foods for a short period of time. The trend goes like this, you start the fad diet, lose some pounds, you get happy, weeks later you gain the pounds back on, you get depressed and end up heavier. Sound familiar?\nFinding the Right Weight Loss Program for You\nFinding the right weight loss program for you may not be as simple as just picking a diet and finding success. Many dieters find that they have to try at least 3 different diet programs before they find the one the fits their personal tastes and lifestyle. So don't get discouraged if you try one diet and find it is not for you. Instead, do some more research and try again.\nTo help you along the way, Weight Loss Center has a large number of diet program reviews available. The diets are separated into 5 categories based on how they approach dieting and exercise. These five weight loss program categories are:\nLifestyle Based Diets - These diet programs focus on making healthy changes to both diet and activity levels. In general, lifestyle based diets are the best choice for achieving long-term and sustainable weight loss.\nCalorie Based Diets - These programs are structured around controlling calorie consumption by either using calorie counting or strict, calorie-limited diets. Calorie based diets are particularly helpful for people who have not paid much attention to calories in the foods they eat, as you can learn a great deal of nutritional information.\nMeal Based Diets - There is a large range of meal based diets that can suit almost any personal taste or food preferences. These weight loss programs involve following custom meal plans, which can make it a simple choice for someone who just wants to follow a structured diet and not worry about making too many decisions about what to eat.\nSupplement Based Diets - These types of diets require you to take supplements during the weight loss program. These supplements are sold by the company who designed the diet and can be of some benefit or not. The supplements can also be expensive.\neDiets - eDieting is a growing trend online where people can register to become a member of a website that provides community, support, recipes, menu plans and much more. eDiets can be a good choice for dieters who are web savvy and like to be involved with online communities.\nStructured Diet Programs\nThere are also a number of structured diet programs you can look into that are not only set up to help you lose weight, but also combat a number of illnesses and ailments. You can find a large list of these diets in Weight Loss Center's Free Diet Plans .\nFor those of you who have the means and the time, weight loss spas may also be of interest to you. These programs are regimented and many have you living in the lap of luxury while you melt the pounds away.

Nutrition and diet specialists always tend to place their main emphasis on counting calories, or certain foods, or \u201cmagic\u201d nutrients that claim to help you lose weight.\nIn reality, the key to losing weight is to use a holistic approach that emphasizes the proper diet, the right amount of exercise and rest.\nWith that being said, here are my top 5 secrets that will help you to lose weight fast:\n1. Control Your Cortisol Levels\nIf there is one thing I would like for my readers to understand about weight loss, then it would have to be the effect that cortisol has on fat loss and muscle. The reason I feel that this is the #1 weight loss secret is because this is a subject that is seldom discussed.\nCortisol is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands in response to stress. When it is elevated, your body will do the complete opposite of what you would like it to do. Your body will actually store fat and eat muscle tissue at the same time (thus lowering your metabolism and preventing your ability to get in shape).\nSome of the top reasons your cortisol levels will rise are:\n1. An improper diet that does not have the right macronutrient ratios and that is too low in calories.\n2. Too much exercise (yep, you heard it right!)\n3. Emotional stress.\n4. Not getting enough sleep.\n5. Not being properly hydrated.\nIf that is not enough for you, when cortisol levels rise, it increases your chances of having high cholesterol, hardened arteries, heart disease and will even affect your immune system adversely.\nAlso, too much cortisol wreaks havoc in your body\u2019s ability to process insulin and carbohydrates. As a result, you will suffer from tons of cravings and will be more susceptible to storing carbohydrates as fat instead of using them for energy.\nTo find out ways to control this hormone, take a look at my Fat Extinction Program where I reveal 5 tricks to keeping your cortisol levels right where they need to be in order to achieve the accelerated weight loss you deserve and permanent fat extinction.\n2. Don\u2019t Forget Your Macronutrients\nAh yes\u2026.we cannot forget those macronutrients (carbs, proteins and fats). Without them you are like a ship without a sail when it comes to achieving your weight loss goals! You see, all 3 macronutrients, not just 1 or 2, are needed for survival. Also, while many people do follow weight loss diets that contain the 3 macronutrients, they fail to eat them in the right ratios and at the right times of the day.\nThis is one of the reasons why people do not get the weight loss results they deserve. They spend all of their hard earned money following fad diets and while their heart is on the right track, the system being used is flawed and thus they fail to achieve permanent success. If you are ever going to lose that unwanted belly fat , you must eat the right macronutrients at the right times of the day. If you do not, don\u2019t expect to change much.\nIf you feel like making some changes to your diet and want to blast away at that belly fat, all you need to do is follow a few simply techniques I have developed in the Fat Extinction Program to be on the track for weight loss success!\n3. Apply the Right Exercise Techniques\nIt amazes me how so many people think that exercising is boring. They think that you need to do the same exercises every time you exercise in order to achieve their weight loss goals. I am so sorry but I have some \u201cBreaking News\u201d: These People Are Dead Wrong! As you will see in my Fat Extinction Program, exercise can and SHOULD be different each time.\nBy adding variety to your exercise program, it will not only allow you to keep things fun and exciting but also give you better fat loss results! Also, if you use periodization principles (the logical manipulation of sets, reps and rest in between sets) and apply them correctly as done in my Fat Extinction Program, you can easily triple your results!\nGoing back to the subject of variety, it is perfectly fine to walk on a treadmill one day and walk outside the other. We are all very busy and as long as you get some form of exercise in while following the parameters specified in the program, you will be just golden.\n4. Don\u2019t Let the Bed Bugs Bite\nWhile you definitely should not let the bed bugs bite, you should definitely be getting your sleep. Sleep is not only important for recovery, but it also helps to keep you anabolic as during sleep your body produces a ton of anabolic hormones like testosterone and growth hormone. As a result of staying anabolic, you are able to increase your metabolism, blast away your belly fat and have a leaner physique!\nTo add to the list of why sleeping is so important, another concern with a lack of sleep is that your cortisol skyrockets when you do not sleep! (Please refer back to Secret #1). In addition, your immune system function will get compromised and thus, you will be more susceptible to getting a cold or infection. And obviously, lack of sleep leads to fatigue, depression, lack of focus and irritability.\n5. Drink Plenty of Water\nWater composes about 65% of the human body. It is needed in order for our body to survive. Water, believe it or not, helps to prevent over eating especially when you are feeling hungry for a late night snack. I only drink water for the most part, but every now and then I\u2019ll sneak in a Crystal Light but I don\u2019t overdo it since plain water works best (crystal light does have some artificial sweeteners).\nRealize that by applying these tactics to your daily lifestyle you will be well on your way to increasing your metabolism and blasting away that unwanted belly fat.\nWritten by Anthony Alayon.

Your weight loss plan should be simple and you should not spend too much time making it. Without a weight loss plan you simply won\u2019t know where you are heading and without goals you will not know how much work you need to do to lose weight.\nTherefore, you should ask yourself some questions:\n1. How much weight am I looking to lose?\n2. Is it possible for me to lose that in X number of days?\n3. How am I going to do that?\n4. What is my ideal weight?\nAbove you can see some of the questions you should ask yourself at the beginning of your weight loss journey and the majority people skip this step, which results in unsuccessful weight loss.\nMotivation \u2013 A Key To Success\nMake sure you write down answers to these questions because they will play an important role in your weight loss journey and it may sound funny, but you should copy that paper and stick in every place you can, because this will ensure you will stay motivated.\nMotivation is probably the most important thing, because if you will be motivated, you will push yourself to achieve goals you\u2019ve set for yourself.\nSet Your Weight Loss Goals\nSpeaking of weight loss goals, you should make them realistic and they have to be achievable, for example, you should not push yourself to lose 10 pounds in the very first week.\nYou should start with small goals and gradually you will start to lose 5 pound a week. Setting unrealistic goals is the reason why people give up and don\u2019t lose weight.\nWhen you set unrealistic goals for yourself and fail, you\u2019ll see that you feel disappointed and frustrated about yourself and your weight loss.\nWith the right diet plan alone you will be able to lose 1-2lbs a week, but if you will do exercises you will be able to lose even more weight. We have found that people with a healthy and successful diet plan and exercise program are able to lose 3-5lbs a week, but you should keep in mind that we are different and a method that helps somebody lose 5lbs a week may not work for you.\nTherefore, you should always be ready to make some changes in your diet or exercise program and in some cases even make some changes in your lifestyle. If you want to lose 100 pounds, it may take you more than 8 months depending on your diet/exercise plan and you lifestyle/habits.\nWe recommend you to set small and achievable goals for yourself so that when you are happy with the first results and achieved goals, you are really to move forward and set a bit bigger goals and this is truly the biggest secret of successful weight loss!\nAchieve Your Goals Quicker\nDiet supplements can help you achieve your weight loss goals much quicker and lose weight much faster and easier. However, it may be very difficult to find the right diet supplement, that will work for you.\nWith literally thousands of diet pills available on the market today it may be really difficult and in fact 90% of diet pills that are available today simply don\u2019t work, which means only 1 out of 10 products is effective.\nHowever, there are some diet pills that stand out of crowd, like Proactol Plus and Phen375 . Below you can see the description of top rated diet pills . Proactol Plus is the most powerful natural fat binder, that has been\u00a0 proven through 6 clinical researches and it is proven that Proactol Plus will bind 28.4% of your fat.\nTop Rated Diet Supplements\nProactol Plus contains only 100% pure and organic ingredients, that have been clinically proven to be effective, and unlike other diet pills, Proactol Plus does not cause any side effects, it is 100% safe to use.\nWith Proactol Plus you will be able to lose 2-5lbs a week quickly and easily and even if you will not be happy with weight loss results, you will be able to get your money back.\nThe manufacturers of Proactol Plus give you full 180 day money back guarantee, there is absolutely no risk of using Proactol Plus fat binder.

Compared to diet pills,these transdermal patches have quite a long list of benefits.\nFirst of all you will not have to worry about taking multiple doses during the day \u2013just slap the patch on in the morning and you are good to go. This will make it quite a lot easier because you don\u2019t have to carry a bottle of pills with you to work.\nAnother really great benefit is that the absorption rate is much higher. When you take anything orally,you are going to face a situation where you gastric system destroys a lot of the active ingredients,leaving you with less to work with.\nThat way your results will not be as good as they will be with transdermal patches,and you will have to use a lot more of the supplement. This is one of the biggest reasons for people to think that the recommended dosage on patches is too low,even though it is higher or similar to capsules.\n"}, {"score": 1634.0645, "uuid": "10453cd7-04cc-524c-b8df-b60296a1c9fa", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-54-10320", "target_hostname": "www.natural-weight-loss-myths-revealed.com", "target_uri": "http://www.natural-weight-loss-myths-revealed.com/exercise-lose-weight-dead-zone.html", "page_rank": 1.1760456e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Exercise <em>To</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>: <em>To</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> With Exercise, Stay Out Of <em>The</em>", "snippet": "<em>The</em> <em>best</em> thing <em>to</em> do is <em>to</em> create a mix of exercises in a workout program that matches your metabolism at <em>the</em> current moment but also adjusts as your fitness level changes.

After 30 days I lost 11 LBS and was able to get back into my favorite pair of jeans. After 60 days I lost a total of 16 LBS. After 120 days, the weight is still off, my skin looks much better, and I actually have energy at 2pm in the afternoon! Lol\nPeople always ask me what\u2019s different and it really boils down to the education that I received from Yegyan. He put facts behind his food & nutrient recommendations so that I began to WANT to eat healthier foods instead of just forcing myself.\nIt\u2019s been a lifestyle change and I couldn\u2019t be happier to have officially said goodbye to the old (overweight) Nick.\nYegyan, thank you for all of your hard work and for our new friendship.\nNick Unsworth\nI hired Yegyan to help me with general health and energy. I wasn't so interested in weight loss.\nBut I endedup losing 14 pounds in two months. And this was also during Christmas!\nI hardly have any sugar cravings (and I was a sugarholic. I mean fast food dessert breakfast lunch and dinner), and have deeper sleep than I ever remember and more energy throughout the whole day.\nThe days were like a struggle to make it through. Now I feel good, calm, focused and happy all day. It is more than I expected.\nJenna Wilkinson\nI CAN FIT IN MY JEANS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 haven\u2019t worn them for about 8 years!\nS.M.

This is great motivation!\n...At 57 I don't feel I have both feet in the grave yet.

Liberty, Tacoma, WA\nWhen I first started changing my diet a week ago, I couldn't believe it. I definitely started to feel the difference.\nMy mind was clearer. It felt like a fog was lifted. My energy was increased.\nI wasn't dragging myself around to do things. I had a lot more energy.\nEven my hair improved. It wasn't as dry as it was before I changed the way I was eating. It has a lot more body and not as frizzy and it was. I was using a special conditioner to make it less dry and frizzy. I don't have to use that anymore.\nMy skin is different also. I have been told so many times by a lot of people that I look younger. I even notice it myself. I don't look so worn out anymore. My skin has a different look to it. It seems like my wrinkles are not as pronounced. The rest of my body isn't as dry as it was, I don't use half of the lotions I did before.\nI have lost ten pounds and 1 inch of my thighs and hips. My life is changing for the better. I haven't even started to exercise yet. But I don't feel that it will be as hard as it would have been if I didn't change my diet. I'll update you with my results.\nThank you so much for all of your help and the knowledge that you are giving me. What a difference a diet can make in your life.\nI think once you get the knowledge on how food affects your body, the easier it is to change the way you eat. Knowledge it half the battle.\nSo many people eat the wrong way because they have been given bad information. There are a lot of people on diets that are really not eating the right way or eating the right things. They seem to gain the weight right back the minute they stop the diet. They feel hungry all of the time and get tempted constantly by the things they can't eat.\nWell I don't feel deprived. I don't feel hungry and I haven't been tempted by anything, which is unusual for me.\nNobody ate more sugar and sweets than I did. I was always putting a cookie in my mouth. Eating chocolate or cake any chance I got. I thought it gave me more energy. I don't need that anymore. I never thought I would not want any sweets, but I don't. I feel satisfied, which is a great feeling.\nFeb 2 2009\nFollow up \u2026.\nYe Gyan, I am now down to 128lbs from 156lbs!! You're great!! I can now wear anything I want!!

THIS IS FUN\nIf people dont belive it they can email me.\nE. Powell, WA\nAt 48 years old, I had spent the better part of 25 years running, working out, eating healthy food, and taking care of my body. Being somewhat of an exercise junkie, I was certain I had all the answers.\nI was frustrated that my body was stuck in a state of \u201cI\u2019m not budging, just try and make me.\u201d I can honestly say that I thought I knew exactly what I was supposed to be doing for myself and for my health, however, I was working in vain. What I wanted was completely eluding me.\nI thought that at 48 I finally had the time, the space and the energy to have the body that I wanted, and dammit, I was going to get it.\nI tried to tweak my diet and exercise routines in every way I could think of, but nothing was working.\nAlthough I was keeping up a rigorous routine of daily exercising and relatively (at least that is what I thought) healthy eating, nothing was changing.\nIn addition to not feeling as fit as I should have been for how hard I was working, I literally had zero energy\nYegyan\u2019s approach to diet, exercise and overall health and well-being are unlike anyone else\u2019s. I have read countless books on diet and exercise. I have had personal trainers and diet coaches.\nHowever, I have never felt as good or, in my opinion, looked as good as I feel and look today after following Yegyan\u2019s advice and approach to repairing the body by correcting hormonal imbalances through nutrition and proper exercise.\nI have lost those stubborn 6 pounds, 8% body fat and 12 inches overall. I am overwhelmed with excitement, not just because I look so much better, but more importantly, because I actually FEEL so much better. I feel more alive, more alert, more energetic, more rested, and healthier than ever.\nL. Quintanilla, Aliso Viejo, CA\nI listened to what you had to say about exercising and now can understand what I am doing wrong.\nI have lost inches .... Thank you for helping me to understand that.\nChuckey Tacoma,WA\nEVERYBODY was asking me what am i doing!!! and that i lost a lot of weight YAY!!!!!\ntoday , my in laws came over for lunch .... it\u2019s amazing how i could finally control my cravings that easy. THANK YOU YEGYAAAAAAAAAAAN!!\nH. Abdul Rhiyad, Saudi Arabia\nBefore I met Yegyan, I had been working out at the gym, but struggled to lose 10 pounds over a period of many months.\nWhen Yegyan and I talked about that, he explained that my heart rate should not go over 126 while working out in order to be burning fat. I had had no idea, so prior to that I had been working as hard as I could push it, out to 135 and even 140 and believing I was doing the best thing possible to lose weight in a healthy manner.\nAs soon as I began to keep my heart rate under 126 and increase the length of workouts as he had also suggested, the next 10 pounds came off much more quickly, and I was a believer!\nThank you Yegyan, for helping me to restore myself to fitness.\u201d\nMelody Haines\nThank you so much for your consults and training. I read your book and though I was doing everything correct but the weight loss stopped even though other other symptoms like energy, sleep, flexibility relaxation were still improving.\nAfter doing the coaching with you for 4 months I realized that there is more to this than meets the eye. You were able to spot many things that were giving me trouble. Better yet, you told me in advance what I would be running into. Not generally, but specifically me. From your experience you were able to tell me I would have a hard time with something and sure enough it was a brick wall.\nThen you walked me through it every single day for three weeks straight.\nThere is no way you can put everything in a book.\nI have reached my goal and know I have given myself the greatest gift - long-term health and knowledge.\nPlease put this email on your site!\nL.Sanders\n"}, {"score": 1633.9945, "uuid": "94ec4d8d-46cb-5e48-a4bf-c494eda0f282", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1113wb-76-19941", "target_hostname": "www.goodsamdayton.org", "target_uri": "http://www.goodsamdayton.org/adam/Care%20Guides/28/000294.htm", "page_rank": 1.6296414e-09, "spam_rank": 66, "title": "Step 6: <em>Lose</em> <em>weight</em> and follow <em>the</em> right <em>diet</em>", "snippet": "<em>To</em> estimate how many calories you need in order <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em> follow, these steps: * Write <em>what</em> you think is a healthy <em>weight</em> for you on this line:________ * If you reduce your usual daily calories <em>to</em> this number, you should begin <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> <em>weight</em>.", "explanation": null, "document": "Return to Index Step 1: What is Diabetes?

You may worry about what kinds of food to choose. But once you understand a few basic facts, you will become more confident in your ability to eat well. Give yourself time to work on your diet because eating habits DO NOT change overnight.\nHere are the basic facts to understand:\nAll food that you eat turns to sugar in your body.\nCarbohydrate-containing foods alter your sugar levels more than any other type of food.\nMost carbohydrates are found in starchy or sugary foods, such as bread, rice, pasta, cereal, potatoes, peas, corn, fruit, fruit juice, milk, yogurt, cookies, candy, soda, and other sweets.\nHigh-fiber, whole-grain carbohydrates are digested more slowly and are healthier choices.\nWhile vegetables, such as carrots, broccoli, and spinach, contain carbohydrates, they add much more to your health than to your sugars. Enjoy lots of them!\nCarbohydrates in food are measured in grams. You can learn to count the carbohydrates in the foods that you like and that you eat.\nOther important factors that impact your health and blood sugars are:\nControlling your weight\nIncluding vegetables and fruit every day\nEnjoying the \"good\" fats\nLet's take these one at a time.\nLosing weight and keeping it off\nFor many people with diabetes, weight loss is the key to getting control of blood sugar and may eliminate the need for medication. A weight change of just 5 - 10 % can be enough to control type 2 diabetes. (If you weigh 200 pounds, that's a loss of only 10 - 20 pounds!) You can enjoy looking better, feeling better, and having more energy -- all while reducing your risks for serious complications.\nLosing weight will help your cells stop ignoring the insulin in your blood (what we call lowering insulin resistance). To lose weight you need to take in fewer calories and burn more. When you eat, your body converts calories into energy. Eating more than your body needs leads to storing the extra energy as body fat. Eating less will decrease your fat stores.\nTo estimate how many calories you need in order to lose weight follow, these steps:\nWrite what you think is a healthy weight for you on this line:________\nAdd a zero to the end of that number.\nIf you reduce your usual daily calories to this number, you should begin to lose weight. (For example, if your desired weight is 130 pounds, your total calorie intake each day should be no more than 1300.)\nYou can find calorie information on food labels or in books designed for this purpose. You may be surprised at how fast calories add up. You may need to do some measuring of portions to be accurate with your counting. Pay attention to how much cereal, rice, or pasta you are putting on your plate. Is it more than you would have guessed?\nEating healthy protein foods\nProtein is an important nutrient that builds muscles and bones and gives you energy. Protein also helps with weight control because it helps you feel full and satisfied from your meals.\nThe healthiest proteins are the leanest. This means that they have the least fat and calories. The best animal protein choices are fish or shellfish, skinless chicken or turkey, low-fat or fat-free dairy (skim milk, low-fat cheese), and egg whites or egg substitute. Plant proteins, such as those from beans, nuts, legumes (lentils or soy foods such as tofu or soymilk) can be as healthy or healthier. If you eat red meats, choose the leanest cuts (loin and tenderloin).\nHigh-fat proteins like many red meats, fried fish, and cheeses contain more calories and unhealthy fat. Try to eat these much less often.\nIf you already show signs of kidney damage, your health care provider will likely have you restrict protein intake and should teach you how to do so.\nIncluding vegetables and fruit every day\nVegetables like broccoli, green beans, leafy greens, zucchini, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, and tomatoes are low in calories and high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Many studies have shown that eating plenty of vegetables is extremely healthy. Try to eat at least 3 - 5 servings every day. This amounts to roughly 2 cups of vegetables.\nFruit is also a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. You should try to eat about 2 - 3 servings of fruit each day. Fruit servings can be tricky. One fruit serving is equal to: 1 medium apple, pear or orange; 1 small banana; or 4 ounces of juice. Whole fruits are the best choices because they contain fiber.\nEnjoying the good fats\nFat is an essential part of your diet. If you have heard that you should eliminate all fat from your diet, you will be pleased to learn that eating healthy fat can improve your diabetes control and even help you lose weight. The best way to keep calories under control while adding the good fats is to remove some of the \"empty calorie\" foods like chips and crackers. If you replace some of your simple carbohydrates with these fats, you may get better blood sugar results. For example, try eating 10 almonds or walnuts rather than crackers. Or, eliminate croutons and try a few slices of avocado on your salad instead.\nThe best choices for fat in your diet are called mono-unsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acid.\nExamples of good fats include olive and canola oils, oily fish, walnuts, almonds, peanut butter, avocado, and olives. An extra benefit is that these foods taste good.\nThe fats that you should eat less often are saturated fats (which come from butter and other full-fat dairy products and meat) and partially hydrogenated fats (found in many margarine, crackers, chips, cookies, and other convenience foods).\nChoosing carbohydrates wisely\nAll carbohydrates are not equal. The best are high in fiber and provide slow-releasing energy into your blood. Beans, whole grain bread, oatmeal, fresh fruit, whole-wheat couscous or pasta, brown rice, and barley are among the best carbohydrate choices for your diet.\nLook for the word \"whole\" (like \"whole wheat\") as the first ingredient on food labels of breads and cereals.\nThe Glycemic Index can help you choose carbohydrates wisely. It is a measure of how fast a food raises blood sugar. More research is needed to evaluate if the glycemic index is a useful tool in controlling your diabetes.\nFind a meal plan that works for you\nA meal plan means that you follow a pattern of eating from day to day. Finding a routine and being consistent with your food will help you get better control of your blood sugar levels. A registered dietitian who understands diabetes can help you set up an eating plan.\nRemember to take your time in trying to change your eating patterns. Food plays so many roles in our lives and we've formed our eating habits over many years. It may be easier to work on one change at a time. Gradual progress is often the key to success.\nReview Date: 6/17/2008\nReviewed By: Elizabeth H.

Unfortunately, some people still struggle with losing weight, no matter how many miles they run. Here\u2019s how you can avoid the pitfalls of losing weight through running.\n3 Tips On Losing Weight With Running\nDon\u2019t expect running to be a weight loss cure-all. As runners, we tend to think that running a few miles cures all nutritional sins. The fact is, running burns only about 100 calories per mile, so that double scoop ice cream cone you devoured to reward yourself pretty well eliminates the benefit of your run. Running and exercise is a key point of a healthy weight loss program, but don\u2019t expect to lose weight if your diet is poor.\nBe patient. As I mentioned, running burns about a hundred calories per mile, so you\u2019d have to run 35 miles to lose one pound based on running alone. The good news is that this adds up over time. If you keep running consistently, you can expect to lose 2-4 pounds a month from running, provided your diet stays the same. This is a healthy rate at which to lose weight and makes it more likely that you\u2019ll keep the weight off over the long term.\nCombine high and low intensity training for best results. There are benefits to be had from including both high and low intensity running in your program. Low intensity, easy running lets you go longer and thus burn more calories, while higher intensity running such as hill reps or interval training have been shown to speed up your metabolism for significant periods of time after your run is finished. This added calorie burn can result in significant weight loss over time.\nIf you stick with it consistently, chances are you will lose weight with running. The weight bearing nature of running as opposed to activities such as cycling or swimming makes running a significantly higher calorie burner than either of the other options. Running can also improve your self-image as you begin to feel stronger and more in control of your life and this attitude has been shown to have a positive effect on weight loss outcomes as well.\nHow to Lose Weight with Running unrated Jacquie Barry 2011-12-28 15:01:04 Running is a great way to lose weight. For best results, pay attention to your diet as well, be patient and combine both high and low intensity training.\n"}], [{"score": 1630.9019, "uuid": "5e226d99-0d58-5295-870f-2cd636232208", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0112wb-52-05054", "target_hostname": "www.getyouhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.getyouhealth.com/blog/index.php/medifast-weight-loss/how-to-use-medifast-diet-meals-for-best-weight-loss-results/", "page_rank": 1.2354188e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "How <em>to</em> Use Medifast <em>Diet</em> Meals For <em>Best</em> <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Results</em> | GetYouHealth", "snippet": "How <em>to</em> Use Medifast <em>Diet</em> Meals For <em>Best</em> <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Results</em> Plan <em>to</em> have your Meals about 2 <em>to</em> 3 hours apart.

Space them throughout the day rather than saving them for the evening.\nHow do I mix the packets?\nTo mix the cold shakes, put 8 to 10 oz. of water in shaker jar or blender. Add contents of Medifast packet and ice, if desired, then mix or blend until smooth.\nMedifast Creamy Soups and Hot Cocoa should be mixed with hot water. Don\u2019t use boiling water as it cooks the protein too quickly and makes the product lumpy. Let mixture stand one minute to absorb liquid and improve flavor.\nCan I mix them with milk or fruit juice?\nNo, milk or fruit juice adds extra calories and changes the program balance. Also, fruit juices contain added carbohydrates so they will alter the critical protein ratio of the Medifast plan.\nCan I add flavorings to my Medifast Meals?\nFor variety, you may add a few drops of flavoring extract or sugar-free, calorie-free syrups, such as vanilla or mint or stir a packet into a cup of coffee. With the hot Meals, you may add salt, pepper, herbs and spices (garlic, onion, basil, cinnamon, etc.) as desired.

You might also consider using the Medifast Ready-to-Drink boxes, which offer a convenient way to take your shakes with you. These pre-mixed shakes are shelf stable and can be stored easily. (Available only in Medifast 55)\nCan I mix two packets together?\nYes, if necessary, you can mix two packets together, adding extra water to achieve the right consistency. Avoid doing this routinely; instead, keep your meals spaced 2-3 hours apart.\nWhat happens if I miss a meal?\nIf you miss a meal, eat the rest of the meals closer together to make sure you get all the required meals in before the end of the day. Because of the low calorie level of Medifast, skipping meals will put you below the optimal nutrient level your body needs to function. This decrease in your nutrient balance will make your body conserve energy and cause you to lose weight slower, not faster!\nDo I need to drink a lot of fluids?\nDrinking fluids helps your body be more efficient at eliminating the by-products of fat metabolism, keeping with more consistent weight loss. We recommend 64 oz of water a day.\nWhat kinds of fluids are OK?\nYou must drink at least 64 oz of water per day. In addition, you may drink any liquids that are considered non-caloric. This includes hot or iced tea, coffee or decaf, diet sodas, Crystal Light, and Diet Kool-Aid.\nShould I worry about salt in bouillon?\nNo. It\u2019s fine to have extra salt. In fact, it might even make you feel better if you are somewhat tired or are feeling light-headed or dizzy. When you are on Medifast, your body loses water quickly, along with some of your electrolytes such as sodium. Your body will eventually get back in balance, but having extra salt, such as in bouillon, will help it do this more quickly. You may have one bouillon per day as your allowed snack.\nCan I drink alcohol?\nNo. You should avoid all alcoholic beverages while you are on Medifast. Because alcohol is metabolized similar to a carbohydrate, it will decrease ketosis and slow your weight loss.\nCan I have coffee or caffeinated sodas?\nYes, but limit coffee and caffeinated drinks to three per day. The low-calorie level of Medifast may increase your sensitivity to caffeine, causing anxiety, shakiness or other symptoms.\nWhat can I put in my coffee?\nIf you wish, you may use low fat or skim milk or small amounts of half and half in your coffee or tea. You may also use artificial sweeteners such as Splenda-? if desired.\nCan I eat fruit?\nNo, fruits contain high levels of carbohydrates that affect your ketosis level and slow your weight loss.\nCan I chew gum?\nYou may use sugar-free gum or mints but limit these to five per day. These products contain sorbitol, which can cause gastric distress as well as stimulate appetite.\nShould I take vitamins?\nA multivitamin does not need to be taken along with the 5 & 1 plan.\nRelated posts:\n"}, {"score": 1630.25, "uuid": "d6dc2a14-55bb-586a-9ad6-533e653ec650", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0112wb-52-05057", "target_hostname": "www.getyouhealth.com", "target_uri": "http://www.getyouhealth.com/blog/?p=109", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "How <em>to</em> Use Medifast <em>Diet</em> Meals For <em>Best</em> <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Results</em> | GetYouHealth", "snippet": "How <em>to</em> Use Medifast <em>Diet</em> Meals For <em>Best</em> <em>Weight</em> Loss <em>Results</em> Plan <em>to</em> have your Meals about 2 <em>to</em> 3 hours apart.

Don\u2019t use boiling water as it cooks the protein too quickly and makes the product lumpy.

Also, fruit juices contain added carbohydrates so they will alter the critical protein ratio of the Medifast plan.\nCan I add flavorings to my Medifast Meals?\nFor variety, you may add a few drops of flavoring extract or sugar-free, calorie-free syrups, such as vanilla or mint or stir a packet into a cup of coffee.

Nevertheless, there are some characteristics shared by all human beings, and this means that some basic principles can be developed. Here are five proven techniques to help you lose weight.\nBest Way 1\nThe most fundamental strategy of successful weight loss is to burn more calories than you take in. You shouldn't find it difficult to apply this in some aspect of your life. Adjust your diet by cutting down on high fat food, and take some simple exercise for twenty minutes, three times a week. Going for a brisk walk instead of driving everywhere will have the desired effect, as will gentle jogging or swimming.\nBest Way 2\nGym membership is becoming increasingly popular, and, as long the exercise you do is well planned, it can be extremely beneficial. Aerobic exercise has to be the focal point of your plan, otherwise you could do more harm than good. Provided you adhere to this basic rule, some anaerobic weight or resistance training can help tone up your body. This will give you more strength and vitality, and should increase your confidence.\nBest Way 3\nGoing to see a professional nutritionist or dietician can pay off handsomely. If you go it alone, you will need to put in some serious research to make sure you are genuinely eating healthily, and many who try this find themselves discouraged by the lack of variety in their diet. It certainly doesn't have to be that way, as there are plenty of different healthy meals which help you lose weight. Getting the advice of a professional can make the task of losing weight seem so much more enjoyable!\nBest Way 4\nFind a friend to train with. If you and a friend are both regularly free at the same time of day, it can make sense to train together. Having someone to help you through the times when you don't seem to be getting anywhere can keep you in the game until the improvement suddenly appears. Having a social aspect to your exercise will help you look forward to it, and make you more likely to stick to it!\nBest Way 5\nEat less food more often. Many medical practitioners now recommend eating more meals a day, with less food at each one. This is a more balanced way to take food into the body, spreading the load on the body over a far wider period of time. The system of eating three meals a day is designed far more to fit in with the working day than it is to fit in with the needs of the human body. When you eat less more often, the body absorbs more of the nutrients in the food, so your body craves fewer calories.\nThe best and most effective method for weight loss does depend on the individual, but follow these time tested principles and you will see results.

However, while the majority do fail with their weight loss program, there are the small minority who do actually succeed.\nIt is those who take weight loss seriously who will be successful, and devising a weight loss strategy that suits you will give you a structure that will support, rather than hinder, your own success.\nElements of a Successful Weight Loss Strategy\nAt its most basic, losing weight is simple; you start to burn off more calories than you consume, at a sensible rate, and then continue to do so until you reach your optimal weight, or BMI. While doing that, you ensure the nutritional balance of your food intake is healthy.\nNow, that sounds very easy. So, what makes it so difficult for most people, often so difficult they just give up any plan to lose weight? There are several things that come to mind: peer pressure, habitual eating and drinking, addiction to junk food, sweet foods and drinks, and lack of exercise.\nWhen devising a weight loss strategy it is best to bear all those negatives in mind, and devise a plan that counters all or most of the negatives mentioned above.\n1. Overcoming Peer Pressure\nIt is much easier than you may think to separate yourself from the crowd. Just decide that you will be different. You will not a meek, mild and overweight donkey being dragged along. You will lead from the front. It is your body, your health and your weight. You will be the one who will look fitter, slimmer and enjoying yourself more. They will continue to be the overweight donkeys being led to graze on junk food.\n2. Set Weight Loss Objectives\nHaving made the decision to lose weight successfully, set yourself some weight loss objectives . Make your targets achievable, enabling you to reach your ideal weight for your height and build. Check out your BMI, and then plan to lose weight at one or two pounds a week; safely, steadily.\nMore on Weight Loss Strategy Next Week\nHypnosis CDs\n"}, {"score": 1625.015, "uuid": "2a7e14ad-24ad-5008-9c2e-f041b1a3f264", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1704wb-77-33026", "target_hostname": "www.thejohnblog.net", "target_uri": "http://www.thejohnblog.net/the-john-blog/1139", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "Looking for a Great <em>Diet</em> <em>To</em> Help You <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em>? | <em>The</em> John Blog", "snippet": "If you get <em>the</em> right one, you can <em>lose</em> and keep it off as long as you are committed for <em>the</em> long haul.

If you have beenattempting to lose bodyweight, whether it be five pounds or fifty pounds, you are not going to be successful if you can not stay on it and if you don\u2019t rework your eating after you have lost those pounds. Some folks lose and gain back, and some fall of a diet because they simply can not handle it. You have to locate the perfect diet for you. What worked for your best friend may not work for you simple because you have unique tastes and different eating habits. If you get the right one, you can lose and keep it off as long as you are committed for the long haul.\nBefore you try to find the best diet, think what has failed you in the past. You should also take into account medical issues that is making it harder for you to lose weight and maintain it off. You should take a trip to your physician, explain that you are trying to find the perfect diet for you, but nothing is working. You can have your thyroid checked, see if you have PCOS, or be tested for any metabolic issues of which you may not be aware. Those can slow down weight loss and can also determine which type of eating plan would work best for you.\nIf you want to be held accountable, which works for some people today, the best diet is a weight loss system that has regular meetings or that offers one on one help from someone in the program. Some allow you to eat things according to points, which can work, or that has you weight in and report to someone. Some send you food so you don\u2019t guess about what you are eating. These programs can help you lose, but keep in mind that some feel deprived on them. That may not be a issue for you. If not, you have found the perfect diet for you. Choose one like this that helps you sustain, not just lose, which is a huge key to weight loss that many do not consider when choosing.\nSome programs are created to help you lose just 5 or 10 pounds. These include changing a few of your meals each day and then eating a healthy supper. These can work too and can be the perfect diet, but remember that the last five pounds are the hardest to lose and keep off. If you lose your weight, and then return to old eating habits, you have not found the perfect diet. Use what you learned in those few weeks or the month it took and see if you can keep those pounds off for good.\nFor some folks, the best diet is a low carb plan. Atkins diet plan is a good one, but there are others that you can try. This can be the best diet for you if you don\u2019t want to be starving while dieting, and if you think you may have a super sweet tooth. You can be addicted to carbs just like you could be addicted to nicotine. The first weeks can be rough as you Desire those carbs, but it will go away as you eat nutritious carbs in controlled amounts. Those on low carb plans often lose quickly and never feel hungry, making it a perfect weight loss plan for them. As long as you comply with these to the letter, they should work well for you as well.\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, October 19th, 2011 at 9:07 am and is filed under .

How did you feel then? Probably frustrated, angry with yourself, a failure? These negative feelings may be even lead you to further overeating, causing you to gorge or eat comfort food in order to feel better with yourself. Back to square on then, and it all starts over again. In order to cut this vicious circle, you need to be able to include dieting into your general lifestyle.\nIn fact a person habitual of overspending will be visible in the eyes of others but if you ask him, he will always say that his spending habits are absolutely normal. It will be hard to make him realize of this fact and until he realizes, it is extremely difficult to even imagine that he will improve upon his spending habits. Absolutely similar is the case of people who actually either overeat or are not diet conscious and their feeling within is whatever they eat is normal. Luckily in the case of diet there are some parameters fixed by deiticians freternity like BMI, 1200 calories dialy diet which guide us how much is overeating but unfortunately like money we don't have a fixed budget to spend. There is no wallet in the case of eating food from where we know by the end of the day how much did we eat. To know how many calories did we consume in a day, we will need to either keep writing everytime we eat\u00a0or by the end of the day and then\u00a0search for the calories count of every thing we ate during the day and\u00a0finally make a total of the calories we consumed during the date. This is like being highly impractical and this exactly is the problem.\nThen how do we reduce / lose\u00a0weight or burn calories ?\u00a0How do we include dieting\u00a0into our general lifestyle?\nHere we present some special tips\u00a0/ ways to help you lose / reduce weight and burn calories.\nMake sure you drink at least eight glasses of water a day : The first tip to lose/ reduce\u00a0weight and burn calories is to drink at least 2 litres of water everyday.Research has shown that many times the body confuses its feelings of hunger and thirst. This means that many times, what you perceive as hunger is actually thirst.\u00a0 If you stay hydrated,\u00a0then\u00a0whenever your body feels hungry, you are actually hungary and not thirsty. Water in itself is highly beneficial to our body in various areas and has no side effects.\nTake many small meals a day : The second tip to lose\u00a0or reduce weight to take probably six small meals a day.\u00a0If you are in the habit of skipping meals, you can be in trouble. Although you may feel you are cutting down on calories if you do so, the harsh truth is that the following meal you will be starving, and will end up consuming much larger quantities of food (and calories!) than you would normally do. A general diet comprises of three square meals a day, plus healthy snacks in between ensures that your blood-sugar levels will remain constant throughout the day, and the feeling of intense, incontrollable hunger will be gone.\nStart substituting : The third of the tips to\u00a0lose or reduce weight is\u00a0to switch over to\u00a0foods with more nutritive values or whole grain type meals.\u00a0It is not dieting but diet plan that is important.\u00a0 Remaing hungary does help losing weight but how long can\u00a0one remain hungary so in order to look sustainace of lost weight, the best way is to\u00a0substitute.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not feel like changing your dietary habits dramatically (which is what a diet generally does), you can start replacing certain foods by others of more nutritive value. Replace, for example, white bread with the healthier whole-grain type. Cut down on soft drinks, and take water or fresh fruit juice instead. Remember what was stated in the first point.\nHere are some herbs which stimulate calorie burning\nDo someexercise : This is infact one of the most important tips to lose or reduce weight\u00a0 and\u00a0 burn calories. A 45 minutes intense exercise helps you burn around 700 calories and imagine this figure by comparing it with 1200 calories daily reciommended diet. If you control your eating habits within 1200 calories every day, then the 700 calories you burned with exrecise are bound to come out of your exixting fat\u00a0and you are bound to\u00a0lose weight. \u00a0It has been proven that slimming diets yield the best results when coupled with exercise. We are talking about a 45-minute workout of moderate intensity at least three times a week. This should be fairly simple to include in your daily routines: you can walk , swim, dance, run\u2026 you can do anything you fancy! The key here is to try to enjoy the activity you are doing, in order to be able to keep it up on the long term. As you progress, you can add more minutes to your workout, or go on to more challenging activities.\nControl your mind : If one can follow this tip then you have won the game. This can be the toughest issue to address. Most of the times we tend to overeat due to our emotional state or as a response to our daily tensions. Try to control this habit of eating comfort food, and you will start loosing weight quickly .\u00a0If you\u00a0make a compromise with yourself and say: \u201cI will only eat five potato chips.\u201d Take them out of the bag, close it, put it back in, then sit back and enjoy your five chips without guilt!\nStop Eating Junk Food: Honestly speaking I have not touched a burger or Pizza\u00a0for the last six months. Junk foods are the biggest friends of human weight. Just stay away from Junk foods to lose or reduce weight. Simply turn to greens and whole grain meals and within\u00a0two months you will see yourself lighter.\nAll the tips to reduce weight and burn calories can be discussed at length but I am sure all our readers are aware of most of these tips and just need to keep them on top their mind before deciding what to eat and what no to eat and if to eat then\u00a0how much.\nTop Comments\nArticles like this really grease the shafts of konwlegde.\nby Vicki 19-Feb-2012\nthanks for feature. would u say how can i reduce my fat around bally?\nby mohiuddin 21-Feb-2012\n"}, {"score": 1617.9149, "uuid": "699bd151-164b-569d-8b3a-737becce1ce4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0012wb-23-07358", "target_hostname": "www.24-7u.com", "target_uri": "http://www.24-7u.com/weightloss/", "page_rank": 1.3589568e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Weight</em> Loss -

You will lose your motivation and want to give up if you find you have not met a goal when it is time to evaluate your progress.\nNo matter how much time you spend exercising or dieting, it is not possible to lose twenty pounds in a couple of days, especially safely.\nHow Much Can You Safely Lose?\nLosing two to three pounds in a week is an attainable goal and considered both safe and healthy.\nIf you regularly exercise at the right pace and length of time you may even push that number to three to four pounds a week.\nYou may want to lose 10 pounds fast quickly, but give yourself a few weeks to do so if you want to keep the pounds off.\nAttempting to lose more than that amount will put unneeded stress on your body. \u00a0Your body functions as a machine, and if it is pushed too far it will wear out and start to resist the change by slowing your metabolism down.\nEat Vegetables and Fruit\nKeeping track of what you eat is the most important step of any weight loss routine. You should always have lots of fruit and vegetables in the fridge. Add fruits and vegetables to every meal you eat.\nFruits keep you fit and boost your metabolism, enabling your body to burn more calories.\nThey also carry very few calories yet still fill you up, which is a key to managing your hunger.\nEat Smaller Meals\nThree full meals in one day is actually too much for the stomach to properly handle, so instead of having three large meals you need to eat four to five small size meals a day.\nEating multiple small meals keeps up your nutrition levels and boosts your body\u2019s metabolism in a healthy way.\nThis enables you to burn more calories which is the primary part of losing weight quickly.\nIt also keeps you from getting so hungry that you over compensate and gorge yourself on too much food.\nDon't Let Your Stomach Fool You\nYour stomach has a delay in how it signals that you are full, so in this case it would be easy to eat more than you actually need.\nEating smaller meals helps keep your appetite more consistent.\nAlways keep in mind that regardless of what your goal weight is the pounds have to be lost in a steady and gradual manner. There is no magic trick that will make your pounds disappear, never to return.\nYou need to stay motivated and constantly keep a watchful eye on the food you are putting into your body.\nWhat Other Kinds Of Foods Can You Eat?\nThere's a lot said about carbs and fat these days, not all of which is true. \u00a0There is nothing really inherent about carbs or fats that make you fat.\nThe problem with them is they contain a lot of calories for their mass and don't always keep you full, so you end up eating more.\nThat's why lean protein is a great choice, keeps you full without many calories.\nAn 8oz sirloin steak is only about 280 calories, add in some veggies and you have a healthy meal that will keep you satisfied.\nFor more information on what foods not to eat, even though you might think they are ok, is my post on the most fattening foods .\nCut Out Soft Drinks And Juices\nOne of the easiest ways to cut calories is to give up sodas and even fruit juices as these contain a lot of extra calories that add up over the course of the day. \u00a03 or 4 drinks a day is enough to put on a pound a week of fat if you're not careful.\nCalorie Calculation For Weight Loss\nOk so armed with all these tips you now need to set a goal as shown in step one. \u00a0Some people don't like to count calories but if you want to have the best chance of success then you really need to.\nDon't worry though, you generally only need to do this for a couple of weeks. \u00a0Once you get a good idea of how much each type of food you eat counts calorie-wise then you'll be able to estimate it later on.\nIt helps to eat the same types of food but if you veer off course a few times now and then don't worry, it's more about consistency over time, a few cheats now and then are fine.\nIn fact most dieters have a cheat day or even just a cheat meal once a week. \u00a0This helps you mentally to stay on track and gives you a break so you can stick to eating healthier long term.\nFormula To Calculate Calories\nOn average it takes about 3500 calories to gain or lose fat.\nSo simply take how many pounds you want to lose a week and divide into 3500. \u00a0For instance if you wanted to lose 2 pounds a week:\n3 pounds = 7000 calories\nNow take that an divide by 7 days and we get:\n1000 calories per day\nDepending on how much you eat already this might be difficult to do but it's possible. \u00a0If you did an hour of heavy cardio (500 calories) and ate around 500 calories less you'd accomplish this.\nYou could try eating less and not have to do as much cardio, this might be better for those with tight schedules that don't allow much time to exercise.\nAs you can see this is going to take some work. \u00a0The only other option is to boost your metabolism so that you just naturally burn off more calories, even without exercising.\nWeight Loss Pills\nWeight loss pills can be very helpful in getting results quicker than just regular dieting and exercise alone.\nThey need to be taken sensibly and careful and of course choose the right one.\nI've personally used Oxyelite Pro with good results, at the moment it's the best one on the market.\nThese are the best and most effective wasy to lose weight. Keep a healthy diet, exercise regularly and eat lots of fruits and vegetables to lose weight fast and safe. Follow the above tips to and you will get that answer to how to lose weight fast and easy.\nWeight Loss Fitness Tip:\nLooking for the fastest way to lose weight?\nOxyelite Pro Super Fat Burner: Step 1 .\nGet a good diet that you can enjoy also eating: Step 2 .\n"}, {"score": 1615.3892, "uuid": "4a738cd0-446e-5744-a649-d4bcabb3690e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-44-13900", "target_hostname": "slimmingpoint.com", "target_uri": "http://slimmingpoint.com/", "page_rank": 2.0244786e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>Weight</em> Loss Products Review.

So you are now asking yourself <em>what</em> exactly is Hoodia Gordonii?", "explanation": null, "document": "Hoodia Diet Max \u2013 Does It Work\nWhat is Hoodia Diet Max?\nHoodia Diet Max is an diet supplement which normally contains the\u00a0 pure Hoodia Gordonii cactus. So you are now asking yourself what exactly is Hoodia Gordonii?\nSo continue reading the next few paragraphs to find out more about hoodia gordonii and hoodia diet max.\nWhat is Hoodia Gordonii?\nHoodia gordonii is a tasty plant from the South African Kalahari desert, home of the San People. The San have used the Hoodia gordonii succulent for hundreds of years to prevent hunger during their long and tough hunting trips in the harsh South African wild.\nThe exposure of the active ingredient in the Hoodia gordonii plant is proven with clinical research and analysis to suppress one\u2019s appetite calorie reduction.\nThis unique\u00a0 and organic ingredient is the result of 30 years of research by the CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) in South Africa.\nSo great is the discovery of this weight-loss ingredient that a large pharmaceutical company, is creating a pill, known as P57, based on the hoodia gordonii plant.\nHoodia works by stimulating natural chemical reactions in the brain which normally occur when we consume a large meal. This gives you an immediate\u00a0 feeling which can last anything up to three hours.\nMany users find they are not able to eat as much as they are usually used to, and can find it hard to finish their regular meals.\nHoodia Diet Max Ingredients\nUnfortunately, Hoodia Diet Max generally seems to contain very low quantities of actual Hoodia Gordonii and also features only just 25mg per serving.\nIn order to claim the best hoodia product it should contain around 400mg of 100% pure extract per serving, which is the recommended dosage for suppressing of your appetite and has been clinically proven and tested to offer actual weight loss results.\nHoodia Diet Max also contains 100mg of Guarana which is a stimulant containing high natural amounts of caffeine.\nDoes Hoodia Diet Max work?\nDespite the fact that there is enough evidence that Hoodia does truly help you to reduce calorie consumption, Hoodia Diet Max seems to offer a small amount of hoodia gordonii. This might be because of the fact that Hoodia is very expensive to cultivate and strict rules are enforced on the quantity.\nThe conclusion is with Hoodia Gordonii\u00a0 you only get what you pay for. While the price tag on Hoodia Diet Max may very well be attractive, you can find more effective supplements available on the market which do not contain any fillers or binders such as caffeine, and only contain 100% pure Hoodia extract.\nDoes Hoodia Diet Max Use Legitimate Hoodia\nA CITES certificate is present although it\u2019s not very sure that the certificate has been granted for this product separately.\nHoodia Diet Max Side Effects\nNo other ingredients are present apart from raw Hoodia \u2013 so no side effects should Occur.\nIs Hoodia Diet Max Recommended\nIt is very difficult to recommend Hoodia diet max because you can get more effective hoodia supplement than this product. And also there is doubt over it\u2019s certification and ingredients as it may contain high level of caffeine which may leads to harmful effects on your health.\nOther Alternative to Hoodia Diet Max\nUnique Hoodia has documentation to prove genuineness and uses 100%\nunique hoodiapure raw Hoodia powder.Most of the US based hoodia supplements use the less expensive and also largely ineffective extract.\nEach pill is made up of 460mg of pure Hoodia Gordonii packed into an easy-to-consume, tiny pill. It comes with 180 days money back guarantee.\n"}, {"score": 1611.0482, "uuid": "66769a0a-5979-523a-bc91-32b976b553e5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1605wb-73-10367", "target_hostname": "loseweightfastpro.com", "target_uri": "http://loseweightfastpro.com/category/lose-weight-2/page/12/", "page_rank": 1.1963848e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> | <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast And Quick - Part 12", "snippet": "As there are thousands of slimming pills available in <em>the</em> market either by prescription or non- prescription but how can you know and sure that you are not buying a hype product <em>to</em> <em>lose</em> your <em>weight</em>.

For so many\u00a0 years, bushmen in Southern Africa have been chewing on the plant during long hunting trips. It allows them to go days without eating but keeps them active and strong. Inquiry on the appetite suppressant started in the 1960\u2032s. It wasn\u2019t until the 1990\u2032s that scientists figured out the main ingredient.\nHoodia gordonii is completely natural \u2013 it is not a drug. Pharmaceutical companies find it so promising, however, that they are trying to keep apart the appetite-suppressing molecule, P57, to make a patented diet drug in the future.\nDoes Hoodia Weight Loss Pills Work?\nYes, hoodia can helps to lose weight but the pure hoodia product only. because of high demand in hoodia product,there are so many hoodia name product out there who just use the brand name but there is no pure hoodia powder so you have to be very careful here as it can lead to harm your health if you are using fake hoodia product to lose weight. Pure hoodia is contain a p57 molecule and it is the only molecule that work any thing less than this p57 is not going to work for you.\nIt is considered that Hoodia (and more specifically the p-57 in the hoodia) simulates the effect glucose has on nerve cells in the brain. Essentially, hoodia fools the brain into believing it\u2019s full when it\u2019s not. So, your brain sends the signal that it is full and this cuts your urge to snack on unhealthy food. In fact, hoodia is more powerful than glucose in telling the brain that you are full.\nThere is no report of any side effects yet from eating or taking Hoodia or\u00a0 P-57 molecule. Remember, for thousands of years that Bushmen have eaten hoodia gordonii plants with no ill side effects.\nCustomers Feedback On Hoodia Pills:\nSome people have described that not only does Hoodia make them feel full, but it also shuts off their desire to eat.\nAs many of us know, we can feel physically satisfied but still eat for a variety of reasons like emotions, timing and social influence. In fact emotional eating is actually responsible for more overeating than physical hunger.\nAs you can see there are so many postive response fron hoodia pills users. By turning off your appetite, Hoodia allows you to start to make positive, healthy food choices. It takes the pain out of building new healthier eating choices. Since you probably don\u2019t want to be on Hoodia forever, this is a great way to lose weight and transition your eating to a healthier, lighter diet \u2013 with less pain and deprivation.\nWhere To Buy Pure Hoodia?\nLook for genuine South African Hoodia from a seller who displays both a C.I.T.E.S certificate on their website along with Lab Assays and testing of their Hoodia pills. If you\u2019re not sure about which Hoodia brand to buy, do more research until you feel comfortable with your decision.\n"}, {"score": 1610.6195, "uuid": "dca157c9-528d-57d0-89a9-e207d2e47d62", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1606wb-09-14554", "target_hostname": "loseweightfastpro.com", "target_uri": "http://loseweightfastpro.com/category/lose-weight-2/page/16/", "page_rank": 1.1945309e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> | <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast And Quick - Part 16", "snippet": "So it is highly recommended <em>to</em> you <em>to</em> go for this <em>diet</em> program and you can see <em>the</em> <em>result</em> within 11 days as this <em>diet</em> program claims that you can <em>lose</em> 9 lbs in just 11 days.

This makes it easier to lose weight fast for a long time and also helps to maintain this weight loss after the diet is over.\nFat Loss 4 Idiots boils down to these basic components:\nEating 4 meals a day\nSwitching off between protein and carb intake\nDrinking lots of water\nMaking your meals at home\nLimiting sweets\nEating until you feel satisfied (not full)\nWalking for exercise\nThese are identical basic guidelines to follow.

Get <em>the</em> Bits-n-Bites Newsletter and <em>The</em> Daily Bites.", "explanation": null, "document": "Workshop Details\nWorking with a Weight Loss Coach Step-by-Step\nIt starts with a decision. When the day comes that you decide (really decide) to make a change, we can get started.\nStep 1 - What Do you Want\nThe first step is determining what you truly want. You may say you want to lose weight, but if your actions don't support that goal, then various issues may be holding you back or blocking your path. By the end of your first session, you can dissolve many of those issues in a trauma-free manner.\nStep 2 - Changing Self Talk\nStep two is ending the self-talk that tears you down. A lot of the chatter going on in our heads comes from our past experiences. That chatter can be quieted, and changed, easily, and effortlessly. Sometimes our chatter seems to talk us into doing what we say we do not want to do. Your chatter can instead support you and your goals. You'll learn how to make this happen.\nStep 3 - The Principals of Eating for Nourishment\nStep Three is learning basic eating principals. How to distinguish hunger from thirst, recognizing the feeling of satisfaction, learning to eat more often for nourishment, and less often for entertainment. Eating for reasons other than hunger are okay, but recognizing which type of eating you are doing (or thinking of doing) makes the difference, because now you are in charge of your own eating.\nStep 4 - Your Eating Habits & Patterns\nStep Four is discovering your own eating habits and patterns. Which habits are healthy, which patterns would benefit from modification. You are always free to eat what you prefer, and all eating decisions are yours alone. Much of our eating is done without much conscious attention. Habits can be changed, new habits can be formed - all without trauma or deprivation.\nYou'll track your food intake to establish your patterns of eating and triggers that cause you to overeat. You'll gain a more clear picture of what you are doing in the present, and how your nutritional profile stacks up. It can be shocking to realize how much you eat without getting enough nutrients. Keeping a diary is temporarily used to catch yourself being yourself.\nYou'll learn ways to change your eating triggers, and end eating as a coping mechanism. You'll find other ways to get your needs met, ways that make better sense, since eating is best suited for nutritional needs first, and recreational needs second.\nStep 5 - Reevaluation\nStep Five is a recheck to see whether what you are doing is working. Continually checking back to see that your actions support your values and goals is important. As you make small changes, you may change your goals. Learning to focus on what you want helps you achieve just that.\nYou will be building greater self esteem, and a sense of power and control in your own life throughout the entire process.\nWhat do you do on a regular basis that you can change without experiencing too much trauma? What foods can you quit eating so frequently or what activities can you add (motion and movement) to create a greater energy need or build up your muscles to create a greater metabolic need?\nYou'll choose one or two things to start and just make those changes. Nothing else. One or two things at a time is best. You'll find what is best for you. I don't try to make radical changes as I know most will give up if they create a too restrictive environment for themselves.\nStep 6 - Emotional Issues and Aspects\nNext we'll take a look at the emotional aspects of where you are today and where you want to be. Using methods such as NLP and EFT we'll tackle any limiting beliefs you might have (\"I can't\"), or fears (\"I'm afraid\"), or anything else that we discover is an issue for you. We do this from the very start, so all the things that come up during our work together are dealt with as they arise.\nWhy You Might Want a Weight Loss Coach\nYou've tried and failed and you're sick of it\nYou know what to do but can't get yourself to do it\nYou don't believe you can succeed\nYou believe you are doomed to remain overweight and unhappy forever\nYou have pain or trauma that you just can't get over\nYou eat to end the pain\nI use 8 weeks as the starting commitment. Why 8 weeks? Because it is short enough to be achievable and long enough to establish new habits that will be the foundation of a lifestyle that supports good health and fitness. If you were hoping for a list of foods to avoid, a magic pill, perhaps a \"Lose Weight While You Sleep\" approach, then you've come to the wrong place. If you are not willing to commit to 8 weeks then you aren't willing to do what is necessary to make a permanent change. That 8 weeks will pass whether you do anything differently or not, but if you do make a change, after 8 weeks you'll see a significant improvement, you'll feel wonderful, and you'll be well on your way to the permanent resolution of your weight problem forever.\nThis is where those that are serious about creating lifelong change get on the bus and those that won't put forth any effort get off. You choose to lose, it's that simple.\nFace it, if you continue to do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always got. Small changes in your daily habits will result in the permanent changes you want for better health, weight loss and general well being.\nWeight Loss with a Difference\nIt's not about your weight and it's not about the food. It's always been how we treat ourselves, pure and simple. Some people treat their cars and pets with greater care and compassion than they treat themselves.

The Secrets to Weight Loss\nThere are many people advising us how to lose weight, but the main problem is that they base their strategy and methods on themselves, don't think about the fact that all the people are different and each and every one of us can find the best way to lose weight effectively. You start from yourself, you think which activity is the best for you? What do you like to do? The important thing is to be active, just sitting by the television or sleeping won't help you at all. So try to motivate yourself, go outside, find the places you like, do the things you like. It is not necessary that you exercise vigorously or starve yourself to lose weight. The most important thing is that you are happy with yourself and the things you do.\n2. Do the Things You Have Always Liked\nYou just think about the things you can do. Do you have a garden? If you have a garden and you like working with plants that can be a very good way to exercise. You can enjoy your time on fresh air, be proud of your work. Have you considered some hobbies like carpentry or pottery, something creative? If you are a creative person you would spend hours in making new interesting items and exercise. The most important thing is to do something you like, spend your energy, your heart and soul into doing something and then watch the results.\nDo you like music? Have you considered learning how to dance? Dancing can be a lot of fun and it can also help you coordinate your moves, be socially active, meet new people. Do you like playing musical instruments? Do you know that playing some instruments, like for example drums, can help you lose weight?\nIf you like sports, just go for it. Don't hesitate, it is never late to try something new, experience new things. There are many sports. You can choose the one which is most suitable for you. Just star slowly and then increase you tempo. You would be happy to see that the results are in your favor, you will lose weight gradually.\n3. Take Care About the Food You Eat\nIt is very important to select your food. You can eat the things you like, but be careful not to eat too much. Every time you have been active the whole day, reward yourself with some nice food. Get used to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, drink a lot of water. The quantity of food should be always proportional to your daily activity.\n4. You Can Do It\nJust go for it. I know you can do it. The results can come slowly, but don't lose your spirit. The important thing is that you feel good with your life and your body. Thank you for reading this article.

Anyway you are here because you want a complete Hydroxycut review and you also want to know that how does it work or it\u2019s just a scam?\nWhat Is Hydroxycut\nHydroxycut is a premium weight-loss support supplement that contains\nseveral unique patent-protected ingredients and compounds, including Hydroxagen Plus\u2122 and HydroxyTea. These research-driven ingredients help increase energy levels, and boost metabolism and calorie-burning, thereby helping you support your weight loss goals when you combine this diet pill with diet and exercise.\nThis diet pill is made by Muscle Tech and is presented as one of the most effective fat burners available on the market today. With all the hype about it, is it really a big surprise that Hydroxycut is recognized as one of the best fat burners around?\nHydroxycut Ingredient:\nKey ingredients in the Hydroxycut formula are supported by research. In two 8-week studies, subjects using the primary ingredients in Hydroxycut (Garcinia cambogia extract, chromium polynicotinate, and Gymnema sylvestre extract) lost on average significantly more weight than subjects using a placebo.\nDoes Hydroxycut Work?\nIs one of the most popular weight-loss supplements available. However, even though it is very popular, there is a lack of reliable scientific evidence to support the claim that the supplement is effective for weight loss.\nAlthough a few studies support the effectiveness of this diet pill, it is important to note that these studies are small and evaluate only some of the ingredients in Hydroxycut (not all of the active ingredients in the current formulation). So it is come to know that it does not work as promised made by it\u2019s company.\nIs Hydroxycut Safe?\nIf you are taking this so claimed weight loss supplement to lose your weight, it is important to understand possible risks before taking the product. For example, Hydroxycut warnings and safeguards include talking to your health professional (before taking Hydroxycut) if you have certain medical conditions, such as glaucoma, any heart problems, or anxiety. Hydroxycut can possibly make these conditions riskier.\n"}, {"score": 1597.9814, "uuid": "29f57ec6-fb27-5dcd-bc10-713f66c991b3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0709wb-98-03814", "target_hostname": "www.weightloss-hq.biz", "target_uri": "http://www.weightloss-hq.biz/special-reviews/7-ways-to-lose-weight-fast.html", "page_rank": 1.195065e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "7 Ways <em>To</em> <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast", "snippet": "You are going <em>to</em> have <em>to</em> <em>give</em> yourself fully over <em>to</em> a commitment <em>to</em> <em>weight</em> loss in this plan and it is by no means easy <em>to</em> accomplish. <em>The</em> <em>results</em> that you get at <em>the</em> end however make it more than worth it.

The Cookie Diet\nDr. Siegal is perhaps the most famous weight loss doctor in existence and part of the reason that he rose to this level of fame has to do with his cookie diet. The cookie diet may seem like a ridiculous concept and on the face of it you would be correct in thinking such a thing. However, once you get deeper into the minutiae of the diet, what you will find is that these cookies are actually going to be your ticket to weight loss in a way that you never may have thought possible before.\nThe cookies that come with this diet have been specially crafted with ingredients that act as appetite suppressants. In other words, you are taking in compounds that can help you control your appetite, but you are doing it through cookies which taste absolutely delicious. Six cookies per day are all it takes and when you combine that with around 1000 calories a day from other sources, you are officially on the cookie diet. With so few calories a day you will start to lose weight quite rapidly on a monthly basis and that in turn will have you feeling good all the time. Not bad for a food that is not traditionally associated with weight loss!\n2. Medifast\nMedifast is a diet plan that has received a lot of media attention recently because of some high profile results that they have obtained.\u00a0\u00a0The basic premise of Medifast is the idea that if you reduce the amount of calories you intake per meal and eat more meals a day, you can feel full while at the same time reducing your overall calorie intake.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you normally eat 3 1000-calorie meals per day, you might be able to get away instead with eating 6 300-calorie meals instead and reduce your daily calorie intake by 1200 calories in the process.\u00a0\u00a0These figures are not exactly what Medifast uses, but they are sufficient to illustrate the point.\nThe actual figures vary quite significantly as they depend on the particular meals that you choose.\u00a0\u00a0You eat the food that Medifast provides, allowing you to directly track calorie intake by using the pre-created calorie meals that Medifast allows you to consume.\u00a0\u00a0Medifast additionally makes the claim that most people end up paying less on a per-day basis for Medifast food than they would with their normal diet, which is added incentive for someone to use their service.\n3. Lipodissolve - Phosphatidylcholine Deoxycholate Injections\nIf the name above doesn\u2019t sound familiar to you at all, chances are that you\u2019re in the majority.\u00a0\u00a0While most people have not heard of the phosphatidylcholine deoxycholate method of weight loss, it is usually because of the fact that it is marketed under the name Lipodissolve by the American Society of Nonsurgical Aesthetics.\u00a0\u00a0This method of weight loss is for people that have weight problems that are not necessarily related to their diet or the amount of exercise that they get.\u00a0\u00a0For women in particular, this method can be effective because it targets one of the main reasons women do not lose weight through conventional diet and exercise methods and that is because of cellulite.\nCellulite has the ability to transcend diet and exercise if it has already made its way into a woman\u2019s body and for that reason it is not uncommon for a husband and wife to go on the same weight loss regime and the husband to get far better results than the wife.\u00a0\u00a0Lipodissolve is a method for cellulite removal that does not require surgery and tends to be far more effective on women than men.\u00a0\u00a0While the method can be effective, it is at the same time controversial as cellulite removal is a purely aesthetic weight loss method that does not directly improve a person\u2019s health.\u00a0\u00a0This does not make it a bad thing, just different.\n4. Green Tea\nGreen tea is one of the new wave of ingredients being touted for its ability to help people lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike many of the other ingredients within this group however, green tea has a number of double-blind peer-review studies backing up the assertions made on its behalf.\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, many people believe that green tea is one of the best weight loss programs out there, especially if taken in the correct daily dose.\u00a0\u00a0Green tea is such an effective ingredient for weight loss that many scientists will argue that when any current weight loss pill is directly compared to green tea on an equal-weight basis, green tea is better than most.\nWhat makes green tea even better as a weight loss ingredient is the combination of no side effects and increased energy.\u00a0\u00a0Green tea has all of the properties of a normal tea drink in addition to its weight loss contributing prowess and that means that you get both the energy surge and the normal feeling that you would get when drinking tea.\u00a0\u00a0This allows you to keep exercising and dieting properly and therefore increases the overall greatness of green tea as a quick way to lose weight. We recommend you also read our five part series on green tea .\n5. The Master Cleanser Diet\nThe master cleanser diet is one of the most popular cleansing diets on the market today.\u00a0\u00a0The main reason for this has to do with the fact that the diet itself has managed to snag some high profile results and for that reason has rocketed to the top of the cleansing diet world riding a wave of positive publicity in a way that was similar to Medifast.\nAt their heart, most cleansing diets work in the same way and the master cleanser diet is no exception to that rule.\u00a0\u00a0The main idea here is that people carry about 10 to 15 pounds of extra weight on average that comes from a lack of purity in their body.\u00a0Different toxins either build up fat tissues on their own, block excess water from exiting the body or promote processes that build up fat indirectly.\u00a0\u00a0By cleansing these toxins from your body, you can lose some of that weight.\u00a0\u00a0This is especially effective in the short term if you are carrying a lot of water weight as that can be released quite quickly through the utilization of these methods.\n6. Jillian Michaels\u2019 Weight Loss Plan\nJillian Michaels\u2019 weight loss plan can be described with many different words, but perhaps the most fitting of those words is \u2018intense\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019ve seen The Biggest Loser on television, you know that her weight loss methods provide results.\u00a0\u00a0And in the end, the biggest motivation that a person can have for doing difficult techniques in diet and exercise is knowing for sure that those methods will produce results if they have the discipline and the nerve to stick to their guns through the thick and thin.\nThat having been said, this particular weight loss plan is not for the faint of heart.\u00a0\u00a0Jillian might refer to it as kicking butt, but in reality you are going to go through an intense array of exercise and diet activities, pushing yourself to the very edge of what you think you can handle and then pushing yourself a lot further than that before you get the chance to stop.\u00a0\u00a0You are going to have to give yourself fully over to a commitment to weight loss in this plan and it is by no means easy to accomplish.\u00a0\u00a0The results that you get at the end however make it more than worth it.\u00a0\u00a0They are simply glorious.\n7. Smoothie Diet\nSmoothies are defined in different ways, but at its heart a smoothie is basically a whipped drink.\u00a0\u00a0Now, naturally the smoothie diet is not referring to the drinks you can get from Dairy Queen or Starbucks as many of those drinks come with huge amounts of sugar and sodium attached.\u00a0\u00a0Rather, the smoothie diet refers to making yourself a fruit or vegetable (or both) smoothie at least once a day and then drinking that smoothie in place of one or more of your meals.\u00a0\u00a0Different versions of the diet are more specific, but at the heart of the concept is this idea of taking in a fruit or vegetable smoothie as a meal.\nWhat is so good about this method?\u00a0\u00a0Well, on the one hand, you are taking in a full serving or more of fruits and vegetables, which are easily the best things you can consume if you want to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, a smoothie for breakfast usually ends up replacing cereal or toast, both of which contain carbohydrates and therefore a smoothie also helps you reduce your intake of carbohydrates which are major contributors to weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, since smoothies contain a lot of air pockets, they tend to be quite filling, allowing you to feel full while eating less, something that once again contributes to quick weight loss.\n"}, {"score": 1587.2065, "uuid": "b3b6e567-7017-5d8d-95de-30cc5096e477", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0904wb-37-09304", "target_hostname": "www.rateddietpills.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rateddietpills.com/hoodia-weight-loss/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Hoodia <em>Weight</em> Loss | <em>Diet</em> Pills | <em>Diet</em> Pill Reviews | <em>Best</em> <em>Diet</em> Pills |", "snippet": "Besides, <em>the</em> manufacturer of UniqueHoodia <em>gives</em> you full 180 day money back guarantee, which means if you will not be happy with <em>weight</em> loss <em>results</em>, you will be able <em>to</em> get your money back quickly and easily with no questions asked.", "explanation": null, "document": "Privacy Policy\nHoodia Weight Loss\nFew years ago, Hoodia became a very popular weight loss aid, it became one of the top non-prescription weight loss supplements.\nBut now the scientific research has clearly spoken: there is a scientific proof that hoodia has effect on weight loss!\nWas this just an additional diet fad that eventually proved to be unreliable?

Each participant was weighed and had their height measured at the beginning of the study and then reported back five years later and filled in a detailed questionnaire about their diet.\nMeat Linked To Weight Gain\nThe research concluded that there was a strong positive correlation between weight gain and meat consumption in both men and women, irrespective of them being smokers or non-smokers.\nFurther analysis of the data revealed that the significant link remained even factoring in overall diet quality, physical exercise and other lifestyle considerations that may skew the outcome.\nThe study results indicated that for people who ate the same number of calories, an additional 250g of meat (approximately a small steak) saw an additional weight gain of 2kg (5lbs) in five years. Clearly this study runs counter to the recent weight loss trends that have advocated low carbohydrate, high protein diets, usually with a particular emphasis on meat consumption.\nWhat is not clear from the study is the precise mechanism by which meat consumption leads to increased weight. The leading theory contends that meat, being an energy-dense food, alters how the body regulates appetite. There may also be additional lifestyle reasons for the weight gain that were not considered in the research.\nRead Related Articles\n"}, {"score": 1586.0728, "uuid": "4aa8aa67-17eb-50f9-8e1a-637b8283c699", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0818wb-54-04215", "target_hostname": "themastercleanse.org", "target_uri": "http://themastercleanse.org/lose-weight-fast/", "page_rank": 2.333898e-09, "spam_rank": 75, "title": "<em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast", "snippet": "This is a Juice Fast that will help you <em>Lose</em> <em>Weight</em> Fast as well as any other <em>diet</em>, but <em>the</em> overall benefits are hard <em>to</em> deny.

Yeah, we all want things fast; cars, food, lifestyles, and Times at Ridgemont High. And the faster we put on 20lbs after highschool snarfing down too many of spicoloy\u2019s pizzas, the faster we want to lose weight.\nIt seems we all want the quick fix. And while The Master Cleanse is by far the most profound way to Lose Weight Fast, it really shouldn\u2019t be all about losing weight (although for most of you landing here, that\u2019s what it is about). I call The Master Cleanse the most effective\u00a0Fast Weight Loss program around, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a\u00a0Weight Loss Fast. Now if you\u2019re getting a little confused with those similar terms, I am sorry, because I am playing with you just a little. In truth, The Master Cleanse is so good for people who want to lose weight fast, because it is just that. A fast. Let\u2019s look at Wikipedia to start to understand fasting:\nFasting is primarily the act of willingly abstaining from some or all food, drink, or both, for a period of time. An absolute fast is normally defined as abstinence from all food and liquid for a defined period, usually a single day (24 hours), or several days. Other fasts may be only partially restrictive, limiting particular foods or substance. The fast may also be intermittent in nature. Fasting practices may preclude sexual intercourse and other activities as well as food.\nOk, so notice the part that I bolded. The Master Cleanse is a fast because it is a liquid diet, or a mono diet. A diet that restricts or limits to a certain food or substance, and that being the Lemonade of the Lemonade Diet.\nDo The Master Cleanse to Lose Weight Fast\nDoes one lose weight fast on The Master Cleanse? Stanley Burroughs , the inventor of The Lemonade Diet says:\nAs a reducing diet it is superior in every way to any other system because it dissolved and eliminates all types of fatty\u00a0tissue. Fat melts away at the rate of about two pounds a day for most persons \u2013and without any harmful side effects\nOf the tens of thousands of comments left on our website, all attest to the rate of fast weight loss that occurs while on The Master Cleanse. But I want to talk more about fasting, because to me that\u2019s the critical component. That\u2019s the healthy component. That\u2019s the spiritual and holistic component that seems so intuitive to living things that animals instinctively fast when they are sick. Think about your dog or cat. What do they do when they are sick? They go into a corner and sleep. Yet we have utterly rejected the concept in modern Western medicine. Thankfully we\u2019re slowly adopting a more complete world view in general due to the access to information like it has never been before. If we would have continued growing big-pharmacuetical companies and big-hospital companies, without the interent, we may have lost the practice of fasting to the history books burried at the back of Barnes and Noble.\nThere are many types of fasts beyond that of what one usually thinks of, the Water Fast. Truthfully the water fast is better left for the Bible and\u00a0intermittent\u00a0days on a juice fast. More often than not, the\u00a0successful\u00a0fasts today have some sort of mono diet component bei it the Lemonade or some other juice. It\u2019s a huge topic, and a controversial one that require an effort to discover the current realities, or most acceptable truths from the common perspective. Here\u2019s some fast facts about fasting from a nice little article I found :\nFasting may help your heart: Fasting for a day once a month may prevent heart disease and insulin resistance, the precursor to diabetes, according to two studies from Utah\u2019s Intermountain Medical Center presented recently at the American College of Cardiology\u2019s scientific sessions.\nThere\u2019s a chance fasting can cut cancer risk: Periods of fasting did slow the rate of cell division (a measure of cancer risk) in mice, according to an American Journal of Physiology study.\nThe jury\u2019s still out on fasting for other ailments: While there isn\u2019t much research on many of the diseases proponents claim fasting helps treat \u2014 multiple sclerosis,\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, and allergies among them \u2014 doctors say that if you\u2019re medically able to fast safely (which rules out those with more serious health issues), there\u2019s no research against doing it either\nIf you look to anecdotal evidence rather than clinical trials then you\u2019ll find all kinds of claims of \u201ccures\u201d from fasting, and The Master Cleans\nFasting can\u2019t take the place of a healthy diet: While there may be health perks to intermittent fasting, the research is still preliminary. Horne\u2019s lab is currently working on studies that will evaluate how often and for how long people need to fast to see health benefits.\nTalk to your doctor before you start a fasting regimen: While fasting may have the potential to play a role in wellness, it\u2019s definitely not for everyone. Specifically, if you have a history of\u00a0eating disorders, diabetes, low blood pressure, anemia, are pregnant or nursing, or are on prescription medication, as well as other conditions/circumstances.\nI have copied the first sentence from the authors summary on fasting and I agree with all of them. To a point and to a degree. In fact the only point I have learned from all of this, after 5 years of writing about the subject and studying peoples responses to their own attempts to lose weight fast and that is this:\nEveryone says there is \u201cNO\u201d evidence to support this or that. Be it the health claims, or danger claims for that matter. What studies do get done seem to have another one counter-claiming it in some way. One Doctor says this, another says that. But the list of proponents is long, and this article lists all the Doctor studies from history about the benefits of fasting . Here\u2019s another great article about fasting .\u00a0Three other pioneers of fasting for health are DR. Tanner\u2019s 40 day fasts, Dr E. H. Dewey fasting experience and Dr Hazzard\u2019s work for 30 years on therapeutic fasting.\nBooks about Fasting for Weight Loss\nDo a little\u00a0research\u00a0about fasting for yourself, and the act of fasting for not only weight loss, but also for the treatment of disease. There are hundreds of books on Amazon.com about fasting. Go there right now and search for \u201cFasting\u201d. There are pages and pages of results, from Doctors, scientists, and in-home-self-practitioners like myself who have discovered their own truths about their own experiences. Look for how many are negative and how many are\u00a0positive. Do you see any books that say \u201cDANGERS of FASTING\u201d. Then look to see how many people have reviewed these books. There are thousands of reviews. And they all seem to be 4 stars or more.\nHere\u2019s a break down of my favourites:\nFasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor\u2019s Program for Conquering Disease:\nJoel Fuhrman M.D. is a board-certified family physician, best-selling author and nutritional researcher who specializes in preventing and reversing disease through nutritional and natural methods.

SOS SOS !\nsevie : Welcome rachel_n22! Congratulations on your weightloss so far. I'm really sorry to hear about this serie of unfortunate events. You should do 3 days of PP and then get back to the cruise phase instructions all the while staying away from tolerated items for the next 4 days and greatly increase your physical activity. Know that the extra days of PP were given in this particular case and at no point and time should you decided to do 3pp days on your own as this could then result in stagnation and even a reverse effect.

Also can I have low sugar, low fat desserts from the shop as I'm having difficulty making from the menu. Many thanks\nbettina : Hi lobl123, that is an excellent question. You are right the problem with fruche is that it contains a lot of added sugar. As far as we are aware there is no natural variety of fruche. If you do happen to find a natural fruche with no added sugar you would be able to have it. As for desserts please make sure they contain no added sugar and carbohydrates. Most diet dessert contain a lot of sugar to make up for the low percentage of fat. Why don't you have a look in your recipe book for some dukan friendly recipes?

This does not seem right i have never had to take supplements with balanced diets and have lost weight. is this diet not working for me? Will i not lose weight without these? I have been very committed and not lapsed at all!\nsevie : welcome callygirl! You sound worried; to reassure you know that Devorcal is something that you can take to increase the weight loss rate but this is not an obligation. Have you been feeling constipated lately? Because this would explain the lack of weight loss you have had these past few days. Do not give up callygirl, we will find a solution to this problem :) Have a great weekend!\namandafaolain : i have fallen off the diet in the cruise phase, as i had hit a plateau and i tend to get lonely and eat at night, or buy cake for my little boy, then eat it myself! can i start again? how do you get back on track\nbettina : Hi amandafaolain and welcome. I understand that you want to kick-start your diet and we will be more than happy to help you. To restart your programme please do 2 days of Pure Protein (PP) starting tomorrow. The best way to avoid not having cakes and sweets is to simply not buy them. Your son might not even miss eating his cakes. Don't forget that what we eat during our childhood influences our eating habits in later life. So focus on being a good example to your son. Please don't ever hesitate to contact us for support! Have a fantastic weekend.\nbubu70 : I had to go out to celebrate my sons birthday, how do you get restaurants to grill meat with no fat and salds with no dressings, they laughed at me last night, said my meal compared to a decaf coffee - why bother? when I explained I had a health problem they replied \"stay at home\"!!!!!!! This will not help the obese people I was absoluely surrounded by. Won't be going out in a hurry again.\nsevie : I'm really sorry to hear that bubu70; Welcome to our chat by the way. I know this can be hard but you have to be strong and will be an outsider for a while but it will be worth it in the end. Take the list of 100 allowed foods the next time you go out so that you have a much wider range of choice, and know that you can come and speak to other Dukan dieters via our forum and Facebook. You are not alone!\namina1502 : Hi I sent a question just before the chat but dont know if you got it. Sorry if I have duplicated! I'm on day four of attack and didnt lose anything yet. Im a muslim and I cant get halal beef easily so can I use lamb or minced lamb instead. Also is Worcestershire sauce okay to use. Thanks for the support!\nbettina : Hi amina! I'm surprised you haven't lost anything yet. Have you been following your daily instructions? Are you suffering from constipation or water retention? Please feel free to contact us via email in your slimming apartment. Have a nice day!\namina1502 : Hi, Im on day four of the attack and didnt lose anything yet. Hope something happens soon! I'm a muslim and cannot easily find halal beef so could I use lamb/lamb mince instead. Also is Worcestershire sause okay to use. Thanks for all the support.\nbettina : Hi again amina1502, I'm afraid you're not allowed to have lamb until the consolidation phase. Worcester Sauce is not allowed as it contains too many carbohydrates and is too salty.\nboudhy : I was in a protein diet already before to start your diet. they are two days that i follow the attack phase perfectly and i put on two kilos ...... what do i need to do ? do i need to diminish the portion\nsevie : Welcome boudhy! As long as you are eating allowed foods, there is no need for you to worry about the portions. I think you are constipated, you should make sure you drink about 2 litres of fluids per day. We recommend drinking really cold, almost icy water. Increase your oat bran intake to 3 table spoons per day. You could also try increasing your daily exercise. You can have up to 200 grammes of baked rhubarb to help to ease your constipation. Our Dukan Diet Online Shop also sells a number of slimming aids including the Digestive Aid Fruit Squares which will help to ease constipation.\ngillforduk : but i was under the impression it had to be no more than 1.5 litres - that is what it said\nbettina : Hi again, it's in between 1.5 lires and 2 litres of fluids you are supposed to drink per day.\navrilo : Are there any tips to control appetite I have a massively busy life and have piled on weight in the last 3 months I am active but am really unhappy with my weight now up at 72kg\nsevie : Hi avrilo, do you mean appetite supressants? Know that as long as you are eating allowed foods, even if it is often, this should not be of an issue. I noticed that you are in the consolidation phase, know that you weight will go up and down throughout this stage which is completely normal as you are in the process of consolidating it. Have a great weekend!\nwynandjacobus : Sorry for all the questions, but what about provita's? Am I only allowed to eat the above foods in the final stage or will some of them be available in the consolidation phase?\nbettina : Hi again wybabdjacobus, it is recommded to have 2 slices of wholemeal bread during the consilidation phase. Provitas contain too much fat and are therefore not allowed.\nnannette : Thank you for all your advice i am now losing weight againNannette\nbettina : I'm very happy to hear that nannette! Keep going and have a great weekend!\nannelie_svensson : I am curious about your thoughts on weighing every day as opposed to weighing for instance once a week.\nsevie : Hi annelie_svensson! Great question, we want you to weight yourself on a daily basis for your daily report; it gives us a better visual on your weight loss. We have come to realize that most people lose their motivation if they do not see the scales budge even if it is one day, and so you can weight yourself 4 times a week if you'd like; this way you do not despair nor become too obsessed with the scales and we can maintain a good visual on your weight loss. Have a great weekend!\nmellopes : Another question: I read in the Forum that apart from your 2 spoons of oatbran we are allowed in the cruise phase I can have two more as a tolerated food. Is that true ?\nbettina : Hi mellopes, please try not to have more than 2 tbsp of oat bran per day during the cruise phase. Please have look in your slimming apartment for the list of tolerated foods.\nmellopes : Hi!!! I'd like to ask about jello. I thought we could have sugar free jello as much as we want but was told that only 300 g is allowed in the cruise phase. This amout of 300g is after it is made or is the sachet content. thanks.\nbettina : Hi again mellopes, 300g relates to the ready made product.\nannelie_svensson : When I crave for a sweet chocolate dessert, I have mixed about 5 table spoons (a lot, I know...) of unsweetened organic cocoa powder in my 0,2 % fat unsweetened natural quark (about 2 dl) together with some vanilla powder and artificial sweetener. Is this okay for worst case cravings or totally bad? If it is bad \u2013 do you have a suggestion that would be better, please? Thanks in advance, Annelie\nsevie : Welcome annelie_svensson! Try to keep it to 1 coffee spoon as far as the cocoa powder and you should be fine. Also change the vanilla powder to vanilla flavoring and you are ok. That is a wonderful idea by the way :) I hope you have a great weekend!\nAnnmaud : Tonight I am at a very big dinner celebration for a good friend. It is an occasion I have been thinking about since I started my diet on Tuesday and I have decided that I cannot refuse the food that is handed to me as I would deeply offend my friend. My question is what is likely to happen to my weight curve tomorrow as if I am prepared to see some weight going on it won;t imapct on my motivation which is very high at the moment. In future I will work around meals and stick to the diet as much as is possible when you are being entertained but this event is non negotiable unfortunately. Please do not reply that I must not eat her food as that will not help me in anyway. Thanks\nsevie : Welcome to the chat Annmaud! We all have offers we cannot refuse, and celebrations but at the end of the day, you are responsible for what goes into your stomach. Your body will show you no mercy upon this and needless to say that there will be weight gain, stagnation, and this will take a while before you can recuperate from this. I hope you have a great weekend!\nLorief : I keep entering my report but you keep thinking that I haven't. Is there a contact number or email to contact you\nsevie : Welcome Lorief, Have you completely filled out your report? if you'd like you con contact us so that we can fill it out together. Mon-Fri from 8.30am to 11am and from 1am to 4.30pm (UK GMT) on phone number (+44 0)844 338 0105. Have a great weekend!\nMedusaGorgon : Hi there, please advise how many oat bran pancakes I can eat during the cruise phase? Can I add to my meal cayenne? thanks\nbettina : Hi MedusaGorgon, you are allowed to have 2tbsp of oat bran per day during the cruise phase. You can therefore either make 2 very small or 1 big pancake using your daily oat bran allowance. I'm not sure what you're referring to with meal cayenne. If you mean cayenne pepper you can add it to your pancakes. Have a nice weekend and please contact us if you have any other questions.\nLuizasams : Good Morning! I was traveling during the Carnival for 5 days ,and really did'nt keep from drinking two glasses of Prosecco per day . My food away from home, always come with plenty of oil, compared to food that I do at my home. I really wish to continue the cruise phase, because I would like my true weight was 54 kg instead of 57, 7lbs on February 23 . graciously, Ana Luiza\nsevie : Welcome Luizasams! You have to quickly get back on track by increasing your physical activities, staying away from tolerated items for the next 4 days, and following the diet to the fullest of extent; lapse free. Also we are not going to modify your true weight as 57.7kg is the weight we feel your body will feel most comfortable in; going underneath your true weight will result in constant effort and high risks of a weight rebound. I hope you have a great weekend! :)\nGeorginaSA : Hello. To my enormous surprise I weghed this morning my true weight and\u2026 on the expected day so I mad my deadline. Can't quite believe it. I sganated so much so to all of you out there: hang in, it is happening. Can I keep cruising for the timebeing as I find I will go up for a few day and come down again. I would like my heaviest weight IE after PV day to be my true weight. Is that okay? It has been such a pleasure. My lapses that I did not have have been removed from my curve. All great and I amrecommending this way of eating to all who will listen. I will now wait for instructions.\nsevie : Hi GeorginaSA! Congratulations on having reached your true weight! :) i'm not sure I have fully understood your statement about your heaviest weight...Congratulations again; we are very proud of you and you make a great example to other Dukan dieters out there. I'm sure you will have a great weekend!\nnannette : is it possible to get my initial measurements from you when i enrolled as i would like to see how i have improved. Thank you for all your help\nsevie : Hello nannette! we will sent you your measurments via your slimming apartment so be sure to look out for those. Have a great day!\nmellopes : Hi, I'm im my cruise phase and would like to know about protein powder. Some recipes in the website have them as ingredientes but in the forum it says that is not allowed. Can we have them or not. And about Wheat Bran and Baking powder are they tolerated food ? I can't find it in my slimming apartmente. How much of it can we have in a day ? thanks\nsevie : Hi mellopes! and welcome! You are not allowed to have protein powder to create shakes; this is only to be used in the specific amount given for baking purposes. I hope this clarifies everything out for you. Have a great weekend!\nmellopes : Hello!! It's me again. I think the questions just keep coming... How much of tofu can we have daily ? Are they for the PP or PV days ? Are there any diference in the quantities for tofu and silken tofu ? I can't find fat free cocoa powder but I found one without sugar added it has only the natural sugar which is 1.9 g and 21 g fat this values are for 100 g of cocoa. Do you think it is possible to use half quantity for the recipes ? thanks.\nsevie : Mellopes, You can have an unlimited amount of tofu or silken tofu on both PP and PV days. As far as cocoa powder goes, you have it right, it can have up to 20% of fat and has to be sugar free so you are fine. Have a great day!\nkazcr1971 : HI Sevie d, I am in perfect health, other than being over weight. I am feeling fine just seem to be stuck at same weight for the 5 days now prior to this i have had 3 days staying the same. I have never had a big appetite even before starting diet and could go all day with out eating! I know this is not good.\nsevie : Hi kazcr1971! You are right, this is not good at all. For the sake of this diet, I will have to ask you to make an effort and have at least 3 meals per day as skipping meals will not benefit you at all. Have a great day!\nGeorginaSA : With heaviest weight I mean that the weight fluctuates somewhat. After PV I am a bit heavier again so I want to be my true weight the right weight after PV day, oh dear too complicated? So sorry hope you understand it now? Thank you for your answer.\nbettina : Hi again GeorginaSA, yes we understand what you mean. You might be suffering from water retention? Don't worry too much about not achieving your true weight by your scheduled date. You body is no robot and it is normal that the time to lose weight varies from individual to individual. Your weight will always fluctuate a little bit.\nmod : The chat is now over. Thank you very much for your participation!

Diets such as low-carb, low-fat, zone, cabbage soup and other celebrity diets, have become popular amongst many people trying to lose weight. However, it is common knowledge that such diets do not give a long lasting result to restore a healthy weight. Put simply: they do not work!\nAiming to lose weight by reducing our food intake or restricting calories reduces the intake of vital nutrients, resulting in poor health and putting our own bodies at risk. The body starts to give messages such as tiredness, stress, depression, anxiety, digestive disorders and food sensitivities, that soon become common complaints. In addition, poor nutrition can also contribute to the development of serious conditions, and even cancer.\nRestoring a proper balance of body, mind and emotions, promotes well-being inside and out. This fascinating field is what is known as \u201cNaturopathy\u201d. Naturopathy includes methods such as Nutritional Therapy or Naturopathic Nutrition; a theory of health using food, and its elements, as medicines. Naturopathy is based on treating the person as a \u201cwhole being\u201d, composed of body mind and soul, looking for deficiencies which are specific to each individual.\nConsulting a Naturopathic Nutritionist normally takes about an hour. During this time you will be asked questions about your diet and lifestyle. Once all of the information is gathered, a plan is formulated providing all the necessary vitamins and minerals in quantities to meet your individual needs. This includes an adequate intake of calories, protein, fat and carbohydrates, and a wide variety of foods. Moreover, a Naturopathic plan involves regular exercise, reducing stress, improving digestion and enhancing the immune system.\nNaturopathic Nutrition uses tools such as juicing, a delicious way to take essential nutrients from fruits and vegetables, which are a major source of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Juicing is an excellent way to get these important nutrients into our bodies as juices are easier to absorb and digest. Juicing also helps to remove waste and toxins, boost the immune system and energy levels, and provide cancer fighting antioxidants.\nVegetables such as cabbage, kale, beetroot, spinach, wheatgrass and even garlic, can be added to fruit juices. You will be fascinated to discover the taste of a colourful delicious drink, full of a variety of important nutrients, ready to be absorbed by the body.\nAs a general rule to healthy eating, you should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, or make fresh juices, eat a variety of foods including carbohydrates, proteins and healthy fats. Avoid big meals, and instead eat smaller portions more often. It is vital that you drink plenty of water.\n"}]]}
