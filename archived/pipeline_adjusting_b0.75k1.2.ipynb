       "  'document': 'packaging\\nCaffeine and Tea\\nOriginally called \"theine\", caffeine was first discovered in tea in 1827. It was later shown that the \"theine\" of tea was identical with the caffeine of coffee, and the term \"theine\" was then dropped. While the caffeine in tea and coffee are, technically, identical, the experience is different due to three key factors:\\n1. There is significantly less caffeine in the average cup of tea - especially when including green and white teas, as these are brewed at shorter times and cooler temperatures.\\n2. L-theanine, an amino acid found only in tea, has a relaxing effect that counteracts the jitteriness of caffeine without reducing the increase in alertness.\\n3. The high levels of antioxidants found in tea slow the body\\'s absorption of caffeine - resulting in a gentler increase of the chemical in the system and a longer period of alertness with no crash at the end.\\nThe biggest myth about the caffeine content between coffee and tea is that tea contains more caffeine than coffee. While this is true when measuring coffee and tea in its dry form, this is false when comparing brewed coffee and tea. After all, we normally use 2 grams of tea per 6 ounce cup, and 10 grams of coffee for the same quantity of water. A widely cited 2004 British study looked at 200 cups prepared by consumers going about their normal brewing routines. It found that the average caffeine level in the cups of tea (black English style teas) was 40mg vs 105mg in the average cup of drip coffee.\\nThe amount of caffeine in tea depends on a number of factors, including the method and length of brewing or steeping. Studies also show that leaf location on the tea plant affects content of caffeine in that tea. The youngest leaves, highest on the plant, contain the greatest concentration of caffeine AND antioxidants.\\nThe greatest impact on caffeine content is the water temperature and length of steeping time. Black, Oolong, Green and White tea leaves themselves have surprisingly similar caffeine content. But a tea steeped for five minutes in boiling water is going to transfer a LOT more caffeine to the cup than a tea steeped for two minutes at 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Let\\'s be clear: Oxidation does NOT increase the amount of caffeine in tea. There is no scientific basis to this common myth, and it results simply from measuring the caffeine in the cup after typical brewing methods and incorrectly crediting those results to the tea itself.\\nWhile it\\'s difficult (and usually incorrect) to make broad factual statements about how much caffeine is in Green Tea vs. Black tea, the varieties used (sinensis vs. assamica), growing methods (shade or high grown vs. low grown) and leaves selected (new vs. old growth) make the following teas stand out in their class:\\nRelatively low caffeine\\n',\n",

That’s actually less caffeine than a cup of coffee.\\nOn the other hand, tea is going to supply vitamins and minerals that colas just won’t give you. Colas are, after all, called “empty calories” for a reason. Other than a bit of fluoride, they’re essentially void of anything “nutritious”.

While a 30-second ‘wash’ under Spiro’s rather extreme laboratory conditions (small leaf CTC tea, loose in the ‘pot’ rather than in a teabag, at constant temperature and stirred vigorously) leached 20% of caffeine rather than the 9% yielded by Hicks’s more normal steeping, neither of these scientifically conducted findings comes anywhere near the 30-second/ 80%-decaffeination claims perpetuated as an Internet Myth.”\\nFinally,\\xa0Mr. Melican provides links to informational sites that serve to make us (or me) even more unsure of what to tell customers to feel 100% accurate:\\n“http://nobleharbor.com/tea/caffiene.html [sic]\\nThis page supports the information given above – summarizes the Hicks et al paper, and in places borrows some of my own data, with a few (unimportant) errors. It debunks some of the popular caffeine myths and concludes ‘all teas have roughly similar caffeine contents, and one cannot rely on the belief that green tea has less caffeine, as asserted by many popular claims.’\\nhttp://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/phytochemicals/tea/\\nThe Linus Pauling Institute gives a fairly inconclusive comment on the level of caffeine in tea showing data (from just 20 snapshot analyses) that the green teas they analyzed varied from 40 to 211 mg/liter, while the black teas varied from 177 to 303 mg/liter — a larger and more representative sample of the worlds [sic] teas could have would have [sic] increased these ranges and the overlap considerably. However, LPI do suggest that the popular belief of low caffeine level in White Tea is misplaced: ‘Buds and young tea leaves have been found to contain higher levels of caffeine than older leaves, suggesting that the caffeine content of some white teas may be slightly higher than that of green teas.’”\\nI’m thankful that “tea scientists” with the status of Nigel Melican have taken the time to talk about the subject of caffeine in tea.\\xa0 Whatever our beliefs, there is definitely caffeine in tea, and since we don’t carry any decaf teas, we kindly point those who don’t want any caffeine at all to the wonderful assortment of herbals we also carry.\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'Caffeine Go?\\nBy Serena Norr\\nDecaf coffee is just one of the growing segments in the coffee market. The extraction of coffee is an intricate process where the removed caffeine is converted into items that we enjoy in our everyday lives - sodas, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products.\\nCaffeine is a natural stimulant that is found in numerous plant species whose purpose is to act as a natural pesticide to ward off predatory insects. As far as consumption is concerned, caffeine has many sources that are found in chocolate, pharmaceutical products, tea and, of course, coffee. According to the Coffee Research Institute located in Long Beach, California, \\x93In the U.S., almost 90% of Americans consume caffeine daily. Many consumers enjoy the taste of coffee but do not want the caffeine due to a variety of reasons often attributed to health and wellness reasons.\\x94 Decaf coffee offers consumers such an alternative. According to coffee broker and author, Tim Castle, \\x93The demand for decaf in North America will increase over the coming years as our population ages. Since exclusive decaf drinkers (those who drink most of the decaf consumed) generally choose decaf for health reasons, they want to know that their decaf choice is a healthy one and one that is also decaffeinated within established guidelines. Further, decaf drinkers will demand an increasingly better cup of decaf as the general level of coffee quality improves in restaurants, coffee houses and in what whole bean is available in grocery stores and through the internet.\\x94\\nThe aim of decaffeination is to produce a blend, which retains its aroma and taste despite the processes, which are necessary to remove the caffeine. Since most flavor components develop during roasting, coffee is almost always decaffeinated in the green bean form. According to the Coffee Research Institute, \\x93The levels of caffeine are controlled by the federal government in decaffeinated coffees, and in order for a coffee to be called \\x91Decaf,\\x92 green coffee beans must have undergone one of several decaffeinating processes to remove 97% of the caffeine resident in the bean.\\x94\\nAccording to the Certified Processing Corporation located in New Jersey, \\x93All methods of decaffeination basically involve soaking green coffee in a liquid tank to expel the caffeine. Some processes require an effort to re-inject lost flavor back into the beans. Then they are washed numerous times, dried and bagged. After decaffeination we have always wondered what happens to the caffeine. There are many decaffeinating processes, some using chemicals solvents, some gasses and some only steam or water.\\x94\\nThe decaffeination process involves removing caffeine from coffee beans, mate, cocoa, tea leaves and other materials containing caffeine. (While caffeine-free soft drinks are occasionally referred to as \\x91decaffeinated,\\x92 some are actually prepared by simply omitting caffeine from production.) With all the consumption of decaffeinated beverages, it is interesting to wonder where the caffeine goes after extraction.\\nMost decaf coffees are made using a chemical process first employed in Europe. This process involves soaking the beans in water and then \\x93washing\\x94 them in methylene chloride to absorb the caffeine from the bean. After this, the beans are rinsed clean of the chemicals, dried and shipped to the coffee roasters. Italian decaf processor Demus Spa states, \\x93According to many experts and thanks to its high solvent capacities, this system is considered the best of all, and allows the organoleptic properties of coffee to remain intact.\\x94 \\x93The coffee processed through the \\x91Demus procedure,\\x92 besides being decaffeinated, is cleaned, and most waxes are removed (it is also possible to certify the coffee as \\x91wax free\\x92 at request and with an additional cost),\\x94 as stated on Demus\\x92 website. The advantage of this method is that it provides decaf coffee with more flavor than the other processes. Although there is virtually no trace of any chemicals left in the bean after roasting, some people are uncomfortable knowing that the coffee they are drinking was chemically processed.\\nAccording to The Coffee Institute, \\x93Another, more expensive, way of extracting caffeine is by steeping it in supercritical carbon dioxide. This requires exposing the beans to the hellish conditions required to make CO2 go supercritical, 300 atmospheres of pressure and 70°C. CO2 under these conditions has the density of a liquid but the viscosity (rather, the lack of viscosity) of a gas, so it can integrate itself pretty deeply into the beans. It\\x92s then drawn off and filtered to be used again, and the beans are allowed to dry, removing any remaining (non-toxic) carbon dioxide.\\x94\\nAnother method utilizes natural components. Maximus Coffee Group located in Houston, Texas utilizes a sparkling water process. According to Carlos deAldecoa Bueno, president of Maximus Coffee, \\x93We operate the second largest decaffeination plant in the world, which is all natural and uses no chemicals. This extraction is achieved using only ultra-pure water and supercritical carbon dioxide. Our facility is green certified by the EPA and does not use chemicals, which results in a chemical free product.\\x94 According to Maximus Coffee, \\x93This process involves placing green coffee through a set of cleaners to remove the silver skin and dust from the coffee. The beans are then moisturized using steam and ultra-pure water. After the moisturizing step, the beans are transferred to an extraction vessel, where the beans make contact with natural carbon dioxide and ultra-pure water to remove the caffeine. At over 3500 psig, the fluid moves through the bed of wet beans, removing only the caffeine from the coffee. After a preset amount of extraction time, the beans are discharged from the extraction vessel to the dryers, where they are gently dried and then cooled. The caffeine-laden CO2/ultra-pure water mixture is then sent to a depressurizing chamber where by reducing the pressure the caffeine drops out of the mixture. The CO2 is recovered and reused in the process. Caffeine is recovered by concentrating the ultra-pure water containing the caffeine and the vapor is condensed and sent through a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration to be reused in the process. The result is naturally decaffeinated coffee boasting full, natural flavor and aroma with no lingering residue from chemical solvents.\\x94\\nSwiss water processing uses no chemicals, but rather hot water and steam to remove the caffeine from the coffee. The bean is taken into the water and then the water solution put through activated charcoal filters to remove the caffeine. According to Swiss Water\\x92s website, \\x93The now caffeine-free water flows back to the beans to remove more caffeine.\\x94 Once the caffeine is removed, these same beans are then put back into the decaffeinated solution to re-absorb to the process to start the next batch of beans. \\x93This process continues for approximately eight hours, until the beans are 99.9% caffeine-free,\\x94 stated Swiss Water\\x92s website.\\nExtraction of Coffee\\nThe decaffeination processes involves treating the green coffee beans with a solvent, then removing the caffeine-laden solvent from the beans. The three main methods of decaffeination in commercial use today are: chemical solvents, supercritical gases or water and caffeine-free extracts.\\nAccording to Carlos deAldecoa Bueno, \\x93the caffeine is recovered using evaporation and crystallization. There are no waste streams out of the process.\\x94\\nOur decaffeination process is the most selective and fastest extraction process; this allows us to produce coffee which most closely resembles the original green coffee and we do not remove any of the flavor or color components from the coffee.\\x94\\nAccording to Demus, \\x93Nearly all the solvent is recuperated and can be used again. This stage is carried out with great care for financial reasons (all products used are very expensive so waste is kept to a minimum), for legal reasons (there are laws which set maximum limits on solvent residue in coffee) and for ecological reasons, since decaffeination companies have to be very sensitive regarding this issue.\\x94\\nAccording to the Coffee Research Institute, \\x93The chemical composition of decaffeinated coffee is altered, and therefore the flavor and aroma are changed. After the decaffeination process, processing companies no longer throw the caffeine away. Some of American\\x92s favorite diet products that contain caffeine come from decaffeination plants. There are several options for caffeine that often involves selling the remains to other companies for additional usage. Certified Processing Corp. revealed, \\x93We sell caffeine to pharmaceutical companies who use it in a number of different products.\\x94 The DeCaf Company added, \\x93The caffeine which is removed from the solvent by distillation has many commercial applications, for example in pharmaceuticals and as a flavoring agent. Traces of solvent still adhering to the beans are forced out by further steaming and the coffee is then dried.\\x94 Caffeine is also sold to soft drink companies where it is extracted into sodas and energy drinks.\\nRetaining Flavor\\nCaffeine extraction is expensive, and some of coffee\\x92s more fragile flavor ingredients are always lost or changed in the extraction process. Recent advances in biotechnology may make caffeine extraction obsolete.

       "  'document': 'Caffeine Go?\\nBy Serena Norr\\nDecaf coffee is just one of the growing segments in the coffee market. The extraction of coffee is an intricate process where the removed caffeine is converted into items that we enjoy in our everyday lives - sodas, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products.\\nCaffeine is a natural stimulant that is found in numerous plant species whose purpose is to act as a natural pesticide to ward off predatory insects. As far as consumption is concerned, caffeine has many sources that are found in chocolate, pharmaceutical products, tea and, of course, coffee. According to the Coffee Research Institute located in Long Beach, California, \\x93In the U.S., almost 90% of Americans consume caffeine daily. Many consumers enjoy the taste of coffee but do not want the caffeine due to a variety of reasons often attributed to health and wellness reasons.\\x94 Decaf coffee offers consumers such an alternative. According to coffee broker and author, Tim Castle, \\x93The demand for decaf in North America will increase over the coming years as our population ages. Since exclusive decaf drinkers (those who drink most of the decaf consumed) generally choose decaf for health reasons, they want to know that their decaf choice is a healthy one and one that is also decaffeinated within established guidelines. Further, decaf drinkers will demand an increasingly better cup of decaf as the general level of coffee quality improves in restaurants, coffee houses and in what whole bean is available in grocery stores and through the internet.\\x94\\nThe aim of decaffeination is to produce a blend, which retains its aroma and taste despite the processes, which are necessary to remove the caffeine. Since most flavor components develop during roasting, coffee is almost always decaffeinated in the green bean form. According to the Coffee Research Institute, \\x93The levels of caffeine are controlled by the federal government in decaffeinated coffees, and in order for a coffee to be called \\x91Decaf,\\x92 green coffee beans must have undergone one of several decaffeinating processes to remove 97% of the caffeine resident in the bean.\\x94\\nAccording to the Certified Processing Corporation located in New Jersey, \\x93All methods of decaffeination basically involve soaking green coffee in a liquid tank to expel the caffeine. Some processes require an effort to re-inject lost flavor back into the beans. Then they are washed numerous times, dried and bagged. After decaffeination we have always wondered what happens to the caffeine. There are many decaffeinating processes, some using chemicals solvents, some gasses and some only steam or water.\\x94\\nThe decaffeination process involves removing caffeine from coffee beans, mate, cocoa, tea leaves and other materials containing caffeine. (While caffeine-free soft drinks are occasionally referred to as \\x91decaffeinated,\\x92 some are actually prepared by simply omitting caffeine from production.) With all the consumption of decaffeinated beverages, it is interesting to wonder where the caffeine goes after extraction.\\nMost decaf coffees are made using a chemical process first employed in Europe. This process involves soaking the beans in water and then \\x93washing\\x94 them in methylene chloride to absorb the caffeine from the bean. After this, the beans are rinsed clean of the chemicals, dried and shipped to the coffee roasters. Italian decaf processor Demus Spa states, \\x93According to many experts and thanks to its high solvent capacities, this system is considered the best of all, and allows the organoleptic properties of coffee to remain intact.\\x94 \\x93The coffee processed through the \\x91Demus procedure,\\x92 besides being decaffeinated, is cleaned, and most waxes are removed (it is also possible to certify the coffee as \\x91wax free\\x92 at request and with an additional cost),\\x94 as stated on Demus\\x92 website. The advantage of this method is that it provides decaf coffee with more flavor than the other processes. Although there is virtually no trace of any chemicals left in the bean after roasting, some people are uncomfortable knowing that the coffee they are drinking was chemically processed.\\nAccording to The Coffee Institute, \\x93Another, more expensive, way of extracting caffeine is by steeping it in supercritical carbon dioxide. This requires exposing the beans to the hellish conditions required to make CO2 go supercritical, 300 atmospheres of pressure and 70°C. CO2 under these conditions has the density of a liquid but the viscosity (rather, the lack of viscosity) of a gas, so it can integrate itself pretty deeply into the beans. It\\x92s then drawn off and filtered to be used again, and the beans are allowed to dry, removing any remaining (non-toxic) carbon dioxide.\\x94\\nAnother method utilizes natural components. Maximus Coffee Group located in Houston, Texas utilizes a sparkling water process. According to Carlos deAldecoa Bueno, president of Maximus Coffee, \\x93We operate the second largest decaffeination plant in the world, which is all natural and uses no chemicals. This extraction is achieved using only ultra-pure water and supercritical carbon dioxide. Our facility is green certified by the EPA and does not use chemicals, which results in a chemical free product.\\x94 According to Maximus Coffee, \\x93This process involves placing green coffee through a set of cleaners to remove the silver skin and dust from the coffee. The beans are then moisturized using steam and ultra-pure water. After the moisturizing step, the beans are transferred to an extraction vessel, where the beans make contact with natural carbon dioxide and ultra-pure water to remove the caffeine. At over 3500 psig, the fluid moves through the bed of wet beans, removing only the caffeine from the coffee. After a preset amount of extraction time, the beans are discharged from the extraction vessel to the dryers, where they are gently dried and then cooled. The caffeine-laden CO2/ultra-pure water mixture is then sent to a depressurizing chamber where by reducing the pressure the caffeine drops out of the mixture. The CO2 is recovered and reused in the process. Caffeine is recovered by concentrating the ultra-pure water containing the caffeine and the vapor is condensed and sent through a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration to be reused in the process. The result is naturally decaffeinated coffee boasting full, natural flavor and aroma with no lingering residue from chemical solvents.\\x94\\nSwiss water processing uses no chemicals, but rather hot water and steam to remove the caffeine from the coffee. The bean is taken into the water and then the water solution put through activated charcoal filters to remove the caffeine. According to Swiss Water\\x92s website, \\x93The now caffeine-free water flows back to the beans to remove more caffeine.\\x94 Once the caffeine is removed, these same beans are then put back into the decaffeinated solution to re-absorb to the process to start the next batch of beans. \\x93This process continues for approximately eight hours, until the beans are 99.9% caffeine-free,\\x94 stated Swiss Water\\x92s website.\\nExtraction of Coffee\\nThe decaffeination processes involves treating the green coffee beans with a solvent, then removing the caffeine-laden solvent from the beans. The three main methods of decaffeination in commercial use today are: chemical solvents, supercritical gases or water and caffeine-free extracts.\\nAccording to Carlos deAldecoa Bueno, \\x93the caffeine is recovered using evaporation and crystallization. There are no waste streams out of the process.\\x94\\nOur decaffeination process is the most selective and fastest extraction process; this allows us to produce coffee which most closely resembles the original green coffee and we do not remove any of the flavor or color components from the coffee.\\x94\\nAccording to Demus, \\x93Nearly all the solvent is recuperated and can be used again. This stage is carried out with great care for financial reasons (all products used are very expensive so waste is kept to a minimum), for legal reasons (there are laws which set maximum limits on solvent residue in coffee) and for ecological reasons, since decaffeination companies have to be very sensitive regarding this issue.\\x94\\nAccording to the Coffee Research Institute, \\x93The chemical composition of decaffeinated coffee is altered, and therefore the flavor and aroma are changed. After the decaffeination process, processing companies no longer throw the caffeine away. Some of American\\x92s favorite diet products that contain caffeine come from decaffeination plants. There are several options for caffeine that often involves selling the remains to other companies for additional usage. Certified Processing Corp. revealed, \\x93We sell caffeine to pharmaceutical companies who use it in a number of different products.\\x94 The DeCaf Company added, \\x93The caffeine which is removed from the solvent by distillation has many commercial applications, for example in pharmaceuticals and as a flavoring agent. Traces of solvent still adhering to the beans are forced out by further steaming and the coffee is then dried.\\x94 Caffeine is also sold to soft drink companies where it is extracted into sodas and energy drinks.\\nRetaining Flavor\\nCaffeine extraction is expensive, and some of coffee\\x92s more fragile flavor ingredients are always lost or changed in the extraction process. Recent advances in biotechnology may make caffeine extraction obsolete. The DeCaf Company, located in San Francisco, California utilizes a method for coffee without giving up flavor by employing technology that can be used to extract caffeine from coffee, tea or sodas. According to chief executive Mel Stuckey, \\x93The company has come up with a wand-like instrument that bears a resemblance to a tongue depressor and lets the holder literally \\x91stir\\x92 the caffeine out of a drink, which is reported to extract about 70% of the caffeine according to the company\\x92s research. Caffeine-hungry polymers coat the stick, grabbing and pulling the hyped-up molecules out of the drink.\\x94 According to Carlos deAldecoa Bueno, \\x93caffeine is naturally bitter in taste, decaffeinated coffees will be milder in taste due to the removal of this bitter note.\\x94\\nDepending on whom you ask, companies are adamant about their extraction method in retaining flavor. The true judge comes from the roaster that knows what best works for the blend of the coffee. According to Java Jacks located in Texas, \\x93Our blends are decaffeinated through a natural water process that offers the highest possible flavor retention available to decaf beans.\\x94 According to Demus, \\x93The methylene process offers the best flavor retention but it is also the most understood.\\x94 Volcanic Red, a coffee company based in Arizona stated, \\x93The majority of our decafs we sell are the methylene chloride, since they produce the best tasting decaffeinated coffees (with zero residual solvent particles).\\x94\\nCaffeinated Products\\nOnce the caffeine is extracted companies sell its properties for various usages. According to Carlos deAldecoa Bueno, \\x93The caffeine is recovered using evaporation and crystallization. There are no waste streams out of the process. We sell our caffeine to the beverage industry as an all natural and naturally extracted caffeine.\\x94 Diet pills and cosmetic companies are the largest consumers of caffeine. The recent trend in caffeine-enhanced cosmetics has been getting international recognition, with everyone from morning news shows to large beauty magazines investigating the effects of the additive. Beauty companies use caffeine that has properties believed to do everything from reduce cellulite to enhance lips, but the three main ways caffeine is said to work on the skin is: as a vasoconstrictor, an antioxidant and a diuretic. Because of this, caffeine can be found in body wash, soap, lip balm, facial scrubs and several other products such as caffeine lipstick. Caffeine is also found in sprays and facial toners, de-puffing eye creams and gels and in hundreds of face and body creams, which claim to give bodies a lift, or improve our contours. The French cosmetic company, Clarins, uses caffeine in some of its products, which claims to stimulate the release of fatty deposits in fat cells. The Italian company Inverni Della Beffa, a drug company that uses caffeine for drugs and cosmetics, similarly proposes extracts of Kola seeds, which contains caffeine used for their astringent, aromatizing and lipase-activating properties. Recent testing on animals has shown that caffeine even protects against sun damage when applied directly to the skin.\\nCaffeine is a necessary and beneficial element for our lives. According to trade sources, there is not enough caffeine to meet the beverage and cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and therefore is made artificially to meet the demand. While caffeine may have had a bad reputation in the past, today\\x92s fast-paced, on-the-go society is relying on the chemical for their morning pick-me-ups, miracle eye creams and cola fixes.\\nSerena Norr is a freelance writer based in New York.

As we learn more about the causes of dementia, answers to these questions are becoming clearer. Coffee and tea\\xa0contain caffeine. The widespread availability of foods containing caffeine has led experts to suggest that 80% of all people in North America have measureable levels of caffeine in their brains from embryo to death. Thank goodness that something good does come from this situation.\\nRecent studies have confirmed that coffee drinking significantly lowers the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. This effect requires about five to six cups of coffee per day for many years and appears to be mostly beneficial only to males primarily due to the lower levels of estrogen. Women benefit from coffee-drinking in other ways, particularly with regard to a reduced incidence of type-2 diabetes. Overall, people who drink substantial amounts of coffee daily tend to live longer than people who do not. Coffee drinking has been correlated with a reduced incidence of colon cancer and liver cirrhosis. Recent evidence suggests that moderate coffee-drinking of about two to three cups each day might reduce your chance of developing Alzheimer's disease .\\nRelated Articles\\n\",\n",

I was surprised to see such positive remarks about coffee, you really seem to approve of that for diabetics. Why? Everything I hear is that it’s bad. Thanks, –M.E., Decatur, Illinois\\nAnswer: After years of being blamed for contributing to everything from heart disease to alien abduction episodes, good news is brewing for the vilified coffee bean. I want to state right here, right now, that I think the coffee (and espresso) itself is fine, especially if it’s organically grown, the problem is all the other stuff that goes into making your latte palatable or scrumptious. Therein lies the problem for many people.\\nA recently published Finnish study found that quaffing three to four cups of joe daily can cut one’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 27 percent in men and 29 percent in women. Jolt yourself with seven to nine cups per day, (which I’m not advocating) and you’ll sleep with your eyes wide open. Seriously, 7 – 9 cups, and those percentages increase to 33 and 66 percent respectively!\\nAnother study conducted by the University of Sydney in Australia found that a similar daily intake of tea resulted in a 20 percent reduction in the risk for developing diabetes. Now, percolate on this- a very recent Harvard study also found that consuming five cups a day slashed the risk for diabetes. The scientists found that certain compounds could reduce blood levels of a nasty inflammation substance (interleukin-6) by 60 percent. Just FYI, blood vessel inflammation plays some role in the development of coronary heart disease, so this is a very significant finding.\\nHow can this be you ask?\\xa0 I know, we’ve all heard the litany of dangers associated with coffee consumption: Elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and homocysteine levels (another inflammation mediator), vasoconstriction, jitteriness, and anxiety which sometimes causing one to hallucinate the aforementioned aliens. Well, as it turns out, these are believed to be only short-term effects. Long-term effects are much better. In fact, the study cites that there isn’t a clear long-term impact on blood pressure. And zapping the interleukin-6 and the inflammation it causes may be why the temporary elevations of cholesterol are rendered innocuous, since it’s believed that the only reason cholesterol clings to your artery walls is because of… drum roll… inflammation!\\nA new study from the Archives of Internal Medicine concluded that women who drink four cups of coffee a day have a 20 percent lower risk of developing depression. A similar study previously done in Finland also correlated caffeine consumption among men with lower incidences of depression and suicide.\\nTake it leaded like I do, you fellow wild-eyed bean lovers!

       "  'document': 'Although green tea is thought of as being low in caffeine, Matcha Green Tea is often higher in caffeine than coffee because it is shade-grown and powdered.\\nLindsey Goodwin\\nThe caffeine levels of teas are often misunderstood and incorrectly listed. For example, many people think that green tea is always lower in caffeine than black tea, and some people think that white tea is naturally low in caffeine. Get the facts behind tea and caffeine with this guide to factors influencing caffeine levels in teas.\\nCaffeine-Free \"Tea\" vs. Decaf Tea\\nAlthough there are many naturally caffeine-free herbal teas / tisanes , there are no naturally caffeine-free \"true teas\" (teas made from Camellia sinensis , such as green tea, black tea and white tea).\\nContrary to popular belief, decaf teas are NOT caffeine free. They still contain caffeine.\\nFor about a decade, there was a popular caffeine myth surrounding at-home tea decaffeination . According to this myth, you could decaffeinate tea at home by steeping it for about 30 seconds, pouring out the tea, and then brewing it again. This has been scientifically shown to be incorrect. It does not decaffeinate your tea.\\nCaffeine by Type: Black Tea, Green Tea, White Tea & More\\nTraditionally, many people have thought of teas\\' caffeine levels as being associated with tea \"types,\" such as black tea , green tea and white tea . More recently, scientific testing has shown that variations in caffeine levels of different tea types have more to do with how they are brewed than how they were processed into tea.\\nFor example, if you brew your white tea at a low brewing temperature for a short infusion time , then it will be much lower in caffeine than if you brew it like a black tea.\\nIn fact, brewing a white tea as you would brew a black tea (with boiling or near-boiling water for four to five minutes) could produce a cup of white tea that is HIGHER in caffeine than black tea.\\nFor more on green tea and caffeine, read the FAQ How Much Caffeine is in Green Tea?\\nCaffeine & Brewing Style\\nBrewing methods and styles can have a large impact on a tea\\'s caffeine level. Using a higher water temperature, longer brewing time or higher ratio of tealeaves to water will increase the caffeine level of your brew. Using teabags can also influence your tea\\'s caffeine level (see \"Caffeine Levels in Different Tea Grades\" below).\\nCaffeine Levels in Different Tea Grades\\nTea grades are categories assigned to teas based on how whole or broken the leaves are. Generally speaking, broken leaves will impart more caffeine into your brew faster than whole leaves. Teabags often hold very broken grades of tea, so they tend to have higher levels of caffeine. (For more information, see teabags vs. whole-leaf tea .)\\nTea grades also assess how \"tippy\" a tea is. The ratio of tips in a tea can also impact its caffeine level.\\nTea Tips, Tea Stems & Caffeine Levels\\nTea tips / buds (the newly formed leaves of the tea plant that are often used to make white tea) are generally known to be higher in antioxidants and nutrients than older tea leaves. However, few people realize that they are also higher in caffeine than older tea leaves.\\nIn terms of the pure leaf, many white teas from outside of Fujian, China are higher in caffeine than black teas simply because they are made with more tips / buds. Similarly, tippy black teas and green teas will be higher in caffeine than their leafy counterparts.\\nConversely, tea stems contain very little caffeine. Teas like Hojicha and Kukicha are made from \"twigs\" (stems) and are naturally very low in caffeine.\\nCaffeine Levels of Tea Varietals\\nThe Assamica tea varietal is higher in caffeine than other tea varietals. The Assamica varietal is primarily grown in Assam, India and used to make bold, tannic black teas, such as English Breakfast tea.\\nThe so-called \"white tea varietals\" (China\\'s tea varietals #1 and #2) are naturally lower in caffeine (and higher in antioxidants) than other varietals. For this reason, white teas grown from these varietals (such as Fujian Silver Needles and White Peony ) are also lower in caffeine and higher in antioxidants than many other teas. However, there are some \"white teas\" made from other varietals in other parts of the world, and these white teas are not as low in caffeine. One example of this is White Darjeeling , which is made from varietals with higher caffeine levels, and is mostly made of tea tips (which naturally contain more caffeine than opened leaves or stems).\\nCaffeine in Shade-Grown Teas\\nGenerally speaking, shade-grown teas (such as Gyokuro Green Tea ) will have higher levels of caffeine than other teas. This phenomenon has to do with a shift in chlorophyll and other chemicals that occurs when netting is used to shade the leaves from sun in the days or weeks prior to harvest.\\nCaffeine Levels of Powdered Teas\\nPowdered teas (such as Matcha Green Tea ) are usually very high in caffeine. This is because you consume the entire leaf rather than just an infusion of the leaf, so you consume all of its caffeine instead of just some of it.\\nMatcha powdered tea is especially high in caffeine because it is shade grown (see \"Caffeine in Shade-Grown Teas\" above).\\nCaffeine Release in Twisted / Rolled Teas\\nTeas that are highly rolled or twisted may release caffeine more slowly than leaves that are flat or open. This tends to apply to certain types of oolong teas , which are typically brewed many times in a gaiwan or yixing teapot . It is not known whether the overall release of caffeine over multiple infusions is comparable to the caffeine release of single infusion a similar, but less twisted / rolled, tea.\\nTea Blends & Caffeine Levels\\nTeas that have been blended with other ingredients (such as mint or masala chai spices ) will often have lower caffeine levels than unblended teas. This is because people often brew them with the same ratio of tea to water (such as one teaspoon per cup), but the total amount of tea leaf used is lower, as it has been partially replaced by herbs.\\nCaffeine Levels\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'tea and health\\nQuestion: What\\'s the difference between caffeine levels in teabags and loose-leaf tea?\\nI\\'ve been researching tea for a little while now, and I notice that something keeps coming up -- steeped loose tea vs. bagged tea . I\\'ve read that steeped, loose tea has less caffeine in it than comparably sized cups of bagged tea. Could you tell me if this is at all true, and why that difference exists in the first place?\\nAnswer: The issue of caffeine levels in tea slightly more complex than a teabag vs. loose leaf tea issue. Amongst other things, it has to do with the \"grade\" of the tea leaf (how broken it is or isn\\'t).\\nA lower grade of tea is more broken, so it has more surface area. The higher ratio of surface area to leaf volume changes the rate at which various compounds infuse and increases the overall rate at which the tea infuses. As a result, tea ends up releasing more of its caffeine when it is broken than when it is whole leaf (and it releases it more quickly).\\nNot all teabags are broken leaf and not all loose tea is whole leaf, so this doesn\\'t ALWAYS mean that teabags have more caffeine than their loose-leaf equivalents, but it usually means that.\\nOne other factor is the tea varietal. Many Assam teas and African teas (both of which are commonly used in teabags) are grown from the Assamica varietal, which is higher in caffeine than the Sinensis varietal.\\nI hope that clarifies things for you a bit!

       "  'document': 'Dietary rules and restrictions are a common part of many world religions, and usually involve the avoidance of various forms of meat (pork or beef, typically). But in a few instances, coffee and tea do fall under some religious restrictions.\\nIslam\\nThe only time when coffee or tea is restricted for Muslims is during Ramadan, a month of spiritual fasting. From dawn until dusk, no food or drink is allowed, even water is forbidden. It\\'s pretty clear-cut, with no gray areas.\\nMore on Ramadan , from the About Islam Guide.\\nLatter-Day Saints (Mormons)\\nThe LDS restrictions involving coffee and tea are fairly well known, though I\\'m sure most people don\\'t really know the details behind it. Coffee and tea are specifically prohibited, as written in the Word of Wisdom: \"Hot drinks are not for the body or belly\" (D&C 89:9) It has been interpreted by the Church that Joseph Smith was referring to coffee and tea with this statement, as they were the only hot drinks commonly available at the time (early 1833). Some LDS members feel this is based on caffeine content, and then also feel that all caffeine is to be avoided. Some feel that the rule should be taken at face value, and therefore only refers to coffee and tea. The LDS church has no official position about caffeinated products other than coffee and tea.\\nMore on the LDS caffeine issue , from the About Latter-Day Saints Guide.\\nJudaism\\nThere are no specific rules against either coffee or tea in Judaism, except for the broader rules of kosher eating. Both tea and coffee are kosher on their own, but there may be many other considerations to remember when enjoying your cup. One is flavoured coffee. Whether you are using flavoured beans, or adding syrups, you cannot be sure the kosher status of the many ingredients used to make these products. Many syrup manufacturers do offer kosher certified products. Another kosher issue can arise from decaffeinated coffee. Ethyl acetate is one chemical often used in the decaffeination process. One component of ethyl acetate is ethanol, which comes from grain. This would make coffee processed this way not kosher during Passover. There are several other aspects of coffee and tea that fall under kosher rules.\\nStar-K Kosher Certification has a good article with more information.\\nSeventh-Day Adventist\\nThe Seventh-Day Adventist\\'s believe strongly in the importance of a healthy and wholesome diet, free from alcohol, narcotics and other stimulants. Caffeine was once officially prohibited, but no longer. It is still recommended that caffeine be avoided.\\nMore on SDA dietary guidelines\\nRastafarianism\\nLike the Seventh-Day Adventist\\'s, the Rastafarians follow a pure and wholesome diet. This excludes coffee, alcohol, salt, tobacco, meat and other processed foods. The foods eaten by Rastafarians (grains, fruits, vegetables) are all \"ital\" foods.\\nMore on Rastafarianism , from the About Alternative Religions Guide\\nI am not an adherent to any of these religions, and I have done my best to understand the nature of these dietary restrictions.

The Royal College of Midwives states that, ‘there is no definitive evidence to show that caffeine in moderation has any adverse impact during pregnancy’.\\nThere has been a great deal of coffee health media coverage recently, following the publication of revised guidelines by the Food Standards Agency concerning caffeine intake during pregnancy. To find out the latest information from the Food Standards Agency visit:\\nClick here for the full fact sheet\\nIntroduction\\nExperts, such as The Food Standards Agency, The Centre for Pregnancy Nutrition and The Royal College of Midwives, are agreed that coffee drinking in moderation, 2 - 3 cups per day, is safe during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. The Royal College of Midwives state that, ‘There is no definitive evidence to show that caffeine in moderation has any adverse impact during pregnancy’.\\nCaffeine and pregnancy\\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA), in November 2008, revised guidelines that advise pregnant women to limit their intake of caffeine from 300mg per day to 200mg per day. This roughly equates to about 2 mugs of instant coffee (100mg each), 1 mug of filter coffee (140mg each), 2 mugs of tea (75mg each), 5 cans of cola (up to 40mg each), 2 cans of ‘energy’ drink (up to 80mg each) or 4 (50g) bars of plain chocolate (up to 50 mg each). Caffeine in milk chocolate is about half that of plain chocolate (1A).\\nA 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that ‘It seems reasonable to conclude that no convincing evidence has been presented to show that caffeine consumption increases the risk of any reproductive adversity’ (2).\\nIn January 2008 two new studies were published looking at maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy. The first concluded “there is little indication of possible harmful effects of caffeine on miscarriage risk within the range of coffee and caffeine consumption reported” (3). The second however, observed an increased risk of miscarriage with consumption of caffeine of 200 mg per day or greater (4).\\nThe British Coffee Association welcomes new research and highlights that it is important to review all the available data rather than taking one study in isolation . The BCA fully support the advice given by the FSA, which provides clear guidance for pregnant women and confirms that coffee consumed in moderation is safe for health.\\nCaffeine is found naturally in tea, coffee and chocolate, and is added to cola drinks, some energy drinks and some over the counter medicines such a cold remedies. All sources should be considered when reviewing total daily caffeine intake.\\nSummary\\nCurrent guidelines issued by the Food Standards Agency are intended to reassure pregnant women that they may consume up to 200mg of caffeine a day – this equates to 2-3 cups of coffee. These guidelines are endorsed by The Royal College of Midwives and The Centre for Pregnancy Nutrition.\\nThere is no conclusive evidence to date to suggest that this level of caffeine represents a health risk to expectant mothers or their babies.\\nReferences\\n1.

It is true to say that sudden reduction in caffeine intake by regular consumers may lead to mild symptoms of withdrawal in a small percentage of individuals who are sensitive to caffeine. However, this is not the case for the majority of the population.

       "  'document': \"Tweet\\nSugar-free coffee or green tea: which is healthier? (Thinkstock photos/Getty Images)\\nSugar-free coffee gives you taste and benefits of coffee with fewer calories. Green tea, on the other hand, is a healthy drink because it is a decent source of antioxidant polyphenols.\\nA refreshing and calorie-safe beverage, green tea works as a good substitute for unhealthy beverages regularly consumed in today's lifestyles. So, now that both sugar-free coffee and green tea are healthy, we wonder which is healthier. Let's take a look...\\nAdvantages of green tea\\nGreen tea contains flavonoids (epigallocatechin ) gallate, or EGCG. New research published in the Journal of Nutrition reports that flavonoids EGCG extracts of green tea lower the harmful effects of high blood sugar. This EGCG can prevent damage to the major organs like the coronary arteries lining of the heart muscle. (via)\\nSome researches have found that green tea reduces the respiration quotient and increases your metabolic rate, albeit temporarily and to a marginal extent only. One study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1999, reports that those drinking green tea increased their total energy expenditure by 3.5 percent and a jump in the proportion of energy came from fat, which rose from 31 to 41 percent. (via)\\nAdvantages of sugar-free coffee\\nA longitudinal study in 2009 found that moderate coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of developing dementia in addition to Alzheimer's disease. Some preliminary research evidence shows that coffee acts against beta-amyloid plaque that may have a causative role in Alzheimer's. These findings were published in the January 2009 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.\\nA moderate coffee drinker who drinks around 3-4 cups of coffee in a day had 65 % less chances of getting dementia later in life. This is a new study from the University Of Kuopio, Finland and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\\nResearch has shown that a person who is a moderate coffee drinker has less chances of getting gallstones diseases. Two such studies were done by the Harvard School Of Public Health .\\nCaffeine is the most commonly consumed psychoactive drug in the world. If you take caffeine in the form of coffee, it will increase the effectiveness of the pain killers, especially in migraine and headache medications.\\nSome primarily studies has shown that coffee helps boost short term memory. The study in 2005 was presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) In which they demonstrated that caffeine modulates short-term working memory. Some cognitive performance tests of simple reaction time, choice reaction time, incidental verbal memory, and visuo spatial reasoning, have shown that participants who regularly drank coffee were found to perform better on all tests.\\nRoasted coffee contains antioxidant, which in turn contain the anti-cancer compound methylpyridinium. Coffee also increases your energy level after you drink it. But it is a temporary hike. Caffeine can stimulates the central nervous system for a few hours.\\nBottom-line: Both, sugar-free coffee and green tea come with their own benefits. Each benefit kicks in only for a few hours, whether it is increased metabolism or migraine relief. Thus, both beverages are good - but in controlled measures. Research suggests that coffee and green tea are good in doses of maximum three cups a day. Therefore, if one uses them as substitutes for unhealthy beverages, they - each - benefit you. Remember, that no single beverage can keep you away from disease and weight gain. If you rely on green tea for weight management without eating healthy and exercising, even eight cups won't help you. Therefore, pick the beverage you prefer based on taste as this will help you develop a lifelong habit, and stick to overall healthy lfiestyle guidelines.\\nThis post was complied with expert inputs from Delhi-based diet and lifestyle nutritionist , Munisha Bhanot.\\nRead more Personal Health, Diet & Fitness stories on www.healthmeup.com\\nHi !\\n\",\n",

       "  'document': 'Chemically speaking, what is caffeine?\\nSun, 2006-01-15 20:42 — Daniel\\nCaffeine is an alkaloid. There are numerous compounds called alkaloids, among them we have the methylxanthines, with three distinguished compounds: caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, found in cola nuts, coffee, tea, cacao beans, mate and other plants. These compounds have different biochemical effects, and are present in different ratios in the different plant sources. These compounds are very similar and differ only by the presence of methyl groups in two positions of the chemical structure. They are easily oxidized to uric acid and other methyluric acids which are also similar in chemical structure.\\nCaffeine:\\nSources: Coffee, tea, cola nuts, mate, guarana.\\nEffects: Stimulant of central nervous system, cardiac muscle, and respiratory system, diuretic Delays fatigue.\\nTheophylline:\\nEffects: Cariac stimulant, smooth muscle relaxant, diuretic, vasodilator\\nTheobromine:\\nSources: Principle alkaloid of the cocoa bean (1.5-3%) Cola nuts and tea\\nEffects: Diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, cardiac stimulant, vasodilator.\\n(Info from Merck Index)\\nThe presence of the other alkaloids in colas and tea may explain why these sometimes have a stronger kick than coffee. Colas, which have lower caffeine contents than coffee are, reportedly, sometimes more active. Tea seems the strongest for some. Coffee seems more lasting for mental alertness and offers fewer jitters than the others.\\nA search in CAS and produced these names and synonyms:\\nRN   58-08-2  REGISTRY\\nCN   1H-Purine-2,6-dione, 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl- (9CI)  (CA INDEX NAME)\\nOTHER CA INDEX NAMES:\\nCN   Caffeine (8CI)\\nOTHER NAMES:\\nCN   1,3,7-Trimethyl-2,6-dioxopurine\\nCN   1,3,7-Trimethylxanthine\\nCN   7-Methyltheophylline\\nCN   Alert-Pep\\nCN   Cafeina\\nCN   Caffein\\nCN   Cafipel\\nCN   Guaranine\\nCN   Koffein\\nCN   Mateina\\nCN   Methyltheobromine\\nCN   No-Doz\\nCN   Refresh\\'n\\nCN   Stim\\nCN   Thein\\nCN   Theine\\nCN   Tri-Aqua\\n\\nMF   C8 H10 N4 O2\\nThe correct name is the first one, 1H-Purine-2,6-dione, 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl- (This is the \"inverted name\") The \"uninverted name\" is 3,7-Dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione\\nMerck Index excerpt...\\nCaffeine: 3,7-dihydro- 1,3,7-trimethyl- 1H-purine- 2,6-dione; 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine; 1,3,7-trimethyl- 2,6-dioxopurine; coffeine; thein; guaranine; methyltheobromine; No-Doz.\\nC8H10N4O2; mol wt 194.19.

       "  'document': 'Introduction\\nWhy is caffeine so important? Because of its mild stimulating properties on the body and mind. Caffeine is the stuff that perks you up when you drink a cup of coffee. The body absorbs it rapidly, usually within 30 minutes, and its effects may last for 2-5 hours.\\n300 mg of caffeine per day is considered moderate caffeine consumption for most people. This translates to about 5 cups of soluble coffee or 3-4 cups of brewed coffee. However, some individuals may choose to consume decaffeinated coffee, tea, or soft drinks, especially later in the day.\\nCaffeine was discovered by two different scientists almost at the same time. It was first isolated in coffee by a German chemist in 1820. In 1821 a French chemist, working independently, discovered the same element and gave it its name.\\nThe effects of caffeine\\nThe effects of caffeine have been the subject of considerable discussion and research, due in no small part to the popularity of coffee, which is acknowledged as being one of the world’s favorite drinks.\\nThousands of scientific studies have been published on the effects of coffee and caffeine on health, the overall conclusion of which confirms that coffee drinking in moderation (4–5 cups per day) is perfectly safe for the general population.\\nCaffeine has a stimulating effect on both physical and mental performance so it is ideal to take it in the morning, during the afternoon work break or in the evening for a long study night.\\nHow much caffeine is there in the NESCAFÉ coffees?\\nNESCAFÉ soluble coffee contains about 65 mg of caffeine per 175 ml (6 fl. oz.) cup. The amount of caffeine per cup of coffee depends on the amount of coffee you put in your cup and there are differences in the strength of the coffee blends in each country.\\nHow does this amount compare to other products that contain caffeine?\\nTea – Brewed (6 fl oz/175 ml): 20 - 90 mg\\nTea – Instant (6 fl oz/175 ml): 24 - 31 mg\\nSoft Drink (8 fl oz/235 ml cola type): 30 - 71 mg\\nChocolate Milk (8 fl oz/235 ml): 2 - 7 mg\\nCaffeine content based on information from the U.S. FDA and National Coffee Association.\\nSee more in our Coffee and Well-being Section.\\nHelpful Links\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'Twitter\\nLately, a lot of people in the specialty tea and coffee industries have been comparing their beverages of choice to wine. While there’s certainly substance to this comparison, I think there are stronger parallels between coffee and tea. I think this because (unlike wine) tea and coffee contain caffeine and are typically consumed hot. Beyond that, quality teas and coffees have some very intriguing overlaps in their flavor profiles.\\nHere are a few of the similar flavor profiles you can find in coffee and tea:\\nâ\\x80¢ Full-bodied depth and roastiness are the primary notes in espresso, Wuyi oolongs and smoked black teas, like Russian Caravan and Lapsang Souchong.\\nâ\\x80¢ Although South American coffee is stronger and more acidic in flavor than Houjicha green tea, they both have an enjoyably medium-bodied, mellow taste.\\nâ\\x80¢ A standard latte is quite similar to a tea latte made with a bold black tea, like an Assam or a Ceylon.\\nâ\\x80¢ All-too-popular spiced coffee lattes now come in flavors like cinnamon, vanilla, cardamom, clove, etc. Masala chai has a milky richness, bold, slightly astringent base and abundance of spices similar to spiced lattes.\\nâ\\x80¢ Ethiopian coffees (with their intense berry notes) remind me of a lychee-flavored black tea.\\nâ\\x80¢ The lingering aftertaste of a well-made coffee is akin to that of a well-made tea. In both cases, the finish is the most prized attribute of many aficionados who drink it.\\nâ\\x80¢ The richness and full flavor of a Sumatra is much like an Assam or Ceylon black tea.\\nâ\\x80¢ The mild and never-bitter taste of quality Jamaican Blue Mountain parallels the smooth, mellow taste of quality Keemun black tea.\\nâ\\x80¢ The full, thick taste and mouth-feel of French-press brewed coffee is akin to bolder black teas, like breakfast blends, second-flush Assams and Russian Caravan.\\nDespite these overlaps, there are some tea and coffee flavors that simply do not compare. For example, vegetal Japanese green teas and delicate, floral white teas have no coffee parallels. This is in part because tea spans a larger spectrum of the flavor palate. Additionally, your average coffee generally has much stronger flavors and aromas than your average tea.\\nI’d love to hear what you think about the similarities (or lack thereof) between coffee and tea. Feel free to comment on which teas and coffees you think taste alike (or don’t).\\nPhoto (c) Lindsey Goodwin\\n',\n",

It involved 410 000 men and women aged between 25 and 70 from across ten European countries over a period of 8.5 years.\\nResearchers found that people who drank more than 100ml of coffee or tea per day seemed to have a 34% lower risk of being diagnosed with a glioma.\\nHowever, Professor Rampling, who interpreted the results for Brain Tumour UK, says: “This study and a previous paper quoted in the study do not give us a clear reason to change the way we behave with respect to tea or coffee.\"\\nHe adds that the risk of developing a brain tumour remains small independent of diet.\\n“Many of us already take at least 100ml of coffee or tea per day and taking large amounts (more than five cups) may have other health drawbacks.”\\nHowever, Professor Rampling says the papers are of considerable scientific interest.\\n“Any inhibitory effect on brain tumour development by antioxidant/caffeine containing beverages needs to be confirmed. If confirmed then the mechanism of inhibition needs to be clarified and possibly exploited. In the meantime changes of beverage consumption to modify the risk of developing a brain tumour do not seem justified,” he says.\\nProfessor Rampling’s full report follows below.\\nThe effect of coffee and tea consumption on glioma development\\nThe paper by Michaud et al (1) “Coffee and tea intake and risk of brain tumors in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study” is a substantial piece of work by a reputable group.\\nThey have specifically examined the relationship between the incidence of 2 broad types of brain tumour (glioma and meningioma) and the daily intake of coffee and tea.\\nTheir conclusion is that taking relatively small amounts of tea or coffee (>100mL) helps to protect against developing a glioma. However they do not show that the more coffee or tea you drink, the lower the risk and they do not claim any effect at all on meningiomas.\\nThey reference another recent study by Holick et al (2) that has shown a similar inverse correlation between coffee consumption and risk of glioma in both men and women.\\nHowever in this paper the risk reduction for developing a glioma is for people taking more than 5 cups of coffee per day.\\nBoth papers discuss previous work in this field, some of which appears to support their conclusions but other of which fails to show any relationship of glioma incidence with coffee drinking.\\nFurther confusion arises in that some papers show a different effect between the sexes and some that show an effect for coffee but not tea and a variable association when caffeine is examined independently of its nutritional source. Both papers acknowledge the difficulty of producing consistent results in this type of work.\\nWhy might coffee and tea protect against the development of glioma? Firstly, both beverages contain large amounts of polyphenols and flavonoids, that have strong antioxidant activity and are thought to inhibit tumour promotion and possibly protect against cancer. Coffee and tea also contain caffeine. Testing caffeine in the laboratory however gives inconsistent results, sometimes increasing and sometimes inhibiting the development of malignant cells. Caffeine also alters blood flow to the brain, which might influence tumour progression.\\nHow then do we interpret these results and what do we need to do? Clearly there is no suggestion in any of these studies that drinking tea or coffee increases the risk of glioma and indeed there is a possibility that drinking either of these beverages over the long term may protect in some way.\\nHowever it must be remembered that some previous studies have shown no protective effect. Also there is a discrepancy between these two studies with one saying that a large coffee intake is needed (>5 cups per day) whilst the other says that any amount over 100ml (one small cup) is beneficial.\\nAlso it is possible that it is not the coffee at all but some other characteristic of people who drink more coffee that is protective. Neither study addresses the influence of coffee or tea when a person already has a brain tumour.\\nIn summary, neither of these papers gives us a clear reason to change the way we behave with respect to coffee or tea.\\nThe risk of developing a brain tumour remains small independent of diet. Many of us already take at least 100ml of coffee or tea per day and taking large amounts (>5 cups) may have other health drawbacks. The papers are however of considerable scientific interest.\\nAny inhibitory effect on brain tumour development by antioxidant/caffeine containing beverages needs to be confirmed.

Can you clarify please.\\nAlso I have read a long string of answers and questions. I would like to add to it:\\nMuch of the information that follows I gleaned from detailed discussions with the owners and brew masters of Java Cofee and Tea Co. They have a shop in Houston for 30 years at least and a website. Each coffee is graded by acidity and mild-bold flavor. Between them, my nurse's training which includes chemistry, and experience with coffee over the years, this is some information I have obtained:\\nFrom my understanding of the chemistry of caffeine, it does not evaporate. Instead it is the acidty in the coffee that destroys the caffeine over time. Anyone who brews tea knows that tannic acid in the tea destroys the caffine, right? so you try to brew it to reduce the tannic acid production which enhances the caffeine content. Also the flavor and drinkability of the brew for those of us who have sensitive stomachs, as the taste of tannic acid is harsh. The lower acid coffees therefore generally have more caffeine, better taste, If you ask me. I have acid reflux and acidic coffee really upsets my stomach. So I have a built in acid barometer, lol. Coffee that sits on the heat definitely becomes more acidic, harsher tasting and the caffeine might become more concentrated too if the acid were not destroying it. But saving coffee at room temperature does not necessarily lose the caffeine if you have a low acid coffee. I believe Robusto beans also have much higher acidic content than most arabica, giving it less refined taste and destroying some of that extra caffeine. Another source of destroyng the caffene is in the roasting process. What degree heat are the beans at when roasting? My impression of Starbucks Coffee beans are generally roasted fast at higher heat, making them very dark and for my taste, burnt tasting and lacking in caffeine. I work nights and I need decent amounts of caffeine to make it, lol.\\n* reply\\n\",\n",

       "  'document': \"my experiences of going off caffeine....\\nI have had interesting results from going off caffeine, which I thought I'd best share with others. It really has made a noticeable difference to how I feel - really.\\nI have only been a caffeine addict for a little over a year - the last 6 months or so I switched to brewed coffee(which I made quite strong). I had 1-2 cups per day, but mostly 1. I am 25 years of age and in good health, I exercise 3-4 times per week (gym) and also bikeride around 1-2 times per week, so am reasonably fit.\\nI have been off caffeine for around 7 days so far, the first 3-4 days I had a slightly lingering headache, and felt a little lethargic, though the symptoms were only mild. To be expected though as I wasn't consuming that much for that long.\\nI had a cup of tea yesterday (with family - I have vowed to not have another) and actually got a headache straight away from it. I found that unusual.\\nAnyway, the thing which made me want to share my experience is the fact that I feel MUCH better. I definately sleep better now, and during the day I seem to have a constant positive/energetic feeling. I feel good ALL day now, rather than having that little burst of energy after having a coffee, and then feeling lethargic, slightly depressed etc for many hours afterwards.\\nAnother thing, though it may be too early to really tell, but exercise seems easier now too, probably because every time I exercised at night I was on the 'down' phase of a coffee.\\nYet anothe thing - over the last year or so I have put on around 2-3 kg, not a lot, but a worry as I have changed NOTHING in terms of my exercise regime, activity levels at work/during the day. Googling 'weight gain' and 'caffeine' does show there may be a link between the two. It just seems the last year or so I was constantly hungry and craved sugary/fatty foods. It may be a coincidence, but it's something worth thinking about. I will see how things go long term now! The more I've learnt about caffeine, the more I've realised it's just a drug like any other, which has negative side effects. Knowledge is a powerful thing, I can now be one of the 10% of non-caffiene addicts who lives a more fulfilled life.\\nReply\\n\",\n",

       "  'document': \"From Craig Weber, M.D. ,\\xa0former\\xa0About.com Guide\\nUpdated August 13, 2007\\nAbout.com Health's Disease and Condition content is reviewed by the Medical Review Board\\nFiled In:\\nPrevention\\nCaffeine is a natural stimulant found in the nuts, berries, and leaves of certain plants. Caffeine is most commonly consumed as coffee or tea products, and some have estimated that these beverages may be the most widely consumed foods in the world.\\nBecause caffeine is so common in all human cultures, a great deal of research has been done to discover the health effects of caffeine. Relationships between caffeine and heart disease, as well as the caffeine-blood pressure link have been especially active fields of study.\\nWhat are stimulants?\\nStimulants, by definition, increase the activity of the central nervous system, which is why they make you feel more awake, focused, and alert. However, this increased activity can also cause blood vessel constriction, which may increase blood pressure and alter the supply of blood to the heart. In fact, most of the dangerous effects of strong stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine are a direct result of their activity on blood vessels and the heart.\\nBecause caffeine is a stimulant, there is good reason to suspect that coffee and high blood pressure might be related. Caffeine, though, is a very mild stimulant, and has a short life span in the body. Caffeine is also a self-limiting stimulant, because it acts on the kidneys to increase the rate of its own excretion.\\nCaffeine, Blood Pressure, and the Heart\\nEvidence has repeatedly shown that consumption of caffeine does not increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease or heart attack. One very well-known study examined more than 85,000 women over a ten-year period and found that there was no increased risk of these diseases, even in women who drank more than six cups of coffee per day. The Joint National Committee on Hypertension has specifically stated that there is no evidence linking coffee/tea and high blood pressure.\\nWhile some recent studies have shown a weak link between caffeine and elevations in blood pressure, the results are complicated and only consider short-term effects.\\nFor example, one widely quoted study found that blood pressure rose slightly in subjects almost immediately after consuming a caffeinated beverage, and that this blood pressure rise was more pronounced in people with pre-existing high blood pressure. However, these elevations were not very large and only lasted a short time. The study also showed that in about 15 percent of people with existing high blood pressure, drinking a caffeinated beverage actually caused a decrease in blood pressure.\\nTwo important studies published in 2007 further supported the existing body of evidence by again demonstrating that:\\ncaffeine-induced blood pressure changes were small and short-lived\\ncaffeine does not contribute to disorders of the blood vessels associated with high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease\\nOne interesting study showed that the caffeine-blood pressure relationship may be more complicated than expected. The study examined how the amount of coffee consumed affected the risk of developing high blood pressure. While the results showed that the risk of high blood pressure was the lowest for those who drink no coffee, it also showed that those who drink a lot of coffee have almost the same risk. In an unexpected twist, people who drank only small amounts of coffee (1-3 cups per day) seemed to have the highest risk. It is believed that over time, the body becomes tolerant to the stimulant effects of caffeine.\\nHealth Benefits\\nCoffee and tea may actually have many health benefits. While green tea was popular for several years as a healthy source of vitamins and antioxidants, newer research has shown that darker beverages like black tea and coffee may actually be better for you. These dark beverages are a rich source of compounds called polyphenols, which may protect against both heart disease and several types of cancer. Recent studies, for example, have consistently demonstrated a decreased risk of liver cancer in men who drink coffee.\\nCoffee and tea polyphenols have been shown to lower the level of activated platelets in the blood, which may help prevent blood clots that can lead to stroke. Polyphenols have also been shown to lower the body's concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP), an important factor in inflammation. Decreases in CRP have previously been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and certain types of kidney disease.\\nThough coffee and tea contain a lot of polyphenols, other types of polyphenols can be found in different foods. All polyphenols have been shown to have health benefits, but the most beneficial besides those in coffee and tea seem to be:\\nGrape polyphenols\\nApple polyphenols\\nChocolate polyphenols (dark chocolate with more than 80 percent cocoa)\\nWhile the scientific evidence should reassure you if you are a coffee or tea drinker, it doesn't mean you should start because of the potential health benefits. A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables is also a great source of polyphenols and polyphenol-related compounds.\\nSources:\\nHartley, T et al.

       "  'document': \"Coffee, Tea and Water Zone\\nCoffee\\nDid you know?\\nIn the UK, we drink approximately 70 million cups of coffee per day.\\n85% of coffee drinkers in the UK take milk in their coffee and 57% add sugar.\\nIt takes 42 coffee beans to make an espresso.\\nIt takes around 4,000 coffee beans to produce just 500g of roasted, ground coffee.\\nDiscovery of coffee\\nEthiopia is generally regarded as the birthplace of coffee. Legend has it that Kaldi, an Ethiopian goatherd, noticed that his herd of goats became more energetic when grazing on coffee shrubs and eating the cherry-red berries containing the beans. Kaldi thought that he would try eating a few berries himself, and soon became as energised as his flock.\\nA group of local monks heard Kaldi’s story and tried eating the berries themselves. They found that the berries helped to keep them awake during long prayer sessions. They experimented with the berries and found that, if crushed and soaked in water, they produced a cold drink that also produced a stimulating effect.\\nThe first coffee beans arrived from Africa in al-Makkha, later known as Mocha over 1,000 years ago.\\nIn Mocha in around 1200 a hermit called al-Shadhili apparently brewed the first mug of a coffee bean drink.\\nCoffee first came to Europe in 1615. Initially, coffee was mainly sold by lemonade vendors and was believed to have medicinal qualities. The first European coffee house opened in Venice in 1683.\\nThe largest insurance market in the world, Lloyd's of London, began life as a coffeehouse. It was started in 1688 by Edward Lloyd, who prepared lists of the ships that his customers had insured.\\nIn the 1970s, Seattle was the birthplace of a café or 'Latte' culture which swept the USA and has dramatically improved the general quality of the coffee Americans drink.\\nWhat is Coffee?\\nCoffee is the seed of a coffee berry and is grown on coffee trees. Of the 73 species of coffee tree only two are cultivated commercially, Arabica Coffea Arabica and Robusta Coffea Canephora.\\nCoffee belongs to the botanical family Rubiaceae, which has some 500 genera and over 6,000 species. Most are tropical trees and shrubs which grow in the lower levels of forests. Other members of the family include the gardenias and plants which yield quinine and other useful substances, but Coffea is by far the most important member of the family economically.\\nCoffee cultivation\\nArabica grows at altitudes of over 1000mtrs in temperatures ranging from\\xa015°-24° C.\\n6-8 mtrs tall\\n0.8 – 1.7% Caffeine\\n70% worlds consumption is Arabica\\nRobusta grows at altitudes of less than 1000mtrs in temperatures ranging from 24° C and over.\\n10 mtrs tall\\n1.5 – 4 % caffeine\\nCoffee harvesting and processing\\nThere are two methods of harvesting coffee, stripping and picking. Coffee is then processed by one of two methods, either, dry or wet.\\nDuring dry processing, cherries are spread thinly out on the ground in the sun. They dehydrate and the pulp shrivels.\\nDuring wet processing, cherries are soaked in water to soften the pulp. Rotten beans float to the surface and are separated. The cherries are transferred to fermentation tanks where the rest of the pulp decomposes and is removed. This process takes 12-48 hours.\\nThe cherries are then laid out on patios to dry for three weeks (or 2 days mechanically). At this stage they can be washed again to remove excess bitterness and defects.\\nThe dry process gives a cup of coffee with more body and sweetness and the taste is not as clean. The Wet Process gives cleaner more acidic and aromatic coffee with less body.\\nSeven steps to sorting coffee\\nBeans are separated from leaves, sticks, dust, stones\\nAny pieces of metal, iron or bits of wire are removed magnetically\\nBeans are passed through screens for size grading\\nBeans are sorted by density and defects are rejected\\nColorimeter detects any over or under ripe beans which are ejected by compressed air.\\nSorting by ultra violet light gets rid of any rotten (stinker beans).\\nA final sorting is done by hand picking.\\nCoffee baristas\\nA barista is someone who prepares and serves espresso-based coffee drinks. The word is Italian in origin, where it means bartender.\\nThe term is often used to describe someone who has acquired some level of expertise or particular skill in the preparation of coffee based drinks.\\nThere are professional baristas who are highly skilled in coffee preparation. Championship competitions are held for competing baristas who demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of coffee, coffee blends, espresso, quality, coffee varieties, roast degree, espresso equipment and maintenance and even latte art.\\nTea\\nTea was first sold in Europe in 1610.\\nThe caffeine content of a cup of tea is usually less than 60 mg, but a strong cup of tea may contain more caffeine than a weak cup of regular coffee.\\nDrinking three or more cups of tea a day is as good for you as drinking plenty of water say researchers in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition. They claim that tea rehydrates as well as water does.\\nExperts believe flavonoids are the key ingredient in tea that promote health. These antioxidants are found in many foods and plants, including tea leaves, and have been shown to help prevent cell damage.\\nPublic health nutritionist Dr Carrie Ruxton, and colleagues at Kings College London, looked at published studies on the health effects of tea consumption.\\xa0 They found evidence that drinking three to four cups of tea a day can cut the chances of having a heart attack.\\nWater\\nWater makes up 50 to 70 per cent of an adult's total body weight.\\nWhy do we need water?\\nWater is essential for the body's growth and maintenance. For example, it helps get rid of waste and regulates temperature.\\nWater is lost from the body through urine and sweat, and must be replaced through the diet. If you don't consume enough you can become dehydrated, causing symptoms such as headaches, tiredness and loss of concentration.\\nHow much do we need?\\nThe body gets its fluid from three sources:\\nDrinks, either plain water or as part of other beverages including tea, coffee and squash\\nSolid foods, especially fruit and vegetables (even foods such as bread and cheese provide small amounts of fluid)\\nAs a by-product of chemical reactions within the body\\nMost healthy adults need between one and a half to three litres a day, so aim to drink six to eight medium glasses of fluid daily. Beverages such as tea, coffee and fruit juices count towards fluid intake, and may bring with them other nutrients or benefits.\\nChocolate\\nChocolate is made from beans grown on a small evergreen tree native to the tropical region of the Americas.\\nThere are three main types of cacao bean. The Criollo is the most sought after, as it is more aromatic and less bitter than any other bean.\\nThe fruit of the tree is called a cacao pod and contains up to 60 beans in a white pulp.\\nThe cacao beans are harvested and then fermented, dried, roasted and shelled. The resulting cacao nibs are ground into a paste, called chocolate liquor, which is then refined further.\\nCacao is believed to have first been cultivated by ancestors of the Maya people thousands of years ago. After fermenting, roasting and grinding the beans it was mixed with chilli and spices to make a chocolate drink with a kick!\\nHot chocolate was first brought by the Spanish from the Americas to Spain in 1528.\\nChocolate drinks were hugely popular in 17th century Europe, and the first chocolate house opened in London in 1657.\\n\",\n",

       "  'document': \"Coffee, Tea and Water Zone\\nCoffee\\nDid you know?\\nIn the UK, we drink approximately 70 million cups of coffee per day.\\n85% of coffee drinkers in the UK take milk in their coffee and 57% add sugar.\\nIt takes 42 coffee beans to make an espresso.\\nIt takes around 4,000 coffee beans to produce just 500g of roasted, ground coffee.\\nDiscovery of coffee\\nEthiopia is generally regarded as the birthplace of coffee. Legend has it that Kaldi, an Ethiopian goatherd, noticed that his herd of goats became more energetic when grazing on coffee shrubs and eating the cherry-red berries containing the beans. Kaldi thought that he would try eating a few berries himself, and soon became as energised as his flock.\\nA group of local monks heard Kaldi’s story and tried eating the berries themselves. They found that the berries helped to keep them awake during long prayer sessions. They experimented with the berries and found that, if crushed and soaked in water, they produced a cold drink that also produced a stimulating effect.\\nThe first coffee beans arrived from Africa in al-Makkha, later known as Mocha over 1,000 years ago.\\nIn Mocha in around 1200 a hermit called al-Shadhili apparently brewed the first mug of a coffee bean drink.\\nCoffee first came to Europe in 1615. Initially, coffee was mainly sold by lemonade vendors and was believed to have medicinal qualities. The first European coffee house opened in Venice in 1683.\\nThe largest insurance market in the world, Lloyd's of London, began life as a coffeehouse. It was started in 1688 by Edward Lloyd, who prepared lists of the ships that his customers had insured.\\nIn the 1970s, Seattle was the birthplace of a café or 'Latte' culture which swept the USA and has dramatically improved the general quality of the coffee Americans drink.\\nWhat is Coffee?\\nCoffee is the seed of a coffee berry and is grown on coffee trees. Of the 73 species of coffee tree only two are cultivated commercially, Arabica Coffea Arabica and Robusta Coffea Canephora.\\nCoffee belongs to the botanical family Rubiaceae, which has some 500 genera and over 6,000 species. Most are tropical trees and shrubs which grow in the lower levels of forests. Other members of the family include the gardenias and plants which yield quinine and other useful substances, but Coffea is by far the most important member of the family economically.\\nCoffee cultivation\\nArabica grows at altitudes of over 1000mtrs in temperatures ranging from\\xa015°-24° C.\\n6-8 mtrs tall\\n0.8 – 1.7% Caffeine\\n70% worlds consumption is Arabica\\nRobusta grows at altitudes of less than 1000mtrs in temperatures ranging from 24° C and over.\\n10 mtrs tall\\n1.5 – 4 % caffeine\\nCoffee harvesting and processing\\nThere are two methods of harvesting coffee, stripping and picking. Coffee is then processed by one of two methods, either, dry or wet.\\nDuring dry processing, cherries are spread thinly out on the ground in the sun. They dehydrate and the pulp shrivels.\\nDuring wet processing, cherries are soaked in water to soften the pulp. Rotten beans float to the surface and are separated. The cherries are transferred to fermentation tanks where the rest of the pulp decomposes and is removed. This process takes 12-48 hours.\\nThe cherries are then laid out on patios to dry for three weeks (or 2 days mechanically). At this stage they can be washed again to remove excess bitterness and defects.\\nThe dry process gives a cup of coffee with more body and sweetness and the taste is not as clean. The Wet Process gives cleaner more acidic and aromatic coffee with less body.\\nSeven steps to sorting coffee\\nBeans are separated from leaves, sticks, dust, stones\\nAny pieces of metal, iron or bits of wire are removed magnetically\\nBeans are passed through screens for size grading\\nBeans are sorted by density and defects are rejected\\nColorimeter detects any over or under ripe beans which are ejected by compressed air.\\nSorting by ultra violet light gets rid of any rotten (stinker beans).\\nA final sorting is done by hand picking.\\nCoffee baristas\\nA barista is someone who prepares and serves espresso-based coffee drinks.

       "  'document': 'Does Teeccino buy fair trade ingredients?\\nWhat do you mean by herbal coffee?\\nHerbal coffee is brewed from herbs that have been roasted and ground to brew and taste like coffee. Most people are aware there is no “milk\" in soy milk, and no “burger\" in a veggie burger. However, many people don’t remember that there is no “tea\" in herbal tea and similarly, there is no \"coffee\" in herbal coffee.\\nTea always used to refer to Camelia sinensis, the plant that has been grown for centuries to produce black tea. But now we have green tea, red tea, white tea, and herbal tea. The term “tea\" has become a generic term for leaves, bark, flowers, roots and spices brewed in hot water like true tea. We wonder if that will happen to “coffee” some day.\\nIn the meantime, we hope that\\xa0 people will come understand “herbal coffee\" as easily as they now know herbal tea and soy milk!\\nBack to the top\\nIs there any coffee or caffeine in Teeccino?\\nNo! There are no coffee beans in Teeccino. Nor is there any tea. Teeccino\\'s ingredients consist of a blend of naturally caffeine-free herbs, grains, fruits and nuts roasted and ground to brew and taste like coffee.\\nBack to the top\\nHow do I quit coffee?\\nOver a two week period, start blending Teeccino with your coffee. Begin with 3/4 coffee, and 1/4 Teeccino and gradually increase the amount of Teeccino until you are drinking 100% Teeccino. Herbal tonics and nutritional supplements can also aid you in restoring your own natural energy supply. Follow our plan for avoiding caffeine withdrawal symptoms by quitting caffeine painlessly .\\nBack to the top\\nWhy not just drink decaf?\\nDecaf coffee is not caffeine free. A 12 oz. cup of decaf contains anywhere from 10-17 milligrams of caffeine. A 16 oz. Starbucks® Grande contains 12-23 milligrams and a 20 oz. Venti contains upwards of 28 milligrams! If you order a cup of decaf coffee at a coffee bar or restaurant, independent studies have shown a great variance in the amount of caffeine in the cup even on the same day from the very same place. So there is no safety in knowing how much caffeine you may get from a cup of decaf coffee.\\nDecaf coffee is made from highly acidic coffee beans and thus it is even harder than regular coffee on the gastrointestinal tract. If you have gastrointestinal problems or suffer from acid indigestion, you\\'ll find that eliminating coffee from your diet, whether it is decaf or regular, will help your recovery process.\\nIn addition, studies show that decaf raises the LDL fraction of cholesterol (commonly referred to as ‘bad’ cholesterol) by 8 to10% in only 3 months, leading to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Most decaf has been extracted using the solvent methylene chloride, a known carcinogen, which leaves behind small but significant residues that could be implicated in the development of chronic diseases. Learn more about how eliminating coffee is beneficial to your digestive health .\\nBack to the top\\nWill Teeccino give me an energy boost?\\nMany people experience an energy lift from drinking Teeccino. The nutrients in Teeccino are in liquid form, making them very bio-available and quickly absorbed. Teeccino replenishes potassium, an electrolyte mineral that stimulates nerve impulses, helps oxygenate the brain, and enhances athletic performance.\\nThe potassium present in Teeccino is completely natural, derived from the ingredients themselves. Sports drinks rely on added potassium to achieve the same effect, but Teeccino’s natural potassium is at an even higher per-serving quantity than sports drinks. Thus, many people find Teeccino makes for a re-energizing post-workout beverage.\\nAnother factor that may explain why people experience an energy lift from Teeccino is the pinitol that is naturally present in carob pods. Pinitol has been shown to act like insulin by making cells receptive to taking in glycogen, the energy component in the blood. The natural pinitol in carob may help people who are insulin resistant by increasing the ability of their muscles to use glycogen. Learn more about Teeccino\\'s natural energy boost .\\nBack to the top\\nWhat makes Teeccino\\'s flavors natural?\\nTeeccino uses only pure, natural flavors made from flavoring constituents that are extracted from natural ingredients like fruits, spices, herbs and even coffee. Teeccino flavors do not contain any constituents from meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, soy, soy derivatives or edible yeast. Teeccino does not allow any monosodium glutamate, propylene glycol, or preservatives in its flavors.\\nAll Teeccino flavors are ‘organic compliant’ which means that no ingredients are allowed in them that have been extracted using synthetic solvents or that are not permissible in organic products according to the USDA National Organic Program.\\nBack to the top\\nIs there caffeine in the natural coffee flavor in Teeccino?\\nFlavor houses extract the flavor components from all natural ingredients in order to create natural flavors . In the case of natural coffee flavor, the components of coffee flavor are extracted from a number of ingredients that include both coffee, chicory and even, believe it not, garlic! Who would imagine that coffee and garlic share the same flavor component?\\nThe expertise of flavor chemists allows them to extract only those flavoring components that they require from natural ingredients without getting many other components of each source that don’t contribute to the flavor. Thus it is possible to produce coffee flavor without the caffeine or acidity found in coffee beans. Watch out though for coffee flavored ice cream, yogurt, etc. because these foods usually contain a coffee concentrate or even ground coffee beans that do have caffeine.\\nBack to the top\\nWhat is Inulin?\\nInulin is a natural soluble fiber that is part of chicory root and naturally brews into a cup of Teeccino. Inulin is not the hormone, insulin, which is excreted by the pancreas to control blood sugar levels. Inulin is a prebiotic because it supports a healthy population of beneficial digestive flora.\\nInulin passes through the digestive tract unabsorbed and thus has no caloric value. In the large intestines however, it becomes food for the beneficial microflora such as lactobacillus and bifidus bacteria. The consumption of inulin helps establish and keeps thriving a healthy population of beneficial microflora that are responsible for creating B vitamins, supporting the immune system, and promoting the absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Inulin has also been shown to be helpful in maintaining balanced blood sugar.\\nBack to the top\\nDoes Inulin create gas in some people?\\nOccasionally, a new Teeccino drinker may experience excess gas. \\xa0The excess gas is most likely caused by unfavorable resistant bacteria in the gut. Inulin , from the chicory root in Teeccino, is a prebiotic. Prebiotics are known to feed the \"good\" digestive bacteria like lactobacillus and bifidus flora, but occasionally there may be some unfavorable, resistant bacteria that can cause gas. \\xa0We have found that the excess gas some people have experienced goes away once probiotics with lactobacillus and bifidus bacteria are added to the diet.\\nDrinking Teeccino (a prebiotic) along with taking a probiotic, over a two week period, should help rebalance your colon with the right mix of healthy bacteria that it needs for optimal digestive health. From then on, Teeccino will continue to support a healthy population of beneficial bacteria that is necessary for good health.\\nBack to the top\\nIs there caffeine in the cocoa powder in Mocha, Chocolate Mint and Maya Chocolate\\'?\\nCocoa contains a small amount of caffeine. However, since cocoa is used as a flavoring in Teeccino in very small quantities, no detectable level of caffeine has been found in a cup of Mocha, Chocolate Mint or Chocolaté when tested by independent laboratories.\\nThere is however, a small amount of theobromine, a milder stimulant found in cocoa powder in a cup of Teeccino’s chocolate flavors. If you need to avoid all central nervous system stimulants, you should drink the other Teeccino Herbal Coffee flavors that don’t contain cocoa powder. This includes any flavor except Mocha, Chocolate Mint, and Chocolaté.\\nBack to the top\\nIs Teeccino safe for pregnant women and nursing mothers?\\nYES! All the herbs in Teeccino have been in the human diet for thousands of years. There are no stimulants or drugs like caffeine that could cause uterine contractions or hyperactivity by the infant.\\nAlthough there is misinformation repeated on some internet sites about chicory being contraindicated during pregnancy, there is no scientific substantiation of this claim. On the contrary, there is the long history of pregnant women drinking chicory-based beverages with no problems whatsoever.\\nTeeccino is nutritious for both mom and baby. Many health care practitioners, midwives and doctors recommend Teeccino to their pregnant patients. Learn more about the effects of coffee and caffeine on women’s health .\\nBack to the top\\nIs Teeccino an instant product?\\nNO! The secret to getting the full-bodied, deep roasted flavor of Teeccino lies in brewing Teeccino. Instant teas, coffee or coffee alternatives can\\'t give you the taste satisfaction that come from fresh brewed beverages. Additionally, Instant beverages lose many of their phytonutrients through the manufacturing process that would ordinarily contribute to making these brewed beverages so healthy for you.\\nIf you desire a simpler method of brewing a cup of Teeccino, we recommend Teeccino Tee-bags that steep just like tea. There are many options for brewing a single cup of Teeccino at home or on the go. Check out our recommended one-cup Brewing Tools and Teeccino single-serve Tee-Bags !\\nBack to the top\\nDoes Teeccino\\'s grind work in all the different brewing methods?\\nYES! Teeccino contains a variety of ingredients that are each ground to different specifications. This composite grind allows Teeccino to be brewed in a variety of ways including drip coffee makers, French press pots, percolators and espresso machines. Although making a cup of Teeccino is as simple as brewing coffee, visit our Brewing Tips page to create your ultimate cup of Teeccino!\\nBack to the top\\nDoes Teeccino need to be refrigerated like coffee?\\nNO! Teeccino will not go stale like coffee, because it doesn\\'t have coffee oils which go rancid when not refrigerated. Simply reseal the foil bag with the resealing tape on the package and store in your cupboard. You could also use a clip or rubber band to secure the package further.\\nBrewed Teeccino can last up to a week in your refrigerator, making it convenient and easy to drink iced Teeccino in the summer or reheat Teeccino to enjoy a cup later.\\nBack to the top\\nIs Teeccino GMO Free?\\nTeeccino is completely GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) free. Fortunately, Monsanto and others haven’t seen fit to tinker with the genetic composition of Teeccino\\'s ingredients . We are vigilant however with all our suppliers requesting a guarantee that the ingredients they supply do not contain GMOs. There is some GMO experimentation with barley to make it resistant to a fungus called barley scab, but fortunately it is still restricted to the laboratory and has not been successful so far!\\nBack to the top\\nAre the ingredients in Teeccino organic?\\nOur seven Teeccino Mediterannean flavors (Almond Amaretto, Chocolate Mint, Hazelnut, Java, Mocha, Original and Vanilla Nut) are certified as 75% organic. Our Maya flavors (French Roast ( formerly Caffé), Chai and Chocolaté) are certified USDA Organic which means that at least 95% of their ingredients are certified organic. Our Boutique flavors have a selection of both USDA Organic and 85% organic variations.\\nCarob, barley, chicory root, and ramon nuts used in Teeccino are all certified organic. Some of Teeccino’s other ingredients are organic too, but they may not be declared certified on our label due to problems with consistent supply. Any ingredient listed as organic on the label is certified by Quality Assurance International of San Diego, California.\\nDoes Teeccino have an acidic or alkaline effect in the body?\\nDrinking Teeccino helps you reduce acidity in your body in two ways:\\nFirst, it provides the alkaline mineral, potassium, which your body uses to neutralize acidity and restore alkaline balance .\\nSecond, the soluble fiber, inulin , from chicory in every cup of Teeccino supports a healthy population of beneficial microflora, which enhances your digestion and increases the bio-availability of minerals. By increasing your daily intake of inulin, you improve your ability to absorb the alkaline minerals calcium, potassium, magnesium, cobalt, and copper that a healthy person needs to maintain the body’s natural alkaline balance. Learn more about the benefits to your health of drinking non-acidic Teeccino .\\nBack to the top\\nWhat makes coffee and tea so acidic in the body?\\nCoffee is highly acidic to the body due to its content of over 100 acids. The acids in coffee, not all of which have even been identified, can be highly irritating to the stomach and intestinal lining. Coffee stimulates an increased production of gastric acid which can aggravate a variety of digestive ailments inlcuding heartburn, acid reflux and GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease.) Decaf has the same or even stronger effect because the beans used to produce decaf coffee are usually more highly acidic than regular coffee beans.\\nCaffeine is also a contributing factor to the reason why both coffee and tea have an acidic effect in the body. Caffeine belongs to a group of chemicals called xanthines. Caffeine has to be detoxified in the liver and its metabolites, methylxanthine, methyluric acid and uric acid, are excreted by the kidneys in the urine. If the diet is over-acidic and the kidneys are not able to keep up with processing acids, these acids can contribute to a build up of acidity in the body.\\nStudies have shown that coffee can reduce the pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, which normally prevents the reflux of the acid contents of the stomach from going back up into the esophagus. Since this effect is produced by both coffee and decaf coffee, it is not just the caffeine in coffee that contributes to heartburn, acid reflux, and GERDS. Learn more about the benefits to your health of drinking non-acidic Teeccino .\\nBack to the top\\nIs Teeccino good for people with acid reflux, GERD and IBS?\\nYes! \\xa0We have many customers who drink Teeccino because they gave up coffee after being diagnosed with acid reflux and/or inflammatory bowel diseases like IBS, and are concerned about Digestive Health . \\xa0Coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, is highly acidic and stimulates an increase in gastric acids. \\xa0Coffee is also shown to speed up the process of gastric emptying, which may lead to acidic contents passing into the small intestine too soon. This could injure the intestinal tissue causing very unpleasant symptoms.\\nTeeccino’s potassium content supplies the body with an alkaline mineral needed to correct metabolic acidity. Inulin, a soluble fiber in Teeccino that comes from chicory root, supports a healthy population of beneficial microflora in both the gut and the colon. Including more inulin in your diet by drinking Teeccino supports good digestive health.\\nIf you suffer from digestive disorders, we highly recommend weaning yourself off of coffee using Teeccino\\'s Kick The Caffeine Habit Program.\\nBack to the top\\nDoes Teeccino contain any gluten?\\nAlthough Teeccino contains barley, an independent laboratory at the University of Nebraska specializing in gluten testing found no detectable levels of gluten in brewed Teeccino. Although gluten is present in barley, it most likely does not extract out of the barley using conventional coffee brewing techniques. Gluten is not extracted by boiling water although it can be extracted using ethanol alcohol, which of course is not present in Teeccino. Click here to see Gluten testing results.\\nFor gluten-sensitive customers, we highly recommend using a paper filter in a drip coffee maker to brew Teeccino so that no particles of Teeccino can leak into the brewed liquid. T eeccino Tee-bags are also perfect for gluten-sensitive customers because the Teeccino grounds are enclosed completely in the tea bag filter paper. Since ingesting small particles of Teeccino grounds could cause a reaction to gluten, we don\\'t recommend reusable filters since they are not as completely reliable as paper filters in preventing particles from going through the filter during brewing. Read more about how to keep Teeccino gluten free .\\nTeeccino Dandelion Herbal Coffees are made without barley and are designed expressly for those gluten-sensitive people who are concerned that they may still be sensitive to the barley in Teeccino\\'s Mediterranean and Maya flavors. Although most gluten-sensitive people report that they have no problems drinking Teeccino, some people do experience a reaction and thus Teeccino Dandelion Herbal Coffees are the best option for preventing a gluten reaction.\\nBack to the top\\nWhat are ramon nuts?\\nRamon nuts are the seed of the fruit of the ramon tree, a 120 ft. tall tree that grows throughout Central America. The ramon tree (Brosimum Alicastrum) is a member of the fig family, which also includes mulberry trees, and forms the upper canopy of the rainforest. Referred to as \"corn tree\" by the Maya civilization, its nut was a nutrient-rich, staple food crop, capable of being stored for lengthy periods of time. Fresh ramon nuts can be boiled like potatoes. The dry nut is roasted, ground into a flour and combined with corn for baking. Dark roasted ramon nuts taste very similar to coffee!\\nRamon nuts are high in potassium, fiber, and minerals. They contain all the essential amino acids including a high amount of trytophan, known for its calming effects. Ramon nuts are both fat free and gluten free. Ramon nuts were used medicinally by the Maya to detoxify the liver and promote lactation in nursing women. Other common names for ramon nuts are ojoche, mojo, breadnut and mayanut.\\nBack to the top\\nDoes Teeccino buy fair trade ingredients?\\nMost of Teeccino\\'s ingredients are grown in Europe and the USA by first-world farmers. We source organic chicory in India and wild-crafted ramon nuts in Guatemala, which allows us to work in developing countries with small family farmers and rainforest villagers. These ingredients create new trade that provides more economic opportunities in regions where sources of income are scarce.\\nFair trade is very important for commodity-driven products where exploitation is common. Creating new trade provides more ways to raise the quality of life for rural communities. By drinking Teeccino, you join us in supporting families devoted to organic values in both first world and developing countries. Read more about Teeccino’s work creating new trade.\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'Caffeine & Weight Loss Print\\nCaffeine & Weight Loss\\nMany people have the popular misconception that caffeine will help them lose weight. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Drinking caffeinated beverages or taking pills containing caffeine ultimately stimulates increased appetite for sweets and fatty foods. Caffeine triggers a roller coaster ride of elevated blood sugar and stress hormones that\\xa0 thwarts people\\'s efforts on a diet to stick to their regime.\\nTeeccino Herbal Coffee , the best selling brand of coffee alternatives, is recommended by well known doctors and health educators in a number of popular weight loss diets for several reasons:\\nPeople can achieve balanced blood sugar, lower their stress and and stabilize their hormone levels if they avoid caffeine and sugar. Kicking the caffeine habit with Teeccino helps them avoid triggering appetite cravings.\\nA natural energy boost is important during dieting. Teeccino provides a lift from nutrients, not stimulants, that keeps energy steady and stable as opposed to caffeinated energy spikes followed by crashes.\\nA full-bodied hot beverage that is low in calories and yet has a natural sweetness helps satisfy the urge for a dessert . Many people on a diet drink a mug of Teeccino as their \"treat\" for a snack or after a meal.\\nA mug of Teeccino provides a full feeling that keeps dieters from wanting to eat more.\\nOur mission at Teeccino is to support people who want to achieve optimal health. We have compiled scientific studies to educate you about the effects of caffeine and coffee on weight loss. Carrying excess weight not only hastens early mortality, but being overweight is associated with many chronic diseases, including: diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and increased incidence of cancer. (NIH, 2003) If your goal is to lose weight, we invite you to read the scientific research below and consider kicking the caffeine habit with Teeccino .\\nCaffeine Increases Stress\\nCaffeine from coffee drinking aggravates stress, including physical, mental, and emotional stress, which can affect your mood and your health. Caffeine intake elevates the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine. (Robertson et al, 1978) (Lane et al, 1990) (Kerr, 1993) (Lane et al, 2002)\\nIf you are trying to lose weight, it is a good idea to avoid coffee and other sources of caffeine in order to reduce potential stress. Caffeine increases the reactivity of the body to the stress of everyday life and increased levels of stress negatively affect weight loss. (Lane et al, 2002)\\nCaffeine Stimulates Appetite\\nAlthough caffeine is included as an ingredient in many weight-loss aids, it actually stimulates appetite, and organizations including the Mayo Clinic (Mayo Clinic, 2003) discourage the use of caffeine as a weight-loss aid. Initially, caffeine may decrease appetite through its central nervous system response. However subsequently, higher levels of cortisol caused by caffeine consumption stimulate appetite. (Takeda et al, 2004) (Epel et al, 2001)\\nCaffeine triggers hypoglycemia through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal glands, causing an immediate and sustained constriction of blood vessels, decreased circulation to the brain and a heightened feeling of low blood sugar. (Kerr et al, 1993)\\nThe body’s reaction to hypoglycemia results in food cravings and increased appetite. People often crave higher fat foods resulting in increased caloric intake, further interfering with the body’s ability to maintain a healthy weight (Strachen et al, 2004) (Dewan et al, 2004)\\nIncreased Stress Leads to Overeating\\nA chronic state of increased stress is associated with a markedly increased tendency to overeat. Anxiety caused by caffeine stimulating the central nervous system increases the tendency of people to overeat or binge-eat and abuse laxatives and diet pills. (Krahn et al, 1991) (Livermore, 1991)\\nCoffee drinking increases physiological measurements of stress, and although this effect is greater with increased caffeine levels, decaffeinated coffee may also influence stress as factors other than caffeine in coffee are associated with stress. (Quinlan et al, 2000)\\nElevation of stress hormones leads to fat cravings (Castonquay, 1991)\\nElevated levels of cortisol increase appetite (Takeda et al, 2004)\\nIncreased Cortisol Levels Lead to Abdominal Obesity\\nChronically elevated blood cortisol levels that are caused by frequent stress or regular caffeine or coffee intake lead to an increased buildup of fat in the abdominal area; this type of weight gain further stimulates the release of additional stress hormones. (Dallman et al, 2004)\\nA well documented relationship exists between chronically elevated levels of stress hormones and deposition of excess fat in the abdomen leading to obesity as well as increased caloric intake, particularly increased ingestion of fats and sugars (Bjorntorp, 2001)\\nCaffeine Interferes with Calming Neurotransmitters\\nGABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid) is a neurotransmitter naturally produced in the brain and nervous system as well as the heart. It plays an important role in mood and stress management and influences a person\\'s sense of well-being.\\nCaffeine has been found to interfere with binding of GABA to GABA receptors, preventing it from performing its calming function (Roca et al, 1988) GABA’s role in stress management is compromised in the presence of caffeine, and increased physiological and psychological stress lead to overeating as well as difficulties losing weight.\\nReference (by alphabetical order)\\nNIH Publication No. 03-4158.

       "  'document': 'Green Coffee Beans and Whole Coffee Beans\\nFrom organic to green, light and dark, fine to coarse, see the wide selection of coffee beans at our site.\\nIf you are tired of drinking regular decaf coffee that does have trace amounts of caffeine, and you will be happy to know that there is a new species of coffee plant that has been created which is caffeine free. This was actually named one of the top 10 new species of 2009 by the University of Arizona, and it is a caffeine free coffee plant coming from West Africa. The name of the plant is coffea charrieriana, and it is from Cameroon and happens to be the first recorded species of coffee plant that is caffeine free. The purpose of the breeding process was to cultivate beans that are grown naturally as decaffeinated.\\nTo put this in perspective, we can first discuss how regular coffee beans are currently decaffeinated, and the processes that are used. There are two main methods for decaffeination, the Swiss Water Process and the Chemical Solvent Method. The majority of the decaf coffee that you find that it is gourmet or organic is actually decaffeinated through the Swiss Water Process, and the other methods use a chemical solvent. Most coffee connoisseurs prefer the Swiss Water Process because it is free from chemicals and uses a green coffee extract. During the process, the caffeine actually moves from the bean to the extract because it has a lower concentration and essential oils. The caffeine can then be absorbed into the extract, leaving the taste and aroma of being behind with around 95% less caffeine remaining. This is a great option, but some individuals who are truly caffeine sensitive may still have a hard time drinking decaf coffee that is not 100% caffeine free. Another thing to keep in mind is that Swiss Water Process beans can be more costly because they are chemical free, and higher-quality beans are used in the process, almost exclusively Arabica.\\nDecaffeination in the Chemical Solvent Method will have a better percentage of removing caffeine, but it does use both Robusta and Arabica beans, with the Robusta being lower quality. These solvents in the process counteract the caffeine after the green coffee beans are soaked in the chemicals. The coffee beans are rinse thoroughly and then steamed so that all of the chemicals evaporate, and these solvents are fully eliminated during roasting. This process will give you a 98% decaffeinated bean.\\nThe good news overall about a species of coffee plant that is naturally decaffeinated is the fact of a higher flavor profile and taste preservation than beans that are decaffeinated by either process. Coffee beans that are put through a decaffeination system can lose their original flavors and aromas, especially when they are compromised with chemicals, so this is an opportunity for coffee connoisseurs to experience the best taste and flavor without added caffeine. The scientific findings also show that this breed of plant is very easy to reproduce to create different varieties and blends of coffee. If you are a true coffee lover that wants to eliminate caffeine from your tasty cup of Joe, then I recommend that you keep your ear open to all of the new advances concerning this plant.\\nOthers are also reading...\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'These truffles contain chocolate and coffee -- two natural sources of caffeine.\\nMarko Goodwin\\nCaffeine is a naturally occurring chemical compound. Caffeine\\'s systematic name is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine or 3,7-dihydro-1,3,7-trimethyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione and its chemical formula is C8H10N4O2. Caffeine is also commonly known as coffeine, theine, mateine, guaranine and methyltheobromine. (Although some sources claim that these are separate chemical compounds they are, in fact, caffeine.)\\nWhere is Caffeine Found?\\nCaffeine is found in coffee , tea , chocolate and yerba mate , as well as a 56 other herbs and plants. It is also added to some types of foods and drinks (such as colas and energy drinks) and drugs (such as Excedrin).\\nHow Does Caffeine Work?\\nCaffeine reduces the body\\'s inclination toward feeling tired in two main ways.\\nFirst, caffeine mimics a naturally occurring chemical called adenosine and binds to the brain\\'s adenosine receptors and the adenosine receptors in other organs of the body. The receptors are blocked by caffeine, which prevents adenosine from binding to them. Adenosine\\'s role in the brain is to slow down nerve impulses and cause drowsiness, so caffeine\\'s presence inhibits this reaction and increases alertness and responsiveness. In their stimulated state, nerve cells can release the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline), which increases heart rate and blood pressure, increases blood flow to muscles, decreases blood flow to the skin and organs, and prompts the liver to release glucose (a form of liquid sugar which supplies the body with energy).\\nSecond, caffeine increases dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a naturally occurring chemical responsible for feelings of well-being and happiness. Therefore, caffeine tends to improve one\\'s mood. This is thought to be the primary reason that caffeine is an addictive substance.\\nHow Much Caffeine is Safe?\\nFor most people, about 300 mg of caffeine a day is a healthy level of caffeine consumption. That is roughly equivalent to three cups of coffee. However, caffeine levels in coffee, tea and chocolate vary widely, and some people experience symptoms of excess caffeine consumptions after consuming as little as 100 mg of caffeine, so be sure to check how much caffeine is in your favorite products if you are concerned about your caffeine intake. (Side note -- Contrary to popular belief, dark roast coffee generally has less caffeine than light roast coffee.)\\nTen to 20 grams of caffeine is generally considered a lethal dose, though the exact amount varies from person to person. However, death by caffeine is extremely rare, and is usually intentional.\\nFor more information, see symptoms of too much caffeine .\\nWhat Does Decaf Mean and How Does Decaffeination Work?\\n\" Decaf \" means that some or most of the caffeine in a caffeine-containing substance has been removed. Coffee can be decaffeinated in several ways . Tea can be decaffeinated with chemical processing or carbon dioxide processing. There is also a pervasive myth surrounding how to decaffeinate tea with hot water .\\nWhat is Pure Caffeine Like?\\nOnce isolated, caffeine is a crystalline white powder with an intensely bitter flavor. This powder is a natural byproduct of tea baking, coffee roasting and tea / coffee decaffeination. Pure caffeine is often reused and mixed into energy drinks, colas and medications.\\nCaffeine was first isolated from coffee by the German chemist Friedrich Ferdinand Runge in 1819.\\nIs Caffeine a Drug?\\nBy the generally accepted definition of \"drug,\" yes, caffeine is a drug. It is a stimulant and it can be very addictive when consumed in excess with regularity. Caffeine is not only a drug; it is the most popular drug in the world. Around 90 percent of Americans consume caffeine in some form every day, and as a nation, the U.S. consumes over 450,000,000 cups of coffee daily.\\nIf you\\'re interested in cutting down on caffeine, read up on how to reduce caffeine intake , caffeine withdrawal symptoms and caffeine headaches .\\nCan Caffeine Help Someone Sober Up?\\nThere is a common myth that caffeine (or coffee) will help a drunk person sober up. This has been proven to be completely false, and consuming caffeine while drunk can actually cause more harm than good. (For example, if someone has drunk enough that their natural physical reaction is to pass out and, by default, stop drinking, then caffeine can inhibit this reaction and allow them to continue drinking.

       "  'document': 'Coffee shop caffeine: pregnancy health risk?\\nPosted by David Adler on Fri, Dec 02, 2011 @ 11:19 AM\\nTweet\\n“Pregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies in danger by drinking coffee from high street chains,” reported the\\nDaily Express. Other newspapers reported the wide range of caffeine levels in espresso shots from different coffee outlets.\\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should continue to be careful about how much caffeine they drink. Current advice from the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day.\\nThe story comes from an analysis of the caffeine content of single shots of espresso from 20 high-street coffee shops in Glasgow. The amount of caffeine they contained varied considerably, from 322mg to 51mg a shot.\\nThe authors say that normally quoted figures for caffeine levels in coffee, which they say are about 50mg a cup, are misleading. One single shot of a high-caffeine drink could place at risk people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of coffee. These include pregnant women, women taking oral contraceptives, young children and people with liver disease, they warn.\\nThe authors also highlight that many coffee outlets prepare other coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, from espresso shots. As they rightly conclude, coffee consumption in commercial outlets and caffeine content of other drinks need to be studied further, so that consumer information can be improved.\\nCaffeine is also found in other foods including tea, chocolate, some soft drinks, and some cold and flu remedies.\\nWhere did the story come from?\\nThe study was carried out by researchers from the University of Glasgow. No sources of external funding were reported in the paper. The study was published in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal, Food and Function.\\nThe story was generally covered accurately in the media. The Daily Express’s claim that “pregnant women are putting themselves and their unborn babies at risk” was misleading as it implied the study found that pregnant women consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. The analysis was of caffeine levels in high-street coffee outlets. It did not look at caffeine intake among pregnant women or any other group.\\nWhat kind of research was this?\\nThis was a chemical analysis of levels of caffeine in single-shot espresso coffees purchased from 20 different outlets. Researchers also looked at levels of another substance in these products called caffeoylquinic acid (CQA). They said that CQA has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have antioxidant properties, but there is limited evidence for any direct protective effects on human health.\\nThey pointed out that consuming caffeine in excess can lead to unpleasant symptoms, although individual susceptibility varies. Certain groups, including pregnant women and young children, are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine because their bodies process it more slowly.\\nThe researchers also say that there is no published information on the caffeine content of the various types of commercially prepared coffees, despite the increasing number of coffee shops on the high street and in other settings, such as airports. The authors quote figures from a US review, published by the International Food Information Council Foundation, which suggest that a 28ml of espresso contains 30–50mg of caffeine.\\nWhat did the research involve?\\nThe researchers bought single-shot espresso coffees from 20 different outlets in Glasgow’s west end. They measured the volume of each coffee serving, which ranged from 23ml to 70ml, before diluting it with methanol (alcohol) and freezing it. The diluted coffee samples were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a biochemical technique that can separate and identify individual components of a particular compound.\\nTo explore a possible reason for any variations in the coffees’ caffeine and chemical content, they also carried out a similar analysis of six samples of ground espresso arabica coffee, prepared from beans subject to different roasting methods.\\nWhat were the basic results?\\nThe analysis of caffeine levels in the 20 espresso shots found a six-fold variation in caffeine levels. The strongest coffee contained 322mg in one shot (from Patisserie Francoise), six times more than the lowest strength, which contained 51mg (from Starbucks). Three further products contained more than 200mg of caffeine and a further eight contained over 100mg (between 129mg and 173mg). The cup size ranged from 23ml to 70ml.\\nHow did the researchers interpret the results?\\nThe researchers concluded that the range of results in their snapshot of espresso coffees demonstrates that the normally quoted figures for caffeine content – about 50mg a cup – are misleading. Consumers at risk of caffeine toxicity, including pregnant women, children and those with liver disease, may unknowingly consume excessive caffeine from a single cup of espresso coffee.\\nThey suggest that the large variability in caffeine content could be due to a number of factors, such as:\\nthe amount of coffee used to prepare the espresso\\ndifferences between batches of coffee beans\\ndifferent procedures used to roast the beans (such as high-temperature short roast and low-temperature long roast)\\ngrinding conditions\\ncoffee-making process (such as the temperature of the water or steam, and ratio of coffee to water or steam)\\nThey highlighted that since many coffee houses prepare larger-volume coffees, such as lattes and cappuccinos, by diluting a single or double shot of espresso, further study on these products is needed. New data are needed to provide labelling information “with attention to bean variety, preparation and barista methods”.\\nConclusion\\nThis analysis provides a useful snapshot of the caffeine content in a range of espresso coffees bought on the high street. Although the study was carried out in only one city, its finding that there is a wide variation in caffeine content is likely to apply to coffee bought in other UK cafes. It found that the caffeine content of most products was higher than normally expected and it is possible that some coffee drinkers may unknowingly consume large amounts of caffeine. In some cases, a single serving may place people who are more susceptible to the toxic effects of caffeine at risk.\\nThe researchers only looked at caffeine levels in espresso coffee, which may not be standard preference in the UK. Although they point out that other types of coffee drinks are based on espresso shots, further analysis of the caffeine content of the more popular, larger drinks is needed. The researchers carried out their analysis only once, without any replication, and the possibility of error in the chemical procedure used to analyse caffeine levels should be noted.\\nPregnant women who enjoy the occasional commercially prepared coffee should not worry unduly about these findings, although they should take care with how much caffeine they consume. Current advice from the FSA is that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg a day, due to concerns about potential associations with low birth weight and miscarriage. However, the risks from occasionally exceeding this recommended intake are thought to be low.\\nThe FSA states that the average daily caffeine intake during pregnancy is already believed to be below 200mg. However, in light of the current study’s findings, further study investigation of the caffeine intake of pregnant women and other vulnerable groups would be valuable.\\nThe researchers in this study say that a cup of coffee is assumed to contain 50mg of caffeine, but the FSA advises that a mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg caffeine, and a mug of filter coffee contains around 140mg of caffeine.\\nConsumers should also be aware that there is caffeine in other foods including tea, chocolate and some soft drinks. Caffeine is also found in some cold and flu remedies, and pregnant women in particular are advised to check with a pharmacist or midwife before they take any such remedies.\\n',\n",

Boil It in Pure Water\\nAdd 1 tablespoon for every 1 cup of pure water, and boil about 5-10 minutes. Strain and drink. Straining is optional, as the grounds will be soft and are edible. The longer it boils, the stronger it gets. Serve with milk or cream, or soymilk, rice milk, almond milk, or coconut milk.\\n2. Coffee Drip Machine\\nThis also works well, and produces a deep flavored cup. Use from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of Roast per cup (8 ounces) of water.\\n3. Coffee/Tea Press\\nPour boiling water into a coffee/tea press, and add the Roast. Then let sit for 5-10 minutes, depending on the strength desired.\\n4. Espresso Machine\\nGrind the Ayurvedic Roast in a coffee grinder, and then you\\'re ready for the espresso machine!\\n5. Just Pour Hot Water On It!\\nPour hot water into a cup containing 1-3 teaspoons (based on desired strength), and let sit for 3-5 minutes. The grounds will get soft, and can be eaten, as they are the barley, rye, and chicory root. Healthy!\\nShipping\\nWe like to see you receive our delicious coffee alternative as soon as possible.

I love the Ayurvedic Roast!\\nDon L.\\nThis herbal coffee has an earthy, full bouqeut. Nicely aromatic. I\\'ve become addicted to it! Drinking this coffee alternative just makes me feel good!\\nGarrick Ginzberg-Voskov\\nAfter being told that caffeine was significantly bad for us over 40\\'s, and that decaf had bad effects on cholesterol, I decided to try the herbal coffee route. My wife and I have tried the \\'other\\' herbal coffee and Ayurvedic Roast. We both enjoyed the slightly stronger coffee flavor and definitely less sweet flavor of the Ayurvedic Roast. It smells better out of the bag as well as during the brew process. It was easy to make in our drip coffee maker, and maintained flavor even when cold (yes, I drink cold coffee after hours of sitting around). While I have become hooked on the flavor of coffee, this substitute is sufficient to fool me with its own unique, in a good way, flavor.\\nBob Flanagan\\nHealth Benefits\\nAyurvedic Roast is made with all organic ingredients, starting with fresh roasted barley, chicory root, and rye. On top of these healthy grains, we add our own unique herbal combination which has been used for centuries in the ancient tradition of Ayurveda: Ashwagandha, Shatavari, and Brahmi.\\nMore information on each herb:\\nAshwagandha: Known as the the \"ginseng of India\", this incredible herb promotes strength and stability in the physiology, and is also an anti-oxidant. It builds immunity and strength, and calms the mind and body.\\nShatavari: Possesing many of the benefits of Ashwagandha, it counterbalances its somewhat heating quality with it cooling effect, and augments their mutually beneficial effects on the body.\\nBrahmi: Commonly used in Ayurveda to lessen mental strain and worry*, it also helps increase intelligence and clarity*. In combination with the other 2 herbs, it has a soothing effect on the mind, while maintaining alertness.\\nThe unique synergy of these three treasured organic herbs creates a soothing, uplifting, and strenthening effect on the mind, body, and spirit*.\\nPregnant and nursing women, and those who have known medical conditions and are under the care of a physician should consult with their medical providers before taking this.\\nThis stuff is amazing!

I love this stuff and drink it almost daily.\\nJack C.\\nHow To Brew It\\nSteep like tea or brew like coffee. Any way you do it, you\\'ll be getting a tasty and healthy caffeine-free beverage!\\n1. Boil It in Pure Water\\nAdd 1 tablespoon for every 1 cup of pure water, and boil about 5-10 minutes. Strain and drink. Straining is optional, as the grounds will be soft and are edible. The longer it boils, the stronger it gets. Serve with milk or cream, or soymilk, rice milk, almond milk, or coconut milk.\\n2. Coffee Drip Machine\\nThis also works well, and produces a deep flavored cup. Use from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of Roast per cup (8 ounces) of water.\\n3. Coffee/Tea Press\\nPour boiling water into a coffee/tea press, and add the Roast. Then let sit for 5-10 minutes, depending on the strength desired.\\n4. Espresso Machine\\nGrind the Ayurvedic Roast in a coffee grinder, and then you\\'re ready for the espresso machine!\\n5. Just Pour Hot Water On It!\\nPour hot water into a cup containing 1-3 teaspoons (based on desired strength), and let sit for 3-5 minutes. The grounds will get soft, and can be eaten, as they are the barley, rye, and chicory root. Healthy!\\nShipping\\nWe like to see you receive our delicious coffee alternative as soon as possible. That is why we ship within 24 hours of receiving your order, and use USPS Priority shipping on 11 ounce and 4lb bags, so it gets there within 2-4 business days.

I love the Ayurvedic Roast!\\nDon L.\\nThis herbal coffee has an earthy, full bouqeut. Nicely aromatic. I\\'ve become addicted to it! Drinking this coffee alternative just makes me feel good!\\nGarrick Ginzberg-Voskov\\nAfter being told that caffeine was significantly bad for us over 40\\'s, and that decaf had bad effects on cholesterol, I decided to try the herbal coffee route. My wife and I have tried the \\'other\\' herbal coffee and Ayurvedic Roast. We both enjoyed the slightly stronger coffee flavor and definitely less sweet flavor of the Ayurvedic Roast. It smells better out of the bag as well as during the brew process. It was easy to make in our drip coffee maker, and maintained flavor even when cold (yes, I drink cold coffee after hours of sitting around). While I have become hooked on the flavor of coffee, this substitute is sufficient to fool me with its own unique, in a good way, flavor.\\nBob Flanagan\\nHealth Benefits\\nAyurvedic Roast is made with all organic ingredients, starting with fresh roasted barley, chicory root, and rye. On top of these healthy grains, we add our own unique herbal combination which has been used for centuries in the ancient tradition of Ayurveda: Ashwagandha, Shatavari, and Brahmi.\\nMore information on each herb:\\nAshwagandha: Known as the the \"ginseng of India\", this incredible herb promotes strength and stability in the physiology, and is also an anti-oxidant. It builds immunity and strength, and calms the mind and body.\\nShatavari: Possesing many of the benefits of Ashwagandha, it counterbalances its somewhat heating quality with it cooling effect, and augments their mutually beneficial effects on the body.\\nBrahmi: Commonly used in Ayurveda to lessen mental strain and worry*, it also helps increase intelligence and clarity*. In combination with the other 2 herbs, it has a soothing effect on the mind, while maintaining alertness.\\nThe unique synergy of these three treasured organic herbs creates a soothing, uplifting, and strenthening effect on the mind, body, and spirit*.\\nPregnant and nursing women, and those who have known medical conditions and are under the care of a physician should consult with their medical providers before taking this.\\nThis stuff is amazing! It really tastes like a clean, mild, exotic cup of coffee! And its good for you! I love IT!

       "  'document': '0\\nPosted March 31, 2012 by admin in Food & Nutrition\\nCaffeine is found occurring naturally and used as an additive to several of the foods we consume throughout the day, including coffee, tea, fizzy drinks and chocolate amongst other harvest. We often rely on such caffeine- laden harvest to give us boosts of energy when we are flagging.\\nMany of us struggle to function and get owing to the day lacking it. Caffeine is very difficult to dodge completely as mentioned earlier, it does naturally suggest itself in many foods and drinks but when consumed to excess, do you ever stop and wonder whether all that caffeine might be detrimental to your health?\\nHealth check research has recognized that very unwarranted caffeine utilization, or even moderate caffeine intake in children and some those who are more sensitive to the things of caffeine, may cause caffeine intoxication. Caffeine intoxication symptoms consist of; restlessness, take a nap disturbances irritability, nervousness, frequent urination and stomach upsets. And trying to go cold failure can cause headaches, anxiety and even the shakes.\\nStudies also suggest that pregnant women, those suffering from high blood pressure, anyone with heart disease, those who have survived a stroke and the elderly should drink caffeine with farthest caution. People who suffer from anxiety disorders or who are caffeine sensitive are much more prone to side-things. Of course, there are healthier alternatives to getting that much needed energy boost.\\ncatechin polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) which are antioxidants that can protect the liver from toxins and aid in its normal function. These antioxidants mop up the harmful free radicals in the body and can help protect against heart ailments, strokes, arthritis, diabetes and degenerative diseases of the nervous system. Theanine, another ingredient in Green tea has a calming effect on the human body, and is known to relieve anxiety and partially neutralize the rise in blood pressure that can suggest itself due to caffeine intake. It is also used to treat an array of skin conditions including acne and eczema.\\nGreen tea does contain Caffeine as with any regular tea, however the amount is so inconsequential that it is dodgy to cause any major side things and with the vast amount of benefits demonstrated by drinking a daily cuppa of Green tea we really can’t think of any better reason to kick the habit and instead, make Green tea your drink of choice.\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'Hang in there! Some experiences and advice\\nI’ve been caffeine-free for 2,5 month, after more than 20 years of caffeine addiction (I’m 40). Actual withdrawal took between 3 to 4 weeks. I reduced intake for 3 days and then went off caffeine completely, taking a lot of ibuprofen. The entries here helped me a lot, so I want to share some lessons without being redundant. I will omit experiences that appear in many other entries.\\nWithdrawal episodes are different. I had tried to get off caffeine several times before. Each time was different. E.g., I had less or no depression in the final attempt. If you failed in the past, it’s worthwhile to try again.\\nThe same is true for the period after the actual withdrawal. In the past, I always got through the withdrawal but gave up later because I felt that I lacked the energy to get my job done without caffeine. This time it took some time (around 6 weeks), but even after 3-4 weeks I had hours in which I felt better and more productive than with caffeine. Ironically, it may have helped that me productivity and energy with caffeine had gotten so low. It is important to have a realistic idea about how much you can and should actually do in a day. I think in the past, I had unrealistic ideas about how much one can and should work. Caffeine was part of very bad working habits (a mixture of procrastination, lack of rest, lack of relaxation and fun). It may help to read a book like “The now habit” to look at this side of the equation.\\nSocial support and distraction helps. Going through withdrawal alone seems to make psychological symptoms more likely and physical symptoms worse. Having people around helps even if all interaction is at a low level.\\nPsychological support is important. Surround yourself with people that support your goal of getting off caffeine. Whenever I thought about quitting, I read entries or research results on caffeine on the web or in books. This helped me a lot. I think central to withdrawal is to change deep beliefs in your own brain and body that you cannot function without caffeine. It is easy to go back to these lies, it takes a lot of work not to.\\nOne of the most interesting results for me was this. I used to say that moderation is impossible for me, which is the reason why I always went (almost) cold turkey. Ironically, after been caffeine free for around 1,5 months, the beliefs in my brain and body really changed. Now I know not only intellectually but deep in my system that caffeine does nothing for me but providing a short term fix. But this means that I can allow myself this fix in exceptional circumstances. If I lack sleep and am really tired but have to get something done, I occasionally allow myself half a cup of green tea, which helps (in the past I drank around more-or-less 4 double espressos a day). But I make sure that this does not happen two days in a row, and I take this fix as a sign that I have to get more sleep or rest or relaxation, or have to rethink my workload or work schedule. It has never tempted me to get back to regular consumption at all. Also, the effect of green tea is very mild or hardly recognizable in my system. I would not do this with coffee. In any case, this might not work for others, so staying completely clean might be better. And of course, this is my goal as well. If I get enough sleep, rest and exercise no fix is needed. It is just that I like the new freedom of having a small fix if I want to without any fear of being tempted back into the terrible habit of regular consumption.\\nBeing caffeine free helped me to lose weight. I had gained around 5 kilos in the month before the withdrawal, which had nothing really to do with caffeine. However, being off caffeine helped me to lose this again very quickly, because coffee consumption with closely associated with sweets in my system. Since my withdrawal, I have not eaten cake or sweets. If you are interested in this aspect, you might want to check out a book, I think it is called “The Decaf Diet”.\\nBest of luck!\\n',\n",

       "  'document': 'Published in Jornal da Tarde, July 9 1998\\nTranslated by Assunção Medeiros\\nOne of the most terrible customs that North-American culture transmitted to the world is the literal belief in certain scientific metaphors that, entering current language, end up deforming the perception of reality and perverting all human relations.\\nArrested by the apparent credibility of the terms, people acquire new patterns of judgement that – reputed as capable of giving them the correct measure of the world – in truth install them in a kingdom of fantasy and pure nonsense.\\nI started to think about this when, in Bloomington, Indiana, realizing that I was taking my second successive cup of coffee with the intention of sweetening my palate for a cigar, a local citizen observed that my organism was fond of a certain quantity of caffeine, being now unable to live without it.\\n- A moment, I answered – Americans drink caffeine. I drink coffee.\\n- And what is the difference?\\n- The difference is that, if caffeine as such served as antipasto to a cigar, I could drink tea, which sometimes has it in greater quantities. However, I abominate tea.\\n- This is subjective, protested my interlocutor. Biochemically, coffee and tea are the same thing.\\n- With all due respect, my friend: subjective is the distinction between the biochemical aspect and the rest of my person. After all, it is not my biochemistry that drinks coffee: it is I.\\nBiochemically coffee can be tea, but it does not have the same flavor, the same aroma, nor the same evocations of childhood, the same taste of those long evenings in the country, by the fire, listening to ghost stories. No Englishman will trade for coffee his tea, under the allegation that it is also caffeine. And the Berbers would think it ridiculous to drink tea instead of that bitterly dense coffee, with grounds on the bottom.\\n- These are merely personal and cultural differences.\\n- Yes, but it is for the seeking of these differences, and not only for biochemical effect, that a person drinks coffee or tea. If the important part was the biochemical effect, these differences that you call cultural would have no reason for being, and the drinks could be changed without people being aware of it.\\n- Why, then, don’t the caffeine addicts accept decaffeinated coffee?\\n- First, because it does not taste like coffee, second because it is written in the label: “Decaffeinated”, what means that it is drunk for the fear of dying, not for the joy of living.\\nI was not able to convince my American friend.\\nBut, even if the conversation were not about drinking, it would be the same. An American, when is holding a naked woman, believes himself to be an animal in search of an orgasm. This effect could be obtained more easily through manual or electronic means, if you did not count with these “subjective differences” that separate in our eyes, for example, Brooke Shields from Betty Friedman.\\nThe belief that the scientific point of view is more valid, more truthful than the personal motivations with which we explain our actions spontaneously has been incorporated to the current mentality to such extent that today it substitutes direct perception, depreciated as prejudices from old, backward country bumpkins. The Americanization of world culture lets us predict that this habit will contaminate all the peoples, all the cultures. It will become in the end decisive criterion in public debates and private disputes between husband and wife, father and son, where each one, instead of expressing his feelings, more and more will rationalize them with fake arguments of scientific origin.\\nThe problem with this is that all of it comes from a fetishistic view – and this, truly, profoundly backward – of what science is. The point of view of a determined science about reality is always a partial and hypothetical cut of it, which only has value for the limited proposals of this science, never for the generality of knowledge. Even more so because sciences are many, and no one knows how to articulate the points of view of all of them to create, above common reality, a supra-reality that is more truthful. Biochemically, drinking coffee or tea is a lack in caffeine, but from the economic point of view it is a pattern of consumption determined by a marketing practice that is totally detached from the actual composition of these substances. Anthropologically, it can be a cultural habit that would resist even negative propaganda (like, by the way, happens to smoking). No one can synthesize, in a single theory, the biochemistry, economy, and anthropology of coffee or tea; however, this synthesis is precisely what each one of us innocently does, without being able to express it in words, each time we drink, with pleasure, our coffee or our tea. Here we find ourselves in real life, the Lebenswelt in Husserl, to which science – each science or a group of them – can only refer to in an allusive and indirect way. They are impotent to give account of a single concrete fact, with all the density of the inseparable determinations that constitute it. We see then that the old American love for the hard facts has become today only rhetoric pretending. That it now hides a secret devotion to sophisticated and artificial theories and schemes, nostalgia of a teenage mental omnipotence and preview of the Brave New World in which we will live in the 21st century.\\n',\n",

He has since been replaced at the company as police investigations now encompass retailers and wholesalers over three states.\\nPolice in Victoria, New South Wales, have already seized $50,000 in cash which has been linked to\\xa0coffee and tea suppliers which are alleged to have paid to get their products onto the shelves of the company’s 700 stores throughout Australia.\\nAt present, police inquires are focusing on the coffee and tea industry but will be extended at a later date to further examine Mr Harvey’s dealings and to ascertain whether or not the scheme might have spread to other products within the Woolworths range.\\nSpeaking to the Australian press, Clare Buchanan – Woolworths public relations manager – has confirmed that Woolworths are “working closely with police to investigate an allegation and an individual is currently assisting police with their inquires”.\\n“Woolworths take such matters extremely seriously but due to the ongoing investigation can make no further comment at this time.”\\nAudit investigators, working with the police, have begun checking suspect assets and will be looking at suspects finances closely to see if they have been receiving large sums of money and living beyond their means.\\nThe surcharges scandal is the latest in a host of recent allegations made against Coles and Woolworths, two of Australia’s largest supermarket chains.\\n',\n",

Love Love and sex are NOT the same thing. Love is an emotion or a feeling. There is no one definition of love because the word \"love\" can mean many different things to many different people. Sex, on the other hand, is a biological event. Even though there are different kinds of sex, most sexual acts have certain things in common. Sex may or may not include penetration. Differences Between Love and Sex Love Love is a feeling (emotional). There is no exact \"right\" definition of love for everybody. Love involves feelings of romance and/or attraction. Sex: Sex is an event or act (physical). There are different kinds of sex but all kinds of sex have some things in common. Can happen between a male and a female, between two females, between two males, or by one\\'s self (masturbation) Abstinence The word for not having sex is called abstinence. Some people, especially people who think it\\'s not cool to wait to have sex, think that abstinence is a completely bad thing. Actually, there are some really good things about abstinence and some of them might apply to you. Abstinence, or not having oral, vaginal or anal sex, is the best way to protect yourself. It is possible to get an STD even without having intercourse (penetrative sex) through skin toskin contact (herpes and genital warts can be passed this way). You also have to think about your own personal values and feelings. Your teenage years bring a lot of changes in how you feel about yourself, family, friends and potential love interests even if you don\\'t think about sex. No matter what your feelings on sex are, it may be smart to wait until something \"feels right.\" Ways to Express Love Without Sex There are millions of nonsexual ways to show someone you like them. You can show a person you care for them by spending time with them. Go to the movies. Or just hang out and talk. If you are with someone you really like, then anything can be fun. There are other ways to feel physically close without having sex. These ways include everything from kissing and hugging to touching and petting each other. Just remember that if you\\'re not careful these activities can lead to sex. Plan beforehand just how far you want to go, and stick to your limits. It can be difficult to say NO and mean it when things get hot and heavy.\\n',\n",
