So what?\n25 Sep 2008\nThe book publishing industry in America cranks out about 4,000 new titles each year, a fair number of which are business titles. And while some are a waste of time, a good number of these books are worth reading. But even if you're reading the best business books, so what?\nAfter reading a good book on business or self-improvement, if you simply put it down and say \"that was a good read,\" you may as well have read a novel. Reading a book is one thing. But to incorporate what you've read into your life, you'll need to take it a step further and actually study the material.\nOne college medical student I know puts it like this: If I simply read my books I'll probably get a \"D\" on the exams. But if I study the books I'm much more likely to get an \"A.\"\nMost folks can probably relate to that student's experience. His observation also explains why business managers continue to flounder, in spite of reading all the \"recommended\" books on management.\nPerhaps you've even experienced it yourself: Senior managers attend a workshop on how to be great managers and they read all the accompanying workbooks, yet the work environment remains \"business as usual.\"\nSuch endeavors can wreak havoc within organizations. One organization I'm aware of recently sent their 50 senior managers through a one-week class on leadership and management, and followed it up by sending all 400 employees through a four-day training session on the same material.\nThe 400 rank-and-file employees were excited that senior managers had gone through the material. Their hope for positive change and better teamwork was almost tangible. They knew the organization spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the training, so they assumed top brass was serious about implementing it.\nUnfortunately, the managers simply read through the material and did not study it. And rather than seeing an improvement, morale sank like a rock when people realized the managers hadn't changed a bit.\nWe can read all we want, but no study results in no change.\nOne of the best-selling business books of all time is Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. A colleague of mine recently told me about attending a workshop at which the presenter asked, \"How many people here have read 7 Habits? Stand up if you've read the book.\"\nMore than half of the 100 people in attendance stood.\nThen the presenter said, \"If you can remember three of the seven habits, stay standing. If you can't name at least three habits, sit down.\"\nMore than half of those standing sat down.\nThen he said \"If you can recite all seven habits, stay standing.\"\nOnly three people remained standing.\nFinally, he said, \"If you are living all seven habits in your life, remain standing.\"\nThe remaining three people sat down.\nThat event further illustrates the sad truth that we can read good books, but reading is not enough. If we want to incorporate what we read we need to seriously study the content.\nLook up the word \"study\" in a dictionary and you're likely to find it means: give careful attention to; critically examine; investigate; and apply to the mind.\nInterestingly, the root of the word study means \"to aim toward\" and \"to strike at.\" This implies that study must have both a mental focus and a physical action.\nSo, what to do?\nObviously, re-reading a book does not constitute study. If you want to apply more of what you read, you must first make it a priority in your life. Many good study techniques are out there (and you should use whatever ones work best for you), but here are just a few to consider:\nUsing a legal pad, summarize in your own words the key points that stick out to you from each chapter. Then identify a few situations in which you can act on what you want to do.\nTalk with a trusted friend about what you're reading, and what you would like to do. As you start trying new things, engage that person in dialog about what you find is working and what's not working.\nIt seems simple, but good old-fashioned flash cards drive learning deep into our memory. Creating flash cards and going through them several times a day can build a new way of looking at things.\nWhatever study method works best for you, do it. Reading is good, but you can read a thousand books and not gain much. It's studying what you read that will make the difference.\nCopyright \u00a9 Dan Bobinski , used with permission\nShare this:\nSOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS?

Answer below!\nWhen writing a book, preparation is key. Just like any other effort that one takes, practice, presence of mind and dedication are needed to succeed. For instance, a singer needs to practice for her upcoming concert. Writing a book is a challenge requiring mental skills. And then while you do your necessary preparation, you can choose who the audience of your book will be.\nMake sure that you know who your writing that book for. Picture your target audience. This can help you focus and if you try to envision these people while you write, you won\u2019t run out of inspiration, which is important to get you going.\nThe moment you feel that you have prepared enough and you are ready mentally and physically and of course emotionally, then go ahead and start. This stage could be hardest and most exhausting part. It is at this point that everything takes place.\nBut, of course, it will be the most fulfilling. When you write a book, it is usually because it\u2019s in you to write a book. And to be actually doing it is going to be some form of release and pleasure at the same time.\nSharing your work with people you trust so they may give you feedback is also recommended. Knowing what other people have to say about what you write helps you edit it and make it better. This process also helps you convey your message clearer and with greater chance of success. After writing your book, next step is to find the best publishing company that can provide you with the best deal possible and help you reach out to your audience. This is very important. Once you have found the company then you have to get your books sold. This is now where Marketing comes in.\nTraditionally, you can go on a promotional tour with other book writers, have a book-signing event arranged, introduce your work to book clubs or even actually join them.\nThese days, however, you can use the Internet in marketing your work. You will, of course, start with a website and make it your online shop where people can read excerpts from your book and purchase it from there.\nOf course, you would want to use search engine optimization to increase traffic into your site. Remember, 90% of online purchases began with an online search. This is something you can control to your advantage simply by doing some SEO.\nChoose a company that can provide you with all catalog printing services that you need to increase your confidence in marketing your book. Your story and how you tell it will still determine your book\u2019s success, but definitely, when you talk about the companies that provide book printing services today, taking the time to find the best will have its reward.\n7 comments to What are some good young adult books to read over the summer?\nshmaxie\nblue is for nightmares and the rest of the series (youll know them they all follow the \u201cinsert color\u201d is for \u201cinsert word\u201d)\ntwilight and new moon (twilight is the first book)\nand if you arent homophobic, Rainbow Boys =]\nSynchronicity\nI really like John Green\u2019s writing, \u201cLooking For Alaska\u201d and \u201cAn Abundance of Katherines\u201d.

Shared values and causes can attract customers, and a philosophy of doing good boosts team morale.\nFor small businesses, being a good citizen makes good business sense. Your own community is where visibility and reputation matter the most\u2014and because you live and work there, you have a vested interest in seeing your community and neighbors thrive.\nHiring from within the community, buying from area businesses, incorporating green business practices, and providing opportunities to young people such as internships and job shadowing are great ways to make a difference. Giving back also can come in the form of donations or providing goods or services at cost\u2014but even better is getting out there and having hands-on involvement.\nMany Fortune 500 companies use volunteering to support their reputation, morale and skill-development goals, according to research by Boston College\u2019s Center for Corporate Citizenship. \u201cService sabbaticals\u201d and \u201cteam-building volunteering\u201d are becoming common ways these businesses serve communities and themselves.\nSeveral experts actually claim that incorporating volunteering into the corporate culture is the management tool of the 21st century. \u201cEmployee volunteering can go a long way toward meeting businesses\u2019 urgent need for meaningful connections,\u201d writes Bea Boccalandro in an article on the Center for Corporate Citizenship\u2019s Web site. \u201cWhat could be more meaningful than assuaging humanity\u2019s most pressing problems? What could be a stronger basis for connecting with stakeholders than through cherished causes.\u201d\n\"The message is clear that good corporate citizenship matters...and not only is it good for business, it is critical for survival.\"\nBoccalandro cites Daniel Pink\u2019s A Whole New Mind and Dev Patnaik\u2019s Wired to Care as making a case that business success hinges on companies\u2019 abilities to create higher meaning and deeper connections with customers and other stakeholders. Businesses such as Apple, IBM, Target and Intel are recognizing that activities fostering what Patnaik calls \u201cempathy\u201d and Pink calls \u201cmeaning\u201d are critical in developing effective products, staying globally competitive and overcoming everyday business challenges, Boccalandro writes.\nSmall businesses have long recognized the importance of associating with causes. After all, the name of a hardware store on the back of Little League team shirts could mean the difference in a parent choosing one business over the one down the street.\n\u201cCustomers are often drawn to us because of our values,\u201d says Jody Kaminsky, vice president of marketing for Ultimate Software in South Florida. \u201cThe customers really see the passion in these employees, and they see that we practice what we preach, and they want to do business with us.\u201d\nUltimate Software, twice named best medium-sized company to work for by the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM), has no problem getting employees involved. \u201cIt\u2019s like the more the company gives, the more the employees want to give. I\u2019ve never been at a company where I don\u2019t have to pull teeth to get volunteers for programs or charity drives. We actually have people come to us wanting to put events or programs together. It\u2019s this spirit of generosity that is just everywhere,\u201d Kaminsky says.\nVolunteer activities also have been incorporated into software company DAXKO\u2019s culture since it was founded in the late 1990s in Birmingham, Ala. CEO Dave Gray recalls \u201cwhen there were only 15 or 20 of us early on, you just didn\u2019t have as many hands to help. So the fi rst service project we did as a team was we took half a day and went to a playground and a youth center in downtown Birmingham and worked there.\u201d\nDAXKO has grown to around 80 employees who still relish the volunteer opportunities, and they are now starting their fi rst nonprofi t, Gray says. Named one of the top 25 best small companies to work for in 2008 and 2009 by the SHRM, DAXKO also has been recognized for its innovation in team-building by Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Business School.\nGray says fi nding activities that fi t employee interest might take some fl exibility. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a good turnout to a Habitat for Humanity event, maybe your company isn\u2019t as into hands-on kinds of things. Just look for something else that suits them better,\u201d he says.\nA cause well suited for Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants was the environment. With almost 50 boutique hotels and chef-driven restaurants in the United States and Canada, offi cials recognized the chain\u2019s environmental impact, and it was the fi rst hotel company to make sustainability a companywide focus.\nNamed to Fortune\u2019s 100 Best Companies to Work For list this year, Kimpton pioneered and standardized more than 50 daily operational procedures. The hotel company also made updates such as window fi lm to reduce summer heat, energy-effi cient lighting, low-fl ow plumbing, in-room recycle bins and better thermostats and occupancy sensors in bathrooms, offi ces and storerooms.\nNiki Leondakis, COO of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, says something important hotel offi cials learned was that communication is key to getting staff and guests to use and appreciate the innovations.\nShe tells how cleaning-staff members initially thought low-foaming cleaning supplies weren\u2019t working and kept adding more product to the solution, which triggered skin rashes and complaints. Managers explained the products were actually doing the job and were designed for less foam. Once workers started using the products properly, they realized they were less irritating to skin and had less noxious fumes than their original products. \u201cThey were much happier then, and they love using those supplies now. Every single hotel uses them,\u201d she says.\nThe changes have been great for business, too. \u201cWe see clients and other companies seek us out because of the things we value and the organizations we\u2019re involved in,\u201d Leondakis says.\nIndeed, making a difference and making money are mutually supportive goals, writes Richard Barrett, author of Liberating the Corporate Soul. \u201cThe more I looked into the issue, the more evidence I found to support my thesis: When companies care about their employees, the local community and society, their employees, the local community and society care about them,\u201d Barrett says.\nResearch backs up Barrett\u2019s statement. Companies making the annual 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the past nine years outpaced other Russell 1000 companies in three-year total return by 26 percent, according to CRO, which edits the list. As one CEO whose company was on the list put it: \u201cIn good times, being 26 percent better is good. But in bad times, 26 percent better is downright brilliant.\u201d\nSpeaking at the CRO press conference announcing the 100 Best list, an IBM vice president went a step further. \u201cThe message is clear that good corporate citizenship matters,\u201d says Stanley Litow, \u201cand not only is it good for business, it is critical for survival.\u201d\n"}, {"score": 1545.6957, "uuid": "d7bca0dc-28a9-514a-a276-35a8a50e4b2f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1910wb-21-28306", "target_hostname": "villagebooksblogs.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://villagebooksblogs.typepad.com/village_books_blog/2007/11/good-reads-what.html", "page_rank": 1.2080283e-09, "spam_rank": 71, "title": "<em>Good</em> <em>Reads</em> (<em>What</em> We&#x27;re All Looking For) - Village <em>Books</em> Blog", "snippet": "Posted at 01:33 AM in <em>Book</em> Lists, <em>Books</em> &amp; Authors | Permalink Listed below <em>are</em> links <em>to</em> weblogs that reference <em>Good</em> <em>Reads</em> (<em>What</em> We&#x27;re All Looking For): This is only a preview.

Here are 10 books that will help you slow down, relax, and reconsider your place in the world.\nPossum Living: How to Live Well Without a Job and With (Almost) No Money, by Dolly Freed\nA 1970s counterculture classic just rereleased by Tin House, written by an 18-year-old who lived outside of the \"money economy\" with her father for five years. With a new afterword by the author.\nGrowing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System, by Paul Goodman\nFirst published in 1956, the book is a screed against the options open to young people in a world that the author saw becoming dominated by The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\u00e2\u0080\u0093style conformity. Old-fashioned yet prescient.\nThen We Came to the End, by Joshua Ferris\nEngrossing and very funny novel about the absurdity of the modern workplace, told in first-person plural by a group of employees waiting for the other shoe to drop during the technology bust of the early 2000s.\nBicycle Diaries, by David Byrne\nThe world's great cities seem even more spectacular and provocative on bike, through the eyes of Talking Heads front man David Byrne. He raves, muses, and rides-only ranting when completely necessary. In one case he describes Southern California as \"a residential theme park in what is essentially a desert.\" It's one for the ages.\nBrave New World, by Aldous Huxley\nIn this new world, a hyper-controlled environment, society worships Henry Ford, the assembly-line system takes the place of natural reproduction and outcasts feel enormous pressure to fit in. Questions about the hive mind and individuality spark interesting conversations.\nThe Outlaw Bible of American Poetry, edited by Alan Kaufman and S.A. Griffin\nJust from its sheer size, this one is impressive. Within the mass lie dozens of poets, musicians, artists, novelists, journalists, and other riffraff from the 20th-century poetic undercurrent.

Yes, that's right, go old school and pick up a printed piece of literature. Not only does reading a book take some time but-yes, we're biased-print just makes everything a little better. Here are 10 books that will help you slow down, relax, and reconsider your place in the world.\nPossum Living: How to Live Well Without a Job and With (Almost) No Money, by Dolly Freed\nA 1970s counterculture classic just rereleased by Tin House, written by an 18-year-old who lived outside of the \"money economy\" with her father for five years. With a new afterword by the author.\nGrowing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System, by Paul Goodman\nFirst published in 1956, the book is a screed against the options open to young people in a world that the author saw becoming dominated by The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\u2013style conformity. Old-fashioned yet prescient.\nThen We Came to the End, by Joshua Ferris\nEngrossing and very funny novel about the absurdity of the modern workplace, told in first-person plural by a group of employees waiting for the other shoe to drop during the technology bust of the early 2000s.\nBicycle Diaries, by David Byrne\nThe world's great cities seem even more spectacular and provocative on bike, through the eyes of Talking Heads front man David Byrne. He raves, muses, and rides-only ranting when completely necessary. In one case he describes Southern California as \"a residential theme park in what is essentially a desert.\" It's one for the ages.\nBrave New World, by Aldous Huxley\nIn this new world, a hyper-controlled environment, society worships Henry Ford, the assembly-line system takes the place of natural reproduction and outcasts feel enormous pressure to fit in. Questions about the hive mind and individuality spark interesting conversations.\nThe Outlaw Bible of American Poetry, edited by Alan Kaufman and S.A. Griffin\nJust from its sheer size, this one is impressive. Within the mass lie dozens of poets, musicians, artists, novelists, journalists, and other riffraff from the 20th-century poetic undercurrent.

Greenleaf in The Servant as Leader, an essay that he first published in 1970. In that essay, he said: \"The servant-leader is servant first\u2026 It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions\u2026The leader-first and the servant-first are two extreme types. Between them there are shadings and blends that are part of the infinite variety of human nature.\"\n\"The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make sure that other people\u2019s highest priority needs are being served. The best test, and difficult to administer, is: Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or at least not be further deprived?\"\nThe Breakthrough Company: How Everyday Companies Become Extraordinary Performers\nBy Keith R. McFarland\nThe vast majority of small businesses stay small\u2014and not by choice. Only the most savvy and persistent\u2014a tiny one tenth of one percent\u2014break through to annual sales above $250 million. In The Breakthrough Company, Keith McFarland pinpoints how everyday companies become extraordinary, showing that luck is a negligible factor. Rather, breakthrough success turns out to be associated with a clearly identifiable set of strategies and skills that anyone in any business can emulate\u2014from small startup to industry leader.\nEncouraged by experts such as business legend Peter Drucker and Good to Great author Jim Collins to identify the drivers that enable a company to push past the entrepreneurial phase, McFarland spent five years building and analyzing the world\u2019s largest growth-company performance database and interviewing more than 1,500 growth-company executives on four continents. His goal was simple: to identify the secrets of breakthrough.\nThe Breakthrough Company is the result. Winnowing a study pool of more than 7,000 companies down to nine that have made the transition to major-player status, McFarland highlights real-world tools and myth-busting insights that can be used by anyone wanting his or her business to join this exclusive circle. Among the book\u2019s takeaways:\n\u2022 Common wisdom holds that the founders and core entrepreneurial leaders of a company must step aside for the business to reach the next level. Not true\u2014as long as founders \u201ccrown the company\u201d instead of themselves.\n\u2022 It\u2019s not reckless to make ever-escalating bets on your company\u2019s future, even going nose to nose with competitors many times your size. In fact, it turns out that the only safety comes in constantly upping the ante in exactly this way.\n\u2022 A Business Bermuda Triangle does exist, gobbling up companies on the verge of breakthrough. Presented here are three ways to navigate this potentially deadly hazard successfully.\n\u2022 However good you are\u2014or think you are\u2014you can\u2019t do it alone. Learn how to surround your company with networks of outside resources, aka \u201cscaffolding,\u201d and how to enlist the aid of \u201cinsultants\u201d\u2014people who are willing to question a firm\u2019s existing assumptions and ways of doing business.\nManaging the Customer Experience: Turning customers into advocates\nBy Shaun Smith\nHow much more profit could you make if you had customers who couldn't imagine doing business with anyone but you? In your dreams! Tell that to Virgin Atlantic or Harley Davidson.\nHow great would life be if 40% of your new business simply knocked on your door without you having spent a cent advertising for it? Impossible! Tell that to First Direct.\nThe companies in this book have managed to turn customers into advocates. Advocates who constantly refer their friends and colleagues to those businesses. Why? Because those companies have created a Branded Customer Experience. They have managed the relationship to the point where customers can't imagine wanting to do business with anyone else.\nHow can you gain this unbeatable competitive advantage? Managing the Customer Experience shows you how. It takes you through the step-by-step process of creating Loyalty by Design. It shows you how to re-think your business from the customer's point of view and then design and deliver a customer experience that drives loyalty and profitability.\nCustomer Satisfaction is no longer enough. 80% of customers who switch suppliers express satisfaction with their previous supplier. To lead the market companies need customers who are enthusiastic 'advocates', customers who are highly loyal and drive new business to the company. For example 38% of First Direct's business comes from customer referrals. Advocacy comes from creating a customer experience that becomes synonymous with the brand, what Forum calls a Branded Customer Experience.\nResearch for this book with organizations like Amazon.com, Virgin, Pret A Manger, Krispy Kreme, Harley-Davidson, Manchester United, and many others has identified the 'Uncommon Practices' that help these organizations create a Branded Customer Experience. Such an experience requires Marketing, Operations, and Human Resources to work together to deliver the brand creating a common strategic agenda within the organization.\nMade to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die\nBy Chip Heath\nMark Twain once observed, \u201c A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.\u201d His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas\u2014businessmen, educators, politicians, journalists, and others\u2014struggle to make their ideas \u201cstick.\u201d\nWhy do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that \u201cstick\u201d and explain sure-fire methods for making ideas stickier, such as violating schemas, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating \u201ccuriosity gaps.\u201d\nIn this indispensable guide, we discover that \u201csticky\u201d messages of all kinds\u2014from the infamous \u201corgan theft ring\u201d hoax to a coach\u2019s lessons on sportsmanship to a product vision statement from Sony\u2014draw their power from the same six traits.\nMade to Stick is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It\u2019s a fast-paced tour of idea success stories (and failures)\u2014the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher\u2019s simulation that actually prevented prejudice . Provocative, eye-opening, and funny, Made to Stick shows us the principles of successful ideas at work\u2014and how we can apply these rules to making our own messages \u201cstick.\u201d\nThe Effective Executive\nby Peter F. Drucker\nWhat makes an effective executive?\nThe measure of the executive, Peter F. Drucker reminds us, is the ability to \"get the right things done.\" This usually involves doing what other people have overlooked as well as avoiding what is unproductive. Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge may all be wasted in an executive job without the acquired habits of mind that mold them into results.\nDrucker identifies five practices essential to business effectiveness that can, and must, be learned:\n* Managing time\n* Choosing what to contribute to the organization\n* Knowing where and how to mobilize strength for best effect\n* Setting the right priorities\n* Knitting all of them together with effective decision-making\nRanging widely through the annals of business and government, Peter F. Drucker demonstrates the distinctive skill of the executive and offers fresh insights into old and seemingly obvious business situations.\nThe 360 Degree Leader: Developing Your Influence from Anywhere in the Organization\nby John C. Maxwell\nIn his nearly thirty years of teaching leadership, John Maxwell has encountered this question again and again: How do I apply leadership principles if I'm not the boss? It's a valid question that Maxwell answers in The 360 Degree Leader. You don't have to be the main leader, asserts Maxwell, to make significant impact in your organization. Good leaders are not only capable of leading their followers but are also adept at leading their superiors and their peers. Debunking myths and shedding light on the challenges, John Maxwell offers specific principles for Leading Down, Leading Up, and Leading Across. 360-Degree Leaders can lead effectively, regardless of their position in an organization. By applying Maxwell's principles, you will expand your influence and ultimately be a more valuable team member.\nNever Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time\nBy Keith Ferrazzi\nDo you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success?\nThe secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships\u2014so that everyone wins.\nIn Never Eat Alone, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps\u2014and inner mindset\u2014he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him.\nThe son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington\u2019s corridors of power to Hollywood\u2019s A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain\u2019s 40 Under 40 and one of Davos\u2019 Global Leader for Tomorrow.\nFerrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with \u201cnetworking.\u201d He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them:\n* Don\u2019t keep score: It\u2019s never simply about getting what you want. It\u2019s about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too.\n* \u201cPing\u201d constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time\u2014not just when you need something.\n* Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you\u2019re working at a corporation or attending a society event\u2014 \u201cinvisibility\u201d is a fate worse than failure.\nIn the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world\u2019s most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama.\nChock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a \u201cconference commando,\u201d and more, Never Eat Alone is destined to take its place alongside How to Win Friends and Influence People as an inspirational classic.\nThe Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What It Means for All of Us\nBy Robyn Meredith\nA compelling look at the major changes in store as America faces increasing competition from two emerging Asian giants.\nIn the streets of India, camels pull carts loaded with construction materials, and monkeys race across roads, dodging cars. In China, men in Mao jackets pedal bicycles along newly built highways, past skyscrapers sprouting like bamboo. Yet exotic India is as near as the voice answering an 800 number for one dollar an hour. Communist China is as close as the nearest Wal-Mart, its shelves full of goods made in Chinese factories.\nNot since the United States rose to prominence a century ago have we seen such tectonic shifts in global power; but India and China are vastly different nations, with opposing economic and political strategies\u2014strategies we must understand in order to survive in the new global economy. The Elephant and the Dragon tells how these two Asian nations, each with more than a billion people, have spurred a new \u201cgold rush,\u201d and what this will mean for the rest of the world.\nThe Speed of Trust: The One Thing That Changes Everything\nBy Stephen M. R. Covey\nAccording to Stephen M. R. Covey (son of the bestselling author Stephen R. Covey), there is one thing that is common to every individual, relationship, team, family, organization, nation, economy, and civilization worldwide. It affects every effort in which humankind is engaged, changing the quality of every present moment, and altering the trajectory of every future moment, both personally and professionally. This one thing, which changes everything, is trust\u2014the foundation of the most powerful governments, the most successful businesses, the most thriving economies, the most influential leaders, the greatest friendships, or the deepest loves.\nThe Speed of Trust challenges the assumptions that trust is merely a soft social virtue and articulates why it has become the key leadership competency of the new global economy. Covey demonstrates how to quickly and permanently gain the trust of clients, coworkers, partners, and constituents so as to make organizations more profitable, people more promotable, and relationships more energizing.\nNow, Discover Your Strengths\nBy Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton\nUnfortunately, most of us have little sense of our talents and strengths, much less the ability to build our lives around them. Instead, guided by our parents, by our teachers, by our managers, and by psychology's fascination with pathology, we become experts in our weaknesses and spend our lives trying to repair these flaws, while our strengths lie dormant and neglected.\nMarcus Buckingham, coauthor of the national bestseller First, Break All the Rules, and Donald O. Clifton, Chair of the Gallup International Research & Education Center, have created a revolutionary program to help readers identify their talents, build them into strengths, and enjoy consistent, near-perfect performance. At the heart of the book is the Internet-based StrengthsFinder\u00ae Profile, the product of a 25-year, multimillion-dollar effort to identify the most prevalent human strengths. The program introduces 34 dominant \"themes\" with thousands of possible combinations, and reveals how they can best be translated into personal and career success. In developing this program, Gallup has conducted psychological profiles with more than two million individuals to help readers learn how to focus and perfect these themes.\nSo how does it work? This book contains a unique identification number that allows you access to the StrengthsFinder Profile on the Internet. This Web-based interview analyzes your instinctive reactions and immediately presents you with your five most powerful signature themes. Once you know which of the 34 themes\u2014such as Achiever, Activator, Empathy, Futuristic, or Strategic\u2014you lead with, the book will show you how to leverage them for powerful results at three levels: for your own development, for your success as a manager, and for the success of your organization.\nWith accessible and profound insights on how to turn talents into strengths, and with the immediate on-line feedback of Strengths Finder at its core, Now, Discover Your Strengths is one of the most groundbreaking and useful business books ever written.\nGood to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't\nBy Jim Collins\nThe findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:\nLevel 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.\nThe Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.\nA Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology\nAccelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.\nThe Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.\nWho Moved My Cheese? An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life\nBy Spencer Johnson and Ken Blanchard\nChange can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. The message of Who Moved My Cheese? is that all can come to see it as a blessing, if they understand the nature of cheese and the role it plays in their lives. Who Moved My Cheese? is a parable that takes place in a maze. Four beings live in that maze: Sniff and Scurry are mice--non-analytical and nonjudgmental, they just want cheese and are willing to do whatever it takes to get it. Hem and Haw are \"little people,\" mouse-size humans who have an entirely different relationship with cheese. It's not just sustenance to them; it's their self-image. Their lives and belief systems are built around the cheese they've found. Most of us reading the story will see the cheese as something related to our livelihoods--our jobs, our career paths, the industries we work in--although it can stand for anything, from health to relationships. The point of the story is that we have to be alert to changes in the cheese, and be prepared to go running off in search of new sources of cheese when the cheese we have runs out.\nDr.\u00a0Johnson, coauthor of The One Minute Manager and many other books, presents this parable to business, church groups, schools, military organizations--anyplace where you find people who may fear or resist change. And although more analytical and skeptical readers may find the tale a little too simplistic, its beauty is that it sums up all natural history in just 94 pages: Things change. They always have changed and always will change. And while there's no single way to deal with change, the consequence of pretending change won't happen is always the same: The cheese runs out. --Lou Schuler\nThe 4-Hour Workweek\nWhat The 4-Hour Workweek Is About:\nFirst of all, I think the title of this book is a bit of a misnomer and is useful for grabbing attention. What this book actually is is the complete embodiment of the 80/20 principle into an individual\u2019s professional life. The 80/20 principle is the idea that 80% of your productivity comes from 20% of your time, and the other 20% of your productivity eats up 80% of your time.\nFerriss argues that by eliminating that 20% of productivity that eats up most of your time, you can live in a much more efficient fashion, and the entire book revolves around that concept in various ways, hence the title The 4-Hour Workweek . In some ways, the book itself reads like a blog, as it\u2019s broken down into lots of little pieces: some of them step-by-step advice, some of them anecdotal, and some of them philosophical.\nFirst and Foremost\nRight off the bat, the book makes it clear that you should pick and choose from the material presented within, and that\u2019s a vital caveat for any personal productivity book - but especially this one. A personal productivity philosophy created by someone else is designed around their own lives and the lives of the people they associate with, but not necessarily your own. Thus, when you read a book like this one, you need to be able to pull out the pieces that work for you.\nWhy is that idea more true for this book than for others? Here, the different pieces of the book apply differently to different people. This is not like Getting Things Done , where the pieces can be applied in any life; many of these tips assume that you\u2019re already wholly into the information age and that your methods of earning money are, too (or at least are comfortable enough with technology to easily move to that sort of approach).\nThe Tipping Point\nBy Malcolm Gladwell\nAmazon.com Editorial Review\n\"The best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life,\" writes Malcolm Gladwell, \"is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.\" Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell's The Tipping Point has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.\nFor example, Paul Revere was able to galvanize the forces of resistance so effectively in part because he was what Gladwell calls a \"Connector\": he knew just about everybody, particularly the revolutionary leaders in each of the towns that he rode through. But Revere \"wasn't just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston,\" he was also a \"Maven\" who gathered extensive information about the British. He knew what was going on and he knew exactly whom to tell. The phenomenon continues to this day--think of how often you've received information in an e-mail message that had been forwarded at least half a dozen times before reaching you.\nGladwell develops these and other concepts (such as the \"stickiness\" of ideas or the effect of population size on information dispersal) through simple, clear explanations and entertainingly illustrative anecdotes, such as comparing the pedagogical methods of Sesame Street and Blue's Clues, or explaining why it would be even easier to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actor Rod Steiger. Although some readers may find the transitional passages between chapters hold their hands a little too tightly, and Gladwell's closing invocation of the possibilities of social engineering sketchy, even chilling, The Tipping Point is one of the most effective books on science for a general audience in ages. It seems inevitable that \"tipping point,\" like \"future shock\" or \"chaos theory,\" will soon become one of those ideas that everybody knows--or at least knows by name. --Ron Hogan\nThe China Price\nBy Alexandra Harney\nAn excerpt from The China Price: The True Cost of Chinese Competitive Advantage by Alexandra Harney ($26, Penguin Press, 2008).\nSam slides behind the wheel of his new black Honda and noses the car into Friday morning traffic. It's a hot, sunny June morning in Changsha, capital of central Hunan province, and everything seems to be falling into place.\nBeside him sits his wife Jasmine, eight months pregnant and radiant in a yellow dress. High school sweethearts, they married at 21. Now, at 23, they're about to start a family in a brand new gated community. Sam, whose name, like those of other members of his family, has been changed, is looking forward to making use of the development's two swimming pools and basketball court. In a few years, they plan to build a house in the mountains where they can entertain family and friends on the weekends.\nThe Honda heads out of town into the verdant countryside toward Jasmine's father's towel factory. Towels, a key Hunan export, have been the family's mainstay for nearly two decades. Sam married into the job of overseeing the plant's $5 million in annual sales.\nThe road narrows and Sam slows to accommodate farmers swaying on bicycles. On either side are rice paddies and family farm plots. That's where the first sign of changes ahead appears. Trees.\nSeveral years ago, farmers on the outskirts of Changsha realized they could make good money growing trees. They planted family plots in Hunan's fertile soil and hung signs on trees near the road advertising their cellphone numbers. Soon enough, the farmers who worked at Sam's factory were demanding higher wages, because they could make better money from trees.\nThe factory, which relies mostly on local labor, had no choice but to capitulate. \"Salaries are going up and up,\" Sam sighs from behind the wheel. The labor market has tightened, too, as other factories have opened in the area. The government is hiking the minimum wage in Changsha. Sam figures he has three, maybe five more years before his factory loses its competitive edge.\nThis is where the next boom in Chinese manufacturing is supposed to take place. Conventional wisdom holds that rising costs of everything from labor to land on the coasts are driving factories in labor-intensive consumer industries deep into the country's heartland, to provinces like Hunan, in pursuit of lower prices. But in China's fast-forward economy, investors are finding things aren't as cheap or plentiful as they used to be. And the workers aren't pushovers, either.\nThanks in part to Chinese government policies, the country's labor-intensive export factories have for most of the past decade operated almost in defiance of the rules of economics, enjoying stagnant wages, ample coastal land near the ports, and a seemingly endless supply of pliant labor. Government incentives, including subsidized electricity and generous tax breaks, have helped keep the ordinary forces of a market economy at bay. The low prices that this produced earned China the enviable position of the world's dominant producer in a huge variety of products. But this fortuitous situation couldn't last. \"This is an advantage that expires,\" says Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Dragonomics, a research and advisory group that specializes in the Chinese economy.\nJonathan Anderson, former head of Asian economics at investment bank UBS, calls it \"the end of China's supposed absolute manufacturing domination.\" He argues that China will revert to a more normal trading pattern, where it gains market share in some areas and loses it in others. For any other country, this would be a natural assumption, devoid of drama. For the world's emerging superpower and a world hooked on its cheap products, it is anything but.\nSee more at http://www.forbes.com/opinions/books/\nReciprocal Link to this Site\nVisit Monster Links to create a reciprocal Link\nKeywords: The Trusted Advocate: Accelerate Success with Authenticity and Integrity, Trusted101, John Mehrmann, Mitchell Simon, Executive Blueprints, Simon Leadership Alliance, Books about Business, Best Business Books of All Time, Must Read Business Books, Business Books of 2008, Good Business Books, Business Leadership Books, Business Books to Read, Best Books on Business, Management Training Books, Sales Motivation Books, Miller Heiman Sales, Sales Technique Books, Sales Training Sandler, Sales Training Motivation, Sales Training Team, Sales PPT, Advocate Books, Books on ethics, Book on ethics, Sales Training Process, Sales Training Workbook, Good Self Help Books, the Best Self Help Books, Top 10 Self Help Books, Popular Self Help Books, Top Self Help Books, Books for Realtors, Books for Real Estate Agents, Insurance Training Books\nServant Leadership : A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness, Robert K Greenleaf, The Breakthrough Company: How Everyday Companies Become Extraordinary Performers, Keith R.

As Americans become highly skilled multitaskers, dedicated readers aren't giving up their passion\u0097they're turning to audio books.\n\"I'm an audio book-ophile. I love them for the same peace, serenity, and brain food they give me as a normal book, but without the eye strain or book lugging that you'd otherwise deal with,\" says Susan Lindner, a busy mother of two and owner of a successful public relations firm in New York City. \"I also find I'm falling in love with the art of storytelling. When they're read right, it's better than me reading it myself. Finally, I find I am so much more open to whimsy about the kind of audio books I read as there's no sense of ownership about them; you can just choose one and put it back.\"\nDale Siegel, White Plains, N.Y., an attorney who commutes 45 minutes twice a day to work, listens to a book a week. \"It becomes a quiet place to have 'my time.' I do not feel compelled to return phone calls or check the Blackberry while driving,\" she says. \"I get to multitask by reading and driving, and it passes the time, making traffic and a monotonous drive more bearable.\"\nWhile they're not new, audio books are popular today not only because of increased demand, but because of the many ways you can get them. You can purchase or rent audio books, borrow them from the library as CDs or audio cassettes, or download them from the Internet as electronic audio files such as MP3 files.\nPay to play options\nOne popular site, Audible.com , allows you to pick a plan that suits your reading habits for as low as $7.95 a month. Then, using the site's custom tool or Apple's iTunes software, you can choose from more than 40,000 books, magazines, newspapers, and podcasts, and digitally download your selections. You can burn them to a CD or synch them with an MP3 player for portability.\nYour library now has audio as well as the hardcover and paperback versions of your favorite book.\nAnother site, SimplyAudiobooks.com , offers more than 10,000 titles on CD that you can rent through a variety of plans\u0097for as little as $11.95 per month. Selections will be mailed to you to enjoy as long as you like, then you return the selection in a postage-paid envelope. Then, the company automatically mails out the next selection on your list.\nPeople like Harvey Rosen, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles, are willing to pay for these services over other options. \"It's far more convenient for me because the books are downloaded at my convenience,\" Rosen, who uses Audible.com, says. \"There is a far greater choice of material than what is available at my local public library. The convenience and variety of choices are well worth the cost.\"\nHow to get audio books for free\nFor some, rising gas and food prices have caused tight budgets. This doesn't stop savvy consumers from reading on the go, however. While you can't legally download published modern titles and bestsellers for free, more services are offering free downloads of titles available in the public domain and unpublished novels.\nBooks in the public domain\nOnce the copyright expires on a book, it becomes part of the public domain and can be legally distributed.

Since \u201cthe worst day\u201d when his dad was killed in the terrorist attack, nine-year-old Oskar Schell has \u201cheavy boots.\u201d Francophile, tambourine player and inventor, precocious Oskar specializes in imaginative creations that help protect the people he loves, even himself. For example, \u201cI could invent a teakettle that reads in Dad\u2019s voice, so I could fall asleep\u2026\u201d One day, Oskar discovers an unusual key in his father\u2019s closet and it becomes his \u201cultimate raison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d to find the matching lock. From Harlem to Coney Island, Oskar travels the five boroughs of New York City on a mission to find the lock that he believes will connect him to his missing father. Many quirky and kind people help him on his quest including his reclusive 103-year-old neighbor who tells Oskar, \u201cSo many people enter and leave your life! Hundreds and thousands of people! You have to keep the door open so they can come in! But it also means you have to let them go!\u201d A mysterious renter who lives in his grandma\u2019s apartment aids Oskar in another of his secret missions to bring the story full circle. At times hilarious, often heartwrenching, Foer\u2019s book is extremely original and incredibly wise.\nSomething old: Italo Calvino\u2019s The Baron in the Trees (translated from Italian) is the fantastic tale of Cosimo Piovasco di Rond\u00f2 who on the fifteenth of June 1767 in Ombrosa, Italy, refuses to eat his plateful of snails at the royal family dinner table. Compounding his rebellion against parental authority, twelve-year-old Cosimo escapes to the trees and declares, \u201cI\u2019ll never come down again!\u201d And he never does. \u201cThe trees were so thick [Cosimo] could move for several miles passing from one branch to another, without ever needing to descend to earth.\u201d Narrated with love and admiration by his younger brother, Biagio, the rich life of the Baron in the trees unfolds. Cosimo hunts, forages and fishes to provide food, clothing and shelter. Though perched in the trees, Cosimo stays connected to his fellow man. He makes friends, adopts a dachshund, helps with irrigation projects, fights pirates and forest fires, aids armies and even has love affairs. By some considered crazy, by others thought wise, \u201cThis [Cosimo] understood: that association renders men stronger and bring\u2019s out each person\u2019s best gifts, and gives a joy which is rarely to be had by keeping to oneself\u2026\u201d Cosimo studies philosophy, reads voraciously and ponders the ideals of a universal society. He interacts with Diderot and Napoleon. By the end of his life, Cosimo understands \u201csomething that was all-embracing, and he could not say it in words but only by living as he did. Only by being so frankly himself as he was till his death could he give something to all men.\u201d\nSomething for young adults or older: A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly\u2019s compassionate coming-of-age novel about Mattie Gokey, a sixteen-year-old girl living and dreaming on her families\u2019 farm in the North Woods of New York state in 1906. Mattie is a gifted writer who desperately wants to go to college but \u201c [I] saw what was in store for me: a whole summer of drudgery and no money for it. Cooking, cleaning\u2026feeding chickens, slopping pigs\u2026doing everything that fell on the eldest in a family of four girls, a dead mother, and a pissant brother who took off to drive boats on the Erie Canal.\u201d Mattie astutely observes issues of class, race, and gender and the constraints put upon women by society at the turn of the century. Mattie acknowledges that she is \u201cwanting things I have no business wanting, and what they call a gift seems to me more like a burden.\u201d Against her pa\u2019s wishes, Mattie takes a job at the lakeside Glenmore Hotel where a young female guest, Grace Brown, begs Mattie to burn a bundle of letters. The story opens dramatically with Grace discovered drowned then shifts between present and past as Mattie comes to understand her own life as well as Grace\u2019s. \u201cRight now I want a word that describes the feeling you get\u2014a cold, sick feeling deep down inside\u2014when you know something is happening that will change you, and you don\u2019t want it to, but you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d With a love of language akin to Mattie\u2019s, Donnelly weaves together the yearnings of Mattie and Grace in this heartfelt historical fiction novel of deception, romance and self-awareness.\nSomething for you and a younger reader: Of his many delightful stories for kids, Dick King-Smith\u2019s A Mouse Called Wolf is one of my favorites. While the other twelve mouse pups had ordinary names like Tom or Ann, Mary, the mother mouse, decides \u201cthat the thirteenth and littlest must have not one but two names, and important-sounding names at that\u2026\u201d Named from a scrap of sheet music, Wolfgang Amadeus Mouse (\u201cWolf\u201d for short) has the perfect name! One of Wolf\u2019s favorite pastimes is listening to Mrs. Honeybee, the lady of the house, as she practices the piano each day. \u201cIf only mice could sing, thought Wolf\u2026Then to his total surprise, out of that little mouth came a high clear lovely little voice that sang every note of the melody to perfection.\u201d Gradually lured by chocolates to the center of the piano, Wolf comes face to face with the gentle and eager Mrs. Honeybee who wants the same thing that Wolf wants\u2014to make beautiful music together. From nursery rhymes to classics, Wolf sings while Mrs. Honeybee accompanies him. Until one day, Mrs. Honeybee has an accident and can\u2019t make it to her usual place at the piano. Though small in size, Wolf relies on his enormous talents to help. \u201cBravo, mouse!\u201d From his experience as a farmer and a teacher, King-Smith creates loveable animal critters. Other enjoyable tales by King-Smith include: Ace: The Very Important Pig and Babe: The Gallant Pig that became an award-winning movie.\nIn addition to classic and current fiction, Michele enjoys reading many of her children\u2019s favorites. For over twenty years, Michele has been art directing and designing books and magazines for kids of all ages.

But instead of promising that your reader will learn about the life of John Adams or look 20 years younger, you're crafting the promise of a good read.\nA good novel or memoir title should reflect the contents of the book in a way that creates an emotional reaction and/or a curiosity. Whether you intrigue, enchant, puzzle, or outrage, your book's title should make the prospective book buyer think, \"I want to know more.\" Here are some examples:\nThe Da Vinci Code - \"Code? Wasn't he, like, a painter?\"\nWorth Dying For - \"What could that be?\"\nMy Blood Approves - \"Vampires?

Jef Raskin, the father of the Macintosh wrote this masterwork shortly before his way to early death. It\u2019s the requiem of a modern genius. I was so fascinated by his writing that I skipped work for one day in order to finish it. I felt that I couldn\u2019t go on doing what I was doing before I didn\u2019t know how this book ends. It has helped me a great deal explaining to myself why I am doing what I am doing.\nThe Pragmatic Programmer A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products. Elements of the approach include specification development, customer relations, team management, design practices, development tools, and testing procedures. This approach is presented with the help of anecdotes and technical problems.\nPrioritizing Web Usability In 2000, Jakob Nielsen, the world\u2019s leading expert on Web usability, published a book that changed how people think about the Web Designing Web Usability\n. Many applauded. A few jeered. But everyone listened.\nThe best-selling usability guru is back and has revisited his classic guide, joined forces with Web usability consultant Hoa Loranger, and created an updated companion book that covers the essential changes to the Web and usability today.\nPrioritizing Web Usability is the guide for anyone who wants to take their Web site(s) to next level and make usability a priority.\nTypography\nEmil Ruder, Typographie Emil Ruder\u2019s Typography is the timeless textbook from which generations of typographer and graphic designers have learned their fundamentals. Ruder, one of the great twentieth-century typographers was a pioneer who abandoned the conventional rules of his discipline and replaced them with new rules that satisfied the requirements of his new typography.\nKimberly Elam, Grid Systems: Principles of Organizing Type Although grid systems are the foundation for almost all typographic design, they are often associated with rigid, formulaic solutions. However, the belief that all great design is nonetheless based on grid systems (even if only subverted ones) suggests that few designers truly understand the complexities and potential riches of grid composition.\nMuller-Brockman, Grid Systems: A visual communication manual for graphic designers, typographers and three dimensional designers. From a professional for professionals, here is the definitive word on using grid systems in graphic design. Though Muller-Brockman first presented hi interpretation of grid in 1961, this text is still useful today for anyone working in the latest computer-assisted design.\nI haven\u2019t read a single book on branding that is worth mentioning here\nBooks on branding usually look cheap, think cheap, are cheap\n. Somehow the branding community seems keen on keeping that know-how to themselves . That\u2019s one reason why I decided to start writing one by myself .

I bought it as high browed as you\u2019d expect it from a former philosophy student at Venice airport, because I forgot my Wittgenstein in the hotel. I devoured \u201cWinning\u201d on the plane with both eye brows high up. This evil looking tycoon said: Managing is all about being candid. If candice is a managerial quality, I\u2019m going to be a tycoon, I thought. Well, candice is not everything, obviously. So I decided to give the idea of an own company another try. Maybe I should read more business books. Honestly, I read this only once, but I would still like to feature it here, because it\u2019s an amazing read, especially for former philosophy or art students.\nBooks I read over and over again\nThomas Bernhard Cutting Wood, Old Masters, Extinction\nLudwig Wittgenstein On Certainty, Tractatus Logico Philosophicus\nArthur Schopenhauer On the Freedom of the Will\nFranz Kafka The Process, The Castle, America\nFriedrich Nietzsche The Geneaology of Morals and The Antichrist\nImmanuel Kant Critique of the Pure Reason, Anthropology, Critique of Practical Reason, Critique of judgment\nKenzaburo Oe A Personal Matter\nCharles Bukowski Post Office, Ham on Rye\nTheodor W.

They want to know your talents and what you have done with them.\nIf you were to purchase a product that would cost thousands of dollars annually, you would want to know how its features could help you.\nTake a look at these lists of occupational titles and employment-related titles to help you do some brainstorming about your own experiences.\nStart by identifying some general traits that you can use to describe your talents. Use this list of general traits to help start your brainstorming session. Choose some of these or add more of your own. The point is to learn to describe yourself and your talents on a resume, in cover letters and in conversations with potential employers.\nIdentifying Your Skills\nMany people have a hard time identifying their skills. Don\u2019t think of a skill as something that requires years of formal education and experience to develop. A skill is something you are doing right now in your life.\nIn fact, job experts such as Richard Bolles suggest the average person has between 500 and 800 identifiable skills, an impressive figure, though no employer will want to hear every one of them. Instead, you need to identify at least 10 to 20 employer-attracting skills worthy of mention and bolstered by evidence of accomplishment on your resume.\nThere\u2019s a method to identifying, describing and promoting your skill set that we\u2019ll now investigate\nOne way to think about skills is to consider yourself a product and employers as consumers. What skills are going to be of use in a particular job or company? What product attributes do you bring to the table? What problem can you solve for an employer?\nThink hard about your career, life and interests. Take a good look at yourself. Consider your personality. Good at self-management? Are you punctual, dependable, creative, independent, flexible and ambitious? Good for you. You just listed six skills.\nWork in an office on a computer? That\u2019s not just one skill, it\u2019s many:\u00a0 typing, writing, editing and meeting deadlines. A computer programmer troubleshooting a network failure uses proofreading skills to find errors in computer codes. A cook uses slicing and cleaning skills to prepare vegetables. To complete tasks in the course of our daily lives, we balance checking accounts, manage budgets, shop and drive.\nThose are skills.\nSome of those skills are employed at jobs, others in life. Some can be used in resumes and during interviews. Others will be irrelevant. Blowing square bubbles and telling jokes are great party antics, but not so great for serious job interviews unless, of course, you\u2019re applying to a comedy troupe or the circus. Understanding skills improves your ability to identify them.\nJob Skills\nJob skills are specific to a job or occupation. An administrative assistant is skilled in typing, word processing, filing, answering telephones and drafting correspondence. An accountant\u2019s skills include calculating accounts receivable and accounts payable, preparing taxes and using computer accounting programs.\nA marketer\u2019s skills revolve around working with creative teams, developing plans for product rollouts, presenting work in front of clients, working with various vendors and meeting deadlines.\nBehind most skills lies a body of knowledge. A graphic designer knows how to create documents using Adobe\u2019s InDesign from files created in Microsoft Word. A cook knows about cooking techniques such as basting or baking. An auto mechanic is trained to fix problems in cars from eight or 10 manufacturers or more.\nJob skills do not always come from employment. They may be developed through education, hobbies, community activities and life experiences. Common activities such as shopping, managing finances, leading a committee at a school, volunteering or teaching are activities that involve potential job skills.\nJob skills are important to employers because they are often looking for individuals with specific talents. They may want someone who is a team player, learns fast, handles little structure, loves challenges, enjoys pursuing goals and has an agreeable personality.\nThey may also want that same individual to have specific skills, such as working with particular software programs or the ability to drive a certain class of vehicle or operate a piece of machinery. Mix those skills together for the right employer and you will find yourself employed.\nThere are thousands of job-specific skills. Use this job skills list to help you get started making your own.\nUse this Job Skills Identification Exercise to help you describe major skills and tasks you've used in prior jobs.\nTransferable Skills\nMany talents can be applied to a variety of activities. They can transfer from one activity to another. Self-management ability and job-specific skills are transferable. If you can operate a drill press, you have skills to operate other types of machinery.\nIf you can balance a personal bank account, you have the math aptitude to balance a business account. If you coordinate events, lead meetings, participate on teams or get involved in community activities, you have several leadership competencies that could transfer to a job.\nIn essence, transferable skills are proficiencies developed in a profession, previous employment or volunteer or hobby activities. For job seekers who want to try a different career, transferable skills will be a big deal on their resumes because their work histories alone might not convince employers they can flourish in a new environment. The transferable skills they delineate on their resumes will have to offer a compelling argument for their consideration.\nThat makes transferable skills all the more important for many reasons. Many job seekers are unlikely to find a job identical to their previous employment. Therefore, carefully evaluating how your skills transfer into other opportunities is critical. People seeking their first job, making a major career change or returning to employment after a long absence will mostly use transferable skills in their job search.\nUse this list of Transferable Skills to help you think about and identify your own skills.\nCase Study\nLearn how Stan, a restaurant manager with 20 years' experience, learned to identify his transferable skills and highlight them on his resume. Read Stan's story.\nSelf-Management Skills\nThese are skills you use day-to-day to get along with others. They are the skills that make you unique. Examples of self-management skills are sincerity, reliability, tactfulness, patience, flexibility, timeliness and tolerance. Alongside those skills are motivation, persistence, drive and cooperation.\nDo not underestimate self-management skills, especially if they show motivation and a good work attitude. These abilities are especially important for people who are seeking their first job or returning to employment after an absence.\nUse this list of Self-Management Skills to help you think about and identify your own skills.\nEmotional Intelligence\nAre you able to manage your own emotions and instinctively understand or detect those of colleagues, friends and acquaintances? You may be blessed with emotional intelligence, another discipline in the evolving skills tool set that has gained traction ever since Daniel Goleman put the term on the map in his best-selling 1995 book \u201cEmotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ.\u201d\nDefining it isn\u2019t all that easy. Peter Salovey and John Mayer, two leading experts on emotional intelligence who have authored several books on the topic, put it this way: \u201cWe define emotional intelligence as the subset of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one\u2019s own and others\u2019 feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one\u2019s thinking and actions.\u201d\nEmotional intelligence isn\u2019t just essential in the workplace. It\u2019s also an important trait to possess during the job hunt, especially when setbacks occur. Being able to find the energy to send out one more resume, make one more call, hit that networking meeting another time speaks not only to persistence but to the ability to manage your own emotions and not be defeated by them. Job hunting can be incredibly difficult, and staying positive and engaged in the process can be daunting. Yet it is the key to your success. And it requires emotional intelligence.\n\u00a9 2012 Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development\n"}, {"score": 1396.9762, "uuid": "62f753e8-4e70-548a-9374-69a18e52dd54", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1805wb-52-21659", "target_hostname": "www.apocalypse2008-2015.com", "target_uri": "http://www.apocalypse2008-2015.com/What_Babushka_Books.html", "page_rank": 1.8745259e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "<em>What</em> <em>are</em> Babushka <em>Books</em>", "snippet": "Those interested <em>to</em> know how, when and <em>what</em> will happen must <em>read</em> this second Babushka <em>book</em> specializing in the Apocalypse, 21 December 2008-2015.", "explanation": null, "document": "Understanding the Bible better by using science instead of theology\nRevealing the true scope of God\u2019s Plan for Humanity\nIlluminating why God\u2019s plan includes an Apocalypse - when , where and why its main events take place\nDiscovering why ancient cultures built pyramids, outdoor observatories like Stonehenge and complex calendar clocks to mark seasons and worship celestial bodies like the sun\nExplaining the catastrophic consequences of Genetically Modified Organisms\nDemystifying global warming\nPresenting a new theory for a startling, donut-shaped structure of each atom\u2019s nucleus that also explains how the universe in the Time Dimension was created using recent discoveries about the nature of light and its velocity\nInventor-scientist Herbert R. Stollorz has written six Babushka books from an unusual and scientific perspective never done before. He discovered a Rosetta Stone in the Book of Daniel that unlocked Bible prophecies seldom understood before by theologians. For the first time, God\u2019s Plan for Humanity can be seen from new discoveries in biology and physics.\nLike international trains, God\u2019s plan must conform to an exact schedule. Significant events in human history and prophecy are like the train stations on a railroad line that crosses international time zones. Similarly, God\u2019s plan is marked through the course of time by events prophesied in the biblical books of Revelation and Daniel.\nHe refers to his writings as Babushka books because they all go together in a way that recalls these well known Russian dolls. Russian Babushka dolls have a number of dolls - one embedded inside another\u00e2\u0080\u0093all painted wearing the same costume. They represent scaled concepts as the larger ones enclose smaller ones with balanced similarities in structure and design to emphasize God\u2019s creative plan duplicated in various sizes. Each design tells the same story only scaled a little smaller needed for a witness to establish truth. To avoid misleading opinions, Deuteronomy requires \u201ctwo [+one]\u201d witnesses for something to be acceptable in court.\nBible prophecy confuses many theologians because they are not educated in science and do not match the witness requirements. As a result, thousands of Christian books have been written over the centuries that do not give clear answers about some of the most important issue of Bible history and prophecy. Many are just speculations to make money. Other teachings postulated in churches that lack the five Bible witness references required to elevate a human opinion to the level of dogma.\nAn angel sent from the Creator told Daniel that in the last days there would be those who were wise (have insight) who would understand the prophecies about the end of the age, the coming of the Messiah and the restoration of Israel . In these pages you will discover Bible prophecy confirmed by the numeric structure of the Hebrew language (the Hebrew Alphabet Number System or HANS ), by the function-driven design of ancient calendars and gold-bronze clocks found in museums around the world and by the Hebrew calendar of fast and feast days.\nThese analytical tools revealed that Daniel\u2019s writing delivers meaning on two levels. One dates and describes to the first coming of Jesus, and the other dates the season, but not to the day or hour, of his return to rule the earth as Israel\u2019s Messiah and the Nations\u2019 King of Kings. When someone gives dates, it sounds like an opinion, but The Babushka books cross-reference often, which in all exceeds the witness requirements due to a surplus of confirming information outside the control of the author.\nMy Babushka books explore many new concepts never preached in any church and expound on God\u2019s Plan for Humanity with specific, biblically-based elements of how it is being and will be implemented. If you have a bit of an open mind and a willingness to think logically, you will have fun reading these books designed to widen your horizons of understanding the Bible linked to science.\nOne of his first discoveries was an ancient Hebrew Alphabet Number System (HANS). The numeric structure of the Hebrew language provides vital keys that opened up answers to a number of Bible mysteries that have stumped theologians for centuries. By using rational scientific principles learned from his years as an inventor who made devices that worked, the author\u2019s discoveries debunk many false teachings postulated by theologians. This research even includes new discoveries in science and the ancient world, which surprised him greatly.\nHis greatest discovery came from applying HANS to Bible prophecy because it revealed a divine plan for humanity that has never really been understood well by theologians. God\u2019s purpose for humankind can be summed up in the first three Hebrew words in Genesis linked to, or completed by, the last two Greek words of Revelation:\n[In the beginning,] [created] [God] \u00e2\u0080\u0093 [all] [the Saints]\nThe Saints are the reason we have a Bible from God using 40 Hebrew scribes across 1,600 years. Applying modern science cross-referenced with HANS reveals many concepts hidden in the Bible that dates specific future events precisely to a day and hour. Like cuckoo clock cycles, overlaying history and ancient clocks announces 21 December 2012 just as surely as we expect the cuckoo bird at 12 o\u2019clock. We should be watching as the continuation of humanity\u2019s historical past became this series of Babushka books. It reassembles the puzzle of God\u2019s creation captured in wholesome new concepts never preached in church. It will even surprise many scientists!\nFor example, many ancient clocks exhibited in museums around the world connected to diverse cultures and dating different times come together to confirm independently a strange chronological-calendar system of cycles mentioned in the Bible\u2019s first book Genesis. They revealed that the Prophet Daniel\u2019s kitchen clock was different from our modern ones because in his day the earth still had a wobble in its rotational axis leftover from a massive asteroid strike that occurred on 5 February 2287 BC at the beginning of Noah\u2019s Flood.\nMore is explained in Babushka book #3, Asteroid Answers to Ancient Calendar Mysteries . For example, Daniel\u2019s system of 70 prophecy weeks matches a 14.305789 calendar constant that appears in several ancient clock mechanisms and calendars discovered by secular scientists. Not only will this discovery shock theologians and atheists, this constant makes it possible to calculate the exact date of the Apocalypse 2008-2015, which makes church building projects unnecessary and obsolete. These ancient calendars project another asteroid strike, which iis confirmed by science magazines to be already in orbit as well as by Bible prophecy.\nThe Creation of Time and the Material Universe\nOriginally, Mr. Stollorz believed that heavenly dimension (Heh=5), which is a dimension without time or clock, was disturbed by something unanticipated in the vast timeless of eternity. Before this disturbance, there was no need for time. The Bible describes this heavenly disturbance as the rebellion of its highest administrator, Lucifer. The rebellion, or fall, of Lucifer/Satan and his associates caused a break in the peaceful flow of eternity that created the necessity for time and a material universe manifest at a lower energy level and subjected to time according to mathematical laws of physical forces like gravity.\nSatan\u2019s ruckus ventured into unauthorized territory, a forbidden direction that required God\u2019s attention and correction. God devised a plan and set it in motion to get everything back on track the way it should be. Two paths, tracks or dials for dealing with Satan\u2019s rebellion were incorporated in that plan:\nA way to deal justly with the rebellious angels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Satan and his demons\nand the other to find replacements to take their place in the administration of God\u2019s heavenly realm, which became God\u2019sPlan for Humankind.\nThe old order of the Heh (=5) dimension got broken and needed a new, higher order or Jod (=10) dimension in order to restore peace to the universe. Once the old system was broken, it could not be fixed and needed replacement. The whole shamazzle Satan caused created the time dimension with cycles that cannot be constant as different problems requires longer or shorter cycles to accomplish a goal of restitution and redemption of what went wrong.\nTwo main players had to be dealt with in parallel; therefore, a number of related, extra creation projects were devised. First, there had to be a court system set up to separate the bad from the good angels in the Heh dimension. After that, a special environmental incubator was made to nurture new beings created with a special design under controlled supervision. That incubator became our earth, which remains unique in the universe in its physical characteristics. We humans are the beings created to become the replacements for the many vacant positions left open in God\u2019s administration, or kingdom, by the massive rebellion of corrupted angels.\nAdam and Eve were created to establish a human race some what different than angels. People are not as powerful, and are born material as the first of a two-stage system analogous a butterfly\u2019s lifecycle. The first stage is the caterpillar, which ends in the death and grave-like stillness of a cocoon. Successful transformations from the cocoon stage emerge as beautiful adult butterflies.\nTo eliminate the potential for a future rebellion, the newly designed humans were embedded with high intelligence. Being mortal, they could be tested in the first stage with evil and eliminated if they failed to learn essential spiritual lessons imbedded in a built-in memory that can be activated automatically like an immune system against evil of any kind. Graduates of this two-stage system (the Saints) will by free choice always reject any infectious evil should it appear again in either the material or spiritual dimensions. They will snuff out any evil in the bud, before it grows like a mushroom overnight so as not to give it time to infect a whole community with evil, which would inevitably result in another rebellion.\nBecause evil was a new experience for everybody, God appointed Satan as the experienced school teacher. Satan\u2019s activities and consciousness transcends all human history while mortals only live for a short time. Since Lucifer (now called Satan) started the original mutiny against God\u2019s established order, he was well qualified to inoculate humanity with evil. Despite his permitted evil role in the divine order, Satan will be executed for his crimes at his appointed day.\nGod will choose only qualified graduate students to replace the fallen angels. This is why all people, including the Saints, must be exposed to the evils and sufferings of this age, forced to live in a world that ignores the true Creator and denies His established definitions of what is good and what is evil. By suffered experience, humans deeply learn to recognize and know the difference between good and evil so as to avoid what is bad, what is not love as defined by the divine nature. The mortals who graduate from living in the school of hard knocks (the caterpillar stage) will be called the Saints(butterflies). By their own choice and transformed nature, they will be forever loyal to the Creator in the future Jod dimension community.\nThe restoration of peace in heaven required a schedule and needed a calendar with clocks. Since there are two parties, Satan and Mortals, both need to be on a synchronized time schedule. Their ages of activity and consciousness run in parallel, intersecting at key milestones or railroad stations in God\u2019s plan. Faithful servants of the Creator can look forward to being resurrected into the new, beautiful Jod dimension world, transformed like a caterpillar into a butterfly.\nBy that time, Satan will be fired from his job and executed for his crimes of rebellion against God. All human institutions and civilization will be closed down. The time dimension will end at the Last Day of Judgment in front of a Great White Throne. Any remaining, unsettled issues will be resolved for everybody. The scales of justice will be balanced, all debts paid and unnecessary junk burned up along with the old, worn-out earth in a fiery lake. The material world will be reduced to simple atomic ashes and recycled as infinite energy to begin and build the new Jod dimension system without a time dimension, schedules or clocks, which will no longer be needed. God\u2019s Plan for Humankind was written only for those who want to be Saints in God\u2019s kingdom administration. The rest of humanity is not interested in, or even opposed to, not privileged to understand these precious, concept pearls.\nThe First Babushka book, Apocalypse Prophesied: From Eden to New Jerusalem\nThis book identifies who the main players are in God\u2019s Plan for Humanity. Many are ignorant about the Bible because we are not allowed to read it in public anymore, which has created a vacuum in understanding and led to a totally atheistic society. Also, our modern pace of life forces everybody to be in a hurry. We have so little time left to discover what is most important in life, like what will happen after death.\nThat raises a lot of questions theologians have tried to answer but failed because they are not educated in applied science. This first Babushka book tells the story of God's Plan for Humanity in a short version balanced by pragmatic scientific principles. This approach is analogous to a stabilized, two-rail track system for trains.\nI use illustrations from science to communicate Bible concepts so that they can be understood in other cultures without Bible knowledge. Since some countries prohibit the Bible altogether, the Internet becomes a good tool to reach those shut out from the light of truth by oppressive governments.\nAs a scientist and engineer, I also present God\u2019s 7,000-year Plan for Humanity depicted by a cuckoo clock system composed of two dials. Each dial marks the time dimension by cycles according to the Hebrew Rosetta Stone 7:5 ratio - a peculiar clock used on earth.\nAnciently, time was measured on earth a little differently than for the last 2,000 years because the earth then experienced a wobble in its rotational axis that required early priests and astronomers to devise calendars with two dials. In my system, one dial became the time cycle allocation for Satan the school teacher of evil, and the other clock dial became the history trail for mortals, who are the students in Satan\u2019s school.\nThis book explains who is involved and presents a synopsis of God\u2019s plan from the creation of the universe to the end of human history. It was written for those who might not have easy access to a Bible and so included a thousand Bible verses organized so that everyone can understand - even those who never read the Bible. The entire book (or by chapter) may be downloaded for free and is translated in all four languages. Published editions may be purchased in English, Spanish and German through our Amazon book store .\nHave fun! Even if you are a Christian, reading this book will widen your horizons. You will learn much about science embedded in the Bible, which came to me as a total surprise as a German scientist.\nThe Second Babushka book, Mystery of Tammuz 17: Ancient Hebrew Keys to Dating the Apocalypse\nThis book deals with what will happen by detailing the main events of the 7-year Apocalypse prophesied in Daniel and Revelation. These seven years end our present civilization of human strife under Satan\u2019s schooling. They conclude with the birthing of the Saints, who are the resurrected graduates of Satan\u2019s school. A massive Resurrection of millions from the grave begins the Kingdom of God Jesus told us about.\nThe present, corrupt and evil world system will be terminated and burnt by cleansing fire to remove harmful genetically modified organisms, which greatly offend God. Satan and his school will be disposed of - like a placenta no longer needed. As the Saints inoculated against evil are released from the present age school of evil, the teacher is put in jail for one thousand years to be executed later for his crimes.\nThis book explains many mysteries found in reading the Bible that have stumped theologians for centuries. In particular, it explains how key events of the Apocalypse can now be dated and why it was not possible before. The prophesied Apocalypse will take place over a seven-year period, which was precisely scheduled from the beginning of time.\nThose interested to know how, when and what will happen must read this second Babushka book specializing in the Apocalypse, 21 December 2008-2015.\nIt was also written for those who might not have easy access to a Bible and so includes a thousand Bible verses that can be read free on the Internet in four languages. The entire book (or by chapter) may be downloaded for free in all four languages. Published English, Spanish and German editions may be purchased through our Amazon book store .\nThe Third Babushka book, Asteroid Answers to Ancient Calendar Mysteries: 2012, Aztec Pyramids, Antikythera & Other Ancient Calendar Clocks\nThis Babushka book is about when. It links to time cycles measured by ancient bronze-gold clocks found in many museums around the world. They were never deciphered. For hundreds of years scientists could not figure out what kind of time and calendar events they kept track of. Even the Antikythera clock in Athens with 32 bronze gears and three dials dated 100 years before Christ remains a mystery to them.\nAll clocks conform to ancient calendars and zodiac positions to tell time. I discovered a world clock in Genesis, the first book in the Bible, describing hidden cycles not obvious to theologians. That cracked the code for all the other clocks. Since many theologians and scientists are ignorant of the Bible, they have preconceived and faulty concepts about nature. Some even think that God must be stupid.\nTo most theologians and scientists, God is not real: the almighty Creator is just a figment of human imagination, fears and needs for psychological support. It is inconceivable to them that real intelligence is structurally embedded in His creation that even reveals his plan and purpose for humanity. These biases have prevented the understanding of many mysteries for thousands years.\nThey have missed the natural cycles functioning like a cuckoo clock seen above his Throne in Heaven surrounded with a rainbow with spectral lines embedded as described by John in Revelation 4 and explained in my 6th Babushka book, A Donut Atom Nuclear Story. Genesis reveals a clock calendar schedule for two ball players - humanity and Satan. I am not surprised to find one clock veiled in heaven above God\u2019s Throne, as the plan for humanity originated there.\nThe ancient priests of various religions did know some interesting aspects of the earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, which they embedded in ancient clocks they designed. The structure of these calendar clocks serve as independent historical witnesses across the ages and from around the world to confirm what was written in the prophetic Word of God called the Bible.\nAncient clocks tell us that the earth once rotated with a backwards wobble. It posed a great challenge to early scientists and priests contending with switched sunrises and sunsets a few times and is very interesting to see how various ancient cultures solved the common problem of uneven years and shifting lengths of seasons by building so many pyramids, outdoor observatories, clocks and calendars. Each of their complicated systems required advanced mathematics, which has not been understood in modern times because almost all university researchers believing in atheistic fairytales assume that the earth\u2019s seasonal cycles have remained unchanged for billions of years. This book examines newly discovered science facts of recent research work published in magazines to balance it with wisdom from the Bible, which took some time to accumulate.\nTo write for an audience of scientists believing in evolutionary fairytales elevated to educational dogma requiring billions of years is a challenge to any writer. Yet, with all of our modern technology, most still do not know the purpose for human existence and do not know why the universe exists either. God has now revealed the explanation of many mysteries concerning ancient bronze-gold clocks hanging in museums, ancient pyramids and stone circles and even the reasons for some of the traditionally preserved features found in fancy clocks from the Middle Ages. That really served no critical function, such as the last ancient astrological clock design in Prague high up the bell tower that even serves as a model for a cuckoo clock sold to tourists.\nThis book upends a lot of faulty teaching found in universities being postulated by an atheistic academic priesthood trying to undermine and silence God\u2019s Word. Ancient clocks adjusted to NASA atom clock calculations were needed by God, and by mankind, to keep a redemption plan right on schedule. That schedule reveals preset dates of ancient prophecies dated like a railroad is planned with stations going through different time zones.\nThat schedule reveals preset dates of ancient prophecies like the dating of the Apocalypse laid out with stations going through different time zones on a dual railroad for balance. History cycles can project future dates accurate to a day if ancient clock-calendars are calibrated to our present NASA calendar because God planned it that way. The present astronomical calendar does not change any longer because the earth\u2019s wobbling axis has almost come to rest at a 23\u00bd\u00b0 tilt.\nIgnorance of God\u2019s Plan for Humanity and ancient clocks has created much confusion in Bible seminaries, where ivory tower philosophers come up with all kinds of dogmas that do not make scientific sense. Faith got a bad repudiation from these dreamed up religious dogmas because the theologians did not recognize the logical, scientific evidence embedded in the Bible, which is identified clearly once one knows God\u2019s Plan for a new Jod universe.\nWe can find out about the schedule and learn a lot about physics in the process. Bible prophecy connects to a time dimension following scientific laws, which puts the Bible back on top, worthy once again of great respect.\nThe Fourth Babushka book, Genetic Modification Exposed!\nThis book explains why the Apocalypse must be so severe. Because of modern technology\u2019s unnatural and greedy manipulation of many species\u2019 genetic codes, God must destroy large areas of the globe to preserve the creation. The world\u2019s environmental ecosystems must be cleansed and purified through fire and extensive calamities so that mankind can survive.\nModern society has become totally corrupt. In their race of mega-profits, global corporations are destroying the earth for the next generation by genetically modifying all foods. The products of this mad science are destroying the natural balance built into the creation, such as causing massive extinction of honeybees that are disappearing. If left unchecked, this irresponsible use of scientific knowledge would by itself terminate God\u2019s creation and destroy His Plan for Humanity at the same time.\nMassive biological manipulation is poisoning the environment with wholesale destruction. God must interfere to save what he created for future generations. A willful rebellious atheism lies at the core of this global threat to all life. It has almost reached the point of no return and must be stopped in the next three years or Satan will be able to gloat, \u201cThis time, God, I screwed up your creation irreversibly because I am more powerful than you!\u201d\nWatch God\u2019s reaction to Satan\u2019s greatest challenges since the Flood. God must not delay His schedule by showing mercy for a second chance. Instead, He must hurry up to save the creation before the natural order becomes extinct. The cuckoo bird now set to appear at the \u201cmidnight hour\u201d of 21 December 2012, which will reset the time dimension in another parabolic time direction as even the ancient Mayans and Aztecs recorded in their calendars. To become educated about one of the greatest crimes being committed against humanity, read this Babushka about a primary cause of the Apocalypse 2008-2015.\nThe Fifth Babushka book, Reflections on Global Warming\nThis book witnesses against the false opinions promoted by atheistic governments, which is one of the latest and most popular hot buttons for politicians to put more money in their pocket. Not surprisingly, they are not interested to learn that historical events reported in the Bible can tell us the cause of global warming.\nWe can become informed about climate change in ancient books of many civilizations especially coming from a historic 4,000-year Bible perspective. Learning about events recorded by ancient eyewitness can aid us in a global warming theory why the weather is changing in our time which could give us enough data for a climate model and not wasting a lot of dollars in wild speculative assumption on top of assumption.\nTherefore any discussion on global warming connected with the Bible should not be stifled by the establishment. I invite my fellow scientists to get a little educated in the true realism of what is happening to our globe from a spiritual Christian perception using a dual rail approach. Global warming theories finally come around to agree with the Bible to establish facts and reject fairytale theories from the past as explained in Science News .\nStudying God\u2019s creation increases knowledge and makes us wiser. If you want to be educated in science from God\u2019s perspective, this short booklet unifies a number of scientific and theological concepts that are scaled from larger to smaller patterns of structured principles like each Babushka book is a little smaller.\nThe Sixth Babushka book, A Donut Atom Nuclear Story\nThis last book is wow. It discusses how God created and sustains the universe. For centuries people looked up into the starry sky and wondered about how it got started. How old is the universe? Why does it exist?\nWhen electron microscopes were invented, it became possible to look at the universe found within an atom. At the subatomic and atomic levels, the smallest scale model of the entire universe may be found. The universe\u2019s vast spaces between humongous galaxies are replicated by the relatively vast spaces found between an atom\u2019s particles. Today, peering through a telescope or a microscope looks the same.\nMany forces we experience daily cannot be fully explained by physics. For example, how is \u201clife\u201d manufactured? Where did it come from? The same line of questioning applies to gravity, which is still a mystery. Add to it magnetism, electricity, light and what we call the dimension of time, and even more concepts debated in science and religion in fact become even more complex. Their study demands a concentrated gathering of information that seems to come with a lot of confusion not following the path of logic. They become so complex that their equations can no longer be processed without massive computers capable of handling billions data bytes per second.\nHowever, God has turned on the light to shine in darkness. Now, for the first time in history, His Plan for Humanity has been more completely revealed from the dual perspective of applied science and the Bible. That is because the time has come for the Apocalypse to begin, which will consummate human history outside of God\u2019s government. These ideas will not be found in theological institutions or explained in the halls of leading universities. They arrived just in time to set the record straight for true scientists during a time dominated by an atheistic education system devoid of common sense\nThis final Babushka book presents a new theory of atomic structure. Many believe in fairytales and false doctrines invented by fallible human beings that blind them to the total picture of God\u2019s plan for humankind from a heavenly or Heh perspective. To understand the time dimension of the material universe, we need clocks. The first cuckoo clock invented is in heaven. It was not made in Germany.\nBut clocks with cycle gears are linked to calendars that must work together like calculators measuring time. It requires a little background knowledge to understand how it works. My theory of atomic structure is a concept from the Bible that is much better at explaining the laws of physics, such as how gravity works. I present it from a biblical perspective unheard of in the halls of higher education. The Donut Atom Theory explores an intelligence system embedded within the rainbow found above God\u2019s throne in the bible\u2019s book of Revelation. It looks at atomic structure and the physical laws of the universe from God\u2019s perspective. To read it, one must first acquire a little instruction on how atoms were created as related to the beginning of the universe. The answer conforms to God\u2019s Plan for Humanity. Without that plan nothing makes sense, which is why atheistic university halls are full of confusion and false teaching. My last Babushka book explains nuclear science in simple language for the average person.\nThe Seventh Babushka book, What is the Time Dimension?\nAll my Babushka concept books are linked to the Bible, which is really the biggest Babushka book embedded with God\u2019s concepts to educate us. Within its pages we read about the history of humanity, many of God\u2019s laws and principles for life and may discover God\u2019s Plan for Humanity.\nIt includes ancient calendars to measure time. The plan of God revealed that the earth is God\u2019s laboratory where we learn for ourselves the consequences of good and evil and may qualify for the promised First Resurrection of the Saints similar to the illustration in nature, a two-cycle system like the caterpillar-butterfly life cycle.\nMy Babushka books attempt to explain more fully many concepts of God\u2019s design of the universe and purpose for life as cross-referenced with scientific discoveries. I present a balanced, 360\u00b0 theater-in-the-round projection by including discoveries like HANS \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Hebrew Alphabet Number System , which opened many more mysteries.\nThe HANS overlay of science led me to write these six concept books that should educate some skeptics biased from incomplete information supplied by our educational system\u2019s atheistic religion. Simply stated, God\u2019s Word can be trusted and agrees with true science.\nMy Seventh Babushka book presents a new model explaining the physics behind HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS CREATED utilizing structural physics that reveal the missing dimension in science.: An invisible Galactic-Atomic Force linked to a universal Strong - Weak Force connects Gravity and Magnetism in a Time Dimension, which can be expressed mathematically as:\nWhich explains the first Genesis Creation Act:\n\u201cIn the Beginning God created the heavens and earth.\u201d\n(Genesis 1:1-2)\nHave fun reading these Babushka books that are designed to widen your horizons by learning something you probably wanted to know about since childhood. Learn how to become a Saint who will be resurrected after 17 September 2015.

These had been natural corrections of the previous bull industry advances. Every time the market recovered and ultimately soared back into new high ground.

The front runners were contemporary fiction/literature and young adult, with an interest in revisiting the classics before related movie releases, such as The Great Gatsby in December 2012 . Only one person, besides me, had any interest in reading the Western Canon. Shocking!\nThe most exciting mind is an open mind, and I\u2019m hoping this applies to book clubs, as well. I\u2019ve decided to keep it 90% contemporary fiction/literature and young adult and 10% miscellaneous so we don\u2019t miss an opportunity to discuss the classics or important memoirs/nonfiction studies that pop up. I would like to divide the 90% adult/young adult evenly, but I also don\u2019t want to read drivel just to keep the score even. Let\u2019s agree to read the best of what\u2019s available, and if that means one genre skews heavily for a while, so be it.\nNext, we need to decide what we will read first. I will almost always recommend something on the adult side because that\u2019s what I normally read. I know there are many young adult fans; I\u2019m counting on you to put in great recommendations. Please put in your recommendations in the comments. I will take the top picks and post them in a later post. We\u2019ll vote on what to read then. Does this sound fair? Easy? I\u2019ve never run a book club before, so if anyone can suggest an easier way to do this, I\u2019m all ears.\nOnce we do that, we can decide on a meeting place. Whew! This book club business is more involved than I thought!\np.s. Let me know if you have a suggestion for a cute name. I have a designer on standby waiting to create marketing material for the club. So far, all I have is Book Club, which is pretty much the most basic name on earth. It does make me chuckle, though, because every time I say it I think Fight Club. Jane Austen\u2019s Fight Club .\np.p.s. I have a few books to toss into the recommendation pile, one being Haruki Murakami\u2019s 1Q84 (the cover art leads the post) and 11/22/63 by Stephen King . Swear, the only Stephen King fiction I have ever read is a collection of short stories. I find this bizarre, since he wrote one of my favorite books on writing .\n"}, {"score": 1379.6787, "uuid": "10165864-79da-5436-aabd-a69c60d3a2b8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0905wb-66-06110", "target_hostname": "bostonma.usn.myareaguide.com", "target_uri": "http://bostonma.usn.myareaguide.com/column-story/Klugertown/Are-We-What-We-Readand-Watch/155", "page_rank": 1.3621833e-09, "spam_rank": 68, "title": "<em>Are</em> We <em>What</em> We <em>Read</em>...and Watch?", "snippet": "I <em>read</em> Clive Cussler&#x27;s &quot;Crescent Dawn&quot; and Jeffrey Kluger&#x27;s (no relation) &quot;The Sibling Effect&quot; while she <em>read</em> Naomi Regan&#x27;s &quot;The Covenant&quot; and Jeffrey Zaslow&#x27;s &quot;The Girls from Ames.&quot; The <em>good</em> thing is we never fight over <em>books</em> and at B&amp;N we <em>are</em> on opposite sides of the store.", "explanation": null, "document": "Are We What We Read...and Watch?\nOct 13, 2011\nI heard a comedienne the other day who said when she was flying Delta in coach, the flight attendant walked through the aisle asking if anyone wanted to read The Wall Street Journal.

Here's an excerpt:\nThe rap on economists, only somewhat exaggerated, is that they are overconfident, unrealistic, and political. They claim a precision that neither their raw material nor their skill warrants. Too many assume that people behave like the mythical homo economicus, who is hyperrational and omniscient. And they take sides in quarrels that freeze the progress of research. Those few who defy the conventional wisdom are ignored.\nCritics are scathing. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the scholar of rare events who wrote Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan, says: \"We have to build a society that doesn't depend on forecasts by idiotic economists.\" Says Paul Wilmott, a quantitative finance expert: \"Economists' models are just awful. They completely forget how important the human element is.\"\nIn the face of such withering criticism, it's tempting to ignore the whole profession. But that won't do.\nNo it won't.\nHere are my comments on the article:\nMost of it refers to macroeconomists (people who study aggregated, economy-wide effects), and they are notoriously inaccurate in their analysis, models, and forecasts. ( Taleb is SO right .)\nThe trouble is that people WANT forecasts, so it's not really fair to complain when the forecasts are wrong.\nAs a microeconomist (someone who studies the behavior of individuals), I know that the mathematical models of homo-economicus are wrong, and I do not use them very much. Most of the time, I assume simple desires (to consume more or feel good) and work with obvious incentives (prices) to design mechanisms that use incentives to direct desires into \"useful\" outcomes (as opposed to failures, disasters, etc.)\nAs an example of how to do things RIGHT, consider my Real Estate Market Index [PDF], which indicated that the market was VERY VERY hot in June 2005. Even if the REMI was not \"calling\" the top of the market, someone looking at the data in 2006 would have seen that it had peaked -- even as prices continued to rise. I consider this result an example of useful macroeconomics built on microfoundations.\nBottom Line: Economists are useful but not for forecasting. Let them advise on incentives and evaluate policy effectiveness, and then let market forces determine what's \"best\" to do. (Oh, and shoot all the politicians with \"free lunch\" policies that promise all gain and no pain.)\n"}, {"score": 1360.8905, "uuid": "c3daab59-d3c3-57f2-917c-e2585152dd92", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0007wb-52-00727", "target_hostname": "menwithpens.ca", "target_uri": "http://menwithpens.ca/more-good-books-to-read/", "page_rank": 1.1896889e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "More <em>Good</em> <em>Books</em> <em>to</em> <em>Read</em> | Men with Pens", "snippet": "I\u2019m enjoying browsing the various <em>books</em> in my personal library, wondering which ones I should suggest <em>to</em> readers and why.

The prose of the novel attracted me by its quiet, alluring sensation \u2013 there was nothing vivid or bold in any description, but Whyte\u2019s style of writing calmly and gently led me through a story of Romans and one blacksmith determined to create the perfect sword.\nTom Downey\u2019s The Last Men Out \u2013 this accurate portrayal of the lives of firefighters was a story I loved.\nDowney\nspent two years living at a firehouse to write about their daily lives and the trials they lived through. Harry recommended this one to me, and I\u2019ll forever thank him for doing so. It\u2019s given me new respect for oft-forgotten heroes.\nStephen King\u2019s Cell \u2013 I loved this book.

My only complaint was the abrupt ending that I didn\u2019t see coming (I never do).

In particular you need great people, high-quality systems and excellent clients.\nMost accountants are happy to invest in improving the capabilities of their team. Likewise there is plenty of ongoing investment in improving systems. While I believe some of that investment could be better focused, I have never doubted that accountants are prepared to invest in improving systems.\nBut it seems that relatively few accountants have active strategies to improve the quality of their client base. I know that many accountants can produce a list of criteria for assessing their clients and prospects, but most don\u2019t appear to do anything with it.\nThe main criterion that is used by most accountants to determine if they should act for a client appears to be the presence of a pulse. Few accountants turn new prospects away and few stop working for any existing clients. The result is that the quality of clients stays exactly the same.\nWhile this remains the situation a great opportunity to improve the performance of accountancy practices is being missed. The best place to start is by confirming your criteria for assessing the quality of your clients. Be equally clear about what sort of clients you want and don\u2019t want.\nWhile many accountants will have the size of fee at the top of the list, I suggest this should not be the overriding factor. Some other factors you may wish to take into account include:\nAbility to pay and/or history of paying on time\nWhether they are good to deal with\nThe quality of their records\nWhether or not they promptly respond to your requests for information\nTheir potential for growth\nWhether they require added value services\nTheir ability to refer more good clients to you\nTheir honesty and integrity\nOnce you have developed a list that you are comfortable with, you then need to decide if there are any 'must-have' factors.\nAn example for existing clients may be their history of paying on time. You may decide that if the client has a history of not paying on time you will no longer work for them -\u00a0no matter how good they are against other factors. Obviously there will be slightly different criteria for existing clients than for new prospects.\nOnce you have your criteria, start with a review of your existing clients. Go through your list with your whole team and identify the bottom 10 percent\u00a0of your clients. Determine whether the issues with these clients can be resolved. If the issues cannot be resolved (and in the bottom 10 percent\u00a0most of them probably can\u2019t) then I suggest you should contact these clients and let them know you can no longer work for them.\nThis bottom 10 percent\u00a0of clients will likely produce only\u00a0two to three percent\u00a0of your fees but cause 50 to 60 percent\u00a0of your headaches and frustrations. Freeing up this time and energy will give you more time to focus on your better clients and more time to attract new and better clients. It will also be great for office morale.\nYou should repeat the process next year with your bottom 10 percent\u00a0of clients and every year thereafter.\nOnce you have carried out the process for the first time, then you can focus on improving your processes for taking on new clients of the type you want. My suggestion is that you should only take on new clients who are clearly better than your current average client. That way each new client improves the overall performance of the practice.\nAs you become more selective with the clients you both retain and take on you will discover that you will attract more prospects of the type you want. That\u2019s because you will design your services in a way that attracts those types of people and those types of people will more likely associate with your existing clients and be referred by them. It becomes a virtuous spiral of improvement.\nBetter clients attract better prospects. Better staff will want to work in your practice. You will enjoy your work and make more money.\nThis article first appeared in The Journal.

That\u2019s roughly 57 new books each week when, for most of us, reading even one a week feels like an accomplishment. How do you keep up? How do you read a business book?\nBecause I study, write, and teach innovation\u2014a subject that fills a healthy chunk of the business book market--I end up reading a lot and so do many of the people I know (professors, consultants, and professional book reviewers). When Comstocks asked me to write a brief column, \"how to read a business book,\" I asked my friends and colleagues how they selected, read, and thought about business books. Their responses are organized here.\nI. Read wisely.\nYou\u2019ll never read everything, so relax about it. Instead, be strategic in your choice of what to read. Know what subjects you\u2019re interested in and what you\u2019re looking for. Books tend to focus on subjects like leadership, managing people, operations, entrepreneurship, marketing, creativity, etc\u2026 If you\u2019re a new manager, a book on managing people can give you a good sense of how to select, train, and reward employees. If you\u2019re looking to grow your business, a book about marketing or sales will help you think about finding new customers or closing deals. Since you'll never read them all, know why you're reading the ones you choose.\nBooks also tend to fit one of four flavors: prescriptive, descriptive, narrative, and fables. Prescriptives promise to particular solution: managing teams, motivating poor performers, making strategic decisions, finding a job, reaching your full potential, leading organizations, etc\u2026 and usually have some number of answers (5 secrets, 7 habits, 22 laws, etc\u2026). Descriptives offer interesting explanations of what\u2019s going on but no real actionable advice (e.g., The Tipping Point and The World is Flat). Narratives are the \u201cgreat man\u201d and \u201cgreat woman\u201d stories, usually auto-biographical, that explain how that one person was responsible for a company\u2019s great performance (Who Say\u2019s Elephants Can\u2019t Dance). Finally, there are the fables, short books that offer a simple creamy insight inside a fluffy, allegorical, outside. Usually (and not surprisingly) food-related: like cheese, fish, chicken-soup. High-calorie and low-nutrition books, read them at your own peril. Know which kind of books you enjoy reading, when, and why.\n2. Don\u2019t read.\nThere is such a thing as reading too many books. The \u201cmargin of diminishing returns\u201d rule applies to reading business books. Don't read more than 2-3 books in any one field: the first can teach you a lot, the second will add a bit more, but the third will likely sound repetitive. Once that happens, move on to another field or topic. If you want to do this right, start with the classics (like Peter Drucker). As Simon London, an occasional reviewer for the Financial Times says, \u201cIt is a cliche, but true, that the biggest challenge for any management writer is finding something to say that Drucker has not already said better.\u201d\n3. Read efficiently\nThe first chapter of a business book (almost) always provides the entire set of ideas contained in the book. Also, the authors likely spent the most time and attention on it, as it was the one they used to pitch the book to the publishers. Read that chapter well. Most of the other chapters will elaborate on the ideas presented here\u2014so decide in this first chapter which ideas are most interesting to you and read (or skim) those subsequent chapters closely.\nAlso, because readers pay attention to the beginning and end of every chapter, paragraph, and section, if writers want to say anything important, they usually say it there. So a well-written book can often be read simply by reading the first section of every chapter, the first paragraph of every section, and the first sentence of every paragraph. Decide how much time you\u2019re willing to devote to this book. Is it a classic? Read it well throughout. Is this your second book on a subject? Read the introductions to each chapter, and skim the sections. Try to figure out what each chapter and section are saying\u2014in your own words\u2014and search for the key points. Is this your third (or more) book? Read the chapter headings and only dive deeper if it looks like you\u2019ll find something you don\u2019t already know.\n4. Read skeptically.\nMost business books are made of three roughly equal parts. The first part is just plain obvious. It's the head-nodding claims about how critical leadership is, what changing times we live in, or how we need to be happy in our work. This stuff makes sure the reader is reading the right book\u2014a little like when the flight attendant tells you where this fight is heading. The second major part includes the ideas that are common to most every business book on the subject: leaders are visionary, innovation is about breaking the rules, etc\u2026 This is valuable knowledge the first time you hear it, and also why the second book you read is less enlightening. The last third of the book is what's the unique contribution of the author. When you\u2019ve got a good sense of the first two thirds, you can begin skimming books looking for this last, elusive bit of value. But beware! The rule of thirds applies here too: 1/3 of this unique contribution will be brilliant, 1/3 will be obvious, and 1/3 will be complete malarkey. You\u2019ll have to figure out which is which.\n5. Finally, read the reviews\nEven if you read the book, read the reviews other people write. For some books, it\u2019s more important to know what everyone else thinks it says than to know what the author actually said. These are the cocktail and conference room books: Tipping Point, Innovator\u2019s Dilemma, etc\u2026 I recommend getting familiar with one or more professional reviewers, like Jim Pawlak (syndicated columnist, Biz Books) and Robert Morris (a top-ten reviewer for Amazon)\u2014it\u2019s easier to trust a review when you\u2019ve read others by the same reviewer. Read a few reviews to find out how everyone has decided to interpret these books.

Their responses are organized here.\nI. Read wisely.\nYou\u2019ll never read everything, so relax about it. Instead, be strategic in your choice of what to read. Know what subjects you\u2019re interested in and what you\u2019re looking for. Books tend to focus on subjects like leadership, managing people, operations, entrepreneurship, marketing, creativity, etc\u2026 If you\u2019re a new manager, a book on managing people can give you a good sense of how to select, train, and reward employees. If you\u2019re looking to grow your business, a book about marketing or sales will help you think about finding new customers or closing deals. Since you'll never read them all, know why you're reading the ones you choose.\nBooks also tend to fit one of four flavors: prescriptive, descriptive, narrative, and fables. Prescriptives promise to particular solution: managing teams, motivating poor performers, making strategic decisions, finding a job, reaching your full potential, leading organizations, etc\u2026 and usually have some number of answers (5 secrets, 7 habits, 22 laws, etc\u2026). Descriptives offer interesting explanations of what\u2019s going on but no real actionable advice (e.g., The Tipping Point and The World is Flat). Narratives are the \u201cgreat man\u201d and \u201cgreat woman\u201d stories, usually auto-biographical, that explain how that one person was responsible for a company\u2019s great performance (Who Say\u2019s Elephants Can\u2019t Dance). Finally, there are the fables, short books that offer a simple creamy insight inside a fluffy, allegorical, outside. Usually (and not surprisingly) food-related: like cheese, fish, chicken-soup. High-calorie and low-nutrition books, read them at your own peril. Know which kind of books you enjoy reading, when, and why.\n2. Don\u2019t read.\nThere is such a thing as reading too many books. The \u201cmargin of diminishing returns\u201d rule applies to reading business books. Don't read more than 2-3 books in any one field: the first can teach you a lot, the second will add a bit more, but the third will likely sound repetitive. Once that happens, move on to another field or topic. If you want to do this right, start with the classics (like Peter Drucker). As Simon London, an occasional reviewer for the Financial Times says, \u201cIt is a cliche, but true, that the biggest challenge for any management writer is finding something to say that Drucker has not already said better.\u201d\n3. Read efficiently\nThe first chapter of a business book (almost) always provides the entire set of ideas contained in the book. Also, the authors likely spent the most time and attention on it, as it was the one they used to pitch the book to the publishers. Read that chapter well. Most of the other chapters will elaborate on the ideas presented here\u2014so decide in this first chapter which ideas are most interesting to you and read (or skim) those subsequent chapters closely.\nAlso, because readers pay attention to the beginning and end of every chapter, paragraph, and section, if writers want to say anything important, they usually say it there. So a well-written book can often be read simply by reading the first section of every chapter, the first paragraph of every section, and the first sentence of every paragraph. Decide how much time you\u2019re willing to devote to this book. Is it a classic? Read it well throughout. Is this your second book on a subject? Read the introductions to each chapter, and skim the sections. Try to figure out what each chapter and section are saying\u2014in your own words\u2014and search for the key points. Is this your third (or more) book? Read the chapter headings and only dive deeper if it looks like you\u2019ll find something you don\u2019t already know.\n4. Read skeptically.\nMost business books are made of three roughly equal parts. The first part is just plain obvious. It's the head-nodding claims about how critical leadership is, what changing times we live in, or how we need to be happy in our work. This stuff makes sure the reader is reading the right book\u2014a little like when the flight attendant tells you where this fight is heading. The second major part includes the ideas that are common to most every business book on the subject: leaders are visionary, innovation is about breaking the rules, etc\u2026 This is valuable knowledge the first time you hear it, and also why the second book you read is less enlightening. The last third of the book is what's the unique contribution of the author. When you\u2019ve got a good sense of the first two thirds, you can begin skimming books looking for this last, elusive bit of value. But beware! The rule of thirds applies here too: 1/3 of this unique contribution will be brilliant, 1/3 will be obvious, and 1/3 will be complete malarkey. You\u2019ll have to figure out which is which.\n5. Finally, read the reviews\nEven if you read the book, read the reviews other people write. For some books, it\u2019s more important to know what everyone else thinks it says than to know what the author actually said. These are the cocktail and conference room books: Tipping Point, Innovator\u2019s Dilemma, etc\u2026 I recommend getting familiar with one or more professional reviewers, like Jim Pawlak (syndicated columnist, Biz Books) and Robert Morris (a top-ten reviewer for Amazon)\u2014it\u2019s easier to trust a review when you\u2019ve read others by the same reviewer.

Along with improving the living environment, HOPE VI is thought to improve residents\u2019 access to social capital by changing the economic mix of their neighborhoods. This article contributes evidence from multivariate analyses of survey data of Boston HOPE VI residents in their post-HOPE VI neighborhoods. Findings indicate that rather than neighborhood socioeconomic mix, neighborhood resources, such as libraries, recreation facilities, parks, grocery stores, and social services, followed by place attachment and feelings of safety,were the strongest predictors of social capital\u2026.\u201d\nJuly 9, 2010 at 2:57 pm | Posted in amenities , cities , consumption , culture , geography , race , reading list , social capital , what to read | 1 Comment\nIn \u201cThe Nightly Round: Space, Social Capital, and Urban Black Nightlife,\u201d sociologist Marcus Hunter uses participant observation and semistructured interviews to consider the ways in which nightlife is used to mitigate the effects of social and spatial isolation, complementing the accomplishment of the daily round. Through an analysis of the nightly round\u2014a process encompassing the social interactions, behaviors, and actions involved in going to, being in, and leaving the club\u2014Hunter demonstrates that understanding the ways in which urban blacks use space in the nightclub to mediate racial segregation, sexual segregation, and limited social capital expands our current understanding of the spatial mobility of urban blacks as well as the important role of extra-neighborhood spaces in such processes. Further, the article highlights the ways that urban blacks use space in the nightclub to leverage socioeconomic opportunities and enhance social networks. While Hunter found that black heterosexual and lesbian and gay patrons used space in similar ways, black lesbians and gays were more likely to use the club as a space to develop ties of social support. The article can be found in the June 2010 issue of City and Community (volume 9, number 2).\nMay 10, 2010 at 11:24 pm | Posted in culture , neighborhoods , poverty , reading list , what to read | Leave a comment\nA new volume of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences reexamines the relationship between culture and poverty. The volume takes contemporary researchers on poverty to task for largely abandoning the study of culture. At the same time, it challenges dated and discredited perspectives that suggest that the poor are poor because of their cultural values. Instead, it calls for scholars and policy makers to take advantage of new research in anthropology and cultural sociology that forces us to broaden our understanding of culture, poverty, and anti-poverty policy.\u00a0 See the uncorrected proofs of the introductory article by Mario L Small, David Harding, and Michele Lamont.\nMay 9, 2010 at 8:39 pm | Posted in data , economic development , geography , neighborhoods , race , what to read | Leave a comment\nThe report , by the Brookings Institution , argues that a decade of transformation and turmoil has resulted in \u201cfive new realities\u201d: the rapid growth and outward expansion of metropolitan areas;\u00a0 a dramatic diversification of the nation\u2019s ethnic composition; the sharp growth of the 55-64 year-old population; a highly uneven increase in educational attainment; and a continuing rise in income inequality.\u00a0 Bruce Katz and Judith Rodin discuss some of the implications of these trends.\nMarch 10, 2010 at 11:30 pm | Posted in immigrants , neighborhoods , reading list , social capital , what to read | Leave a comment\nIn the new article, \u201c Noneconomic Effects of Ethnic Entrepreneurship: A Focused Look at the Chinese and Korean Enclave Economies in Los Angeles ,\u201d Min Zhou and Myungduk Cho aim to develop a conceptual framework from a community perspective to examine the noneconomic effects of ethnic entrepreneurship. They pay close attention to the linkage between entrepreneurship and community building using ethnographic data from comparative case studies of the Chinese and Korean enclave economies in Los Angeles. They argue that it is the social embeddedness of entrepreneurship, rather than individual entrepreneurs per se, that creates a unique social environment conducive to upward social mobility. This study suggests that ethnic entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in immigrant adaptation beyond observable economic gains. The analysis contributes to the literature on ethnic entrepreneurship by shifting the focal point from ultimate mobility outcomes\u2014earnings or employment opportunities\u2014to intermediate social processes\u2014community building through the consolidation of ethnic social structures, the creation of ethnic social spaces, the return of the co-ethnic middle class, and social capital formation. In this respect, the enclave economy concept is superior for investigating specific social contexts and processes of group-level social mobility.\n"}], [{"score": 1345.5947, "uuid": "e1bcd3e4-8735-5fe4-86a7-ebef22573867", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1801wb-21-01044", "target_hostname": "nikonites.com", "target_uri": "http://nikonites.com/photography-business/2338-good-reads.html", "page_rank": 1.2603036e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>Good</em> <em>Reads</em>", "snippet": "These <em>are</em> all very <em>good</em> <em>reads</em>: Professional <em>Business</em> Practices in Photography - ASMP Best <em>Business</em> Practices for Photographers - John Harrington <em>Business</em> and Legal Forms for Photographers - Tad Crawford The one by John Harrington was a real stretch for me.", "explanation": null, "document": "D300s\nGood Reads\nI typically ignore recommendations from Amazon.

Blink by Malcolm Gladwell\nRecommended by Melissa\nGladwell\u2019s Blink may get less attention than \u201cThe Tipping Point\u201d and \u201cOutliers,\u201d but it\u2019s a quick read that explains how our brains unconsciously make decisions before we even know we\u2019ve made them, as well as how our instinct-based decisions are often more on-point than we initially give them credit for.\n10.

In particular you need great people, high-quality systems and excellent clients.\nMost accountants are happy to invest in improving the capabilities of their team. Likewise there is plenty of ongoing investment in improving systems. While I believe some of that investment could be better focused, I have never doubted that accountants are prepared to invest in improving systems.\nBut it seems that relatively few accountants have active strategies to improve the quality of their client base. I know that many accountants can produce a list of criteria for assessing their clients and prospects, but most don\u2019t appear to do anything with it.\nThe main criterion that is used by most accountants to determine if they should act for a client appears to be the presence of a pulse. Few accountants turn new prospects away and few stop working for any existing clients. The result is that the quality of clients stays exactly the same.\nWhile this remains the situation a great opportunity to improve the performance of accountancy practices is being missed. The best place to start is by confirming your criteria for assessing the quality of your clients. Be equally clear about what sort of clients you want and don\u2019t want.\nWhile many accountants will have the size of fee at the top of the list, I suggest this should not be the overriding factor. Some other factors you may wish to take into account include:\nAbility to pay and/or history of paying on time\nWhether they are good to deal with\nThe quality of their records\nWhether or not they promptly respond to your requests for information\nTheir potential for growth\nWhether they require added value services\nTheir ability to refer more good clients to you\nTheir honesty and integrity\nOnce you have developed a list that you are comfortable with, you then need to decide if there are any 'must-have' factors.\nAn example for existing clients may be their history of paying on time. You may decide that if the client has a history of not paying on time you will no longer work for them -\u00a0no matter how good they are against other factors. Obviously there will be slightly different criteria for existing clients than for new prospects.\nOnce you have your criteria, start with a review of your existing clients. Go through your list with your whole team and identify the bottom 10 percent\u00a0of your clients. Determine whether the issues with these clients can be resolved. If the issues cannot be resolved (and in the bottom 10 percent\u00a0most of them probably can\u2019t) then I suggest you should contact these clients and let them know you can no longer work for them.\nThis bottom 10 percent\u00a0of clients will likely produce only\u00a0two to three percent\u00a0of your fees but cause 50 to 60 percent\u00a0of your headaches and frustrations. Freeing up this time and energy will give you more time to focus on your better clients and more time to attract new and better clients. It will also be great for office morale.\nYou should repeat the process next year with your bottom 10 percent\u00a0of clients and every year thereafter.\nOnce you have carried out the process for the first time, then you can focus on improving your processes for taking on new clients of the type you want. My suggestion is that you should only take on new clients who are clearly better than your current average client. That way each new client improves the overall performance of the practice.\nAs you become more selective with the clients you both retain and take on you will discover that you will attract more prospects of the type you want. That\u2019s because you will design your services in a way that attracts those types of people and those types of people will more likely associate with your existing clients and be referred by them. It becomes a virtuous spiral of improvement.\nBetter clients attract better prospects. Better staff will want to work in your practice. You will enjoy your work and make more money.\nThis article first appeared in The Journal.

Agreement shows that our preferences <em>are</em> not purely individual, but have some basis in the world outside our own heads.", "explanation": null, "document": "What Good Are the Arts?\nJohn Carey\nDolan Cummings\nposted 28 June 2005\nIn the first half of this book, John Carey ties his hands firmly behind his back. In the second half, he clambers awkwardly into the ring to champion his beloved literature. As he is stretchered off at the end, it is hard not to admire his efforts, while feeling somewhat bewildered by the whole spectacle.\nCarey wants to persuade us that literature is the greatest of artforms, but he doesn't believe that judgements of this sort have any objective meaning beyond expressing the preferences of their authors. When it comes to judging between artforms, many will be sympathic to this argument, however compelling Carey's own case for literature may be. But Carey takes the argument further, insisting that there is no objective basis for saying that any work of art is better than any other. Art is whatever anyone says is art, even if only for that person, and nobody can claim with any authority that anyone else's opinion on art is wrong.\nThis may seem an eccentric position for a critic and professor of literature, and indeed it not only forestalls his own case for literature in general, but it undermines the whole business of literary or any other art criticism, rendering it whimsical or merely descriptive. Carey's otherwise faintly silly suggestion that literature is 'better' than other artforms is made all right by this relegation of criticism itself. Like polls meant to decide 'the nation's favourite writer', perhaps, his arguments are not to be taken too seriously.\nThey may, of course, persuade some or all of my readers, and I hope they do. But this will not show that they are true, only that they are persuasive. We cannot talk of truth or falsehood except where proof is available, and where proof is available persuasion is not needed. (p172)\nPersuasion is made here to seem sordid, an act of low seduction rather than intellectual engagement. While Carey accuses 'high art' advocates like the novelist Jeanette Winterson of 'living in a world of absolutes', Carey himself seems unable to imagine anything between laboratory-tested scientific proof and sheer fancy.\nCarey sees the assertion that some things are art and others not as a residual trace of Kant's theory that there exists a mysterious realm of truth, or 'supersensible substrate of nature' where these things are decided. But such a belief is not necessary to support strong judgements of value in the arts or anything else. If I say I'm no footballer, this is not a Kantian reference to some transcendental realm: I'm quite willing to concede that if I take part in a kickabout in the park, then in a literal sense, I am a footballer. But anyone watching for five minutes would be perfectly justified in observing, 'That guy is no footballer'. Philosophically, the statement may be more complicated than it appears, but I think we all know what it means. Isn't the same true of art? This is the rub.\nWhereas football has commonly understood rules (and not just FIFA regulations, but implicit standards anyone who knows the game understands) the arts are increasingly bereft of such a framework. What Good Are the Arts? has been written in a particular context. As Carey discusses, old-fashioned conventions determining what is and is not art, and guiding judgements about how good a particular work of art is, are increasingly hard to sustain in the face of so-called multiculturalism and a pervasive anti-elitism. This is not the place to discuss the merits of these things: suffice to say that Carey sees this development not as a challenge to existing standards of artistic judgement, but as an indication that standards per se are unsustainable.\nHis response to what might be considered a political phenomenon as much as a cultural one is philosophical, in both senses of the word. Characterising value judgements in art as the sentiment that 'What I feel is more valuable than what you feel', Carey writes, 'We can see now that such a claim is nonsense psychologically, because other people's feelings cannot be accessed.' (p25) Come again? Responses to art 'are shut away in other people's consciousnesses.' (p31) So, that's that, then. Now, granted, we can never be absolutely certain about what other people feel, but can't we get a rough idea by, say, talking, and stuff like that? Isn't communication between consciousnesses what culture is all about?\nCarey says he wants other people to read books he has enjoyed because they might enjoy them too. That's very nice of him, but I suspect that for most of us at least there is more to it than that. We want other people to read and enjoy the books we have read and enjoyed because other people's agreement will confirm that we are right. Agreement shows that our preferences are not purely individual, but have some basis in the world outside our own heads. I haven't said that basis is purely objective, or that such agreement proves anything in a strict logical sense. But that would miss the point: as Carey discusses, the various scientific efforts to account for the effects of art in terms of measurable traits or its effect on the brain just don't cut it: to argue that a book is great is not to make a statement about the natural world.\nIndeed, perhaps the thrill of agreement is heightened when we realise the matter of agreement is not purely objective. In affirms that we are united in our subjectivity. Better than being right merely as individuals against objective reality: we are right as participants in a culture.\nWhen Carey and others discussed the book at a recent public event in London, someone in the audience suggested that arts critics are like Narcissus gazing at his own reflection in the pond; what they see is merely a reflection of their own implicit cultural assumptions. Carey was very taken with the analogy, but it surely misses something. One man gazing lovingly at his own reflection may be narcissistic, but a society regarding itself is a culture. There is nothing sad or solipsistic about that. Indeed, it is the rejection of culture in favour of cosmic objectivity that would be truly antisocial. Carey acknowledges this. To be taken right out of one's culture would be to go mad, he says.\nThis is not to say that 'different cultures' are incommensurable any more than different societies are: culture in this sense is broader than a particular set of beliefs and practices. It is humanity's collective awareness of itself in a particular historical context, including morality: sometimes conflicting ideas about what makes the good life (and good art). Carey says that 'moral questions could be defined as questions to which there are no answers.' (p172) This might be true for alien observers. Is slavery a good thing or a bad thing? There is no objective answer to satisfy a disinterested Martian. And as Carey suggests, an ancient Greek would find the question incomprehensible. But for us, the answer is obvious. Is the EU constitution a good thing or a bad thing? The answer is less obvious, but it would be ridiculous to say there is no answer. It's just that we disagree about it. And to disagree is to assert right.\nThat people disagree about the arts, then, does not mean there is no basis for agreement. If artistic merit is relative only in the same sense that ethics or politics are relative, it is hard to see the point in making such an argument. Carey concedes that artistic judgements, like ethical ones, are not unimportant: they shape our lives (p173). The devastating philosophical critique of the idea of a supersensible substrate of nature turns out to be a bit beside the point, then. The point is that Carey would rather not get involved in arguments about artistic merit - he likes what he knows (and as the book demonstrates, he knows a lot) - but he doesn't want to tell others they are wrong. When it comes to the culture war, Carey is a conscientious objector.\nWe don't have to believe in the transcendental notion of art's value that Carey ridicules to take a more combative approach. The point of arguing about the arts is not to establish for all time that a particular work fulfils some cosmic criteria of artistic worthiness, but to convince fellow members of our own society that it has value according to our own standards and ideals. Those things may shift in subtle and not-subtle ways over time, but it is disingenuous to claim there is nothing to them but personal taste. Properly engaged criticism can speak for more than just the taste of its author, and thus can have a hand in shaping our culture and our lives. John Carey's distaste for such bold judgements is just that. Supersensible substrata of nature aside, the rest of us remain free to engage with culture, and politics, not as Olympian observers but as red-blooded participants.\nAll articles on this site \u00a9 Culture Wars.\n"}, {"score": 1336.9174, "uuid": "c79dc9b6-648f-533a-97a0-c3618e8faa02", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1408wb-70-19979", "target_hostname": "www.thatswhatsheread.net", "target_uri": "http://www.thatswhatsheread.net/2009/09/i-read-banned-books.html", "page_rank": 1.1769894e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "That&#x27;s <em>What</em> She <em>Read</em>: I <em>Read</em> Banned <em>Books</em>!", "snippet": "Looking for Alaska was a really <em>good</em> <em>book</em>.

Not often (and not well). But reading the books is fun. It\u2019s a vicarious thing, imagining how a trick might work, visualizing the effect and then smiling at how the technique is done. One after another, it\u2019s a pleasant adventure.\nA lot of people read business books in just the same way. They cruise through the case studies or the insights or examples and imagine what it would be like to be that brilliant entrepreneur or that successful CEO or that great sales rep. A pleasant adventure.\nThere\u2019s a huge gap between most how-to books (cookbooks, gardening, magic, etc.) and business books , though. The gap is motivation. Gardening books don\u2019t push you to actually do something. Cookbooks don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to sell you on why making a roast chicken isn\u2019t as risky as you might think.\nThe stakes are a lot higher when it comes to business.\nWreck a roast chicken and it\u2019s $12 down the drain. Wreck a product launch and there goes your career...\nI\u2019m passionate about writing business books precisely for this reason. There are more business books sold than most other non-fiction categories for the same reason. High stakes, high rewards.\nThe fascinating thing is this: I spend 95% of my time persuading people to take action and just 5% of the time on the recipes.\nThe recipe that makes up just about any business book can be condensed to just two or three pages. The rest is the sell. The proof. The persuasion.\nWhich leads to your role as the reader. How to read a business book... it\u2019s not as obvious as it seems.\nBullet points are not the point.\nIf you\u2019re reading for the recipe, and just the recipe, you can get through a business book in just a few minutes. But most people who do that get very little out of the experience. Take a look at the widely divergent reviews for The Dip. The people who \u2018got it\u2019 understood that it was a book about getting you to change your perspective and thus your behavior. Those that didn\u2019t were looking for bullet points. They wasted their money.\nComputer books, of course, are nothing but bullet points. Programmers get amazing value because for $30 they are presented with everything they need to program a certain tool. Yet most programmers are not world class, precisely because the bullet points aren\u2019t enough to get them to see things the way the author does, and not enough to get them motivated enough to actually program great code.\nSo, how to read a business book:\n1. Decide, before you start, that you\u2019re going to change three things about what you do all day at work. Then, as you\u2019re reading, find the three things and do it. The goal of the reading, then, isn\u2019t to persuade you to change, it\u2019s to help you choose what to change.\n2. If you\u2019re going to invest a valuable asset (like time), go ahead and make it productive. Use a postit or two, or some index cards or a highlighter. Not to write down stuff so you can forget it later, but to create marching orders. It\u2019s simple: if three weeks go by and you haven\u2019t taken action on what you\u2019ve written down, you wasted your time.\n3. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about the next person. The single best use of a business book is to help someone else. Sharing what you read, handing the book to a person who needs it... pushing those around you to get in sync and to take action--that\u2019s the main reason it\u2019s a book, not a video or a seminar. A book is a souvenir and a container and a motivator and an easily leveraged tool. Hoarding books makes them worth less, not more.\nEffective managers hand books to their team.

In your wildest imaginings\u2026\u2026could you ever envision a debilitating brain injury changing your life for the better?\nIn Left Neglected, a new novel by Lisa Genova, the New York Times best-selling author of \u201cStill Alive,\u201d we are introduced to Sarah Nickerson, a prominent VP of Human Resources who forever on her cell phone, laptop or running to meetings. Genova paints a picture of a woman driven, one who is often absent in the everyday lives of her husband and three young children.\nDriving to work one fateful, rushed morning, Sarah is involved in a life-altering car accident whereby she is left with permanent brain damage, a condition referred to as \u201cleft neglect.\u201d An injury leaves her brain unable to recognize anything on the left side of her body.\nThrough reading the novel, we learn about Sarah\u2019s childhood during which a devastating family accident leaves her with a depressed, guilt-ridden mother and an angry, withdrawn father.\nAs an adult, she has chosen to her dedicate her time and energy to her career, leaving her children to grow up with an absentee mother, much like she did. The accident forces her to slow down\u2026and regain her strength and consequently begin to become a more nurturing. The accident also makes her re-evaluate what it means to be there for her family, and helps her to rekindle a new relationship with her mother.\nAs Sarah realizes that the chances of a full-recovery are non-existent, she is forced to accept her limitations, and an opportunity presents itself, where her business experience and her present condition will be seen in a whole new light.\nBy the end of the book you hardly recognize the \u201cover-scheduled, over-achieving\u201d woman she used to be.\nI really enjoyed reading this book because it made me wonder whether, in the face of such adversity, I could live with a such a dramatic life change. It is a very moving human drama, that lends you the ability to experience the hardships that accompany a life with this medical condition.\nThe story makes one appreciate the fragility of life and how just one moment can have such a drastic impact. To quote Sarah, \u201cI\u2019ve learned that my life can be fully lived\u2026..with less.\u201d Could yours?\nLeft Neglected is published by Simon & Schuster\n\"WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU ONLY HAD ONE YEAR TO LIVE?\"\nSo begins the book entitled REBOOT YOUR LIFE by Catherine Allen, Nancy Bearg, Rita Foley and Jaye Smith. The four authors met in 2006 in Puerto Rico at a conference for CEOs and other executives.\nSitting at a table where the pre-selected topic of conversation was \"Following your dreams,\" the concept of the \u201csabbatical\u201d soon arose and, as it turned out, the four senior execs were all established veterans.\nA chance meeting, and within the following year, the \"sabbatical sisters\" had written a book on the overwhelming merits of taking such a step.\nIf time is our most precious commodity and something we can never get back, why is it that we often undervalue time invested in ourselves? The return on such an investment is sure to be a guaranteed period of self-discovery, personal growth, and inner evaluation.\nReboot outlines a number of reasons why taking a sabbatical might be the right choice for any of us regardless of age, social standing, marital status, or professional background. It also presents us with seven \u201ccategories\u201d of life where taking inventory of one\u2019s goals and priorities may be necessary. The seven categories are:\nCareer Enhancement, Family-Related, Emotional Healing, Volunteering, Life Enhancement and Pre-Retirement.\nIn discussions and interviews with over 200 people ranging in age from mid 20s to late 70s, the authors reveal how Rebooting allowed each of them to \"step back\" from what they deemed was \"missing\" or \"unfulfilled\" and make necessary adjustments in order to re-establish personal goals and priorities.\nMany of the \"Reboot Break CHORUS\" were so impacted by taking a year off , that they have since taken additional ones, at different phases of their lives. Allen et al stress that a sabbatical is not \"time off....but in fact time-on to re-invest in your life!\"\nThe reasons to \"Reboot\" are as varied as the people taking them. The authors stress that sabbaticals don't require trips to Europe or the penning of a best seller......but something as diverse as to \"follow a creative dream, make a difference, give back to society or explore something different.\"\nUnfortunately, it may also be triggered by negative issues such as \" job burnout, career disillusionment, or a life-changing event like death, illness, or divorce.\"\nIf any of these topics seem to jump out at you......and you reply with a resounding......\"that is exactly how I feel\" then perhaps a \"Reboot\" is in your future!\nIf you are at a crossroads, or are thinking about taking time off for your physical, mental or emotional well-being, then that is reason enough to read this book. We all innately know when we have had enough and are in need of a change!\nAlthough this is not usually the type of book I read.....I did learn some interesting information about time management and the benefits of financial planning. Whether you are considering a sabbatical or not there are some very useful ideas about saving and ways to approach your employer about varied pay options. It also made me take a hard look at what, if anything, I would like to change or attempt in my life. Perhaps become an accomplished Italian chef or a sommelier? Reading Rebooting your Life certainly got me thinking.\nOntario-based Rosemarie Barnes is a mother of four,\u00a0full-time librarian,\u00a0avid gardener and amateur photographer.\u00a0\u00a0With a\u00a0voracious appetite for the written word, Rosemarie\u00a0reads an average of a dozen books a month.\nSign up for our free newsletter and we'll send you this...\nNEWS, EVENTS & SPECIAL OFFERS\n"}, {"score": 1325.4453, "uuid": "4c629c6e-9a74-5e44-920e-c50ad88a958e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1301wb-08-18820", "target_hostname": "www.realministry.org", "target_uri": "http://www.realministry.org/what-to-read/", "page_rank": 1.248788e-09, "spam_rank": 94, "title": "REAL Ministry | <em>What</em> <em>to</em> <em>Read</em>???", "snippet": "There is a great monograph <em>to</em> the \u201c<em>Good</em> <em>to</em> Great\u201d <em>book</em>, called \u201c<em>Good</em> <em>to</em> Great and the Social Sectors\u201d (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;<em>Good</em>-Great-Social-Sectors-Monograph&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0977326403&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1?", "explanation": null, "document": "January 23, 2012 2 Comments\nRecently, Jon Acuff tweeted about a couple books he was reading this year.

That got my questionably wandering attention.\u00a0 The environmental impact held inside this book seems to hold more drama for me and affect me far more than both those fictional mystery/suspense novels.\u00a0 Perhaps it's because Mono Lake can never be replaced.\u00a0 Perhaps also, it's because this ancient, saline lake has held on throughout the ages until the DWP decided to start tampering with nature.\nWhatever the reason, I haven't finished any books lately, but I sure have picked up a few.\nPosted by Heather Ames on November 18, 2004 at 11:00 PM in Books | Permalink\n"}, {"score": 1323.7458, "uuid": "f2f7fe2a-6619-56ca-a3b3-5b0637eb75b5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1203wb-95-09416", "target_hostname": "marketingmonster.wordpress.com", "target_uri": "http://marketingmonster.wordpress.com/2007/04/13/my-top-4-business-books-to-read/?replytocom=105", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 82, "title": "My Top 4 <em>Business</em> <em>Books</em> (<em>To</em> <em>Read</em>) \u00ab Marketing Monster", "snippet": "A list of the next 4 <em>business</em> <em>books</em> I want <em>to</em> <em>read</em>: Don\u2019t Make Me Think by Steve Krug (currently on page 53) Punk Marketing by Richard Laermer and Mark Simmons Mavericks at Work by William Taylor and Polly LaBarre 2 Responses <em>to</em> \u201cMy Top 4 <em>Business</em> <em>Books</em> (<em>To</em> <em>Read</em>)\u201d I\u2019ve heard a lot of <em>good</em> things about", "explanation": null, "document": "April 16, 2007 at 12:23 pm\nGood question.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Think\u201d and so far I\u2019m impressed.

Here are 22 recommendations sure to transport you this winter, even if you're only sitting in front of the fire.\nJOHN CAREY, Professor of Government, Chair, Department of Government\nJohn Wentworth Professor in the Social Sciences\nMy recommendation this time is Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba by Tom Gjelten, which I\u2019m reading these days in anticipation of joining an alumni trip to the island in February. The book weaves the story of generations of the Bacardi family, of rum-making fame, with the political history of Cuba. The Bacardis were leaders in the Cuban movement for independence from Spain in the late 19th century, then built one of the most successful export industries in the country during the first half of the 20th century. They opposed Batista, initially supported Castro\u2019s revolution, and then felt betrayed when Castro nationalized their Cuban holdings. Through the years, however, the family had internationalized its production and distribution network. The company thrived even after the family left for exile, and eventually played a key role in the anti-Castro networks in Cuban-American Miami. Gjelten does a great job weaving the business history, political history, and family biography. Turns out there\u2019s also more to making rum than I had thought.\nKATE CONLEY,\u00a0Edward Tuck Professor of French and Comparative Literature\nThis winter, I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed the novel Waiting for Robert Capa by Susana Fortes, translated beautifully from the Spanish by Adriana Lopez. This fictional account of the work and love story of Robert Capa and Gerda Taro during the Spanish Civil War is poetic and gripping. It serves as a worthy companion piece to the recent exhibition and catalogue from the International Center for Photography, The Mexican Suitcase, edited by Cynthia Young. The catalogue has a wealth of photographs from that war, including work by Capa and Taro, lost for decades and only recently recovered in a suitcase found in Mexico in 2007.\nAINE DONOVAN, Director, Ethics Institute, Faculty, Tuck School of Business\nSteve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is one of the best biographies/social history of this new century!\nLast Train to Paradise by Les Standiford chronicles the attempts of Henry Flagler to establish a deep-water port in Key West, Florida, and the many trials and tribulations of building a railroad in swamp- and disease-plagued 19th-century Florida.\nM. CECELIA GAPOSCHKIN, Assistant Professor of History\nA wonderful \u201ccrossover\u201d book is a new history of the First Crusade by Jay Rubenstein called Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for the Apocalypse. \u00a0This is a superb, utterly entertaining, thought-provoking, at times (rightly) disturbing, and thoroughly illuminating account of the First Crusade. It is written by an eminent historian, who has gone back to the primary sources and re-narrated the events of 1095 to 1099, when something on the order of 100,000 Christians marched across Europe, through Byzantium, Anatolia, and down to Palestine to retake the holy city of Jerusalem from Muslim control. Though eminently scholarly, it is pitched to a non-academic audience. Rubenstein tells a wonderful story and, although specialists will be able to identify his arguments and his engagement with historiographical disputes, his narrative is free of the kind of \u201cinside-baseball\u201d argumentation that can sometimes muddy the overall picture. This book conveys the excitement, anticipation, horror, and amazement at the extraordinary events that started one of the consequential phases of the history of the West and the history of the relationship between Christianity and Islam.\u00a0 Worth the read.\nPETER HACKETT, Professor of Theater, Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities\nI was on sabbatical this fall and attended the Dublin Theater Festival. While there I read Sebastian Barry\u2019s two novels, The Secret Scripture and On Caanan\u2019s Side. Beautifully written, the stories focus on members of two families, the McNultys and the Dunnes, from Barry\u2019s earlier novels and give a deeply personal look at 20th-century Irish history.\nDOUGLAS IRWIN, Robert E. Maxwell \u201923 Professor of Arts and Sciences, Department of Economics\nOne of the best books that I have read in the past year is Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World by Liaquat Ahamed. This book tells the story of the interaction among the world\u2019s top four central bankers (from the United States, Britain, France, and Germany) and how they coped with the aftermath of World War I during the 1920s\u2014and made policy mistakes that eventually led to the Great Depression. Ahamed is a great writer with an eye for the arresting story or vignette, but at the same time bases his work on impressive scholarly research. On the economics of the Great Depression of the 1930s, a historical topic of unusual contemporary relevance, a good and short overview is Gene Smiley\u2019s Rethinking the Great Depression.\nRICH KREMER, Associate Professor of History\nA History of the World in 100 Objects by British Museum Director Neil MacGregor offers a sprawling, quirky survey of human history. The hefty book begins with a 1.5-million-year-old hand ax found at the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa and concludes with a plastic credit card issued in 2009 by the United Arab Emirates. The objects, all from the British Museum, range from the ordinary to the fancy; they span the globe and reflect not only human history but also the 250-year collecting history of an imperial nation. A great read \u2014 with great photos. My favorite is the Throne of Weapons, a chair made in 2001 by the Mozambican artist Kester of weapons parts from the civil war in his nation, a simple object that tells many stories of African and global history.\n_\nJENNIFER LIND, Assistant Professor of Government\nThe \u201cDear Leader\u2019s\u201d death has made North Korea more interesting than ever, and literature is no exception. One of the books on my nightstand that I can\u2019t wait to read is the well-reviewed novel The Orphan-Master\u2019s Son by Adam Johnson. All the same I can\u2019t imagine that it can possibly be as good as the mysteries of James Church (pseudonym), a former U.S. intelligence officer with decades of experience on the Korean peninsula. Church\u2019s novels, also set in North Korea, are tense and gripping in the style of John Le Carr\u00e9. His most recent (fourth) book, The Man with the Baltic Stare, follows unforgettable main character Inspector O through the byzantine world of politics in Pyongyang\u2014and explores North Korea\u2019s delicate relationships with South Korea and China.\nIncome quadrupling. Second-largest GDP in the world. China\u2019s growing wealth and power has attracted much attention, but often at the 35,000-feet level. To come down to earth, read Ian Johnson\u2019s Wild Grass, a book consisting of three vignettes about how China\u2019s rapid growth is transforming its society and the everyday lives of its people. It is a fascinating and very human account that is all too often missing in discussions of China\u2019s rise.\nGRAZIELLA PARATI, Professor of Italian, Comparative Literature, and\u00a0Women\u2019s and Gender Studies; Paul D. Paganucci Professor of Italian Language and Literature\nAlthough tangentially, Italy is present in Jennifer Egan\u2019s book A Visit from the Goon Squad, and I needed to pay attention to it. It is a great novel, but not really a novel, as it is made up of stories that are closely connected. The stories span a few decades, from the 1960s to today, and we follow the lives of an aging rock music executive, his secretary, and a number of their friends. The plot will take you to California, New York, Italy, and Africa. Jennifer Egan is a writer to follow: She won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2010 and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2011. Enjoy!\nAmerican Dervish is a beautiful first novel by Ayad Akhtar, an actor, playwright, and screenwriter you have probably seen in the HBO movie Too Big to Fail. He is a first-generation Pakistani-American, and some of his experiences filter through this coming-of-age novel. The story takes place in Milwaukee and narrates the life of a Pakistani family, in particular that of the young son. Although it is about a boy falling in love, the novel also touches on tensions within the Muslim community, the rediscovery of faith, and being a member of a minority in the 1980s.\nDIEDERIK VANDEWALLE, Associate Professor of Government\nI\u2019ve been reading Wade Davis\u2019 Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory, and the Conquest of Everest, about British attempts in the early 1920s to reach the top of Mount Everest. Relying largely on the letters of the expeditions\u2019 members, the book is vivid account of what climbing was like in the early 20th century, before modern climbing gear was available. The book also contains a wonderful tribute to Sir Charles Bell, the British local envoy and tibetologist whose friendship with the 13th Dalai Lama ensured British climbers\u2019 access to Everest.\nI\u2019ve also been reading The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit by Lucette Lagnado \u2014 a poignant memoir of Leon Lagnado and his family who, like thousands of others, had to flee Egypt when Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s 1952 revolution took place. For those who intimately know Cairo, the book contains wonderful vignettes of Groppi\u2019s and a hundred similar places that were once de rigueur for any self-respecting, middle-class Cairene.\nLINDSAY WHALEY, Professor of Classics and Linguistics\nBitter Winds by Harry Wu and Carolyn Wakeman is the memoir of a young man who is imprisoned during the Rightist Campaign of 1960 in China and spends the next 19 years in labor camps. As a reader, you get a glimpse both of the political turmoil that plagued China from 1960 to 1980 and of the human instinct for survival.\nIn Moral, Believing Animals: Human Personhood and Culture, Christian Smith provides a refreshing critique of social theories that ignore the moral dimension to humans and fail to address basic notions such as motivation and belief.\nRICHARD WRIGHT, Orvil E. Dryfoos Professor of Public Affairs and Geography\nDon\u2019t let the slightly small font and 800 pages put you off The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined by Steven Pinker. Buy this book. This is required reading for anyone the slightest bit interested in why slavery, sadistic punishment, and public violence became taboo. It\u2019s a fascinating study of the decline of violence over time.\nStephen King\u2019s Under the Dome is another long book, but another great read. It\u2019s a sly political satire of tin-pot dictators and, yes, the violence they can still mete out.\n"}, {"score": 1322.0045, "uuid": "6602b141-6fba-59b8-b3cf-363e1c6322db", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1801wb-75-17923", "target_hostname": "chs.mesa.k12.co.us", "target_uri": "http://chs.mesa.k12.co.us/Library/BookstoRead.htm", "page_rank": 1.179739e-09, "spam_rank": 74, "title": "<em>Books</em> <em>to</em> <em>Read</em>", "snippet": "Enjoy take the <em>book</em> quiz * YA <em>book</em> discussion YALSA-BK readers have some <em>good</em> discussions about the <em>books</em> teens <em>are</em> reading <em>To</em> see comments about teen <em>books</em>, sign up at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.yahoo.com&#x2F;group&#x2F;adbooks&#x2F; Send mail <em>to</em>: Sarah Shelp with questions or comments about this web site.", "explanation": null, "document": "Prince Award\nBooks To Read\nYou may have played those games in which people answer a question such as, \u201cIf you could be an animal, what animal would you want to be?\u201d\u00a0 Well, here is a quiz that tells you which book you are based on the answers to 6 questions.\u00a0 Enjoy take the book quiz\nBook Lists:\n"}, {"score": 1321.7812, "uuid": "b24a2552-a65d-5167-87ba-b331b926d6ea", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0411wb-93-12373", "target_hostname": "www.citizenreader.com", "target_uri": "http://www.citizenreader.com/citizen/2010/04/why-read-business-books.html?no_prefetch=1", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 81, "title": "Citizen Reader: Why <em>read</em> <em>business</em> <em>books</em>?", "snippet": "Posted at 07:24 AM in <em>Business</em>, Favorites, Investigative, Reference | Permalink Listed below <em>are</em> links <em>to</em> weblogs that reference Why <em>read</em> <em>business</em> <em>books</em>?: I&#x27;m not sure I can bring myself <em>to</em> <em>read</em> <em>business</em> <em>books</em> yet.

Being a book lover, I have. I want 2009 to be a good year of reading and I want to fill it with the best books possible.\nThe problem is finding the best books to read. While there are many ways to find them, one good way is by looking at others\u2019 recommendations. Books that have been recommended again and again are likely to be good.\nOf course, the recommendations themselves should be of high quality. That\u2019s why I made a clear criterion for the recommendations I referred to: they must be popular enough to be listed in Delicious popular . Then what I did is going through all book recommendations that made Delicious popular in 2008 and count the number of recommendations each book in the lists get. In total, there are 14 lists I referred to that altogether recommend more than 400 books. Next, I picked only the books that have been mentioned at least twice and that reduces the number of books to 47.\nLooking at the list below, you will see that it contains books from many different genres. There are fictions and non-fictions. There are science, history, and self improvement books. That\u2019s the point of the list. You should read books from many different fields to enrich your life. You should diversify your readings. That way you can cross-pollinate ideas from one field to the other and come up with a lot of fresh ideas.\nWith that in mind, here are the 47 most recommended books in 2008 (sorted by the number of recommendations and then by alphabet):\n1984 by George Orwell (4 recommendations)\nGodel, Escher, Bach by Douglas R. Hofstadter (4 recommendations)\nThe Bible by multiple authors (4 recommendations)\nCatch-22 by Joseph Heller (3 recommendations)\n"}, {"score": 1313.6925, "uuid": "658d296d-dfce-5691-92a3-5e1944bf8f8e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0900tw-16-03410", "target_hostname": "www.kaizennotebook.com", "target_uri": "http://www.kaizennotebook.com/2012/03/dont-read-another-business-book.html", "page_rank": 1.2058099e-09, "spam_rank": 79, "title": "Kaizen Notebook: Don&#x27;t <em>Read</em> Another <em>Business</em> <em>Book</em>...", "snippet": "...until you <em>read</em> this one!
