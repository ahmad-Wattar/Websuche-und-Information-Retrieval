These are reading, listening, speaking and writing. The TOEFL is for a duration of four hours with maximum time spent in the Reading and Listening sections.\nStructure of Reading Test\nThis section has the maximum number of questions with about 36-70. The Reading test includes three to five academic reading passages followed by comprehension questions. The student\u2019s ability to understand and analyse the meaning of the passages is tested. The question types are similar to those that appeared in the computer based TOEFL. Students are expected to demonstrate that they have learned what they have read, either by filling out a table or completing a narrative summary. Choose a correct paraphrase of a reading. The new features that make the testing experience easier and even include a glossary and review feature.\nStructure of Listening Test\nThe listening section has anything from 34-51 questions. The test involves the student listening to two to three conversations on their headphones. The conversations may include two or more speakers in each. Apart from this, there are four to six lectures, which include classroom dialogue. A positive development is that test-takers can now write down notes while listening. Again, the questions are similar to those that appeared in the TOEFL CBT. There will be a few new question types that measure ability to understand a speaker\u2019s attitude or meaning.\nStructure of Speaking Test\nThe speaking test consists of a total of six tasks. Two of the tasks are independent tasks about familiar topics. The test taker is required to state, explain and support their response using personal knowledge and experience.\nTwo tasks are based on Reading and Listening material. These tasks include a short reading passage and a short talk. The questions require test takers to answer using the information provided in the reading and the listening material. One question is based on a campus-related situation, and the other is based on academic classroom material. Again, test takers can take notes and use the information to shape their responses.\nThe remaining two tasks are based on Listening material, including a short lecture or conversation. The questions require test takers to summarise key ideas from the talks in the responses.\nTest-takers are judged on the basis of the following criteria:\n1. Topic development: The student\u2019s ability to understand the matter and draw connections between topics as well as their capability to convey relevant information.\n2. Delivery: The ability to use clear, smooth, sustained speech.\n3. Language use: Trained evaluators pay attention to the use of correct grammar and vocabulary. Close notice is paid to the response of logical answers.\nThe six tasks in the Speaking section are rated by at least two human scorers on a scale of 0-4. The six individual scores are averaged to arrive at an aggregate value. This aggregate is converted to the scale of 0 to 30.\nStructure of Writing Test\nThe Writing test consists of a total of two tasks to be completed by the test taker. The first task could be a reading, listening or writing one \u2014 an academic reading followed by a lecture. Test takers must answer a question discussing the key points in the lecture and explain how they relate to those in the reading passage. The reading passage appears first, and then it is removed from the screen during the lecture. Test takers can view the passage again while responding to the question. The second task is an independent task about a familiar topic. Test takers must state their response and support it with information from personal knowledge and experience.\nTrained evaluators measure the ability to understand the material, as well as write clearly, accurately and in an organized manner. The two tasks are scored by at least two human scorers from 0 to 5 and then the raw scores are totaled/averaged before scaling them to the range of 0 to 30.\nTOEFL score\nEach of the four sections of TOEFL iBT is scored on a scale of 0 to 30. The sectional scores are then added to arrive at a total score of 0 to 120. Each score corresponds to a percentile ranking. This displays how an individual\u2019s score compares with that of other students answering the test.\nThe maximum score of 120 has a percentile of 100. Students will also receive information of what the numeric scores mean in terms of language skills and proficiency (high/medium/low), along with performance feedback including suggestions for improvement.\n"}, {"score": 2085.8523, "uuid": "5276f541-a553-5c69-a2a3-faf2205a7794", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-26-31981", "target_hostname": "www.koolkareers.com", "target_uri": "http://www.koolkareers.com/careers/category/all-about-toefl-ielts/page/4/", "page_rank": 1.1788212e-09, "spam_rank": 67, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em> &amp; <em>IELTS</em> | KoolKareers.com - Part 4", "snippet": "In general, grammar scores go up faster than <em>the</em> scores on any other section.

Nearly 2400 education institutes in the United States and Canada require TOEFL scores from each applicant. The test is also used by institutions in other countries where English is the language of Instruction. The TOEFL tests the ability to understand North American English.\nWhy Take the TOEFL Test?\nMost people take the TOEFL test as a prerequisite for admission into colleges and universities where English is used or required. In addition, many government, licensing, and certification agencies and exchange and scholarship programs use TOEFL scores to evaluate the English proficiency of people for whom English is not their native language.\nWho makes the TOEFL Test?\nThe TOEFL Test is created and produced by the Educational Testing Service.\nWho Should Take the TOEFL Test?\nNon-native English speakers at the 11th-grade level or above should take the TOEFL test to provide evidence of their English proficiency before beginning academic work. The test content is considered too difficult for students below 11th grade.\nHow many kinds of TOEFL Tests are there?\nThere are currently 3 kinds of TOEFL tests being used around the world:\nThe IBT: the Internet Based TOEFL Test (IBT) is currently being used in the U.S., France, Italy, Germany, and Canada\u2026and will soon appear in many other countries. Selected cities in North Africa, the Middle East, Eurasia, Europe and the Americas will offer the IBT for the first time on March 25, 2006. Check: ets.org/toefl for details. In May, 2006, selected test centers in Japan and Korea will begin to offer the IBT. In August, 2006, the IBT will be given in China.\nThe CBT: the Computer-Based TOEFL (CBT) is still being used in some countries such as Japan and Korea\u2013and will still be used even after the IBT is administered in selected cities. However, this test will be completely phased out by the end of 2006 according to ETS.\nThe PBT: the Paper and Pencil TOEFL, also called the Institutional TOEFL. This test is still being used by English language institutions around the world. However, universities and colleges normally do not accept this test for admission unless it is used in a local context (in other words, if the English language institution is located in close proximity to a university or college, then the university or college might accept it for admission). There are no plans to phase out this test.\nWhich kind of TOEFL Test do I need to take?\nThe student must ask the educational institution which type of TOEFL Test it accepts. Different universities accept different TOEFL tests.\nWhich TOEFL Test is the easier: the IBT, the CBT, or the PBT?\nETS has tried very hard to make the tests equally difficult. Some students feel that the IBT is more difficult because it contains more difficult reading and listening tasks\u2013and it contains a Speaking Section. Some students feel that the PBT is easier because it does not always contain a writing section\u2013and it contains a grammar section. Different students will have different reactions to the different tests.\nWhat are the Topics covered under TOEFL?\nGrammar, Reading, Vocabulary, Listening comp, Writing and targeted TOEFL test taking skills and strategies.\n- English Language training through American films.\n- University Admission Guidance, Exercises and information.\n- Review of idiomatic expressions and responses that they are likely to encounter in American campuses and in professional settings.\n- From the start, students focus on all the important components of the TOEFL test: Grammar, Reading, Vocab, Listening comp, Writing an essay and targeted. TOEFL test skills and strategies.\n- Practice test sessions are given monthly under \u201creal test\u201d conditions (Virtual Reality)\nIndividualized profile for learning style.\n- Developing a personalized structured self-study plan.\nWho administers the TOEFL test?\nThe TOEFL test is developed and administered by the US-based \u201cEducational Testing Service\u201d (ETS). This implies that ETS sets the questions, conducts the test, and sends each examinee the score report. For the conduct of the test, ETS has appointed Testing Agencies in various countries, which act as franchisee for ETS. In India, this agency is the \u201cPrometric Testing Services Pvt. Ltd\u201d which administers the test at 9 centers in the country: Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, New Delhi, and Trivandrum.\nHow to Apply?\nObtain the \u201cTOEFL Information Bulletin\u201d available free with Prometric Testing Services and USEFI. The Test Scheduling Form comes with the bulletin. There are three ways to register:\nRegistering by Phone: You may call up Prometric office until 12:00 noon to register. Make sure to call at least THREE BUSINESS DAYS before the test date.\nRegistering by Fax: If registering by fax, you must send your fax at lest SEVEN DAYS prior to your first choice of a test day.\nRegistering by Mail/Courier: Fill in the form, get the draft made (if you are not paying by credit card), and submit these to the Prometric Centre either by hand or by registered post/courier. You must send the documents at least THREE WEEKS before your choice of a test day.\nWhere Can People Take the Test?\nThe TOEFL test is offered in 180 countries around the world at institutional locations, such as colleges and universities testing centers operated by Prometric, a division of Thomson Learning. In areas where access to computer-based testing or Internet-based testing is limited, a paper-based version of the test is administered on specific dates. The paper-based TOEFL test is generally offered at institutional locations such as colleges and universities.\nWhat are the materials Required on the Test Day?\nYou are required to bring your valid passport on the day of your exam. This is mandatory. Some signature bearing identification, i.e., Driving License, Notarized identification. Confirmation letter or Number\nWho Accepts TOEFL Scores?\nMore than 6,000 colleges, universities, and licensing agencies in 110 countries accept TOEFL scores.\nHow can I get a copy of the TOEFL Bulletin?\nCheck the Bulletin section of our website or you can download it or order it from the Official TOEFL Web Site: You can download a free copy of the information bulletin at the official TOEFL web site.\nFor how long is my TOEFL score valid?\nYour TOEFL score is valid for only two years. In other words, two years after you take your TOEFL, your score will be deleted from the official TOEFL database, and TOEFL will not send you another report of your score. If you still have a copy of your original score, you can ask the university whether they will accept it, but most universities will not accept a copy from you; they require a score sent directly from TOEFL.\nWhat is a good score on the TOEFL?\nThe highest score on the paper TOEFL is 677. The highest score on the computer TOEFL is 300. Most people now still use the paper TOEFL scores, even though most students take the computer TOEFL. The score that you need depends on the university that you want to go to; you will need to contact the university to find out. In general, however, the score requirements range from 133 to 250 (CBT scoring) or 450 to 600 (PBT scoring). Some universities will tell you that they don\u2019t have a minimum requirement; usually these universities are the best ones, such as Stanford or Harvard. However, even though they don\u2019t have a \u201crequirement,\u201d most of the people who go to these universities have TOEFL scores from 267 to 300.\nWhat score do I need on the TOEFL?\nThe highest TOEFL score that you will need is probably about 630. The lowest TOEFL score that you will need is probably about 450. In general, better universities require higher TOEFL scores and worse schools require lower TOEFL scores. Some schools require no TOEFL score, but, be careful! These schools are usually not good schools!\nHow can I raise my score on the TOEFL?\nSome people can raise their scores by speaking and watching television and American movies, other people can raise their scores by studying the TOEFL. The answer really depends on the student.\nWhat is the best way to raise my TOEFL score quickly?\nIn general, grammar scores go up faster than the scores on any other section.\nDo I have to take the computer TOEFL or the paper TOEFL?\nIn every country except China, you will probably have to take the computer test. However, TOEFL has closed many CBT test centers in the last few years and is giving the paper-based TOEFL instead. Again, check the Official TOEFL web site to be sure.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the computer TOEFL and the paper TOEFL?\nThere are many differences between the CBT TOEFL and the paper TOEFL. The biggest difference between the CBT TOEFL and the paper TOEFL is that the CBT TOEFL requires an essay. Also, the CBT TOEFL has some new question types that we have not seen before on the paper TOEFL.\nWhich TOEFL is easier? The computer TOEFL or the paper TOEFL?\nMost people agree: the paper TOEFL is much easier than the CBT TOEFL. For example, the listening on the CBT TOEFL is much harder than the listening on the paper TOEFL and the CBT TOEFL has an essay that you have to write. However, everybody is different, and you may find the CBT TOEFL easier.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Institutional TOEFL and the International TOEFL?\nSome people have heard about the \u201cinstitutional TOEFL.\u201d The Institutional TOEFL is the TOEFL that is given by an \u201cinstitution\u201d (such as a company or a language school) so that they can measure the English level of the people who take the test. The score you receive from this test is NOT accepted by every university in the world. However, many colleges will accept a TOEFL score from the Institutional TOEFL. If you want your TOEFL score to be accepted at every university in the world, then you need to take the International TOEFL.\nCan I still take the paper TOEFL instead of the computer TOEFL?\nFor most schools, the answer is \u201cNO.\u201d However, some schools think that the price of the nternational TOEFL is too high (about US $130) and will still accept scores from the Institutional TOEFL, which is given on paper. You will have to ask the school that you want to attend to find out whether they will accept the institutional TOEFL or not. If schools accept the institutional TOEFL, you will have to find a place to take it. However, remember, these scores are NOT accepted by most schools and are not considered official scores.\nShould I type or handwrite the essay for the computer TOEFL?\nThe easy answer is this: you should type your TOEFL essay if you can! However, if you cannot type very fast, you should handwrite your TOEFL essay. If you type your TOEFL essay, you should receive your TOEFL score within two weeks. If you handwrite your TOEFL essay, it might take up to five weeks to receive your TOEFL score.\nPage 4 of 6 \u00ab First ... \u00ab 2 3 4 5 6 \u00bb\nSearch\n"}, {"score": 2161.8726, "uuid": "555e47ec-a98d-53e7-a872-74a329dd99b0", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201tw-21-11493", "target_hostname": "www.genietalks.com", "target_uri": "http://www.genietalks.com/blog/toefl-or-ielts-which-is-better/", "page_rank": 1.4409323e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em> <em>or</em> <em>IELTS</em> - Which is Better? | Genie Talks", "snippet": "While you <em>should</em> check with <em>the</em> specific university you want to apply to, in general any school in <em>the</em> US, <em>the</em> UK, Australia <em>or</em> New Zealand will <em>take</em> either test score.

And TOEFL and IELTS are the two biggest standardized tests of the English language. One of the most frequent questions I hear is which test is easier or which test is better. The answer depends on what kinds of tests you excel at, as well as where you plan to apply. This article breaks down the differences between the two tests so that you can make your own decision.\nAdmissions\nThe IELTS test is administrated by the British Councils, the University of Cambridge, and IELTS Australia . That is to say, it is associated with the British government and traditionally was used by British universities , as well as New Zealand and Australian universities to determine the language capability of foreign students. TOEFL is administered by ETS, a US-based non-profit and is used widely by American and Canadian universities . However, these days, in order to make it easy on international students, universities all over the world take both TOEFL and IELTS. While you should check with the specific university you want to apply to, in general any school in the US, the UK, Australia or New Zealand will take either test score. So that\u2019s one worry off your mind. Pick the test you think will be easier for you to complete. To do that, you probably need to know the structure of each exam.\nStructure of the TOEFL\nAs of last year, official TOEFL is almost universally given in the iBT (Internet Based Testing) format. It consists of four sections:\nReading\nThe TOEFL Reading section asks you to read 4-6 passages of university level and to answer multiple-choice questions about them (multiple-choice means you choose the answer from provided options). Questions test you on comprehension of the text, main ideas, important details, vocabulary, inferring, rhetorical devices and style.\nListening\nThe Listening Section presents long 2-3 conversations and 4-6 lectures. The situations are always related to university life i.e. a conversation between a student and a librarian about finding research materials or a lecture from a history class. The questions are multiple choice and ask you about important details, inferences, tone, and vocabulary. The conversations and lectures are very natural and include informal English, interruptions, filler noises like \u201cuh\u201d or \u201cUhm.\u201d\nSpeaking\nThe Speaking section is recorded. You will speak into a microphone and a grader will listen to your answers at a later date and grade you. Two questions will be on familiar topics and ask you to give your opinion and/or describe something familiar to you, like your town or your favorite teacher. Two questions will ask you to summarize information from a text and a conversation\u2013and may ask your opinion as well. Two questions will ask you to summarize information from a short conversation. Again, the topics of the conversations are always university-related.\nWriting\nFinally, there are two short essays on the TOEFL . One will ask you to write your opinion on a broad topic, such as whether it is better to live in the country or the city. One will ask you to summarize information from a text and a lecture\u2013often the two will disagree with each other and you will need to either compare and contrast, or synthesize conflicting information.\nIELTS Structure\nThe IELTS contains the same 4 sections, Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing, but the format is very different.\nReading\nThe reading section of the IELTS gives you 3 texts, which may be from academic textbooks or from a newspaper or magazine\u2013but all at the level of a university student. One will always be an opinion piece\u2013i.e. a text arguing for one point of view. The variety of questions on the IELTS is quite broad, and not every text will have every question type. One question type asks you to match headings to paragraphs in the text. You may be asked to complete a summary of the passage using words from the text. Or you may have to fill in a table or chart or picture with words from the text. There may be multiple-choice questions that ask you about key details. One of the hardest question types presents statements and asks you whether these statements are true, false or not included in the text. You may also be asked to match words and ideas. Finally, some questions are short-answer but the answers will be taken directly from the text itself.\nSome questions come before the text and may not require careful reading to answer. Others come after the text and may expect you to have read the text thoroughly.\nListening\nThe IELTS has four listening sections. The first is a \u201ctransactional conversation\u201d in which someone may be applying for something (a driver\u2019s license, a library card) or asking for information (say calling for more details about an advertisement or a hotel). The second section is an informational lecture of some kind, possibly a dean explaining the rules of the university. Third is a conversation in an academic context and the final section will be an academic lecture. For all sections you may be asked to fill out a summary, fill in a table, answer multiple-choice questions, label a diagram or picture, or classify information into different categories. You will be expected to fill out answers as you listen.\nWriting\nThere are two writing tasks on the academic IELTS. The first asks you to summarize a table or chart in about 300 words. You will have to identify important information, compare and contrast different figures or maybe describe a process. The second task asks you to present your opinion on a statement about a fairly open topic such as: \u201cWomen should look after children and not work\u201d or \u201cToo many people are moving to cities and rural areas are suffering.\u201d\nSpeaking\nFinally, the speaking section will be held on a different day from the rest of the test and in the presence of a trained interviewer. The questions are the same for all examinees but some parts may be more in the form of a conversation than a monologue. The first part of the test will be a brief introductory conversation followed by some short questions about familiar topics. The interviewer may ask your name, your job, what kinds of sports you like, what your daily routine is, and so on. In the second part, you will be given a card with a topic and a few specific questions to address. You will have to speak for two minutes on this topic, which may be about your daily routine, the last time you went to the movies, your favorite part of the world or a similar familiar topic. In the last section, the interviewer will ask you to discuss a more abstract side of the topic in part 2\u2013why do people prefer daily routines? Why do people like the movies? How does travel affect local life?\nWhich is Better for Me?\nSo now you have some understanding of what each test involves, but you might be wondering which is better for you. Maybe in reading about the structure, you thought, \u201cWow TOEFL sounds so easy,\u201d or, \u201cOh the IELTS sounds like it\u2019s kind of fun!\u201d That might be a good sign that one test will be easier for you than the other. More concretely, there are a couple of key differences between the tests.\nBritish versus American English\nWhile both the UK and the US accept both tests, and while British English and American English are not as different as some think, the fact of the matter is the IELTS tends to use British English and the TOEFL uses exclusively American English. On the IELTS, this difference will have a larger effect because spelling counts, and that is one area where Britain and the US do not always see eye-to-eye. Obviously if you have problems with the British accent (and the test may include a wide variety of accents, including Australian, New Zealand, Irish and Scottish). On the other hand, American accents may throw you off. Certain terms are also different and you don\u2019t want to waste time in your speaking test asking what a flat or a lorry is. So whether you are used to British or American English is certainly a factor. If you are more comfortable with US English, the TOEFL is a good bet but if you are used to British English and accents, you\u2019ll do better on the IELTS.\nMultiple choice versus Copying Down\nFor the reading and listening sections, TOEFL gives you multiple-choice questions, whereas IELTS generally expects you to copy down words from the text or the conversation word-for-word. Multiple-choice questions will tend to be require slightly better abstract thinking, but the IELTS favors people who have good memories and think more concretely. The good thing about multiple-choice is that it is easy to pick out wrong answers, whereas the good thing about copying down is that the answer is sitting there in the text. You just have to find it and repeat it. So, concrete thinkers will tend to do better on the IELTS and abstract thinkers will tend to excel on the TOEFL .\nPredictable or Different Every Time\nOf course, the TOEFL is also more predictable than the IELTS. The IELTS throws lots of different question types at you, and the instructions are often slightly different every time. That makes it harder to prepare for. The TOEFL , on the other hand, is pretty much the same test every time\u2013pick A, B, C, D, or E. On the other hand, the IELTS certainly keeps you on your toes and that can keep you more alert.\nSpeaking to a Person or a Computer?\nAnother large difference is in how the speaking section is carried out. For some people, it\u2019s very relaxing to just record your answers into a computer because it feels like no one is listening. You just try your best and forget about it until you get your grades. Because the IELTS test is done in an interview format with a native speaker present, you might get nervous or feel you are being judged. And they take notes: Oh God, did he write down something good or something bad? On the other hand, you might feel more relaxed in a conversation, with a person there to explain if you don\u2019t understand a question, or simply having a face to look at, instead of a computer screen. Getting feedback from a native speaker can be helpful too, in order to correct mistakes and improve during the test. So it depends on what you are more comfortable with. If you like talking to people, the IELTS is a better bet. If you just want to be alone and not feel judged, the TOEFL will be more comfortable for you.\nHolistic versus Criteria\nFinally, the speaking and writing sections of the TOEFL are graded holistically. The grader gives you a score based on the overall quality of the essay, including vocabulary, logic, style, and grammar. The IELTS by contrast is marked by individual criteria and you are scored individually for grammar, word choice, fluency, logic, cohesion, and a dozen other criteria. In other words, if you write well but have a lot of small grammar mistakes, your TOEFL score might be quite good because graders will ignore small mistakes if the overall essay is logical and detailed. The IELTS will not overlook bad grammar. On the other hand, if your grammar and vocabulary are strong but you have trouble expressing your opinion or organizing an essay, you could end up with a low TOEFL score but the IELTS will give you good marks for language use. So while it may sound like the IELTS is much tougher since it grades you on everything, in fact you can get quite a good score if you are strong in a number of areas. The TOEFL emphasizes the ability to put together a logical and detailed argument (or summary) and looks at clarity, word choice, and style above all. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable writing essays but you think you have excellent grammar and vocabulary and overall are a decent writer, the IELTS will probably be easier for you.\nI hope this essay was helpful in making your choice. In any case, I recommend you go to the websites of IELTS and TOEFL and get some more detail on each test, and also try out some practice problems on your own.\nSource: AssociatedContent\n"}, {"score": 2136.303, "uuid": "93b3212c-6103-5e10-840b-56325ff187f3", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1300tw-88-08002", "target_hostname": "www.montyenglish.co.uk", "target_uri": "http://www.montyenglish.co.uk/montyblog/?p=429", "page_rank": 1.2958374e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em>, <em>IELTS</em> <em>or</em> Cambridge ESOL? | Monty English Language Blog", "snippet": "<em>The</em> comparison between <em>IELTS</em> and iBT <em>TOEFL</em> scores is based on similar unofficial tables on a number of leading UK university web sites as quoted on <em>the</em> Oxford School of English website.

It is an admission requirement for non-native English speakers at North American universities and is sometimes accepted by universities in other English-speaking universities instead of IELTS. For the 2012 Directory of universities accepting TOEFL, click here .\nThere are two different tests, the Internet-Based test (iBT) and the paper based test (PBT). The Internet Based test is gradually replacing the paper based test other two as more and more centres convert, it has already replaced the old Computer Based Test (CBT).\nThe iBT version of the TOEFL test is divided into Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing and scored as follows. Speaking is initially given a score of 0 to 4, and writing is initially given a score of 0 to 5 these are then converted to scaled scores of 0 to 30. The other two sections are marked between 0 and 30. The scaled scores from the four sections are added together to determine the overall score between 0 and 120 points.\nThe Paper Based Test (PBT) is based on three subscores: Listening (31\u201368), Structure (31\u201368), and Reading (31\u201367). The scores received are not the percentage of correct answers as the figures are adjusted to reflect the fact that some tests are more difficult than others. The final score ranges between 310 and 677. The Writing section, referred to as the Test of Written English (TWE), is reported separately on a scale of 0\u20136.\nIELTS (International English Language Testing System)\nIELTS is jointly managed by University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations, the British Council and IDP Education Australia. It can be taken at over 500 centres worldwide. It is sometimes accepted in North America though the TOEFL exam is preferred. For a searchable database of universities that accept IELTS, click here .\nThere are two versions of the IELTS: the Academic version and the General Training version. The Academic version is used by universities and for overseas doctors and nurses whilst the General Training is aimed at those seeking to migrate.\nCandidates are assessed on the four skills : Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. The Reading and Writing Modules are different depending on whether the candidate is taking the Academic or General Training versions of the Test but the Speaking and Listening modules are the same..They are given a score between 0 (No knowledge) and 9 (Expert User) for each of these skill areas and then an average overall score is calculated.\nIt is generally accepted that the reading and writing tests for the Academic version are more difficult than those for the General Training version, as they are more cognitively demanding.\nCambridge Exams\nYou can take Cambridge ESOL exams at authorised centres all over the world. There are over 2,000 centres in 130 countries. Cambridge Exams are primarily recognised by employers but for a searchable database of universities that accept the Cambridge Exams, click here.\nThe five exams, known as the \u201cmain suite\u201d are: KET ( Key English Test ), PET ( Preliminary English Test ), FCE ( First Certificate in English ), CAE ( Certificate in Advanced English ) and CPE ( Certificate of Proficiency in English ).\nThe best known Cambridge Exams are FCE, CAE and CPE. KET and PET are not commonly taken as they aren\u2019t in much demand from employers. FCE corresponds to an Upper Intermediate level of English whilst CAE is as the name suggests an Advanced level, CPE is beyond the Advanced level and close to a native speaker\u2019s command of the language. CPE is usually only taken by those looking to become translators or English teachers.\nThe exams are divided into Reading, Writing, Use of English, Listening and Speaking papers. Grades are awarded between A and E, grades A to C are considered to be pass grades.\nEquivalences\nHere is a table that shows the rough equivalents between the different exams.\niBT TOEFL\n"}, {"score": 2082.0757, "uuid": "3e4b5a3b-a2e4-57ff-9961-9874941fda93", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0814wb-98-18810", "target_hostname": "www.i-studentadvisor.com", "target_uri": "http://www.i-studentadvisor.com/blog/education/international-students/ielts-vs-toefl-which-is-better/", "page_rank": 1.3050675e-09, "spam_rank": 93, "title": "<em>IELTS</em> vs <em>TOEFL</em>: WHICH IS BETTER? | <em>i</em>-studentadvisor blog", "snippet": "<em>I</em> am really a poor person, help me please! my teacher said if <em>I</em> would study in England, <em>I</em> <em>should</em> <em>take</em> <em>IELTS</em>,but if <em>I</em> would study in USA <em>i</em> <em>should</em> <em>take</em> <em>TOEFL</em>. is my teacher right? and pleas, would you recommend what to choose.

For TOEFL the speaking test consists of six questions which you answer into a microphone.

The question of which is easier is largely irrelevant as both tests will grade you accurately according to your level of English.

The pros and cons brought up by this left year should be careful considered before one student decides her future. In my opinions, this situation provides more advantages than disadvantages.\nFirst of all, going to university is a big decision one has to make when graduating from high school. Investing in higher education reveals many problems: financial insufficient, time management, ability and most important which major to choose. Gap years will help anyone who still confuses about whether or not to study in university makes her mind up. During the gap years, she can work or travelling, while finding her true ambition. Working in a specific field, for example, teaching poor children in volunteer work, make her mature, thinking deeply about the future job she desire to work. Another advantage is travelling through other land, exposing to diversification of culture and work resources may lead to other higher purpose which can not be find out if staying at home passively. In conclude, years off from high school confirm one's future position, in university, in which major or in other working field.\nSecondly, there are some disadvantages of gap year as a whole: more money and time spent as well as the opportunity cost. One year without attending to university or in any other work place means one year late in comparison with normal students. One taking gap years has to accept either the living cost or the time consumed, while other friends study and graduate earlier than her. It also about the opportunity cost: one year travelling makes no money; even she can spend more than amount should have been invested to education. That is why gap years are not always the best choice, especially with who have a clear goals and strategies for future.\nIn summary, the advantages and disadvantages of gap years can be seen clearly, although the good ones are more than the bad ones. Even one takes gap years or not; she should define what she wants to do when staying in the high school.\nThank you for reading and correcting my writing.\nNgoc Mai Chu\nPosts: 7\nEdited by: chelseazcl \u00a0Feb\u00a02,\u00a02012,\u00a002:45am #2\nThe pros and cons brought up by this left year should be careful considered before one student decides\nher\ntheir future.\nFirst of all,\nGoing to university is a big decision one has to make when graduating from high school.

Got a band of 8.5. \u0095 How to defeat <em>the</em> time constraints in <em>IELTS</em> test!", "explanation": null, "document": "The test\nIf candidates are most unhappy about any section of the IELTS,it is the reading component.\nThis is a general opinion among most of us that, for reading the allotted time is never enough.And that exactly is the challenge here.With practice most of the candidates come out with flying colors and am sure,you will be no exception to this.\nThe test basically consists of 3 Passages, each one with its own set of questions to answer. Total number of questions are usually 40. The aim is to answer these 40 questions in a time limit of 60 minutes.\nQuestions are all based on the passage,which you gotta read before attempting the questions.\nYou are expected to spend not more than 20 minutes over each passage.\nYou can mark on the question paper, but you are not given any extra time to transfer the answers to the answer sheet towards the end of the test(as it is given in listening).It is always advisable to answer directly in the answer sheet and save yourself the mess towards the end of the exam.\nThe passage length usually vary from 700-1000 words;for general training it can be shorter.These are usually chosen from Newspapers and Articles of general interests ,intended to be read and understood by common population(not specialist groups).So you can relax yourself on these aspects.\nThe difficulty levels usually increase as you move ahead with the passages,viz, Passage 3 is usually more difficult than Passage 1 or Passage 2. So keep this in mind when you practise. Don\u0092t get euphoric and loose concentration if u finish the 1st Passage in 12-15 minutes. Move ahead to next passage immediately.You might need that extra 5 minute for the upcoming difficult passages.\nAlways keep some time in hand to go through your answers towards the end of the test.\nCheck:\n-if you have made any spelling or singular/plural mistakes,\n-that you have not messed up with serial numbers of the answers,\n-that you have followed the instructions carefully and not written 4 words where you were supposed to write \u0093NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS\u0094.\n-that the incomplete sentences in the question paper make grammatical sense when read complete with your answers.\n-that the answers you have written are legible and examiner will not misinterpret it to be some other word.\nThere are no negative marks and I suggest you attempt all the questions.\nHowever don\u0092t spend much time over one question.If u get stuck,make your best guess and move ahead.If have time left at the end of the test,you can always come back to this question.\nThe practise\nAgain, I found \u0091How To Prepare for IELTS\u0092, very useful for reading practice.\nIt has real good collection of paragraphs for practice and the difficult level is so set that most of us found the real exam much easier than those given in this book.\nTime yourself when u practice reading.This is most important.\nBut don\u0092t leave half your mind on your watch.You need to be fully concentrated on the passage.Start a stop watch and let it take care of time while you give yourself totally to the passage and the related questions.\nCheck at the end of each passage, how much time u spent over the entire task. This will tell you if you need to speed up or your speed is just as accurate as you need.\nCollect editorials from your daily newspaper to give yourself a thorough practice.\nThere are 2 main methods to practice efficient reading :\na)Skimming\nb)Scanning\nSkimming\nSkimming is just moving your eyes over the entire paragraph and get a feel/general idea of the text.\nDuring skimming,note :\n-The main heading of the paragraph - prepare your mind for what exactly the extract going to talk on.\n-Check if there are there any subheadings\n-Is the para divided into \u0093Labeled\u0094 sub sections :This is an important point to note here.\nIf the entire para is divided into sub sections which are labeled, say, Section I,Section II, etc. Turn the page and have a look at the questions. Is there a set of questions which asks to match Paragraph Headings? If yes,write down your own \u0091HEADINGS\u0092 for each section as you read.This will save a lot of your time when you start answering later.\nIf there are no such questions, you are saved from the time consuming task of giving headings.\nSmile and move ahead with the next step.\nSpend not more than 1-2 minutes in skimming.\nScanning :\nThis is the next step.....here you actually start reading the topic.Remember that you have to be fast and that doesn\u0092t mean that you keep looking at your watch and get nervous.\nConcentrate on totally on the passage.With a pencil ,as a guide to ur eyes, move ahead with the passage and mark the important points.\nMarking the important points/key word is the talent you have to practice and improve upon.Remember the aim of marking isn\u0092t to just MARK ---- You should be able to track down to this particular \u0091marked\u0092 area when you are solving the questions.\nYou don\u0092t need to read just everything,but its important that you understand the basic idea.\nNote down the dates mentioned,names (of speakers,places,etc), any other specific info (like some Organisation or some NAMED meeting )\nIf a sentence gives u a long list of lots of things,just mark the key word (of what the list is about).Don\u0092t mark all the things in the list.You don\u0092t even need to read that long list.If a question is based on this,you will always be able to locate the list and answer correctly without wasting much time in marking everything or reading everything.\nThis is what you have to train yourself in while you practice : What to read ,What not to read,What to mark,What not to mark!!!\nYou have 20 minutes for each passage.Spend around 5-8 minutes in skimming/scanning and the rest you have to spend in the most important part,which is going to fetch you marks - ANSWERING!!!\nDon\u0092t spend too much time on one question.You have more questions to answer.Make the nearest guess and move ahead.\nDuring the entire reading process, don\u0092t forget that you are reading so that you will be able to locate the answers to the questions which follow.\nRemember that all the answers are in the passage given,so if u read intelligently you will be able to answer all of them.\nLook for the key words in the questions.If you have scanned the text efficiently,you may easily locate where exactly it was discussed in the para.\nAlways go back to the para and read the concerned sentences before answering.Never answer without referring back to the para.\nTypes Of Questions\n1.Multiple choice questions :\nThere are three types of multiple choice questions in the IELTS reading exam.\nFor these questions you may be given the start of a sentence which you have to complete with one out of four choices.\nOr you may be presented with a question and asked to find two, three or four items in a list of answers.\nYou could be asked to identify facts or opinions in the texts.\nMultiple choice questions can test both your global understanding of the text or ask you for specific information.\n2.Short Answer questions\nThere are two types of short answer questions in the IELTS reading exam.\nType 1. Questions\nType 2. Lists\nThese questions will usually tell you to write your answers in NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS.\nRead the instructions carefully.It varies with every exam and every para.\n3. Sentence completion questions\nThere are two types of sentence completion questions in the reading exam.\nType 1 asks you to complete sentences with words from the reading passage.\nType 2.asks you to complete sentences with words given in the list provided with the question.\nread carefully before you answer.\n4. Notes/table/form/summary/flow chart/diagram\ncompletion questions\nThis is similar to sentence completion type questions,just that in the form of diagram or tables.\nYou may be required to pick the words from the reading passage or from the list of given words.\nRead the instructions carefully, read the headings of the table and note if the table runs horizontally or vertically.\n5.Yes/No Not given or True/False Not given\nThis is the trickiest set of questions.\nAnswering this depends on how well you understood the passage.\nIf the question asks about a statement which is clearly given in the passage ,there is no confusion.Your answer is YES/TRUE.\nIf the question asks about a statement which clearly contradicts the idea given in the passage,your answer is NO/FalSE. Remember,for an answer should be NO/FALSE the idea should have been mentioned in the passage.\nIf the idea is not metioned- its NOT GIVEN.\nEasily said than done!\nThe real situation isn\u0092t as easy as it appears in the sentences above.You need to be careful in recognising what is NOT given and what is given but different from what asked in the question.\nKnow that the statements in the questions is usually paraphrased from what is given in the passage.So read carefully and understand what the statement says.\nLook carefully if the question says, \u0091The new rule is implemented....\u0092 and the paragraph says, \u0091The new rule may be implemented...\u0092 This implies that the passage only says that the rule may be implemented.It doesn\u0092t say that it IS implemented.\nThe significance is,though it all looks the same and in hurry you may answer this as YES,in truth the answer should be NOT GIVEN.\nLearn to identify these sort of differences when you practice.\n5.Giving headings\nYou may be asked to give heading to the entire paragraph,or to the different subsections.\nIf you have given your own headings while u were scanning the passage,the task becomes real easy for you.\nA list of headings is usually given,be careful and choose the most likely match as more than one match may look like giving the same idea in the sub section.\nThis one, I personally found to be the most time consuming.\n6.Completing a paragraph\nAn incomplete para will be given and you will be required to complete it by filling up with words from the passage or the given list of words.\nRead the instructions carefully.\nThey may mention that the \u0093FOLLOWING PARA IS RELATED TO THE 1st PART of THE PASSAGE\u0094 This means that you can easily locate and concentrate on the 1st part,no need to go thru the entire passage searching for proper words.\nLook for key words.Answers are usually around these key words.\nIf the answer you have chosen doesn\u0092t makes a grammatically correct sentence,most probably it\u0092s a wrong catch.\nThe test day\nCheck that you filled in the personal details right in the answer sheet.\nCkeck that you are writing in the part of answersheet meant for reading (usually,one side of the answer sheet is meant for LISTENING and the other side for READING - Make sure you are not messing up with the 2 sides).\nIf you have opted for Pen & Pencil type of exam,most centers accept ONLY pencil for the listening and reading modules.Find this out clearly before making any errors.\nStart with the 1st passage.\nRead the instructions carefully.\nNote whether there are any set of questions appearing before the passage starts. Don\u0092t miss these questions.Make sure that you come back to these questions once you finish reading the passage.\nStart skimming.\nNote the main heading,the sub headings and quickly move your eyes over the questions. Any \u0091choose headings\u0092 questions....? If yes,make sure you write your own headings as u go through each paragraph in the passage.\nMark the key words intelligently.\nConcentrate only on the passage.Let your watch take care of time.\nIf you are honestly reading,u will be always ahead of time,so don\u0092t worry.\nStart answering questions immediately as you finish.\nAlways note the question number when u write down the answer.Don\u0092t mess up with the serial numbers.Also,this way you will be immediately aware of any questions you have missed.\nDon\u0092t spend too much time on any one question.Make your best guess and move ahead.You can always come back to it if have time left towards the end.\nThere is no penalty for wrong answers.\nMake sure that you are not making any spelling singular/plural mistakes, that your handwriting is legible,that you are not exceeding the number of the words required for the answer.\nRead carefully if the questions wants answer from the passage or the options are given.\nFor sentence completion and paragraph completion, read the entire sentence/paragraph once before moving ahead to next question. Is all that grammatically correct? If not, search for a better match.\nAbove all,don\u0092t panic! Remember that all the answers are there in front of you.\nSkill is just to locate them accurately with least time consumption.\nMove to the next passage immediately after you finish the 1st.Remember your job isn\u0092t complete till the last question of the 3rd passage.\nLook at your watch after you finish each passage.

You <em>should</em> refrain from using such words which show your opinion, like, &quot;<em>I</em> think,&quot; etc.", "explanation": null, "document": "IELTS alerts\nThe Writing Component of IELTS is divided in two separate tasks.\nTask I deals with report writing on information provided to you in the form of diagram, flow chart or graphs.\nTask II is like an essay writing either in form of argument or opinion.\nThe Test\nTotal duration of the writing component is 60 minutes and because the Task II carries more weightage, it is always advisable to break up your allotted time accordingly.\nIts always advised that you break up the total allotted 60 minutes in 20 : 40 proportion, i.e. 20 minutes for the Task I and 40 minutes for Task II.\nHowever, its always wise to 1st practice over this and see if this suits you or you need some modification in the same.\nAgain, because Task II is more time consuming and has more impact on your final score, its advisable to start with the Task II 1st and come to Task I later. However, again tailor this advise according to what suits you the best.\nIn Task I, data or information is provided to you in the form of diagram, flow chart, graphs or just tables.\nYou are supposed to write a report on the data provided in about 150 words.\nRemember that you are not supposed to give your view, but to only narrate what the given diagram/graph says.\nIn Task I you will be specifically checked on the following points :\na)it will negatively impact your score if you go away from the main given topic.\nb)you should maintain the fluency of thoughts without repetition of words or ideas.\nc)your word bank\nd)it will negatively impact your score if you write less than 150 words.\ne)You wont be given marks if you copy the words or sentence form from the question. They specifically judge your efficiency in paraphrasing.\nf)Your ability organize your writing using a suitable structure.\ng)Using connective words to link sentences and paragraphs logically ,i.e.. Coherence and Cohesion.\nTypes of Questions :\nThese can be single line graphs or double line.\nSingle line graphs usually show a trend of events depicted.\nDouble line graphs usually compare 2 separate variables or the effect of one variable over another.\n2)Bar graphs :\nAgain, u can be given information in the form of one or more bar graphs and your task will be write report from the information provided in the graph without giving your opinion.\n3)Pie Charts :\nYou can be given a single pie chart or more than one. Always remember to read the information carefully before jumping in writing report.\nMake sure you observe any trend, if suggested by the graph. Your inability to mention an important trend in the graph may not give you desired scores.\nPie charts are usually provided with color codes or design codes. Make sure you read them well and not confuse on code with another. You might just land up giving a completely different report than what is expected.\n4)Tables :\nThe information provided to you may be in the form of tables. Read the table carefully and note the headings of all the rows and columns. use your pencil to mark the highest and the lowest numbers (or the like, as required in the question), for each table.\nThis will help you in formatting your report efficiently with least time consumption.\n5)Flow Charts:\nThis can come in simple diagrams with arrows showing how one process follows another. Note carefully the direction of arrows and any extra information given at each step.\nLook from the starting point and follow it till the end. Start writing only after the process/ steps depicted in the flow chart is clear in your mind.\n6)Diagrams :\nSometimes they can just simply give you one labeled diagram and ask you to describe it in terms of information given in picture.\nAll all points, remember that all these graphs/ diagrams or flow charts show information which is of general public interest and can be understood by a non specialist population.\nSo be relaxed on these aspects. They wont ask you anything which you are not supposed to know. They will provide you with all information and your task is to present it beautifully to them.\nThe Practice\nThe Cambridge Books and How to Prepare for IELTS give good writing practice tests for Task 1. Practice on those tests, for the real test is very much similar.\nAlthough its very much tempting to look at the Practice Task and quietly think in your mind what you will write. This habit satisfies us till the extent that we tend to \u0091PRACTICE\u0092 these tasks mentally.\nI seriously abhor this attitude/ practice.\nPractice means you should take it as a real test.\nFor the first practice, jot down your thoughts on a piece of paper and start the timer.\nAt the end of the test, note how much time you took for it and do you need to improve.Ideally you should not spend more than 20 minutes for Task I.\nAlso note, the following points once you go through your report .\n1)Structure :\nHow structured is your essay? Is it organized in different paragraphs?\nIdeally, a report should be organized in 3 paragraphs.\nIn the 1st para should be introduction. Say what the graph is about. This information is generally given in the question line, but remember YOU SHOULD NOT COPY THE QUESTION AS IT IS.\nYou need to develop your paraphrasing skill here, or you wont be given marks. Along with this also mention a line or two about the GROSS trend shown in the graph.\nDon\u0092t go to the minute details at this stage.\nRemember that you are only reading what the graph/ picture is showing you. You should refrain from using such words which show your opinion, like, \"I think,\" etc. Rather, always carefully use begineers like, \" The graph suggests...\",or the like!\nThus your introduction is 1st paragraph which should contain minimum 2-3 sentences.\nThe 2nd paragraph is the main body of your report. Go to the minute details. Note the trends, If things changing with time or place, don\u0092t forget to mention it. Use connective words to make your report flow smooth.\nHowever, if the given table(say) contains just too many data, try to wrap it up among the highest and lowest values in each row/ column, instead of listing down everything separately.\nIn the 3rd paragraph conclude what the graph/ picture is suggesting. This can be similar to what you had mentioned in the 1st paragraph but always paraphrase it.\n2)Vocabulary :\nYour strong vocabulary will fetch you real good marks. However, refrain from using very complicated words. Be as simple and straight as possible.\nRead as many newspapers and magazines as possible. Note how they organize their stories.\nKeep a pencil and a dictionary handy while you read. Note down any interesting word /phrase and try to use it the next task you practice.\nI found this link at BBC world quite useful for the purpose :\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/index.shtml\nThis gives a list of words used with their meanings at the end of each story. Quite useful to improve your vocabulary and to learn the correct use of it in sentences.\n3)Grammar :\nGrammar is very important of the writing part, especially the tense.Even though the graph describes an event in the past, the graph is read in the present tense.\nSo, its appropriate if u say that, \u0091The graph shows..\u0092 and \u0091The number of cases decreased by the end of 1998\u0092.\nNote that the 1st sentence is present tense and the 2nd one is past. Hope you understood the difference between the tense utilization when you talk about the graph or when you talk about the information.\n4)Connecting Words :\nThis is another important point you will be judged on. Try and use as many variety of connecting words and phrases possible.\nIt is always wise, when you practice on a task, to list down the connecting words you could use for that topic. Try and think and find out more from books and dictionaries and list it for every task you practice.\nSo that, by the time you are in your 5th or 6th practice task you will be rich in these connecting words and would no longer need to list them down as they will come spontaneously as you write.\nA good list of connecting words is given at the dowload section:\nhttp://www.rxpgonline.com/downloads-cat-14.html\n5)Information :\nMake sure you describe the graph completely. However, if the datas given are exhaustive, tailor it intelligently. Develop this skill as you practice.\nAlso note that you should not sway away from the topic.\n6)Word and Time Limit :\nYour Task should not be less than 150 words. Its always wise to target for 200 words. Don\u0092t make it lengthy or you loose time for other tasks. Don\u0092t make it shorter than 150 or u loose marks.\nYou don\u0092t need to count word by word when you write, especially on the Test day. Practice on an average A4 paper and see how much of your lines make 150-200 words approximately.\nIf you stick to the Intro-Body-Conclusion pattern of the task, it is very unlikely that you will write less than 150 words. But then, practice is the key.\nThe Test Day\nThe Writing component usually comes only after listening and reading.\nBoth the Tasks (Task I and II) are given together and the total time allotted finish both is 60 minutes.\nAnswer sheet are also the same for both the tasks, however,note that there are separate space alotted for each task. Make sure you read carefully and answer in appropriate places. In case of any confusion, don\u0092t hesitate to ask the invigilators.\nIt is always wise to start with the Task II first as it carries more weightage. However, if you are comfortable with finishing Task I, first there is absolutely no harm.\nStart Task I with reading the question heading. The heading will read something like this :\n\u0093You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.\nWrite a report for a university lecturer describing the information in the graph below. You should write at least 150 words. \u0093\nGo to the graph/ picture. Note the important points quickly(in 2-3 minutes) -\n-what it is about\n-is it comparing any 2 (or more) datas\n-are the dates mentioned in past or future (yes, sometimes they do give you graphs with date quoted ahead of your present time -note this carefully, for you will need to modify your tense from past to future).\n-what gross idea you get after reading the graph. This will form your conclusion part.\n-be comfortable with the vocabulary (you have pracitsed on most topics, so don\u0092t worry).\n-don\u0092t try to use a new word without knowing its real meaning. You might be using it in an inaapropriate place and end up losing marks.\nStart writing.\nOrganise your report cleanly in 3 paragraphs (Introduction- Body- Conclusion).\nMake sure your report is not short of 150 words.\nIf you have taken additional sheets, make sure you attach them at appropriate places mentioned in the answer booklet.\nBe clear and legible in your writing.\nFor the pen and pencil type exam, its always advisable to use a pencil as it will be easier to correct your mistakes and make your report look clean and tidy.\nAlways leave some time at the end to read what you have written. Read it as the invigilator would read. Make sure that your report gives the information clearly and legibly and that it says what you meant it to say. Correct spelling mistakes, if any.\n4 (Excellent)\n"}, {"score": 1560.5725, "uuid": "3d1525d8-fdcd-59ca-b1c5-340811f2d97b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0108wb-75-22641", "target_hostname": "www.eslincanada.com", "target_uri": "http://www.eslincanada.com/english/passtests.php", "page_rank": 1.1731421e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "ESL in Canada - How to score HIGH on <em>the</em> NEW <em>TOEFL</em> TOEIC, AP, Cambridge", "snippet": "Students can <em>take</em> combinations of English language programs and enjoy high test scores.

Is the test a written test only? Do you have to read a text? Do you have to listen to a conversation on tape? How much speaking is required? What type of questions will be asked? What type of answers are required? Students must understand how the English information is presented, what English skills are being tested, and how answers must be submitted.\nSecond step is to understand the volume of advanced English skills and vocabulary required to score high on these tests. Students must have studied and practiced English for 2500 to 5000 hours counting school classes and self study.\nStudents require a vocabulary of between 8,000 and 15,000 words to score high on the new TOEFL, TOEIC, AP, IELTS and Cambridge tests. Students who score over 95 in the IBT or 900 on the TOEIC have English language vocabularies of over 10,000 words.\nTo score high students require all four English skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening), technical language structure knowledge (grammar) and the application of the grammar knowledge in the active productions of speaking and writing.\nThe \"secret tips\" of using specific words that have a higher percentage of occurrence in the correct answers may give you the opportunity to raise your score from 0 to 1 %. If your vocabulary is less than 8000 words or your listening skills or writing less than advanced then you will still fail despite using all the \"secret tips\" or \"secret vocabulary indicating correct answers\".\nEveryone knows that cramming helps memorizing facts for a short time but does very little for the practice of the application skills. All new English tests are a combination of facts and the application of English skills including technical grammar knowledge. Students who only cram for tests will fail most of the new tests as answers require the application of English grammar skills. The students who cram can only help some of their factual knowledge if they can remember it perfectly. I have never met a student who can remember crammed English facts correctly.\nStudents become upset when they read questions they cannot answer, questions they cannot understand, words they do not know the meaning of, or \"secret words\" that occur in two or more answers.\nRemember students that are prepared have less chance of becoming upset. Students that are rested, relaxed and arrive on time at the test site will score higher on the tests.\nWhat English Should I study to PASS English Tests?\nDiagram showing the overlap between the English Classes\nThere is only one English language.\nThere are a variety of programs and courses that overlap each other. Many business English courses cover 90% of what students require to pass the TOEIC exam. Many advanced English courses cover 90 % of what is required to pass TOEFL, TOEIC, AP, IELTS and other English tests.\nMany Toeic, toefl, IELTS courses only provide practice tests without teaching any vocabulary the four English skills and applied grammar practice. Students must create a plan to increase all applied English skills, vocabulary and become comfortable with the test requirements and answer formats.\nStudents can take combinations of English language programs and enjoy high test scores.\nFor example: Advanced students could take 100 hours of business English, 200 hours of academic preparation and 10 hours of toefl and score high on the new Toefl test .\nThe only secret to high English language test scores is to have a balance of applied English skills and factual knowledge.

If you are studying to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language, either in the paper-based, computer-based, or the new Next Generation TOEFL\u00ae format, then this podcast is for you. The TOEFL\u00ae Podcast will help anyone studying for an exam that requires listening comprehension, including the IELTS and other similar exams throughout the world.\nEach weekly TOEFL\u00ae Podcast will have four parts. First, you\u2019ll hear a portion of a conversation or a lecture similar to one you may hear in your classes in the United States. This first portion is done slowly, to give you a chance to pick up the new terms and vocabulary. The second part of the podcast is an explanation of some of the key vocabulary and expressions from the sample conversation or lecture. Third, you\u2019ll hear the conversation or lecture again, but this time at the normal speed that you will hear in the actual TOEFL\u00ae examination. Finally, we ask you a few comprehension questions to check your understanding, similar to what you may hear on the TOEFL\u00ae.\nThe approach we use in this podcast to prepare you for the listening comprehension section of the TOEFL\u00ae or similar exams is very different from other books or courses. Many people think that you should listen to native speakers talking as they usually do\u2014very fast\u2014so that you can get used to understanding them. Unfortunately, for many learners of English, this is too fast for them to understand much of what is said. Sometimes you may only understand 40-50% of what was said. This is a very inefficient use of time, since you can only pick up new words and phrases when you can understand their meaning. Listening to native speakers only speaking at a native rate means picking up fewer new words in English than if you listened to them more slowly.\nOur approach is very different. Here, you will listen to English conversations using the same words or phrases as a native speaker uses, but more slowly and clearly. This way, you can actually understand and pick up these words. After a couple of times listening to the podcast, you will be able to comprehend up to 80-90% of it. This is a much better and more efficient use of your time. As your English gets better and better by listening, you will be able to understand what native speakers are saying when they speak fast.\nOf course, the TOEFL\u00ae exam will have native speakers speaking at the regular\u2014that is, a fast\u2014rate. You have to eventually be able to understand that type of talking. But first you have to expand your vocabulary and pick up the new words and phrases. Then you can worry about understanding at a faster speed.\nMost TOEFL\u00ae books give you sample listening exercises and introduce you to the types of questions on the test, but they don\u2019t actually teach you any of the English that you\u2019ll need to know to succeed on the TOEFL\u00ae. In the TOEFL\u00ae Podcast, we explain words and phrases that will help you improve your ability to understand spoken English.\nTOEFL\u00ae Podcast is currently produced by a team of volunteers at the Center for Educational Development, in Los Angeles, California. My name is Dr. Jeff McQuillan, and I\u2019m the host of TOEFL\u00ae Podcast. I have been teaching English as a Second Language for many years both here in the United States and in other countries. I received my Ph.D., my doctorate, in applied linguistics and education from the University of Southern California. I taught as a university professor for several years here in California and in Arizona. I have written many articles and books on the teaching English.\nOur podcasts are short, so they won\u2019t be as long as the conversations or lectures you may hear on the TOEFL\u00ae, especially the new Next Generation TOEFL\u00ae that will be used beginning in 2005 and 2006. However, you will still pick up new terms and learn how to listen to lectures and conversations. We look forward to seeing you next time on the TOEFL\u00ae Podcast.\nNote: TOEFL\u00ae is a registered trademark of the Educational Testing Service, which does not endorse and was not involved in the production of this podcast.\n"}], [{"score": 1533.3169, "uuid": "a9007e1c-3d97-50dc-bd90-68007b5fa535", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1305wb-48-13154", "target_hostname": "www.test-guide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.test-guide.com/simple-tips-on-passing-the-ielts-exam.html", "page_rank": 1.2086635e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "Simple Tips On Passing <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> Exam | <em>IELTS</em> - Test-Guide.com", "snippet": "On <em>the</em> other hand, those who need to work <em>or</em> pass immigration requirements need to <em>take</em> <em>the</em> General Training Module.

There are two test formats to choose from. Those who wish to enroll for higher education need to take the Academic Module. On the other hand, those who need to work or pass immigration requirements need to take the General Training Module. No matter what you'll take, below are some simple tips on how to ace the exam.\nSince you're already aware of the kinds of tests to be given, you should devote time to practicing them. For instance, you can practice and sharpen your reading skills by opening magazines, newspapers and journals. Often, you'll find in there the kinds of materials in the reading part of the exam. Go for those which will improve your argumentation skills, so you may also practice your ability to speak.\nJust because some people fail the test doesn't mean they're already incompetent. Sometimes they simply fail to follow instructions carefully. So before you answer any question, make sure you have thoroughly read and understood the instructions. For instance, don't give complete word answers if only a letter is asked.\nIn the IELTS and just about any other tests you take, your greatest enemy is time. The fact is there are a lot of examinees who are unable to finish all four modules each time. It's important that you budget your time well. During your review period, you should practice how to listen, write, read and speak fast. But it doesn't mean you should compromise giving the right answers for each question.\nFor the speaking test, you'll have a face-to-face interview with a certified Examiner. Remember to always speak directly to him or her, and not to the recording device. Quickly organize your ideas and sentences right before answering. Remember to talk clearly and at a normal pace. This part of the exam isn't about testing how knowledgeable you are of things, but how you can effectively communicate.\nPanicking and getting nervous are some of the things you're likely to go through coming to the testing center unprepared. This happens to a lot of examinees, especially when facing a difficult question or considering the remaining time. But when you're prepared, you can focus more effectively, thus provide the best answers. Thinking positively will help you out a lot as it can boost your confidence.\nBefore taking the IELTS exam, there are plenty of practice or sample tests you can find on the internet. Some of them are free, while some come for a fee. There are also recommended review materials which you can buy, or review centers to enroll in to make sure you're well prepared for the examination day.\n"}, {"score": 1513.4131, "uuid": "231ed643-fdc5-549b-92db-22103ea8bba1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0210wb-08-32039", "target_hostname": "www.rxpgonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rxpgonline.com/article1284.html", "page_rank": 1.2256153e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "<em>The</em> Speaking Component of <em>IELTS</em> <em>IELTS</em>", "snippet": "\u0095 Apply these in <em>the</em> <em>IELTS</em> Test to get a good score You can share your exam experiences, preparation strategies, books you have read <em>or</em> just any information about <em>IELTS</em> on RxPG website and we will publish it under your name.

Or you might be just asked to describe how did you reach the test center from home.\nDo not hesitate.Sit back relaxed and make the conversation enjoyable.\nThe aim is to impress the interviewer and I believe that each one of us have our own style to do this;Use yours!\nThis part of interview lasts for not more than 4-5 minutes.The topics are of general interests and usually deal with the following :\n. Your country of origin\n. How long you have lived there\n. What you do: work or study\n. Your interests and future plans\n. why u want to go abroad\n. are you aware of the situations there\n. why this particular field interests you\n. Shopping\n. Your hobbies\n. your family\n. interesting places in your hometown - which one u like the most? Why? Whats the most interesting thing there? Would you like to change some thing there?\n. climate/seasons\n. festivals in your country\n. traditions in your country\nThis is just a general overview to give you an idea of what exactly the 1st step consists of.\nThe topics may vary with the interviewer\u0092s choice.\nMake sure that you are fully aware of your future plans, the reasons why you are planning to go abroad, the competition in your field and any alternative plans you have if this one do not materialize.\nPrepare your mind for these sort of questions.\nIts definitely impossible to predict the questions but the idea is that always be prepared, for processed speaking always better than random speaking.\n2nd Part :\nThough its totally upto the interviewer to decide when the 1st part ends and 2nd part begins,you will be able to clearly identify that you are into the 2nd part when the interviewer says, \u0093 Now I will give you a topic to speak on (and will hand over the card with the topic). You will be given 1 minute to think over it. You are allowed to make notes if you wish.\u0094\nThe topics will be of general interest and something on which any one can speak on. It is carefully selected that it doesn\u0092t requires any professional knowledge to speak on these topics.\nCommon Topics are :\n-Your Favorite Tourist Destination : Where would you like to go? With whom?\n-Your Favorite Home/place of living\n-Men- Women Relationships\n-What you think is the best way to combat stress\n-Country living or City life : what you prefer and why\n-Why do you think people go abroad for\n-Family or friends : who is more important to you\n-Pollution in cities\n-Your view on technology : is it helpful?\n-Education\nThere can innumerable topics here and this list is just to help you with the TYPE of topics usually allotted.\nThere will be sub topics or suggestions following the main topics, giving you the idea on which you need to elaborate.However, you should note that you can speak on any idea which isn\u0092t mentioned in the sub topics,but should be related to the main topic.\nThe card will look something like this :\n\"Q. Describe a person from your youth who had a great influence on you:\nYou should say:\nwhat relationship this person was to you\nwhat was special about them\nand explain how they influenced you so much.\"\nUtilize the one minute efficiently.Prepare your mind of what exactly u will speak on! Write down the key words quickly on the paper provided. Can remember any interesting incident or example? Quote it! This will make the conversation more interesting. Get ready and plan how exactly you r going to start.\nFor e.g. for the sample question above :\nIf say,I want to tell about one teacher who had greatly influenced me, my rapid 1 minute note will be something like this :\n-Ida Borrison (note that, writing just the name prepared my answer for the main topic and next 2 sub questions as well.)\n-teaching style\n-school journal\nThese 3 words did not take more than 30 sec for me jot down, but will provide me enough matter for me to speak for the next 2-3 minutes.\nMake sure that your start is correct and your every sentence is \u0091propagative\u0092 (i.e. automatically helps you start with the next sentence), rather than dead sentence ,which starts and ends by itself.\nfor the given e.g.,\na dead sentence would be like : My school teacher, Ida Borrison influenced me the most.\nNote that though this sentence is on the topic asked and is grammatically correct , it will not help you much with your fluent conversation.\nPerhaps I found that,if the FLOW of the conversation is good and you could involve the interviewer in whatever you speak, the interviewer will have no choice but to give you a great band.\nA good start for the above e.g., could have been like,\nO well, Ida Borrison was one person I just cannot forget. She was our English teacher when we were in 9 th standard. She taught us just for an year and then she got transferred .But that one year was so influencing that ....!\nNote that,\nHere the essence is, the candidate first told the name and then explained who she was. He met her when he was in 9th standard and he wants to talk about just 1 year he was in contact with her.\nNote how gradually the conversation is propagating rather than jus saying , \u0093 My school teacher, Ida Borrison influenced me the most.\u0094 and STOP!\nLearn to master this when you start practising.\nLearn to use sentences which automatically leads to the next one and there is no thought blocking.\nThis is the 2nd part of the interview and is regarded as the most important determinant of the final score.\nYou are supposed to speak for 2-3 minutes on this following which the interviewer will ask you to elaborate on certain points you have mentioned.\nDon\u0092t bother if the interviewer stops you and asks his question. Immediately change your concentration on the immediate question put forth to u.\n3rd Part\nStep 3 of the interview deals with the same topic but the interviewer will ask you more deeply and into the topic.\nIt will usually depend on what you have described in the 2nd part.\nDon\u0092t bother much. Speak as much as possible. Don\u0092t bother if the you don\u0092t know the exact answer to the question put forth by the examiner.\nDon\u0092t sit back and think that , \u0093You don\u0092t know\u0094! Speak this aloud!\nYou are being judged on your speaking skill not the depth of your knowledge about traffic controls or teaching styles of different people(for e.g.).\nThe interviewer puts forward a certain question to prompt you to speak; The question should not make you silent.\nThis is the last part of interview and lasts for around 3-4 minutes.\nTotal duration of the interview varies from 11-14 minutes approximately.\nBe polite through out. Do not overdo things. Just be yourself.\nThe Practice\nIts always a good idea to practice speaking with a partner. Form a group, make a list of the topics and go ahead discussing one by one.\nMake sure the number of persons in your study group should be just optimum.In my view, 2 are best and more than 3 is crowd. Of course,it also depends on ur own convenience and preference.\nDon\u0092t bother much if you r alone and cant find a study partner. Take a topic and practice speaking for 2-3 minutes at a stretch.\nRecord ur conversation while speak. Play ur recorded conversation later to find out what exactly are your mistakes and weakness and where you need to improve upon.\nFluency :\nThis measures your ability to speak without too many pauses and hesitations. It is also to do with how easily and clearly your ideas can be understood.\nSome pauses are normal and acceptable for a good conversation. However, check if your pauses are just too frequent or too long.\nLearn and choose, how exactly you would pause. \u0093...aahhmm\u0094 is the most commonly used one.You can even use a gesture with your eyes,eyebrows or hands.\nWatch interviews on TV and try and observe these small things and try to adopt it in your style.\nVocabulary :\nA good vocabulary is a very strong point for your interview. But do you use all that you know when you speak? Well, most of us don\u0092t!\nListen to your recorded conversation when you practice. Identify if you are using one particular word repeatedly. Find out if you can replace that with some another word (and same meaning).\nTry using thesaurus and list down various words with similar meanings which you would use while speaking.\nDo this for every topic you speak on.\nYou will be rich in no time.\nHowever, learning new words is never easy and more difficult is to use a new word in your conversation,especially when you will be under stress at the time of the interview.\nKeep this in mind when you learn a new word. Make sure you will be able to use it as easily as you use the other words you know.\nNew words can be learnt from dictionary, thesaurus. What I found as the best way for this is to sit with newspaper article with a pencil in hand and a dictionary by your side.\nMark any unfamiliar words, search the real meaning in the dictionary and then see how it has been used in the article. Try and use these words as much as u can till your brain gets adjusted to the new addition.\nThe following bbc link I found very useful for improving vocabulary :\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/newsenglish/witn/index.shtml\nThere are more resources here:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/index.shtml\nExplore and find out what you need the most.\nPronunciation and Accent\nPronunciation is the most important factor in speaking. Most of the time it actually doesn\u0092t matters if you don\u0092t show off much of your vocabulary power with complicated words, but whatever you speak should be correctly prononunced.\nYou wont be aware of your wrong pronunciation till you actually think over it. Watch BBC (or even HBO or Star Movies). Note if your pronunciation is wrong.\nHow do u pronunce \u0093HEART\u0094, as \u0091hurt\u0092 or as \u0091hart\u0092.These are small things which you might have never thought on before,but beware, the interviewer is going to mark you on these.\nDon\u0092t bother much about the accent.Its always good to maintain a \u0091neutral\u0092 accent.\nRemember that the Interviewer is usually a trained person from the city, where u r taking the test.Don\u0092t TRY to introduce any foreign accent for the interview sake, the interviewers are trained to catch these.\nGrammatical mistakes :\nThe variety of grammar you use and how correctly you use it are both judged by the interviewer. So, the range of tenses as well as the appropriate use of them is important in all parts of the Speaking test.\nDon\u0092t panic if you realize that you just spoke a grammatically wrong sentence. Go ahead and correct it. This is what we do in our day-to- day conversation, isn\u0092t it? and the interviewer also gets to know that you actually know correct English.\nListen to your recorded conversation while practising.Is it grammatically correct?\nIdeas to speak:\nMost candidates complain that though their English is good ,they have a good vocabulary and are strong with the grammar, too, yet they stop as soon as they start the conversation.Do you experience the same problem?\nIt is usually because we don\u0092t get actually what we want to speak or rather it\u0092s the scarcity of ideas.\nYou are what you know and you know what you read. So improve your \u0091Idea Bank\u0092.\nRead articles on Men-Women,Technology, Sports, Pollution, Tourism and such general topics.\nPrepare your mind for the \u0091Personal Topics\u0092 say, your most funny experience. Am sure you must have had many,but which one would you like to quote? Make sure its interesting and that you talk on it for at least 5 minutes at a stretch.\nPrepare beforehand, what you will talk if you r alsked to describe about yourself, your family, your job, your future plans or even your favourite tourist destination.\nThese topics should be at your finger tips.\nDon\u0092t mug up preformed speeches.Interviewers are trained to catch these.\nAlso, you should develop your own spontaneous conversation which should be as unique and interesting as you are.Try giving interestnig examples.\nThe following link gives you a wide range of topics to practice on.Hope you find it useful.\nhttp://www.writefix.com/ieltsspkg/\nThe Test Day\nReach the test center in time.\nMake sure you look your best. Wear your best apparel and your best smile.A formal/ semi formal attire is the most suited for the purpose.\nDon\u0092t try to show off your casualness by moving in a pair of shorts nor overdo things by wearing a jazzy party dress.\nBe confident. This is also one important aspect they are going to judge you on.\nDon\u0092t try to talk to candidates coming out of the interview room. By doing this you will be breaking the examination rules and invite a disqualification for yourself.\nI always advise to talk calmly to the other candidates waiting for the interview in the same waiting room as you are. Its always a good warm up.\nKnock and enter the interview room confidently.\nThink before hand how exactly you would like your sitting posture to be and in which you r most comfortable.\nKeep your hand movements or other gestures you use during conversing, in control. You should not sit like a statute either. Just that you should not over do such things which looks unnatural in a day to day conversation.\nKeep your cool. Be calm and be polite.\nMake an interesting conversation. Smile and involve the interviewer in your conversation.\nRemember that the interviewer is all too exhausted and bored by interviewing so many candidates before you. Your conversation should refresh him up.\nIf the interviewer keeps a view in front of you tell him if you fully agree with him, that he is right or if you have another view, be polite and say that you think some thing else.\nDid he say he enjoyed talking with you? Tell him that it was nice speaking to him too.\nThank him in the end.\nThe Mantra\nThe mantra for a great score in speaking is to be confident, calm and cool.\nProject yourself as an interesting person. Be yourself.\nTalk clearly, loudly, pronounce correctly and no grammatical mistakes.\nYou will come out with flying colors.\nGood Luck!\n"}, {"score": 1496.6399, "uuid": "249cb9b1-d6cc-5f53-b52e-91adf2f0bb4b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1201wb-30-22836", "target_hostname": "www.toeflgoanywhere.org", "target_uri": "http://www.toeflgoanywhere.org/category/article-category/toefl%C2%AE-step-step", "page_rank": 1.1972943e-09, "spam_rank": 88, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em>\u00ae Step-by-Step | <em>TOEFL</em>", "snippet": "<em>TOEFL</em> JOURNEY is a trademark of ETS. * Source: Survey of 263 admission officers at U.S. universities, of which 212 accept both <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em>\u00ae test and <em>the</em> <em>IELTS</em>\u2122 test and 152 state a preference.", "explanation": null, "document": "TOEFL\u00ae Step-by-Step\nTo help you feel focused and confident on test day, we\u2019ve put together some useful information about what to expect including a list of things you need to do before you arrive, some information on how the test is administered and an idea of what the test experience itself will be like.\nThe TOEFL\u00ae test is an important part of your journey to studying abroad.

Admission decisions are not formula-driven, but depend on the applicant's overall profile.\nThe application procedure should be carefully completed with all requested information showing the qualifications that schools request and highlight in their public materials. The admission selection process is highly competitive-with the best candidates competing for a restricted number of school openings. A candidate's undergraduate performance, GMATTM and TOEFL\u00ae test scores (when required), length and quality of work experience, career goals, resume, personal essays, and recommendation letters are different elements of an MBA application.\nAll Business Schools require candidates to hold at least a Bachelor's Degree or its equivalent. It is not mandatory to have earlier exposure to business studies to be accepted into an MBA Program. Academic results form a vital component in one's application.\nAnything that positively reflects one's past interests and experiences is a definite plus. Extracurricular activities that are considered a past success should be emphasized.\nBecause of the rigors of Business School, admissions committees look for students who are able to motivate and discipline themselves to learn and to balance academic pursuits with their personal lives. Good responses to essay questions and the length and quality of the applicant's work experience wood therefore contribute in making a strong\napplication.\nFinancial assistance and loan programs for non-US citizens are available though they are very limited. Some of the larger, well-established programs have more funding available, or at least more programs in place, to help students finance their MBAs. All Indian banks give education loans at nominal rates of interest, and it is a good idea to avail of these loans in case one is looking for outside sources of funding.\nThe evidence of financial support is required by universities to issue the documents needed for visa application. Applicants are also required to submit a bank statement demonstrating their financial capacity to support their education.\nADMISSIONS TO OTHER GRADUATE PROGRAMS\nStudents wishing to pursue a Master's or PhD in Engineering or Sciences (Computer, Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical etc.) or a Master's or PhD in Economics or Arts subjects need to supplement their application profile with GRE\u00ae and TOEFL\u00ae scores. For some PhD programs, Subject GREs might also be required. For admission to post graduate courses, you need to have a Bachelor's degree. Applications to most graduate programs include details of past academic record, statement of purpose indicating the applicant's areas of interest, recommendation letters, and financial statements showing adequate proof of funding and application forms of the university. The range and choice of courses available in universities abroad is quite exhaustive and one can always find the course of one's choice.\nMost universities in the U.S. and UK have academic sessions starting in Fall (August/September) and Spring (January/February). It is advisable to apply about six months prior to your intended date of enrolment. But don't forget to check the application deadline of each university.\nFunding options are available to international students for most graduate programs in the form of scholarships, tuition waivers, and research and teaching assistantships though they might not be enough to cover your entire expenses. Most aid in graduate programs is based on merit, and also depends on the funding available to each university in this regard.\nUNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS\nHigh School academic record, SAT\u00ae scores (when required), personal essays, recommendation letters from teachers, and financial statements are the key elements of undergraduate applications. The choice of courses available is varied and exhaustive.\nMost universities in the U.S. and UK have academic sessions starting in Fall (August/September) and Spring (January/February). It is advisable to apply about six months prior to your intended date of enrolment. But don't forget to check the application deadline of each university.\nFew top Universities such as Harvard, MIT, Yale, etc. give upto 100% Need Based aid. Their admission policy is need-blind. Few top Universities such as Brown, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, etc. give upto 100% Need Based aid. However, their admission policy is not need-blind. Few top Universities such as Cornell, Duke, etc. give a combination of need-based and merit-based scholarships upto 100%. A lot of schools give merit based scholarships upto 100%. Students with SAT scores more than 1900 if applying carefully can look forward to scholarships. Part-time jobs are also available on campus, and students can expect to cover a part of their living cost by working part time.\nHow do I find out about American universities and colleges?\nThe best source of information is the Internet. Most institutions have web pages that contain a wealth of information and instructions on how to submit an application for admission, including special instructions for international students. Alternatively, if you do not have access to the Internet, you can find information by visiting the nearest USEFI, British Council or other country-specific education centers. You can also avail of the services of the Jamboree admission cell to help you get information on colleges and universities abroad.\nHow do I find the right university for me?\nFirst, you must have a clear idea of what you wish to study and what features you would like the school in which you want to study to have. There are also financial considerations to take into account, and the cost can vary enormously from institution to institution. The field of study, geography, and cost will help you narrow down your selection.\nThe next step is to contact the universities that appeal to you and obtain information from them. As it can take some time to complete the application process, the earlier you begin the better it is for you. Start your search at least 12 months in advance; if you are planning to begin your studies in the autumn of 2012, you should start contacting universities in the autumn of 2011. Most universities admit new students twice a year.\nWhat is the application process?\nOnce you have gathered all the information and application forms from the universities that interest you, read them carefully and follow the instructions. Most require you to fill an application form and submit it, along with your educational qualifications, test results, one or more letters of recommendation from former teachers or employers, personal essays and statement of purpose, financial affidavits, and applications for scholarship if any. They will also require that you pay an application fee.\nWhat tests?\nThe standardized tests required for admission vary from country to country and from course to course.\nAll universities in the United States require applicants to take 'standardized tests' designed to measure students' aptitude for further study. Students whose native language is not English must also demonstrate their proficiency by taking the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Graduate schools of business and MBA programs usually require the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT); post-graduate programs in other disciplines require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Students going just after Class 12 for undergraduate programs need to take the SAT\u00ae I and, in some cases, SAT\u00ae II as well.\nWhere do you send your applications and how are they Reviewed?\nThe admissions office in the university is responsible for receiving applications, credentials, test results, letters of recommendations and application fees. When a file is complete, it is reviewed and a decision taken on admission. For post-graduate admission, the file is referred to the department to be reviewed by professors who make the final decision. A decision of admission could take between one month and six months depending on the university though most decisions take about two to three months.\nFor more information, Contact Us\nFill out the form,\nFor more information on Jamboree's programs and application details.\nName*\n"}, {"score": 1402.998, "uuid": "29e9fe00-f235-573f-a53e-97cf98ff4f1d", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1203wb-91-17735", "target_hostname": "www.jamboreeindia.com", "target_uri": "http://www.jamboreeindia.com/faqs_general.asp", "page_rank": 1.1726016e-09, "spam_rank": 76, "title": "GRE\u00ae| GMAT\u0099| SAT\u00ae|<em>TOEFL</em>\u00ae and <em>IELTS</em> Preparation| FAQ&#x27;s Exam Query| GMAT", "snippet": "Students have to apply at least 40 days in advance <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> is held three - four times every month on pre-determined dates One <em>should</em> preferably <em>take</em> <em>the</em> exam in <em>the</em> 11th grade if in school <em>or</em> in <em>the</em> second last year if in college.", "explanation": null, "document": "General FAQ's\n\"Transforming Careers, Transforming Lives\"\nGMAT : ANU KUMARI 790 | NAGENDRA SINHA 780 | NIKHIL RAJPAL 780 | RAJAN KUKREJA 780 | ROHIT JAIN 780 | ABHIMANYU SINGH 770 | AMARJEET RAI 770 | ASHISH KHANDELIA 770 | ARPIT MIDHA 770 | AWANEESH VERMA 770 | GRE : DEEPA DORAISWAMY 1600 | WAJEEHA ALTAF 1600 | RAGVIR SABHARWAL 1590 | SIDDHARTH PANDIT 1590 | ANKUSH WALIA 1570 | ANIMESH KUMAR 1560 | BHAVNA AGGARWAL 1560 | VIVEK DAHIYA 1560 | SOHINI BANERJEE 1560 | DEEPIKA SHARMA 1550 | NEW GRE : SARV PRATEEK SINGH 330 | PANKHURI 329 | SHREYAS 329 | PANKIT THAPAR 328 | PRACHI 327 | KUSHAL PRASAD 326 | NIKITA JAIN 326 | HARINI SUBRAMAN 325 | HRISHIRAJ SEN 325 | ISHA 325 | SAT : PRONAY SABLOK 2330 | SRISTHI NATH 2310 | SUCHITH VASUDEVAN 2310 | ABIR 2300 | DIVYA BHASIN 2280 | TANVI BIKHCHANDANI 2280 | ARJUN SARKAR 2240 | SHIV GOEL 2200 | YASH 2200 | RIDDHI 2190 | TOEFL : HARINI SUBRAMANIAM 120 | ARCHANA JAIN 119 | JUHI RANJAN 119 | ARAVIND NV 118 | ARUSH MANAV KALRA 118 | ASTHA YADAV 118 | KETKAI 118 | MITALEE GUPTA 118 | SMITA POKHRIYAL 118 | THOMAS ALEX 118 | IELTS : ARCHANA CHAWLA 8.5 | GAURI KAUSHISH 8.5 | DR.

These are reading, listening, speaking and writing. The TOEFL is for a duration of four hours with maximum time spent in the Reading and Listening sections.\nStructure of Reading Test\nThis section has the maximum number of questions with about 36-70. The Reading test includes three to five academic reading passages followed by comprehension questions. The student\u2019s ability to understand and analyse the meaning of the passages is tested. The question types are similar to those that appeared in the computer based TOEFL. Students are expected to demonstrate that they have learned what they have read, either by filling out a table or completing a narrative summary. Choose a correct paraphrase of a reading. The new features that make the testing experience easier and even include a glossary and review feature.\nStructure of Listening Test\nThe listening section has anything from 34-51 questions. The test involves the student listening to two to three conversations on their headphones. The conversations may include two or more speakers in each. Apart from this, there are four to six lectures, which include classroom dialogue. A positive development is that test-takers can now write down notes while listening. Again, the questions are similar to those that appeared in the TOEFL CBT. There will be a few new question types that measure ability to understand a speaker\u2019s attitude or meaning.\nStructure of Speaking Test\nThe speaking test consists of a total of six tasks. Two of the tasks are independent tasks about familiar topics. The test taker is required to state, explain and support their response using personal knowledge and experience.\nTwo tasks are based on Reading and Listening material. These tasks include a short reading passage and a short talk. The questions require test takers to answer using the information provided in the reading and the listening material. One question is based on a campus-related situation, and the other is based on academic classroom material. Again, test takers can take notes and use the information to shape their responses.\nThe remaining two tasks are based on Listening material, including a short lecture or conversation. The questions require test takers to summarise key ideas from the talks in the responses.\nTest-takers are judged on the basis of the following criteria:\n1. Topic development: The student\u2019s ability to understand the matter and draw connections between topics as well as their capability to convey relevant information.\n2. Delivery: The ability to use clear, smooth, sustained speech.\n3. Language use: Trained evaluators pay attention to the use of correct grammar and vocabulary. Close notice is paid to the response of logical answers.\nThe six tasks in the Speaking section are rated by at least two human scorers on a scale of 0-4. The six individual scores are averaged to arrive at an aggregate value. This aggregate is converted to the scale of 0 to 30.\nStructure of Writing Test\nThe Writing test consists of a total of two tasks to be completed by the test taker. The first task could be a reading, listening or writing one \u2014 an academic reading followed by a lecture. Test takers must answer a question discussing the key points in the lecture and explain how they relate to those in the reading passage. The reading passage appears first, and then it is removed from the screen during the lecture. Test takers can view the passage again while responding to the question. The second task is an independent task about a familiar topic. Test takers must state their response and support it with information from personal knowledge and experience.\nTrained evaluators measure the ability to understand the material, as well as write clearly, accurately and in an organized manner. The two tasks are scored by at least two human scorers from 0 to 5 and then the raw scores are totaled/averaged before scaling them to the range of 0 to 30.\nTOEFL score\nEach of the four sections of TOEFL iBT is scored on a scale of 0 to 30. The sectional scores are then added to arrive at a total score of 0 to 120. Each score corresponds to a percentile ranking. This displays how an individual\u2019s score compares with that of other students answering the test.\nThe maximum score of 120 has a percentile of 100. Students will also receive information of what the numeric scores mean in terms of language skills and proficiency (high/medium/low), along with performance feedback including suggestions for improvement.\n"}, {"score": 1382.5657, "uuid": "8a77f5d0-f7a5-5dd5-bac5-2bec991a8720", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1408wb-84-24629", "target_hostname": "www.indiancareerclub.com", "target_uri": "http://www.indiancareerclub.com/exams/IELTS/Assessment.html", "page_rank": 1.1859157e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "<em>IELTS</em> | <em>IELTS</em> Exam | <em>IELTS</em> test preparation | <em>IELTS</em> formats | Tips to attend", "snippet": "Assessment <em>takes</em> into account <em>the</em> amount of strain caused to <em>the</em> listener, and <em>the</em> notice ability of L1 influence. <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> results are graded&#x2F;banded using a 9 BAND scale.", "explanation": null, "document": "Pronunciation\nFluency and Coherence:\nThis refers to the candidate's ability to talk with normal levels of continuity, speech rate and effort, and to link ideas and language together in coherent, connected speech..\nLexical Resource:\nThis refers to the candidate's ability to talk with normal levels of continuity, speech rate and effort, and to link ideas and language together in coherent, connected speech.\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy:\nThis refers to the range of structures available to the candidate and how accurately and appropriately s/he can use them.

Well, if you fall into any of <em>the</em> categories mentioned above, then <em>the</em> <em>IELTS</em> is definitely worth researching (and considering).", "explanation": null, "document": "The 5 W\u2019s of the IELTS\n(International English Language Testing System)\nWHO \u2022 WHY \u2022 WHAT \u2022 WHERE \u2022 WHEN\nWho takes the IELTS exam?\nThe IELTS is taken by 1.4 million people in 130 countries every year. Like all English language exams, the IELTS was created with a particular audience in mind. However, the IELTS is unique in that it is one of the only English language exams that has two different formats that aren\u2019t just different in the structure they are given, but vastly different in purpose. In other words, depending on which format you choose to take, your results will indicate what kind of jobs and institutions you are applying to and how proficient your level of English is. These two tests are the Academic and the General Training.\nBut before we get into what makes the formats different and especially before taking the IELTS, it is crucial to identify whether you fall into either of the following two categories:\n1. Someone who wants to enroll into a an institution of higher education in an English speaking country or professional in the medical field who also wish to practice their English in such countries (note: all Ivy League colleges accept it.)\n2. Someone who wishes to practice his/her English not so much through academic pursuits but through work and/or to oblige by certain immigration requirements (note: IELTS is used for English measuring proof for immigration to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.)\nIf you do, keep reading!\nWhy should you take the International English Language Testing System Test?\nWell, if you fall into any of the categories mentioned above, then the IELTS is definitely worth researching (and considering). Much like the TOEFL exam , the IELTS is widely accepted worldwide and regarded as one of the most important English language exams. Your results on the IELTS will indicate that you are a proficient English speaker who is either ready to take on a rigorous academic journey or join the hustle and bustle of every day work among native English speakers (Or hey, even both!)\nWhen weighing your different English language exam options, it is also important to remember that the IELTS, for instance, is accepted in over 6,000 institutions around the world (half of those in the U.S. alone) \u2013 everywhere from universities, immigration offices, private business companies, and government agencies. English language exams don\u2019t test your math skills (thank goodness for most of us), but if you think about it, the probability that 6,000 people are wrong about the exam is highly unlikely!\nWhat can I expect to see on the IELTS?\nThe IELTS is basically an exam that will assure your future employer or university that you have the ability to communicate in English proficiently, and thus, excel in your new English-speaking environment. The exam will specifically test your ability to listen, read, write and speak in English.\nSomething to be prepared for and to really consider before signing up for the IELTS is the fact that it uses a variety of different accents. That\u2019s right \u2013 don\u2019t be shocked to hear British accents (after all, the test is in fact managed by the University of Cambridge and the British Council). To shake things up even more, Australian and Irish accents may also be thrown into the mix. While this might scare off a few potential test-takers, it also makes sense from the perspective of the employer or University you are applying to. Do they want someone whose proficiency in English is limited to just one accent and sound? Living in a multicultural world where English is a leading language in both academic and business, you should be ready to hear and be familiarized with all sorts of accents.\nThe price for the exam is both the same for the Academic version and the General Training version. To find out about the IELTS cost , here is a worldwide chart in your local currency. To give you an example, in the United States, the test fee is set to $185 USD.\nClick here to view the IELTS format to familiarize yourself with the exam.\nUnderstanding your score\nThe IELTS is scored through a nine-band scale, each number being representative of your level of English proficiency (1 being the lowest and 9 the highest) in each skill module.\nAccording to the IELTS official website, the band numbers are described as the following:\nBand 9\nExpert user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have fully operational command of the language: appropriate, accurate and fluent with complete understanding.\nBand 8\nVery good user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have fully operational command of the language with only occasional unsystematic inaccuracies and inappropriacies. Misunderstandings may occur in unfamiliar situations. Handles complex detailed argumentation well.\nBand 7\nGood user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have operational command of the language, though with occasional inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings in some situations. Generally handles complex language well and understands detailed reasoning.\nBand 6\nCompetent user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have generally effective command of the language despite some inaccuracies, inappropriacies and misunderstandings. Can use and understand fairly complex language, particularly in familiar situations.\nBand 5\nModest user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have partial command of the language, coping with overall meaning in most situations, though is likely to make many mistakes. Should be able to handle basic communication in own field.\nBand 4\nLimited user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have basic competence which is limited to familiar situations. Has frequent problems in understanding and expression. Is not able to use complex language.\nBand 3\nExtremely limited user\nAt this level, you have proven that you can convey and understand only general meaning in very familiar situations. Frequent breakdowns in communication occur.\nBand 2\nIntermittent user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have no real communication except for the most basic information using isolated words or short formula in familiar situations and to meet immediate needs. Has great difficulty understanding spoken and written English.\nBand 1\nNon-user\nAt this level, you have proven that you have essentially no ability to use the language beyond possibly a few isolated words.\nBand 0\nDid not attempt the test\nNo assessable information provided.\n* If the average across the four skills ends in .25, it is rounded up to the next half band, and if it ends in .75, it is rounded up to the next whole band.\nEach university you apply to will have a set of required IELTS scores. To get a general idea, let\u2019s use the University of Miami* as an example, whose program offers admission to Graduate and undergraduate students on the basis of their scores on the Academic version of the IELTS.\nThe minimum requirement for both is a 6.5 on the IELTS.\nLuckily for you, almost every college has their test score requirements easily searchable on their website.

It's a way for universities, colleges and companies to judge if a person is qualified to be one of their students/workers.\nIf you had to read all your textbooks in English, how much would you understand?

IELTS measures a persons ability to communicate in English across all four language skills - listening, reading, writing and speaking. IELTS has been there since 1989 to provide a secure, global, authentic test which measures true to life ability to communicate in English. The IELTS test is jointly conducted by The British Council, IDP:IELTS Australia and University of Cambridge - ESOL Examinations.\nWhy IELTS?\nIELTS is the way to prove your English language skills and open doors to international opportunities.

Admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses is based on the result of these Modules.\nThe General Training Reading and Writing Modules are not designed to test the full range of formal language skills required for academic purpose, but emphasize basic survival skills in a broad social and educational context. General Training is suitable for candidates who are going to English speaking countries to complete their secondary education, to undertake work experience or training programmes not at degree level, or for immigration purpose to Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\nIt is the responsibility of the candidate to inform the test centre whether they wish to take the Academic or General Training Modules. Centres are not responsible for providing this information. The General Training module is not offered at all test administrations. It must be noted that it may not be possible to change module later or on the day of the test.\nWhat is the scoring system of IELTS?\nFrom 1 July 2007, IELTS Band Scores will be more informative. Scores for each part of the test will still be reported on the scale from 1 to 9, but now the Writing and Speaking tests will be reported in whole or half bands in the same way as the Reading and Listening tests.\nCandidates registering for IELTS continue to have the option to specify up to 5 organisations to which their IELTS test scores should be sent. This information is recorded by the centre in their local administration systems and subsequently uploaded to the central IELTS processing systems and websites.\nFor how long is a test result valid?\nAs a general rule it is recommended that a Test Report Form (TRF), that is more than two years old should only be accepted as evidence of present level of ability if accompanied by proof that a candidate has actively maintained or tried to improve their English language proficiency.\nHow do I register for IELTS?\n1--On-line on through the website and pay the test fee by credit card (Master / VISA), and get instant confirmation of your reservation.

IELTS has been there since 1989 to provide a secure, global, authentic test which measures true to life ability to communicate in English. The IELTS test is jointly conducted by The British Council, IDP:IELTS Australia and University of Cambridge - ESOL Examinations.\nWhy IELTS?\nIELTS is the way to prove your English language skills and open doors to international opportunities. Whether you want to migrate or to study or practice your profession in an English-speaking country, IELTS is a must. It opens doors for you to the 3800 educational institutions, government agencies and professional organisations across 120 countries which recognise IELTS scores as a trusted and valid indicator of ability to communicate in English. Among the popular study destinations IELTS is accepted by universities in UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. You cannot be granted an Australian student visa without an IELTS score, TOEFL is not accepted.\nWhere can I appear for IELTS in India?\nYou have to be 16 years and above to sit for IELTS. One can appear for IELTS once a month in the following cities:\nAhmedabad--Amritsar--Bangalore\u2014Chandigarh\u2014Chennai\u2014Delhi\u2014Gurgaon\u2014Hyderabad\u2014Kochi\u2014Ludhiana\u2014Mumbai\u2014Pune\u2014Vadodara.\nFrom 1 May 2006 the policy on candidates re-taking IELTS has been amended. The restriction on re-taking IELTS within 90 days has been removed and candidates are able to repeat the test whenever they wish.\nWhat is the Test Format ?\nAll candidates are tested in Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking Modules. There is a choice of Reading and Writing Modules, where a candidate can either opt for Academic or General Training Module. The total test time is 2hrs 45minutes.\nA-Listening Module:4 sections,40 items in 30 minutes\nB-Academic and General training Reading Module: 3 sections, 40items in 60 minutes.\nC-Academic and General training writing Module:2 tasks (150 and 250 words) in 6o minutes.\nD-Speaking :11-14 minutes.\nThe first three Modules- Listening, Reading and Writing- must be completed in one day. The Speaking Module may be taken, at the discretion of the test centre, either seven days before or after the other three modules.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Academic and General Training Module?\nThe Academic Reading and Writing Modules assess whether a candidate is ready to study or train in the medium of English at an undergraduate or postgraduate level. Admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses is based on the result of these Modules.\nThe General Training Reading and Writing Modules are not designed to test the full range of formal language skills required for academic purpose, but emphasize basic survival skills in a broad social and educational context. General Training is suitable for candidates who are going to English speaking countries to complete their secondary education, to undertake work experience or training programmes not at degree level, or for immigration purpose to Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\nIt is the responsibility of the candidate to inform the test centre whether they wish to take the Academic or General Training Modules. Centres are not responsible for providing this information. The General Training module is not offered at all test administrations. It must be noted that it may not be possible to change module later or on the day of the test.\nWhat is the scoring system of IELTS?\nFrom 1 July 2007, IELTS Band Scores will be more informative. Scores for each part of the test will still be reported on the scale from 1 to 9, but now the Writing and Speaking tests will be reported in whole or half bands in the same way as the Reading and Listening tests.\nCandidates registering for IELTS continue to have the option to specify up to 5 organisations to which their IELTS test scores should be sent. This information is recorded by the centre in their local administration systems and subsequently uploaded to the central IELTS processing systems and websites.\nFor how long is a test result valid?\nAs a general rule it is recommended that a Test Report Form (TRF), that is more than two years old should only be accepted as evidence of present level of ability if accompanied by proof that a candidate has actively maintained or tried to improve their English language proficiency.\nHow do I register for IELTS?\n1--On-line on through the website and pay the test fee by credit card (Master / VISA), and get instant confirmation of your reservation. This is the most convenient way to book your IELTS test\n2--In person at any of the IDP:IELTS Australia Test Centre Planet EDU offices or at any Input Node. Fill the form on-line or use the paper form, pay the fee by Credit Card / Debit card or Demand draft and get instant confirmation / tentative seat booking. This is also a convenient way and ensures seat for you instantly.\n3--By completing the IELTS application form and sending it by Courier, addressed to 'IDP:IELTS Australia Test Centre Planet EDU, 101, Greenwood Plaza, Greenwood City, Sector 45, Gurgaon - 122001, Haryana'. The application will be processed upon receipt and seat will be allocated subject to availability.\nWhat is the IELTS Test fee In India ?\nA--Rs. 7,200/- (Rupees Seven Thousand Two Hundred only), payable by Demand Draft, drawn in favour of ' IELTS India Project ', Payable at New Delhi\nB--Rs. 7,400/- (Rupees Seven Thousand Four Hundred only), payable by Credit card / Debit card\nThe withdrawal administrative charge will be Rs. 1,800/- (Rupees One Thousand Eight Hundred only), which will be deducted from the test fee paid by the applicant if the application for such withdrawal is received 5 WEEKS PRIOR TO THE TEST DATE, and the balance Rs. 5,400/-(Rupees Five Thousand Four Hundred only) will be refunded to the applicant.\nThe fee is subject to change.\nWhat is CB IELTS?\nCB IELTS is s computer-based version of IELTS. It is the same test as the present Pen and Paper test, just delivered differently. It consists of Listening, Reading and Writing tests. The Listening and Reading test MUST be taken on the Computer. The Writing test can be taken EITHER on Computer OR on paper. The Speaking tests will be conducted face-to-face, as is presently done. The CB IELTS is available currently at the New Delhi centre of IDP:IELTS Australia Test Centre Planet EDU in India and is Only for Academic Module.\nLike this article?

It measures ability to communicate in English across all four language skills - listening, reading, writing and speaking - for people who intend to study or work where English is the language of communication.\nWhat level do I need to be?\nMulti-level. You get a score between 1 and 9. Half scores such as 6.5 are possible. Universities often demand an IELTS score of 6 or 7. They may also demand a minimum score in each of the 4 sections.\nHow will it help me?\nIELTS is internationally available, internationally recognised, internationally focused and internationally owned. It opens doors for you to more than 6000 educational institutions, faculties, government agencies and professional organisations across 120 countries which recognise IELTS scores as a trusted and valid indicator of ability to communicate in English. In every sense, IELTS is a truly global test which can take you where you want to go. British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand universities require IELTS scores ranging from 4.5 for foundation courses and some science subjects to 7.5 / 8 for subjects like Law, as proof of applicants having a sufficient level of English to follow courses.\nWhat does the exam consist of?\nYou can choose between the Academic or General Training versions of the test. All candidates do the same Listening and Speaking sections.\nThe test has four sections:\nListening - 4 sections, 40 questions, 30 minutes\nSpeaking - interview, 15 minutes\nReading - different for Academic or General Training - 3 sections, 40 questions, 60 minutes\nWriting - different for Academic or General Training - 2 pieces of writing, 60 minutes\nHow often and where can I take it?\nA candidate can repeat the test as often as they wish. There is no limit to the number of times the candidate can take the IELTS test. We can arrange for you to take the exam at one of the IELTS testing centres in Bangkok or Chiang Mai.\nTop tips for preparing for the exam:\nIf necessary, you can jot down a few notes on the answer sheet. These can be crossed out when you have finished and will not be marked.\nYou must respond to each point mentioned in the task. If you leave something out, you will lose marks.\nIt is worth reading the task several times to make sure you understand it fully, as you will lose marks in the IELTS if you misinterpret the situation.\nIn the listening test, when you transfer your answers to the answer sheet, make sure you follow the same numbering as the questions on the question paper.\nIf you use more than three words in the listening test, your answer is most likely incorrect.\nAs in the listening test, use no more than three words for your answers on the reading test.\nYou do not need to be able to understand all the words in the reading section to be able to answer the question.\nIn the writing section you should describe the trends in the graphs, not just describe the information shown.\nIn the speaking test do not answer yes or no, even if it is applicable with the questions, be prepared to expand your answer.\nTOEFL .\nWhat kind of exam is it?\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) recognizes the ability to deal with reading, speaking, listening to and writing American English at advanced level.\nWhat level do I need to be?\nLower Advanced\nWhat does the exam consist of?\nReading\nThe reading section consists of 3-5 long passages and questions about the passages. The passages are on academic topics; they are the kind of material that might be found in an undergraduate university textbook. Students answer questions about main ideas, details, inferences, sentence restatements, sentence insertion, vocabulary, function and overall ideas. New types of questions in the iBT require paraphrasing, filling out tables, or completing summaries. Generally prior knowledge of the subject under discussion is not necessary to come to the correct answer.\nListening\nThe listening section consists of six long passages and questions about the passages. The passages consist of two student conversations and four academic lectures or discussions. The questions ask the students to determine main ideas, details, function, stance, inferences, and overall organization.\nSpeaking\nThe speaking section consists of six tasks, two independent tasks and four integrated tasks. In the two independent tasks, students must answer opinion questions about some aspect of academic life. In two integrated reading, listening, and speaking tasks, students must read a passage, listen to a passage, and speak about how the ideas in the two passages are related. In two integrated listening and speaking tasks, students must listen to long passages and then summarize and offer opinions on the information in the passages. Test takers are expected to convey information, explain ideas, and defend opinions clearly, coherently, and accurately.\nWriting\nThe writing section consists of two tasks, one integrated task and one independent task. In the integrated task, students must read an academic passage, listen to an academic passage, and write about how the ideas in the two passages are related. In the independent task, students must write a personal essay.\nTask\n"}, {"score": 1353.894, "uuid": "0d892616-ee8d-5806-9a0c-8e47c9fcc8e5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1812wb-19-14005", "target_hostname": "www.collegecanada.net", "target_uri": "http://www.collegecanada.net/TOEFL_Preparation_toronto.php", "page_rank": 1.3623288e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em> courses Toronto - <em>TOEFL</em> Preparation classes Toronto", "snippet": "After improving your Writing skills you can <em>take</em> <em>TOEFL</em> preparation course.

A short background to the test, its format and its uses are given, along with information that might be of use to test candidates and language teachers.\nIELTS tm is a test of academic and vocational English, produced by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES), and jointly managed by the British Council and IDP Australia. It was launched worldwide in 1989 and is used as an indication of the readiness of examinees to participate in academic courses at institutions in many English-speaking countries.\nAvailable at British Council offices worldwide and throughout the IDP network in the Asia Pacific region, over 100,000 took this test in 1999. Although only a small percentage of the global total take the test in Japan, many Japanese sit the test in the UK and Australia prior to embarking on higher education courses.\nApart from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, where IELTS is the preferred entry qualification among universities, over 170 universities in the USA now welcome students with the required IELTS score. A list of institutions where IELTS is accepted is available on the Web at www.ielts.org .\nTest Format\nWhile in Japan TOEFL \u00ae is now available only as a computer-based test, IELTS is only available as a pencil and paper test. A computer-based version is available elsewhere, but pilot studies conducted by the British Council in Tokyo suggested that it would not be popular among Japanese candidates. However, one drawback of using only the pencil and paper test is that the number of candidates is limited by the size of the test venue and the number of test sessions that can be offered.\nThe test is currently offered twice a month in Tokyo and Osaka, and less frequently in Nagoya and Fukuoka. Candidates are advised to book a minimum of four weeks in advance, as sessions are generally oversubscribed. The cost of the revised test remains unchanged at 20,000 yen.\nCandidates elect to take either the Academic or the General Training modules, depending on their reason for taking the test. In Japan, around 80% opt for the Academic modules, reflecting the strong interest in studying abroad. All candidates take the same Listening and Speaking modules, but the Reading and Writing modules vary. While the Academic Reading and Writing modules assess readiness to study in English medium higher education, the General Training modules focus on the survival skills necessary in social and/or secondary education contexts. The tests are task-based, and are designed to reflect the sort of tasks candidates are likely to encounter in reality.\nA band score is awarded for each module, ranging from 0, where the test was not attempted, to a maximum of 9. The global band is calculated from the average of the band scores of each module, and this is reported on a scale at 0.5 intervals. The global average for Academic module candidates in 1999 was 6.19, and among the top ten nationalities, Japan ranked 6th, with an average of 5.84. This was ahead of regional neighbours Taiwan, Thailand, and Hong Kong. The top average score by nationality was 7.0, recorded in India.\n[ p. 2 ]\nThere is no standard required band score for entry to academic courses, as they vary greatly in terms of linguistic demands. However, very broadly speaking, a band score of around 6.0 is required for most undergraduate studies, and 6.5 to 7.0 for post-graduate studies. Some institutions also specify a minimum score in each module.\nThe reliability of the objectively-marked Reading and Listening tests is assured, according to UCLES, by rigorous pretesting, item analysis, and standards fixing. As a result, Cronbach Alphas of between 0.82 and 0.91 were reported for live material introduced in 1998/99 (IELTS Annual Review, 1998/1999.) Writing tasks and elicitation tasks for the Speaking test are pretested for suitability, and reliability for these tests is assured through training, certification, and monitoring of examiners. (IELTS Annual Review, 1998/1999, p. 18), details of which will be given later. However, it was recognised that in order to increase the reliability of the Speaking test, a revision of the format was necessary, and this is discussed below.\nTest Preparation\n\"preparation for direct tests of writing and speaking should really involve other people; for guidance and feedback in the case of the former, and as interlocutors in the latter.\"\nOne potential drawback for candidates used to being able to prepare for a language test by rote learning vocabulary and rules of grammar while standing on a crowded train is the fact that IELTS does not lend itself to this form of preparation. Of course, preparation courses and materials are available, as are practice test books, and these are very valuable means of helping candidates become familiar with the format of the test, particularly the Listening and Reading tests. However, preparation for direct tests of writing and speaking should really involve other people; for guidance and feedback in the case of the former, and as interlocutors in the latter. According to Cambridge, in preparing for their exams, candidates develop skills they need to make practical use of the language, and I would argue by extension that by using the language, whether at work, academically, or socially, candidates are preparing for the exam. For candidates remote from institutions offering preparation courses, Internet-based training for the test is already becoming quite widely offered (see, for example, http://international.holmesglen.vic.edu.au/IELTS01.htm [Expired Link]or http://www.brookes.ac.uk/icels/icels_ancillary/found_acc/icelsexampreparation.html [Expired Link].\nRevision of the STET Speaking Test\nAccording to the 1998/99\nIELTS Annual Review\n, discussion about the revision of the Speaking test was informed by studies conducted between 1992 and 1997. However, apart from the Merrylees and McDowell study (1999), which looked at the reliability of the Speaking test and examiner attitudes to it, and a Brown and Hill study (1998), which investigated interviewer styles and candidate performance, there appear to be no published studies directly relating to the IELTS Speaking test in general, or the Elicitation phase in particular.\nThis suggested that research might have been conducted by, or commissioned by UCLES/IDP for internal use, and this was confirmed by Dr. Lynda Taylor of UCLES (personal communication). Two studies were carried out on the IELTS Speaking test for UCLES by Lazaraton (1998, 2000). The first provided evidence of the effect of examiner language and behaviour on ratings, and contributed to the development of an interlocutor framework for the revised test, while the second provided confirmation of the effectiveness of the revised test, particularly the range of speech functions elicited (Taylor, personal communication). UCLES also commissioned a study of the current Speaking test (Wylie and Hudson, 1994).\n[ p. 3 ]\nResearch into inter-rater reliability (Wylie, 1993) and intra-rater reliability of the IELTS Speaking test (Conlan, Bardsley and Martinson, 1994) was commissioned by the International Editing Committee of IELTS (Taylor, personal communication), but no details of the findings are available.\nThe Revised Speaking Test Format\nThe revised Speaking test format is scheduled to be introduced worldwide in July 2001. According to UCLES, the objectives of the revision are to develop a clearer specification of tasks, in terms of input and expected candidate output; to increase standardisation of test management by the introduction of an examiner frame; and to revise the rating scale descriptors (IELTS, 2000).\nThe revised test will comprise three rather than five phases, but the length will remain the same. In Phase 1, which lasts 4-5 minutes, the candidate will answer general questions about themselves, their homes/families, their jobs/studies, their interests, and a range of similar familiar topic areas.\nIn Phase 2 (3-4 minutes) the candidate will be asked to speak for one to two minutes on a particular topic. The topic is written on a card, and the candidate has one minute to prepare the talk. S/he will be asked one or two follow-up questions.\nIn Phase 3 (4-5 minutes) the examiner and candidate will discuss issues and concepts thematically linked to Phase 2. An outline of the test and sample materials are available on the IELTS Web site.\nExaminer Training\nProspective IELTS Speaking and Writing examiners must first meet the IELTS\nCode of Practice\nqualification requirements. Until recently examiner training consisted of a self-access pack of a videotape, training manual, scripts to be graded, and an audiocassette of interviews to be graded. Potential examiners worked through the material, completing a number of worksheets, although these were not submitted, before awarding grades and submitting them to headquarters for checking. Grades within a certain, undisclosed range of those awarded by senior examiners resulted in examiner status being conferred for the Speaking or Writing test, or both. Failure to meet the standard resulted in the applicant being requested to reassess and resubmit the assessment.\nSince 1999, centres have been encouraged to provide face-to-face training wherever possible. Two days are spent with a trainer, one on the Speaking test and the other on the Writing test. This has proved popular with trainees because it allows them to share ideas about grading, to express doubts and ask questions about the descriptors, and to engage in role-play of the Speaking test (examiner trainer and trainees, personal communication).\nNew examiners for the revised test will be trained after July 2001, but the first half of the year has been spent on the not inconsiderable task of retraining the cadre of current examiners worldwide. In Japan, examiner retraining has taken place in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka, with around fifty examiners attending the one-day sessions. All examiners, current and new, will be required to grade a certification set of recordings of revised format interviews. These will be assessed in Cambridge for accuracy, and successful examiners will be issued with an identifier for use worldwide.\n[ p. 4 ]\nConclusion\nThe IELTS Speaking test has been revised as a result of a number of studies which have helped to improve understanding of test and task design for assessing spoken language ability. It is to be hoped that the new test format, rigorous training, and strict monitoring of examiner performance will result in a speaking test which makes STET fairer and more reliable by candidates, teachers, examiners and receiving institutions.\nReferences\nBrown, A., & Hill, K.

It measures ability to communicate in English across all four language skills - listening, reading, writing and speaking - for people who intend to study or work where English is the language of communication.\nWhat level do I need to be?\nMulti-level. You get a score between 1 and 9. Half scores such as 6.5 are possible. Universities often demand an IELTS score of 6 or 7. They may also demand a minimum score in each of the 4 sections.\nHow will it help me?\nIELTS is internationally available, internationally recognised, internationally focused and internationally owned. It opens doors for you to more than 6000 educational institutions, faculties, government agencies and professional organisations across 120 countries which recognise IELTS scores as a trusted and valid indicator of ability to communicate in English. In every sense, IELTS is a truly global test which can take you where you want to go. British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand universities require IELTS scores ranging from 4.5 for foundation courses and some science subjects to 7.5 / 8 for subjects like Law, as proof of applicants having a sufficient level of English to follow courses.\nWhat does the exam consist of?\nYou can choose between the Academic or General Training versions of the test. All candidates do the same Listening and Speaking sections.\nThe test has four sections:\nListening - 4 sections, 40 questions, 30 minutes\nSpeaking - interview, 15 minutes\nReading - different for Academic or General Training - 3 sections, 40 questions, 60 minutes\nWriting - different for Academic or General Training - 2 pieces of writing, 60 minutes\nHow often and where can I take it?\nA candidate can repeat the test as often as they wish. There is no limit to the number of times the candidate can take the IELTS test. We can arrange for you to take the exam at one of the IELTS testing centres in Bangkok or Chiang Mai.\nTop tips for preparing for the exam:\nIf necessary, you can jot down a few notes on the answer sheet. These can be crossed out when you have finished and will not be marked.\nYou must respond to each point mentioned in the task. If you leave something out, you will lose marks.\nIt is worth reading the task several times to make sure you understand it fully, as you will lose marks in the IELTS if you misinterpret the situation.\nIn the listening test, when you transfer your answers to the answer sheet, make sure you follow the same numbering as the questions on the question paper.\nIf you use more than three words in the listening test, your answer is most likely incorrect.\nAs in the listening test, use no more than three words for your answers on the reading test.\nYou do not need to be able to understand all the words in the reading section to be able to answer the question.\nIn the writing section you should describe the trends in the graphs, not just describe the information shown.\nIn the speaking test do not answer yes or no, even if it is applicable with the questions, be prepared to expand your answer.\nTOEFL .\nWhat kind of exam is it?\nTest of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) recognizes the ability to deal with reading, speaking, listening to and writing American English at advanced level.\nWhat level do I need to be?\nLower Advanced\nWhat does the exam consist of?\nReading\nThe reading section consists of 3-5 long passages and questions about the passages. The passages are on academic topics; they are the kind of material that might be found in an undergraduate university textbook. Students answer questions about main ideas, details, inferences, sentence restatements, sentence insertion, vocabulary, function and overall ideas. New types of questions in the iBT require paraphrasing, filling out tables, or completing summaries. Generally prior knowledge of the subject under discussion is not necessary to come to the correct answer.\nListening\nThe listening section consists of six long passages and questions about the passages. The passages consist of two student conversations and four academic lectures or discussions. The questions ask the students to determine main ideas, details, function, stance, inferences, and overall organization.\nSpeaking\nThe speaking section consists of six tasks, two independent tasks and four integrated tasks. In the two independent tasks, students must answer opinion questions about some aspect of academic life. In two integrated reading, listening, and speaking tasks, students must read a passage, listen to a passage, and speak about how the ideas in the two passages are related. In two integrated listening and speaking tasks, students must listen to long passages and then summarize and offer opinions on the information in the passages. Test takers are expected to convey information, explain ideas, and defend opinions clearly, coherently, and accurately.\nWriting\nThe writing section consists of two tasks, one integrated task and one independent task. In the integrated task, students must read an academic passage, listen to an academic passage, and write about how the ideas in the two passages are related. In the independent task, students must write a personal essay.\nTask\n"}, {"score": 1331.0552, "uuid": "5272658f-9680-51bc-b193-2106790259f1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0110wb-62-17169", "target_hostname": "www.cna-qatar.com", "target_uri": "https://www.cna-qatar.com/testingcentre/Pages/QuestionsIELTS_1-12.aspx", "page_rank": 1.1792036e-09, "spam_rank": 84, "title": "Questions <em>IELTS</em> 1-12", "snippet": "If you want to study using English at undergraduate <em>or</em> postgraduate level <em>or</em> you are applying to nursing <em>or</em> medical councils, you <em>should</em> <em>take</em> <em>the</em> Academic Module.", "explanation": null, "document": "[ top ]\n7.

Which one will an employer ask for? Which one will help you study in a college abroad? Think of this English language exam as your plane ticket. Without it, you cannot go through the gate and board the airplane. And since we really want you to catch your flight, we\u2019ve answered all the questions for you.\nThe 5 W\u2019s of the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)\nWHO \u2022 WHY \u2022 WHAT \u2022 WHERE \u2022 WHEN\nWho takes the TOEFL exam?\nThis is important. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of signing up and preparing, only to realize you had been nervous about a test you didn\u2019t have to take.\nSo who takes the TOEFL exam? Well, since 2005, over 25 million people in 180 countries around the world have taken it! The reason for this? Simple. The TOEFL exam scores are the only among the English language exams that are accepted by over 7,500 institutions worldwide, including academic and government agencies. In other words, if you are applying to major institutions abroad, your TOEFL exam scores will likely be accepted. Of course, it is crucial that you verify with the particular institution you are applying to and make sure they accept the TOEFL scores. You can do this by simply checking their website for requirements or calling them directly.\nAmong the 25 million who have taken it are people just like you:\nSomeone who wishes to study abroad in an institution of higher learning (think college, masters degrees, in some cases \u2013 even high schools)\nSomeone who is eager to put his or her English to practice in a work environment abroad\nSomeone who needs to apply for their visa, a scholarship or any other important documents that require validation of your English speaking proficiency skills.\nBut guess what? While the TOEFL exam can take you many places, it is also useful in your own country. Some universities and businesses in countries where English is not the national language, may require TOEFL exam scores to fulfill a students foreign language credit requirement or to test the proficiency of a possible new employee.\nWhy should you take the TOEFL exam?\nYour TOEFL score might just be the single factor that determines an acceptance into a university, a yes to a paycheck and simply \u2013 a stamp on your passport. In order to get your foot in the door, it is important to have a respected test on your side. Being able to offer a tangible proof of your proficiency in English as a second language is crucial to your success abroad.\nAnd again, over 7,500 colleges and institutions around the world accept the TOEFL scores. That\u2019s no coincidence!\nWhat exactly is the TOEFL and what can I expect to see on it?\nIf you fall under any of the above categories, then it is likely you are a candidate to take the TOEFL. But before you sign up, you must understand and be prepared for what the TOEFL will actually test you on. Simply, the TOEFL exam is designed to measure how well you would be able to understand and communicate in an English-speaking classroom. Passing the exam would then validate your skills and inform the institution you are applying to that you are in fact an proficient English speaker. As a result, the passages and questions asked on the exam could probably be found on the pages of a college-level textbook. For example, you might be asked to read a passage and answer questions that make you analyze cause and effect or push you to think critically and analyze themes.\nThe price for the exam is between $150 and $250 US dollars (Hey, when you think about it, it\u2019s a cheap plane ticket). Click here to view the TOEFL format to familiarize yourself with the exam.\nYour TOEFL exam score is basically a series of numbers that will translate to your future school or employer as: \u201cThis is how much and how well I speak English.\u201d\nOf course, this all depends on your performance on the exam. Your TOEFL exam score will be the tangible proof you will need to internationally represent your verbal and written skills in English.\nOkay, so what you really want to know is: \u201cWhat score do I need to get in?\u201d\nWhile a perfect score is probably your best guarantee, it\u2019s not always realistic (don\u2019t worry, universities know this!)\nUnderstanding your Score\nEach university you apply to will have a set of required TOEFL scores. To get a general idea, let\u2019s use the University of Miami* as an example, whose program offers admission to international students for full-time academics as well as admission into an Intensive English Program.\nFor the TOEFL Internet-Based Test:\nFull-time academics admission: Total score at least 80\nIntensive English program admission: Total score below 61\nFor the TOEFL Paper-Based Test:\nFull-time academics admission: Total score at least 550\nIntensive English program admission: Total score below 500\nLuckily for you, almost every college has their test score requirements easily searchable on their website. Just go to your search engine and type the name of the college/university/program you are applying to and \u2018TOEFL requirements\u2019.\n*Each programs test score requirements may vary. Make sure to verify with the program you are applying to.\nWhen and Where can you take the TOEFL exam?\nWith high international demand, the Internet-Based Test is offered on 30-40 test dates a year and the Paper-Based Test on six dates. The wonderful thing is that you can take the exam as many times as you\u2019d like without penalty from your institution. In other words, the institutions asking for your TOEFL exam scores will not turn you away if you have taken the exam more than once and have received different scores on it. However, some might ask for your most recent score or one might ask for your highest score \u2013 so calling and verifying with the institution directly is your best bet. The only downside to taking the test too many times is that you have to pay a registration fee every time you take it. Colleges don\u2019t care, but your wallet might!\nYou\u2019re in luck! With over 4,500 locations in 165 countries, you will probably not have any problems finding a place to take it.

No problem, you think, maybe an easy grammar question, or a comment on how they enjoyed the class (or not!)... or maybe it's a question about an ESL exam. \"What's the difference between TOEFL and TOEIC?\" \"Should I take the FCE?\" \"Who recognizes IELTS?\" So if you don't know your BEC from your KET, or your CAE from your CELS, here's a brief guide to the most popular ESL exams.\nESL exams fall broadly into three main categories: General English, Business English and Academic English.\nGeneral English\nProbably the most popular in this category are the Cambridge ESOL exams. One and a half million people in 135 countries take Cambridge exams every year. There are five General English exams, sometimes referred to as the \"Cambridge Main Suite.\"\nThe first two levels are the KET (Key English Test) and the PET (Preliminary English Test). The KET and PET have reading and writing, listening, and speaking components, and are most often used to assess progress or to prepare for the next exam in the series. The PET is also recognized by some employers and universities. KET and PET have two pass grades, Pass with merit and Pass.\nNext up from the PET is the FCE (First Certificate in English). The FCE has five sections, reading, writing, use of English, listening and speaking. It is widely recognized by employers and educational institutions and so is very popular with students who want to study or work abroad.\nMany universities and employers, however, prefer the CAE (Certificate in Advanced English), which is the next level up. This exam shows that a student is capable of following a university course or can function in a range of business contexts.\nAfter the CAE comes the CPE (Certificate of Proficiency in English), the highest level in the series. Students who pass this exam have the ability to function effectively in almost every English speaking context. The CPE is also a typical requirement for non-native speakers who want to train as English teachers. Students typically need 3 years of study after passing the FCE to reach this level (depending, of course, on how often they study and other factors).\nFCE, CAE and CPE have five grades, A-E, of which A-C are passes.\nCambridge also has a series of General English exams for Young Learners aged between 7 and 12 (YLE). There are three exams in the series, Starters, Movers and Flyers. They are taken mainly as a means of measuring progress, and also as preparation for the KET and PET. There is no pass or fail - students are awarded up to five \"shields\" for each component (reading and writing, listening, speaking).\nOther General English exams\nCambridge also offers CELS (Certificates in English Language Skills). These are individual exams in each of the four skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking). Students can choose which of the exams they want to take, according to their strengths and requirements.\nPitman, part of the British City and Guilds Group, is another examining body with a series of General English exams. The International ESOL covers listening, reading and writing, and the International Spoken ESOL is a one to one structured interview. Both have six levels, from basic to advanced.\nBusiness English\nEvery year four and a half million people take the TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication), run by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The TOEIC is a multiple choice exam in two sections, listening and reading, each scored out of 445, giving a total of 990. Many companies and government agencies use TOEIC as a criterion for recruiting or promoting staff, or for sending staff abroad. Some universities also use TOEIC, requiring their business school students to achieve a particular score prior to graduation, for example.\nCambridge also has a series of business exams called the BEC (Business English Certificate). BEC comes in three levels, Preliminary, Vantage and Higher. The types of exam task are similar to those in the Cambridge Main Suite, but test language ability in a business context. They are recognized by many employers worldwide, and students take them to demonstrate language skills required for international business. There are two pass grades for BEC, Pass with merit and Pass.\nOther Business English exams\nCambridge offers BULATS (The Business Language Testing Service). BULATS is designed specifically for companies and organizations to test the language ability of employees who need English in their work, and for students and employees on language and business courses.\nPitman has a three-level series of exams called English for Business Communications, which tests business writing ability, and English for Office Skills, a two-level series designed to test the ability to carry out office-related tasks where accuracy in writing and following instructions is important.\nAcademic English\nA common question from students is \"What's the difference between TOEIC and TOEFL?\" Well, both are run by ETS, but whereas TOEIC evaluates language skills for the workplace, TOEFL evaluates language skills in an academic context. It is therefore used primarily as a prerequisite for admission to universities and colleges. More than 5000 colleges and universities in 90 countries recognize the exam. During 2005 and 2006, TOEFL is phasing in a new internet-based test (iBT), which will replace the current computer-based and paper-based exams. The iBT has 4 sections, reading, listening, speaking and writing, each with a score of 30, giving a total score of 120. This is likely to cause some confusion for a while, as most students and universities are used to working with the paper-based total of 677, or the computer-based total of 300!\nCambridge also has an academic exam, the IELTS (International English Language Testing System), which they jointly manage with the British Council and IDP:IELTS Australia. IELTS is recognized by universities and colleges, as well as employers, immigration authorities and professional bodies. The exam has listening, reading, writing and speaking components. For the reading and writing, students can choose between an academic and a general option. IELTS is scored on a scale of 1-9.\nComparing levels\nOne of the most common questions from students is how exams in the different categories compare to each other. Is the FCE equivalent to one of the BEC exams? If I have the CAE, what TOEFL score can I expect? Luckily, we have a reference guide to help us here, called the \"Common European Framework of Reference for Languages\" (CEF). The CEF divides language learners into six levels, and enables us to compare all the ESL exams according to these levels.\nThe six levels are A1 (Breakthrough), A2 (Waystage), B1 (Threshold), B2 (Vantage), C1 (Effective Operational Proficiency), and C2 (Mastery).\nHere's a quick comparison of exams at the different levels. Bear in mind that this is a general guide only -- students' scores in different exams will of course depend on many factors, such as preparation time and motivation!\nA1: YLE Movers, Pitman ESOL Basic, IELTS score 1-2.\nA2: KET, YLE Flyers, Pitman ESOL Elementary, TOEIC score 246-380, TOEFL iBT score 32-42, IELTS score 3.\nB1: PET, TOEIC score 381-540, BEC Preliminary, TOEFL iBT score 43-61, IELTS score 3.5-4.5.\nB2: FCE, Pitman ESOL Intermediate, TOEIC score 541-700, BEC Vantage, TOEFL iBT score 62-91, IELTS score 5-6.\nC1: CAE, Pitman ESOL Higher Intermediate, TOEIC score 701-910, BEC Higher, TOEFL iBT score 92-112, IELTS score 6.5-7.\nC2: CPE, Pitman ESOL Advanced, TOEIC score 911-990, TOEFL iBT score 113-120, IELTS score 7.5-9.\nThere is of course much more information about these exams on the Cambridge ESOL, TOEIC, TOEFL and Pitman websites -- you will find the links at this ESL exams resource.\nAbout the Author\nKeith Taylor is the founder of eslbase.com, providing free resources, information and advice for TEFL teachers, and a directory of TEFL jobs and TEFL courses worldwide.

It contains about 34-51 questions overall. Its goal is to measure the test takers\u2019 ability to communicate in an academic setting. Even if the test is computer-based, test takers may take written notes throughout the entire test.\nThe format of the listening test is in two parts: Conversations and Lectures.\nConversations\nThe test will include about 2-3 conversations. Each conversation is about 3 minutes long and will have 5 questions related to it.\nExamples of conversations in an academic setting would be: a meeting with a professor or instructor or a conversation with university staff or other students. For each conversation, pictures of the scene are shown so you can visualize the setting and participants.\nIn most cases each verbal exchange will be heard only once, but you may take notes while listening and refer back to those notes at any time during the exam.\nLectures\nThe test will include about 4-6 lectures. Each lecture is 3-5 minutes long and has about 500-800 words. Each lecture will include 6 questions.\nThe lectures you will listen to in the exam are samples of the kinds of communication that occur in an academic setting. They generally include a professor speaking. In some of the lectures, there is dialog between the professor and students. In all the lectures, a picture will be shown of the people involved and the setting. You do not need to have background knowledge on the subject of the lecture to complete the test.\nAs with the conversations part you will be able to take notes and refer back to those notes to answer your questions.\nHow to Prepare for the Listening Exam\nAs with all TOEFL test preparation, the student should prepare for the Listening exam by practicing as much as possible. Practice is the most productive way to prepare for the exam. There are many practice tests that can be found by searching online. I have found a free TOEFL Listening Lecture with sample test questions as well as free TOEFL Listening Test online.\nClick here for a link to sample test questions for all sections of the exam. (For the Listening section, this sample test shows a transcript of the spoken parts rather than an audio recording. However, it gives good examples of the types of questions asked.)\nIn addition to taking practice tests, I highly recommend listening to a variety of talk radio programs, such as those on NPR or the BBC to gain more practice listening to spoken English. A good exercise to do would be to listen to a portion of a broadcast and write down the conversation as you listen. Then listen to the broadcast again and check to see if you understood the words that were spoken.\nSince some of the questions may require the listener to draw conclusions about the speaker\u2019s feelings toward what is being said, it may also be helpful to think about this while listening to broadcasts. It may even be useful to listen to English lectures and speeches. Click here for a link to a great site with a wide variety of video speeches.\nGeneral Tips and Information for the Listening Exam:\nFor many people, the Listening section is the hardest part of the TOEFL test. Be sure you practice and prepare adequately.\nTake notes on the conversation while you are listening. Practice note-taking during your test practice sessions as well.\nThere may be a question that measures your understanding of a speaker\u2019s attitude toward what they are speaking about. This requires you to listen to voice tones and inflection to deduce how the speaker feels. Be sure to keep this in mind during your practice.\nSome questions will refer back to a particular part of the lecture or conversation. In this case you will see a headphone icon, and that part of the conversation will be replayed for you.\nYou will hear the questions on your headphones and see them on the screen at the same time.\nThere is not a time limit for each question, but there is an overall time limit for the section. Keep this in mind when answering questions.\nYou must answer each question as it appears.\nYou cannot skip a question or go back to previous questions.\nResources for Test Preparation\nThere are many resources available online for preparing yourself to take the TOEFL test. I encourage you to use a variety of resources. In addition, working with an experienced TOEFL teacher can help you receive advice on how to improve your listening skills.\nIf you are looking for more help preparing for the TOEFL exam, I do offer private tutoring for TOEFL preparation. I am a qualified ESL tutor and have successfully coached many English learners. I would also be happy to give you some personal tips on how to prepare for success on this exam.\nTo schedule your free introductory lesson, contact me today!\nor simply fill out the contact form

The TOEFL is taken by thousands of students every year and although US universities and colleges are starting to accept a broader range of English language proficiency tests, TOEFL still remains the most widely recognised test for admission to degree programmes and many other college courses. TOEFL is also accepted by some universities outside the US.\nStudy English with the Tutorium in Intensive English at UIC. Our program is the most highly accredited in all of Chicago.\nFind out more\nIf you are not a native speaker of English but have studied in an English-speaking country for at least three years, US colleges will probably waive the TOEFL requirement. However, this is done on a case-by-case basis, and you must check with each individual institution rather than assume that you do not have to take the test.\nThe TOEFL Information Bulletin\nIf the colleges you are applying to require a TOEFL score, the first thing you need to do is obtain the TOEFL information bulletin. This free booklet provides information on how to register for the TOEFL, fees and payment methods, registration forms, a list of test centres, what happens on the test day, scoring information, and some sample questions. As it contains so much information, the booklet is quite long, but a thorough reading will pay off in terms of following the correct registration procedures and a clear understanding of the test. The bulletin is available on the TOEFL Website at www.ets.org/toefl , and is also available by mail from the test administrators (or from their local representatives in some countries), as well as from US educational advising centres around the world. To find the closest source to you, either consult the TOEFL Website or contact a US Embassy or Consulate for details of your nearest US educational advising centre.\nThe TOEFL is currently offered as an Internet-based test (iBT) or paper-based test (pBT). Both tests are administered at secure testing centres in various cities around the world where there a number of people taking the test at the same time on computer workstations.\nThe internet-based test has four mandatory sections which assess reading (36 - 70 questions), listening (34 - 51 questions), speaking (6 tasks), and writing skills (2 tasks).\nWhere the internet-based test is not yet available, the paper-based test will be given.\nYou can register for TOEFL by mail, fax, telephone and online. There are registration centres worldwide, whose details are in the TOEFL bulletin. To register by fax, telephone or online, you need a credit card. Payments by mail can be made by cheque in US dollars or a number of other currencies, by credit card or by other methods, all of which are detailed in the information bulletin.\nSome test centres are extremely busy so it is wise to register well in advance of when you plan to take the test.\nOnce your registration has been processed, you will be told your actual test date and the full test centre address. In many countries there are strict security procedures on the day of the test, so make sure you know what identification you will have to take with you to the test centre.\nPreparing for the TOEFL\nAt the very least, it is wise to familiarise yourself with the test format and practice some test questions before you arrive at the test centre. The amount of practice you will need to do will depend on your English language ability, the time available before you take the test, and how familiar you feel with the test format. While the TOEFL information bulletin provides some sample questions, there are also various TOEFL preparation materials produced by both the test administrators (the Educational Testing Service) and by independent test preparation companies. The test administrators' materials focus on practising actual past questions and complete tests, while the latter are independent companies which aim to help students improve their performance on the test using a variety of strategies and techniques. Materials are available for purchase on the Educational Testing Service (ETS) website, and may also be available in bookstores or from your nearest US educational advising centre. Before buying materials, check the contents to find out whether they provide preparation for the computer-based or paper-based TOEFL.\nIn addition, a number of organisations offer test training courses or private tuition for the TOEFL for a fee. US educational advisory centres can usually provide you with a list of test trainers, but many trainers advertise in educational publications. Some things to consider before signing up for a course include how many hours of tuition are provided, whether the tuition is provided on videotape or by a 'live' teacher, what training and experience the teachers have, and how they measure your improvement throughout the course. If the course is offered at an English language school, check what accreditation the school holds. If you are not sure about a course, ask if you can sit in on a class as an observer, or speak to past participants.\nEach section on the TOEFL iBT test (reading, writing, listening and speaking) is scored on a scale of 0-30. The total score is the sum of all the four skill scores and is on a scale of 0 - 120.\nThe total paper-based test score is reported on a scale that ranges from 310 - 677.\nYour scores will be sent by ETS to up to four of the institutions you specified when you registered. This service is included in the price of the registration fee.\nWhat score do you need for entry into a US degree programme?\nThis will vary, with each college setting it's own minimum. Check your college or university's website for their specific requirements.\nEnglish language test scores are just one part of the admission process for colleges, but an important part. Plan ahead, read the registration information thoroughly and give yourself plenty of time to prepare for the test and for the scores to reach the colleges. For further information on the TOEFL consult www.ets.org/toefl , or contact your nearest US educational advising centre for help with this and other aspects of applying to study in the USA.\nAuthor\nDirector, US Educational Advisory Service\nThe Fulbright Commission\nLast Updated on Thursday, 04 November 2010 12:51\nUser Rating:\n"}, {"score": 1291.1676, "uuid": "1f7376b0-52ef-5755-9138-3e70f988dba1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1305wb-48-13142", "target_hostname": "www.test-guide.com", "target_uri": "http://www.test-guide.com/answers-for-you-concerning-the-ielts-test-dates.html", "page_rank": 1.2087602e-09, "spam_rank": 73, "title": "Answers For You Concerning <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> Test Dates | <em>IELTS</em> - Test-Guide.com", "snippet": "Home <em>IELTS</em> Exam Answers For You Concerning <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> Test Dates One of <em>the</em> first things that you <em>should</em> know about <em>IELTS</em> test dates is that there are not specific scheduled dates.", "explanation": null, "document": "Answers For You Concerning The IELTS Test Dates\nAnswers For You Concerning The IELTS Test Dates\nOne of the first things that you should know about IELTS test dates is that there are not specific scheduled dates. The IELTS or International English Language Testing System is a test that is meant for people who are able to speak English at an intermediate level or higher. However if you are at a lower level you can still get test results but some accommodations might have to be made.\nIf you do not do well the first time that you take the test you are going to be able to continue to take it over again until you get that desired score. There are no set dates because there are so many testing centers. This gives the centers the freedom to be able to offer tests as they are needed in their area.\nIt is most common to see the testing centers offering about one test per month an in some cases many more during certain times of the year. You can take the test nearly everywhere since there are centers in over one hundred and five countries at nearly three hundred centers. If you want to know the appropriate places that were available for the testing then you should consider contacting one of the main offices which include the IDP Education Australia, the British Council, and the UCLES.\nThere is no certificate but you will receive a results list that shows you where you rated in each area of the English language. Plus you are going to only be able to use the score for two years. You will have to be able to prove that you can use English to communicate effectively and will be retested as needed.\nWhen the scores are combined from the test you will have an overall score which is what is most important. Plus the results will be to you very quickly after the test which is nice so you can make sure as to whether or not you need to take the test again. Keep in mind that you can score high enough in one area but not in another which would still require retesting in all areas.\nDepending on how you are studying the English language and how hard you are working improving your score can be done more quickly for some then others. One of the biggest things to think about is how much you are going to be able to study and focus on the information that you need to learn. If you have a hard time you can even choose a preparatory class since there are so many available.\nEven though there is no reason to study in a language school prior to taking the test there are many reasons that you might want to. One of these is that the classes will help you to be best prepared for all areas of learning for the language.

Good luck \u2013 and remember <em>the</em> note card is there to help you and guide you; so make <em>the</em> most out of it!", "explanation": null, "document": "Using the IELTS Interview Note Card\nWho knew note cards could be so stressful?\nAfter all, students use note cards to study all the time! They are cheap, easy to use, and efficiently present information. Still, the note card provided during Part 2 of the IELTS interview causes students to shake in their boots and revive old, nail biting habits. This is because Part 2 is arguably the toughest part of the Interview.\nThe examiner gives you a note card with a set of related questions on a specific topic: for example, the grading system in universities or the use of mobile phones. You then have one minute of preparation time to think about what to say in response to these questions. Often, students feel the most stressed out during this part. They read the note card over and over again, but only gloss over the words each time. They have trouble thinking of something coherent to say, because the time constraint adds additional pressure. As a result, their ensuing monologue is limited and sounds ill prepared. Nevertheless \u2013 there are certain measures you can take to make the most out of Part 2 and therefore maximize your overall score in the Interview section. These measures involve using the note card optimally. Below, we\u2019ve outlined some steps for you to follow. Review these guidelines thoroughly, and have a family member or friend do a few trial runs with you. This way, you are organized before you show up for the real Interview \u2013 and know fully that you can ace Part 2!\nWhen you receive the note card, read everything on it twice. When you read it the first time, try to grasp the main points or basic subject that is being addressed. During this time, circle the main topic; this is usually found in the first two lines. Then, when you read the note card the second time, look for specific information that you need to respond to. During the second read, underline the exact information that you need to think about and discuss.\nNow you that you know what the note card contains, you are ready to engage with it. Re-read the first question, and think of one quick point you can make in regard to it. As you think of your point, write down one or two key words to remind yourself of the point you are trying to make. You can write these words in English or in your native language; you will not be marked on what you write. However, you should strive to think of English words since you are being tested in English. Additionally, the translating process from English to your native language consumes valuable time \u2013 and you only have one minute to prepare.\nRepeat this process for the remaining questions. Try not to think of elaborate things to say; just note down some basic words. You will have time to elaborate when it is your turn to speak. In general, you should plan to spend about 5 to 10 seconds thinking about each point you are going to make.\nConcentrate on grammar for the rest of your preparation time. What kind of tenses do you need to use to explain your points? Do you need to use the past, present \u2013 the conditional? Additionally, think about adjectives, nouns, and other devices that you need to employ to flesh out your points. Are there any personal experiences or memories that you can describe that will give you more support? If so, start scribbling these down.\nWhen your time is up, the interviewer will let you know. When you speak, first introduce your subject material in some way: \u201cI will discuss,\u201d or \u201cNow I\u2019m going to explain.\u201d But keep it brief! Then, launch into the points you made on your note card. Make sure you answer all of the questions; and try to spend the same amount of time on each one (roughly, 30 to 45 seconds). You should be able to speak for 1.5 to 2 minutes without assistance from the examiner. Once you are done, make a conclusive remark: \u201cThis is why I believe mobile phones should not be used in the classroom.\nGood luck \u2013 and remember the note card is there to help you and guide you; so make the most out of it!\nSource: Myielts\n"}, {"score": 1269.1252, "uuid": "84712f1c-522a-54cf-9561-db8cb46908a4", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-00-10263", "target_hostname": "edusoftech.com", "target_uri": "http://edusoftech.com/wEPDwULLTE0MDkxNzYwNDNkZA==", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "GRE, GMAT, SAT, Mock, <em>TOEFL</em>, <em>IELTS</em>, Test Preparation CD, Online Exam Practice", "snippet": "&#x27;<em>TOEFL</em> BIG CD saved my life. <em>I</em> waited until <em>the</em> last minute to <em>take</em> <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> and used this product to cram. <em>The</em> section on Listening Comprehension helped me <em>the</em> most because that&#x27;s my weakest skill. <em>I</em> can read and write English well, but <em>I</em> can&#x27;t always understand spoken English.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1268.9866, "uuid": "4eedb268-39fe-5c51-9454-5e9b45b941e7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1801wb-81-12965", "target_hostname": "edusoftech.com", "target_uri": "http://edusoftech.com/index.asp", "page_rank": 1.8140265e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "GRE, GMAT, SAT, Mock, <em>TOEFL</em>, <em>IELTS</em>, Test Preparation CD, Online Exam Practice", "snippet": "&#x27;<em>TOEFL</em> BIG CD saved my life. <em>I</em> waited until <em>the</em> last minute to <em>take</em> <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> and used this product to cram. <em>The</em> section on Listening Comprehension helped me <em>the</em> most because that&#x27;s my weakest skill. <em>I</em> can read and write English well, but <em>I</em> can&#x27;t always understand spoken English.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1265.4103, "uuid": "fcabe653-1bc7-549b-a621-39e98e3778bb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1802wb-10-14142", "target_hostname": "edusoftech.com", "target_uri": "http://edusoftech.com/128.2.207.79", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "GRE, GMAT, SAT, Mock, <em>TOEFL</em>, <em>IELTS</em>, Test Preparation CD, Online Exam Practice", "snippet": "&#x27;<em>TOEFL</em> BIG CD saved my life. <em>I</em> waited until <em>the</em> last minute to <em>take</em> <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> and used this product to cram. <em>The</em> section on Listening Comprehension helped me <em>the</em> most because that&#x27;s my weakest skill. <em>I</em> can read and write English well, but <em>I</em> can&#x27;t always understand spoken English.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1260.6295, "uuid": "34fc1ab4-a7fe-547d-acd3-8cdd278e9884", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1801wb-64-11524", "target_hostname": "edusoftech.com", "target_uri": "http://edusoftech.com/", "page_rank": 1.174531e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "GRE, GMAT, SAT, Mock, <em>TOEFL</em>, <em>IELTS</em>, Test Preparation CD, Online Exam Practice", "snippet": "&#x27;<em>TOEFL</em> BIG CD saved my life. <em>I</em> waited until <em>the</em> last minute to <em>take</em> <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> and used this product to cram. <em>The</em> section on Listening Comprehension helped me <em>the</em> most because that&#x27;s my weakest skill. <em>I</em> can read and write English well, but <em>I</em> can&#x27;t always understand spoken English.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1266.1964, "uuid": "2ac996b4-fed1-5a3a-9e35-9f647a83d7cb", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-92-09924", "target_hostname": "www.rxpgonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rxpgonline.com/forum23.htm", "page_rank": 1.1939768e-09, "spam_rank": 86, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em> Forum - Latest Posts", "snippet": "4 2K claireh 3 years ago by riseandshine How can <em>i</em> prepare for <em>the</em> <em>toefl</em> ?????", "explanation": null, "document": "This forum will deal with all the problems and discussions regarding the TOEFL Exam\nRxPG Forum Rank: 715\n"}, {"score": 1261.5398, "uuid": "6e379741-9a04-57e1-88a6-5ec57219232f", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1502wb-13-29564", "target_hostname": "thelinguist.blogs.com", "target_uri": "http://thelinguist.blogs.com/how_to_learn_english_and/toefl_toeic/page/2/", "page_rank": 1.17443e-09, "spam_rank": 69, "title": "<em>The</em> Linguist On Language - Having Fun Learning Languages: <em>TOEFL</em>, TOEIC", "snippet": "<em>I</em> continue to see ads like these popping up all over <em>the</em> internet: You can substitute <em>TOEFL</em> <em>or</em> <em>IELTS</em> in any of those ads.

You can listen by clicking here .\nTOEFL or Test of English as a Foreign Language\nETS is a company which develops tests. This is big business as millions of people around the world take these tests. ETS describes itself as having set the standard for English testing since 1964 when it created TOEFL which ETS claims to be accurate, reliable and fair. Universities have, in fact, found TOEFL to be very unreliable and inaccurate. As a result TOEFL has now come up with a new version to try to get closer to their stated goal of being accurate, reliable and fair.\nTraditionally TOEFL and TOEIC and other similar tests have relied on multiple choice, fill in the blank and similar gimmicky ways of testing people\u2019s language skills, because such tests are easy to mark. Unfortunately these methods create problems as test takers focus on the technique of doing these tests rather than on the language skills themselves.\nThe new TOEFL tests keeps some of these gimmicky features but puts more importance on what they call integrated skills, the ability to read and listen and then express oneself in writing or speaking, in other words old fashioned written and oral expression. (So who needs TOEFL then?)\nIn the new TOEFL, questions are either on a general (\u201cfamiliar\u201d) subject or on an academic subject. Test takers typically have to read or listen and then answer questions, either of the multiple choice/fill in the blank type or in the form of oral or written expression. The oral or written expression can be an answer to a specific question or a summary of some content that the test taker has been asked to read or listen to.\nIn the test of writing, the test taker has 30 minutes to write an independent text of a minimum of 300 words. I would imagine that there is no advantage in writing any more than the minimum, but rather it is best to be clear, accurate and well-organized in a short and effective answer. In the case of a summary or response to reading and listening, the test taker has 20 minutes to write 150-225 words.\nFor the speaking or oral response section, the test taker has 15 seconds to prepare an answer and then must speak for 45 seconds. In the case of a read/listen/respond type of question the test taker has 45 seconds to read 100 words, then listens to a short lecture and then has 30 seconds to prepare a response of 60 seconds in length.\nThe oral and written expression by the test taker is marked based on whether it is clear, accurate and well-organized. Obviously to mark this kind of question is more time consuming and more subjective than computer based correction of multiple choice type questions. It is also more meaningful, more accurate and more reliable.\nIn my view the new TOEFL test with its belated greater emphasis on actually speaking and writing will be better than the previous test. However, the test is still unfair. Why should an economics student be asked to answer questions on biology or vice versa? One of our principles at The Linguist is meaningful content. If learners choose content of interest to them, they will not only understand it better, they will improve their language skills better. If they write or speak on subjects that are familiar or interesting they will do a much better job. Test takers should really only be tested on their ability to express themselves about things that matter to them. The TOEFL test remains artificial, like so much of what happens in language classes.\nIdeally one day this general kind of universal test will be replaced by a customized measurement of the language competence of each individual, and in a variety of languages. This is what we are preparing in the new version of The Linguist. An ongoing record of a learner\u2019s language activity, vocabulary range, samples of written and oral expression (done the same way as in the new TOEFL test) can be accumulated on each learner\u2019s personal portfolio. Each learner will be able to edit his or her own portfolio and then allow a potential employer, educational institution or other organization to view it. This way each person can be evaluated based on what he or she is able to do in a language and that can be compared to the requirements of a job or school. Nowadays when so many native English speakers have trouble expressing themselves in their own language, such a portfolio could include one\u2019s native language as well as other languages.\nIn the meantime, given the fact that it is impossible to know what kind of \u201cfamiliar\u201d subject or academic subject will be covered in the new TOEFL, the best way to prepare remains massive input. Massive input through reading and listening to a lot of content, combined with a systematic way of acquiring words and phrases is always the best way to build up language competence. This language competence needs to be built up gradually and then tested regularly in writing and speaking with corrective feedback from a tutor.\nGood students will supplement this with broad based activities in English including reading, watching films, meeting with English speaking friends etc. However, at the core of all of these activities there should be an integrated learning environment and community of learners and tutors to encourage, stimulate, provide feedback and measure progress.\u00a0 These are the elements that we seek to provide at The Linguist.\n"}], [{"score": 1259.3109, "uuid": "0f834b78-91a6-5602-bd2e-aea4ad70a0c1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0209wb-85-07571", "target_hostname": "www.rxpgonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rxpgonline.com/article1319.html", "page_rank": 1.2256153e-09, "spam_rank": 90, "title": "Writing Task II of <em>IELTS</em> <em>IELTS</em>", "snippet": "Task <em>I</em> deals with report writing on information provided to you in <em>the</em> form of diagram, flow chart <em>or</em> graphs.

In my view, 300 words is a decent target to be on the safe side.\nMake sure that you have practiced well before hand so that you know approximately what length of your hand writing makes 250-300 words on an average A4 paper. This will save you from the arduous task of counting each and every word on the test day, especially when you have very limited time in hand.\nThe Practice:\nPractice is the key to success.

Telecommuting is growing in many countries and is expected to be common for most office workers in the coming decades. How do you think society will be affected by the growth of telecommuting? \u0093\nUnderstand the fact that you should read the question completely and upto the last line.\nLearn to identify \u0091factual\u0092 lines and \u0091subjective\u0092 lines.\nIn the above example there are 2 factual statements :\n\u27ae Telecommuting refers to workers doing their jobs from home for part of each week and communicating with their office using computer technology.\n\u27ae Telecommuting is growing in many countries and is expected to be common for most office workers in the coming decades.\nHowever, there is just one subjective statement :\nHow do you think society will be affected by the growth of telecommuting?\nIt the subjective statement which determines the main theme of dicussion in your topic.\nLike say, in the above example you can write pages on \u0091Telecommunication\u0092 , but here what u need to answer is how this telecommunication is effecting social lives of the people.\nMark the Key words and Arrange a Vocabulary List :\nThis is good practice.\nMark the key words in the question and list down the all the related words synonyms you can think of.\nThis list can be very meagere when you actually start to practice. But don\u0092t get disheartened. Keep a dictionary/thesaurus handy. Select appropriate words and make a good list. The aim of this list is to utilize these words when you actually start to write the real essay.\nPlan your ideas :\nThis is a very individual and personal thing but matters a lot on your score. As soon as you see the question plan what exactly you would like to discuss in the given topic.\nDecide if you want to discuss \u0091FOR\u0092 the topic or \u0091AGAINST\u0092 the topic or that you want to discuss both the aspects in your task.\nIf you can think of a good example to quote, write down the keyword in the rough area so that you wont forget it later when you are in total flow of writing.\nTo get good and solid ideas for your essays, it is important that you read as many articles as possible, from a standard good english daily/ magazine.\nIts not necessary nor ideal that you quote down everything mentioned in an article in your essay. While reading an article learn to identify the points you think you can elaborate upon. Learn to use these ideas in your essay.\nStructure your Essay :\nAn essay has 3 main parts : Introduction, Body and Conclusion.\nYour essay should be divided at least into 3 paragraphs.\nIt is also advisable to discuss each point in a separate paragraph, thus giving your essay a more organized look and giving a good example of your clear thinking/ organization.\nIf you are writing an argument, a model essay should contain 4 paragraphs:\nParagraph 1 : Introduction :\nStart with introducing the topic. Take help of the \u0091Factual\u0092 statements in the question, but DO NOT COPY the exact words, for you wont be given any marks for such an introduction.\nA good practice is to start with a saying or a proverb. But at every point make sure that whatever you write is all related to the topic. Don\u0092t get diverted from the main topic in order to include a proverb/phrase.\nParagraph 2 : Body Part 1 :\nDivide your main body in different parts. If you have already planned what are you going to discuss, it will be easy for you at this step to decide how your main body will be divided.\nIf you have decided to discuss both \u0091for\u0092 and \u0091against\u0092 the topic, a good practice is to say \u0091FOR\u0092 in one paragraph and \u0091AGAINST\u0092 in another paragraph.\nIf you have decided to discuss either \u0091for\u0092 or \u0091against\u0092, get at least 2-3 main topics/points and discuss these separately in separate paragraphs.\nLength your paragraphs accurately and make sure you don\u0092t write too long or too short paragraphs.\nQuote examples as and when possible.

Each part fulfils a specific function in terms of interaction pattern, task input and candidate output.\nIn Part 1 the candidate answers general questions about themselves, their homes/families, their jobs/studies, their interests, and a range of similar familiar topic areas. This part lasts between four and five minutes.\nIn Part 2 the candidate is given a verbal prompt on a card and is asked to talk on a particular topic. The candidate has one minute to prepare before speaking at length, for between one and two minutes.

Answer the questions based on information that is stated or implied in the passage.\nThe Amish, a denomination of Anabaptists, are known for their religiosity and for their social isolation. Not to be confused with Mormons or Mennonites, the Amish live primarily in the United States and Canada, with significant concentrations in Pennsylvania and Ohio. A subculture, the Amish largely shun the mores and folkways of modern society in favor of a way of life that they deem suitable.\nAmish lifestyle can vary from one Amish community to the next; each community must follow its particular Ordnung, or Amish rules of living. The word is German (meaning \"order\"), reflecting the strong Swiss-German ancestry of the Amish. Though lifestyles can fluctuate across Amish communities, there are shared features of Amish lifestyles across the board. Specifically, all Amish isolate themselves from modern culture, maintain religious devotion, dress and behave in a modest manner, work hard, and consider the man as the dominant figure in the family. Probably the most famous attribute of this lifestyle is the general absence of technology, such as electricity and automobiles. However, in some Amish clusters, thoughtfully chosen types of technologies are allowed under certain circumstances, such as farming needs or that which sustains life, and does not disrupt the tradition of a simple life over one that places an individual's pining for possessions over one's community. Technology is not what Amish communities fear, but the vanity and lack of humility that often results from consumerism. The Amish regard such traits with distaste, as ego and pride clash directly with their religious beliefs, which value humility and community.\nDetermined to uphold these beliefs, along with their desire to maintain negligible contact with non-Amish, the Amish educate their young outside of the American public school system. American public schools, aside from exercising the palpable modern practices that the Amish shun, value autonomy and individual thinking, both of which go against the core of Amish philosophy. As a result, the Amish prefer to use schoolhouses within their communities, run by their own, maintained by their own, and attended by their own. Amish children are not educated beyond the eighth grade, as any more education is not pragmatic for farm life, and could even rouse ambition and greed in the young. Such education, like much of American society at large, is viewed as a threat to the way of life and the values that the Amish work hard to preserve. Though much of their culture is misunderstood and often attacked, most Amish families are content with their protected way of life.\n1. The Ordnung is:\n(A) the Amish rules of living\n(B) a town in Pennsylvania with a large Amish population\n(C) a religious sect within the Amish community\n(D) the history of the Amish in America\n2. According to the second paragraph, many Amish communities do not use technology because:\n(A) they believe all technology is evil\n(B) they fear electricity\n(C) it can often result in individuals expressing materialism and pride\n(D) their religious beliefs prohibit it\n3. The third paragraph presents all of the following as reasons why the Amish don't educate their children within the public school system EXCEPT:\n(A) they don't want to have too much contact with non-Amish people\n(B) public schools often use modern practices and technology\n(C) public schools encourage individualism\n(D) other children would tease Amish children\nStructure and Grammar \u2014 Part I\nFor the Error Identification questions, each sentence contains four underlined words or phrases.

This guide will help you begin to choose the best English test to take for your English learning needs and goals for both further education and career. Each of the major English tests are discussed and point towards more resources to study and prepare for these all important English tests.\nTo begin with, here are the major tests and their full titles\nTOEFL - Test of English as a Foreign Language\nIELTS - International English Language Testing System\nTOEIC - Test of English for International Communication\nFCE - First Certificate of English\nCAE - Certificate in \u00a0Advanced English\nBULATS - Business Language Testing Service\nThese English tests are created by two companies that dominate the English learning system word wide: ETS and University of Cambridge. TOEFL and TOEIC are provided by ETS and IELTS, FCE, CAE and BULATS are developed by University of Cambridge.\nETS\nETS stands for Educational Testing Service. ETS provides the TOEFL and the TOEIC test of English. It is an American company with headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey. ETS tests focus on North American English and computer based. Questions are almost exclusively multiple choice and ask you to choose from four choices based on information you have read, heard or have to deal with in some manner. Writing is also tested at the computer, so if you have difficulties typing you may have difficulties with these questions. Expect North American accents on all listening selections.\nUniversity of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge based in Cambridge, England is responsible for a wide range of English exams. However, the main international tests that are discussed in this overview are the IELTS the FCE and the CAE. For business English, the BULATS is also an option. Currently, the BULATS is not as popular as the other tests, but that may change in the future. The University of Cambridge is a dominate force in the entire English learning world, producing many English learning titles, as well as administering tests. Cambridge exams have a wide variety of question types including multiple choice, gap-fill, matching, etc. You will hear a wider variety of accents on University of Cambridge exams, but they tend towards British English.\nWhich English Test Should I Take? - Objective\nThe first and most important question to ask yourself when choosing your English test is:\nWhy do I need to take an English test?\nChoose from the following for your answer:\nI need to take an English test for study at University\nI need to take an English test to get a job or improve my career\nI want to improve my overall skills in English, but not necessarily for a purpose such as getting a better job or going to a university\nStudy for University\nIf you need to take an English test for study at university or in an academic setting you have a few choices.

These are reading, listening, speaking and writing. The TOEFL is for a duration of four hours with maximum time spent in the Reading and Listening sections.\nStructure of Reading Test\nThis section has the maximum number of questions with about 36-70. The Reading test includes three to five academic reading passages followed by comprehension questions. The student\u2019s ability to understand and analyse the meaning of the passages is tested. The question types are similar to those that appeared in the computer based TOEFL. Students are expected to demonstrate that they have learned what they have read, either by filling out a table or completing a narrative summary. Choose a correct paraphrase of a reading. The new features that make the testing experience easier and even include a glossary and review feature.\nStructure of Listening Test\nThe listening section has anything from 34-51 questions. The test involves the student listening to two to three conversations on their headphones. The conversations may include two or more speakers in each. Apart from this, there are four to six lectures, which include classroom dialogue. A positive development is that test-takers can now write down notes while listening. Again, the questions are similar to those that appeared in the TOEFL CBT. There will be a few new question types that measure ability to understand a speaker\u2019s attitude or meaning.\nStructure of Speaking Test\nThe speaking test consists of a total of six tasks. Two of the tasks are independent tasks about familiar topics. The test taker is required to state, explain and support their response using personal knowledge and experience.\nTwo tasks are based on Reading and Listening material. These tasks include a short reading passage and a short talk. The questions require test takers to answer using the information provided in the reading and the listening material. One question is based on a campus-related situation, and the other is based on academic classroom material. Again, test takers can take notes and use the information to shape their responses.\nThe remaining two tasks are based on Listening material, including a short lecture or conversation. The questions require test takers to summarise key ideas from the talks in the responses.\nTest-takers are judged on the basis of the following criteria:\n1. Topic development: The student\u2019s ability to understand the matter and draw connections between topics as well as their capability to convey relevant information.\n2. Delivery: The ability to use clear, smooth, sustained speech.\n3. Language use: Trained evaluators pay attention to the use of correct grammar and vocabulary. Close notice is paid to the response of logical answers.\nThe six tasks in the Speaking section are rated by at least two human scorers on a scale of 0-4. The six individual scores are averaged to arrive at an aggregate value. This aggregate is converted to the scale of 0 to 30.\nStructure of Writing Test\nThe Writing test consists of a total of two tasks to be completed by the test taker. The first task could be a reading, listening or writing one \u2014 an academic reading followed by a lecture. Test takers must answer a question discussing the key points in the lecture and explain how they relate to those in the reading passage. The reading passage appears first, and then it is removed from the screen during the lecture. Test takers can view the passage again while responding to the question. The second task is an independent task about a familiar topic. Test takers must state their response and support it with information from personal knowledge and experience.\nTrained evaluators measure the ability to understand the material, as well as write clearly, accurately and in an organized manner. The two tasks are scored by at least two human scorers from 0 to 5 and then the raw scores are totaled/averaged before scaling them to the range of 0 to 30.\nTOEFL score\nEach of the four sections of TOEFL iBT is scored on a scale of 0 to 30. The sectional scores are then added to arrive at a total score of 0 to 120. Each score corresponds to a percentile ranking. This displays how an individual\u2019s score compares with that of other students answering the test.\nThe maximum score of 120 has a percentile of 100. Students will also receive information of what the numeric scores mean in terms of language skills and proficiency (high/medium/low), along with performance feedback including suggestions for improvement.\n"}], [{"score": 1218.9084, "uuid": "6e3912c7-9a37-54a2-88d6-62d08c1d4d5a", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0211wb-92-09923", "target_hostname": "www.rxpgonline.com", "target_uri": "http://www.rxpgonline.com/article1459.html", "page_rank": 1.2086245e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "New Internet-based <em>TOEFL</em> (iBT) Test - Overview <em>TOEFL</em>", "snippet": "Nonnative English speakers at <em>the</em> 11th-grade level <em>or</em> above <em>should</em> <em>take</em> <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> test to provide evidence of their English proficiency before beginning academic work. <em>The</em> test content is considered too difficult for students below 11th grade.", "explanation": null, "document": "The new Internet-based TOEFL (iBT) will include\n- a new Speaking Section,\n- twice the number of essays\n- integrated skills testing\n- will be one hour longer.\nThe TOEFL Internet-based Test (TOEFL iBT) tests all four language skills that are important for effective communication: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The test helps students demonstrate that they have the English skills needed for success.\nWhat Is the Benefit of An Internet-based Test?\nTOEFL iBT emphasizes integrated skills and provides better information to institutions about students' ability to communicate in an academic setting and their readiness for academic coursework. With Internet-based testing, ETS can capture speech and score responses in a standardized manner.\nOnline registration and online score reporting make it easier for students to REGISTER for TOEFL iBT and receive their test scores.\nWhen Will TOEFL iBT Be Available?\nETS is introducing the new test in phases.\nUnited States (excluding U.S. Territories) September 24, 2005\nCanada, France, Germany, Italy October 22, 2005\nPuerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands November 4, 2005\nAmerican Samoa November 5, 2005\nGuam March 18, 2006\nA complete schedule will be available on this Web site by October 1, 2005.\nWhat Is Happening To The Current TOEFL Tests?\nThe computer- and paper-based (CBT, PBT) versions of the TOEFL test will be given at a particular location until the Internet-based version is implemented.\nHow Can I Learn More About TOEFL iBT?\n* Take the TOEFL iBT Tour at http://tinyurl.com/89yy7\n* Read the TOEFL iBT frequently asked questions at http://tinyurl.com/bc53r\n* Take a practice test at TOEFL Practice Online at http://toeflpractice.ets.org/\nWhy Take the TOEFL Test?\nMost people take the TOEFL test as a prerequisite for admission into colleges and universities where English is used or required.

The test content is considered too difficult for students below 11th grade.\nMany institutions report that they frequently do not require TOEFL test scores of certain kinds of international applicants. These include\n* nonative speakers who hold degrees or diplomas from postsecondary institutions in English-speaking countries (e.g., the United States, Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand)\n* nonnative speakers who have successfully completed at least a two-year course of study in which English was the language of instruction\n* transfer students from institutions in the United States or Canada whose academic course work was favorably evaluated in relation to its demands and duration.\n* nonnative speakers who have taken the TOEFL test within the past two years\n* nonnative speakers who have successfully pursued academic work at schools where English was the language of instruction in an English-speaking country for a specified period, generally two years.\nStudents should contact their prospective institutions directly concerning their specific admission requirements.\nWhere Can People Take the Test?\nTOEFL iBT is taken via the Internet at ETS-certified test centers.

Read the task question very carefully.\nWhile you are reading the question, you should ask yourself the following questions:\nWhat exactly do I have to write about?\nWhat style (formal or informal) and tone (informative or complaining etc?) do I need?\n2. Brainstorm and make notes of your ideas.\nHere you are trying to think of the maximum number of ideas you have that relate to the task (make sure they\u2019re relevant!). You should write these notes on the question paper, rather than the answer sheet, so then you know that they examiner will not read them as part of your answer.\n3. Plan your essay\nHere you need to select the ideas that you\u2019re going to use, decide which are the most important and group them so that your essay has a structure and isn\u2019t just a fragmented catalogue of ideas.\nI find a lot of students are concerned about \u2018wasting time\u2019 on planning. In the IELTS Writing test, do NOT glance at anyone else in the room and panic because they appear to be writing their answer and you\u2019re making notes. There are two reasons for this;\nnever look at other people in an exam, you don\u2019t want to look as if you\u2019re trying to cheat\nwe\u2019re trying to use our planning strategy to get the best IELTS Writing score possible; it\u2019s not a race to see who can write the most quickly!\nThat said, it\u2019s important to be aware of time in the IELTS Writing test. You have 20 minutes for Task 1 so I suggest you spend maximum 5 minutes on the preparation stage. You have 40 minutes for the longer Task 2 so I suggest you spend maximum 10 minutes on the preparation stage.\nDrafting\n4. Write your essay on your answer sheet, following the plan you wrote in the preparation stage\nMake sure your handwriting is legible. Although you can choose whether to write in pen or pencil, I usually recommend that my students write their IELTS Writing answers in pencil; much neater if you change and correct things.\nI usually recommend that this stage takes about 10 minutes for IELTS Writing Task 1 and 20 minutes for IELTS Writing Task 2. (You need to leave some time for the next stage; approximately 5 minutes for Task 1 and 10 minutes for Task 2).\nReviewing\n5. Here the aim is to check that you\u2019ve written the best IELTS Writing answer you can. You\u2019re going to review and improve your work.\nHere\u2019s what you should be checking at this stage:\nmake sure you\u2019ve answered the task fully (all aspects of the task)\ncheck that your style and tone are appropriate and consistent (e.g. NOT, Dear Sir,\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019Hi, how are ya doin?\u2019!\nmake sure your paragraphing is clear and logical\nall your supporting points are relevant to your answer to the task.\nlook for grammar and spelling mistakes.\nFinally don\u2019t forget that IELTS Writing Task 1 needs to be at least 150 words and IELTS Writing Task 2 needs to be 250 words.\nThese word counts are good guidelines. In my opinion, Writing Task 1 answers should be somewhere between 150 and 180 words, Writing Task 2 answers should be somewhere between 250 and 300 words.\nSource: Onlineielts\n"}, {"score": 1203.1042, "uuid": "70e2648f-4982-5e6e-bd7a-3385b9178ee7", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1015wb-19-22301", "target_hostname": "www.jeevasacademy.com", "target_uri": "http://www.jeevasacademy.com/services.html", "page_rank": 1.3899739e-09, "spam_rank": 92, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em> Preparation| GRE Coaching | <em>IELTS</em> Training Institute| GMAT l SAT", "snippet": "In your Gre &amp; <em>Toefl</em> we would again stress on attaining excellent scores.

There is NO extra time at the end of the test to transfer your answers to the answer paper (you get 10 extra minutes in the listening test only); your answers must be on the answer paper at the end of the 60 minutes. The test has 40 questions based on a series of 3 texts. The total length of all the texts put together will be between 2000 and 2750 words. As in all the different parts of IELTS, the Academic Reading Test gets progressively harder through the paper. In each section of the Academic Reading Test there will be 1 text with 13 or maybe 14 questions to answer in 2 or 3 sets of differing formats. We will look at the types of question that you will meet later. The texts will come from magazines, books and journals and are written for general interest or for an academic though non-specialist reader. At least one text will contain a logical argument. One text may contain non-verbal materials such as a diagram, graph or illustration.

It's useful to read the list of course, but the only way to really be familiar with the types of question is through practice.

Sometimes leaving a question and coming back later can help you answer it too. Leave any questions that you have spent too long on, and come back at the end of the test if you have time. Sometimes, if the question has a yes/no/not given answer, the answer you are looking for does not exist as it could be a not given. Be aware so you don't waste time looking for something that isn't there.\nRead the questions and instructions so you don't make a silly mistake. For example, people often will mix the yes/no answers with the true/false answers and write yes as an answer instead of true or vice versa. Strictly speaking you are wrong although you have understood the question and answer.\nIf the question asks for one answer then give one answer. Giving two is wrong as it asks for one and you will be marked wrong. The type of question where this could happen would be: Give one example of... Writing two examples, to show you really understand, is wrong.\nIf the question asks for no more than 3 words, use no more than 3 words. Writing 4 words or more is wrong. You won't be asked to do it in 3 words or less unless it is possible so don't worry; it can always be done.\nOne area that students don't like is that, in the reading test, good grammar and spelling are important. The grammar part is not as important as you can't make many grammar errors in 3 words (the maximum you use in the reading test) but, if you spell something wrong, it will be marked as wrong. People think, quite rightly in my opinion, that the reading should test whether you understand what you read and not how you spell something but these are the rules. So, be careful about your spelling!\nOne constant discussion I have had with students is whether to read the questions first and then read the passage or read the passage first and then the questions. From my experience with many students my conclusion is that there is no correct answer for this. It depends on a number of variables. It can depend on the types of question and how difficult the questions are. It can depend on how good and fast a reader you are. It can depend on the length of the text and how much time you have. Let's look at these variables.\nIf the question type is difficult and asking something which is hard to answer then reading the text first can help. Just a quick read through using a technique called skimming (see below for an analysis of skimming) can give you the knowledge of the text that will help you find the answer more easily.\nIf you are a good, fast reader, then you can read the text quickly, getting good knowledge of the contents without using up too much precious time. This can help you answer the questions better.\nIf the texts are short then it doesn't take long to quickly read through them. On the other hand, if the texts are short it is easier to find the answers so you may not have to waste time reading the texts to find the answers quickly, especially if time is short.\nIf time is short then it doesn't matter how complex or long the texts are. You need to get some answers on the answer sheet as quickly as possible. So, you can see that there is not one answer to the problem of whether to read the texts or questions first. What I tell students is to experiment in your practice and see what suits you for the different types of question in different situations. As usual practising your techniques is the key.\nTime management is an important thing to be aware of. You have a number of texts to read and 40 questions to answer in 1 hour. If you spend to long on one part, you may find that you have not enough time to finish all the questions and some of those questions could be ones that you could answer quite easily. As I said above, don't spend too long on a difficult answer but also keep an eye on the clock. It's a good idea to have your watch or a small clock on your desk so you know exactly how long you have left in the test at any given time. In addition to this, keep control on how long you spend on each section. Remember the test gets more difficult as it goes on so you will probably need more time for the questions at the end than for those at the start. Maybe a guideline could be:\n17 minutes on section 1.\n20 minutes on section 2.\n23 minutes on section 3.\n(If you can do things more quickly all the better as that will give you time to look at questions that you skipped and to check on your answers)\nWith experience and practice you will soon know how long things take you, and be able to manage your time well.\nAs I just said, if you have finished the exam with time to spare, DON'T just sit there!! Check what you have done. If you have time after the check, check again. And so on....\nReading Techniques - Skimming and Scanning\nSkimming and scanning are the two main techniques that people use to read and answer IELTS reading tests. It's not a question of using one or the other but you will need both methods in doing the test. Let's have a look at the two techniques in turn.\nSkimming\nSkimming is reading fast to get the \"gist\" or the general idea of the text. There are different techniques of doing skimming. You can run your eyes over the text getting the general meaning, not stopping at words that you don't understand as this will slow you down. The important thing with skimming is speed. Another way to skim is to just read the first and last paragraphs of a text and summaries as well. You could also just read the title, subtitles and illustrations if there are any. I prefer for IELTS the first way - reading it all quickly to get the general meaning, but of course it depends on your reading speed. If you are a slow reader in English you really need to practise to improve. You don't need IELTS specific texts for this. A good English newspaper is fine. Get one every day and read the articles as quickly as you can. Do this with as many articles as possible every day and your speed will quickly improve.\nScanning\nThis is another very important technique for the IELTS Reading Tests. This is the technique that you use when you are reading a telephone book or a dictionary. You are not starting at the top and reading every line back and forth as you would read a novel. You are moving your eyes around the text, back and across and up and down. You are searching for some specific information: a word or name. This is an important technique in IELTS reading as you are often searching for some specific information. You read the question and then you search for key words or ideas associated with the question. This is a bit more difficult to practise than skimming. You get long texts (from newspapers, magazines or other sources) and get a friend to read it and then ask you to find key ideas or words as quickly as possible. Again, if you do this frequently, your speed will quickly improve.\nIf you want to improve, there's no secret. Practice. Practice. Practice. You won't get better sitting and doing nothing. Even good English users need practice for the IELTS exam. It could make all the difference between your getting the band that you need, and getting half a band less than you need and having to wait 3 months to do the exam again.\nFinally, there are no correct answers or methods. Here I've given you some ideas to guide you and hopefully to help you but the questions can be answered well in different ways. Good luck with the IELTS Academic Listening Test! I hope that this tutorial has helped you.\n"}], [{"score": 1187.0577, "uuid": "ff25cdae-6ce7-5388-a837-ca6295b184f8", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0402wb-10-12481", "target_hostname": "www.achieverspoint.com", "target_uri": "http://www.achieverspoint.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=114&p=196&sid=57e495a8396f81967f384fd5a5832ec6", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 77, "title": "AchieversPoint.com \u2022 View topic - <em>THE</em> FREE <em>IELTS</em> ACADEMIC READING TEST", "snippet": "Board index \u00bb Test Required \u00bb <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> &#x2F; TSE&#x2F;TOEIC <em>The</em> <em>IELTS</em> Academic Reading Test has 3 sections.

In this short time you have to convince the examiner who will be speaking with you of your level of English.\nThe IELTS Academic Speaking Test is the same for both the Academic and General Training modules. The test is conducted with 1 examiner and 1 candidate. The Speaking test is recorded. The Speaking Test is divided into 3 sections:\nSection 1 Section 1 begins with some general introductory questions. This is followed by some questions on personal information similar to the type of questions one would ask when meeting someone for the first time. Finally the examiner asks a series of questions of 2 topics of general interest. (4 - 5 minutes)\nSection 2 Section 2 is a monologue (1 person speaking) by the candidate. The examiner will give the candidate a card with a subject and a few guiding questions on it. The student must talk for 1 to 2 minutes on this subject. The examiner decides on the exact length. The student has an optional 1 minute in order to prepare for his talk and is provided with some paper and a pencil in order to make some brief notes. After the candidate's talk the examiner will ask 1 or 2 brief questions in order to finish off the section. (3 - 4 minutes)\nSection 3 Here the examiner will ask some more questions generally related to the subject spoken about in section 2. These questions will be more demanding and require some critical analysis on the part of the candidate. (4 - 5 minutes)\nQuestion Types\nThe types of questions that come in the IELTS Academic Speaking Test are very general in nature and are designed so that anyone around the world, regardless of what background or culture they come from, should be able to answer them. The questions will not be overly personal and will avoid contentious subjects such as politics, *** or religion.\nAll the questions will be open questions rather than closed questions. An open question asks the candidate to give an extended answer, and so have the opportunity to show how good his English is. A closed question is one that can be answered by a single word or a couple of words. So, you will not get a question like:\nDo you like living in your town?\nA student could just answer yes. Any answers like this will just be followed by the question why? so you have to extend your answer (what you should have done after the \"yes\" anyway). Anyway, the question is more likely to be:\nWhy do you like living in your town?\nHere the candidate has to give an explanation and therefore the examiner hears plenty of English which will help him or her evaluate you.\nMarking - IELTS Academic Speaking Test Marks, Bands and Results\nIn the IELTS Academic Speaking Test you will be marked in 4 areas. These 4 areas are: Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy and Pronunciation. For the first 3, you get a mark out of 9. For Pronunciation you get a 2, 4, 6 or 8. Finally an average is taken to give you your final band for the Speaking. Let's look at these areas in more detail.\nFluency and Coherence: The examiner grades your fluency, which is how easy, smooth and flowing your speaking is. To get a good grade here, any gaps in your speaking should be associated with searching for the right idea rather than hesitancy with finding the right word or structure. For the coherence part, the examiner looks at how easy you are to understand. Does your flow of ideas run smoothly, logically and with consistency? Do you communicate well?\nLexical Resource: This mark grades the range of words that you use in your speaking test and whether you use the words in the right way, at the right time and in the right place.\nGrammatical Range and Resource: This mark grades your range of grammatical structures, your accuracy at producing them and whether you use the right structure at the right time and in the right place. This is the area that worries the candidates the most as it is the dreaded grammar. Remember it is only 1 part out of 4.\nPronunciation: This mark grades you on how clearly you speak English.\nThe Three Sections of the IELTS Academic Listening Test\nHere we will look at the three sections in more detail. Remember, the IELTS test always tries to mirror situations that you will encounter as a student or immigrant in an English speaking country. The speaking test is no different and each of the sections has a specific purpose. Like all the different modules of the IELTS, the speaking gets more difficult as it goes on. The questions that are asked in Section 1 are easier than in Section 2 and so on. This does not mean that by Section 3 they are impossible but they are more demanding linguistically.\nSection 1 (4 - 5 minutes)\nThis section is divided into three parts.\ni) The first part involves general introductions. Here the examiner checks that he or she has the right person by checking the candidates name, origin and identification. This only takes a few seconds.\nii) In the second part the examiner asks some personal (not too personal so don't worry) questions about some familiar topics such as yourself, your family, your home or your work/study. These questions are the type that people would use when meeting someone for the first time. This should last for a couple of minutes.\niii) In the third part the examiner chooses 2 sets of questions from his selection. These sets of questions will cover general ideas on a theme of general interest.\nSection 2 (3 - 4 minutes)\nIn this section the candidate has to give a small \"speech\" or monologue on a general subject chosen by the examiner. The examiner will hand you a card with the subject written on it, along with about three questions on the subject in order to guide and help your speaking. The examiner will then tell you that you have 1 minute to prepare your mini-talk and he or she will give you some paper and a pencil to make some notes during that minute. You can refer to your notes while you are speaking. After the minute, the examiner will ask you to start talking and you must talk on the subject until the examiner asks you to stop. After he has asked you to stop, he may ask you 1 or 2 general questions about what you have been discussing. You cannot ask the examiner for another card. You must use the one that he gives you.\nSection 3 (4 - 5 minutes)\nIn Section 3 the examiner will ask you a series of questions thematically linked to the subject that you spoke about in Section 2. These questions will be of a more demanding nature and will require a more analytical and thoughtful answer. You will also probably need to use more complex language as regards grammatical structure and vocabulary.\nHow to do Better in the IELTS Academic Speaking Test\nThere are a number of things you can do to have a better performance in the IELTS Academic Speaking Test.\nFirst of all practice. This is the key to all the different modules of IELTS. Below you will find a separate section devoted to practising the speaking.\nWhen you are in the test, smile and look the examiner in the eye. Try and be friendly and look as though you are enjoying the conversation. This has a big effect on the examiner. If an examiner has to talk with someone who doesn't talk much, doesn't smile at all and who clearly doesn't want to be there, then it has a negative effect on the examiner. Being nervous is fine. The examiner understands that and will try and put you at ease. But be friendly. It makes a difference.\nDon't worry about the occasional mistake. The examiner will expect some mistakes - after all, English is a foreign language for you and people make mistakes in speaking foreign languages. The examiner is not making a note of every single mistake that you make. This would be impossible to do and concentrate on your speaking. He will more get a general impression of your English accuracy so individual errors don't matter. More important is your communication.\nYou have to talk. Without your talking input, the examiner can't grade you very well. Try and give as full an answer as you can so that you show the examiner that you are comfortable at talking at length and can communicate well. Don't do this to extremes though. When you have finished what you have to say stop. Don't try and force more out as it will probably be strained and repetitive. The examiner will see that you have finished and will give you the next question. Similarly, you won't be able to answer all questions at length. Different people can talk about different questions more and the examiner knows this. If you don't know much about something, say so and then say what you do know. When you're finished, the examiner will give you another question. You can't duck out of every question though - the responsibility is on you to talk.\nDon't try and be too clever. Just try and talk normally as that is when you will perform at your best. If you try and extend yourself too much, then that is when you will make the most errors.\nPerfection is not needed. You can still make some errors and get a 9 (not many errors though). So don't let making errors upset you. Get on with the talking and concentrate on your communication.\nOne thing that puts candidates off is that the Speaking test is recorded. This is done so that, if necessary, the speaking can be re-marked. If the bands for a candidate's writing and speaking for instance are very different, then the candidate's test is re-checked. If the speaking was not recorded, then this could not be done. This doesn't happen very often. Sample recordings are also sent to the IELTS administration to be monitored to make sure that examiners are doing a good job and assigning the correct bands. So, try and forget that the recorder is there and get on with answering the questions.\nDon't forget your ID! You need it at the start of the test.\nDon't give yes/no answers unless you continue with a because. It gives a bad impression. If you do give a yes/now answer, you'll probably get a why next anyway.\nPractice\nAs in all parts of the IELTS, this is the one thing that will really improve your band. There are various things that you can do to improve your performance.\nPrepare the types of questions for each of the different sections.\nSection 1\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn section 1 you start with personal questions such as about yourself, your family, your home or your work/study. So, sit down with your dictionary and try and think of all the vocabulary you would need to completely describe all parts of your life, home, family and work/study. Then sit down with a piece of paper and write down every question you can think of about these ideas. Try and come up with about 20. You can then practice them in 2 ways:\ni) Get a friend to ask you the questions and practice giving long, full answers. Do this again and again. It doesn't matter if you do the same question frequently, as you will give better and better answers with more and more information. The more often you practice this, the better you'll get.\nii) If you don't have a friend who can do this, then you can do it by yourself. You just look at your list and imagine that someone has asked you the question. Then, off you go. You can do this sat at home, you can talk to the cat, the mirror or do it driving on the way to work. It may feel a bit strange at first, talking by yourself, but it works and you will improve. You don't have to do either method i or ii, you can mix both. It all helps.\nIn the second part of Section 1 you have to answer questions on themes of general interest. These are not complicated but are more demanding than the ones that you did in the part before. Let's say for example that the theme the examiner chooses is travelling. The examiner will have a set of questions to ask you. How many he asks depends on how long you talk for in your answers. The first question could be:\nDo you enjoy traveling and why/why not?\nThen this could be followed by:\nWhere would you like to travel to and why?\nYou can find other sample themes and questions in IELTS Practice Now Question Papers and from other sources. Once you have an idea of the types of theme and question, you can start to make your own examples and practice answering them in the ways (i and ii) above. I have done this with classes and it works very well. Students doing this, more often than not, come up with actual themes and questions from the test itself!!\nSection 2\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPreparation and practice for Section 2 is similar to the practice in Section 1.You have to talk for 1 to 2 minutes in English. Speaking for this time in your own language is quite hard, so in a foreign language it is harder. The reason it is hard is that you don't often talk uninterrupted for 1 to 2 minutes about anything, whether it is in your language or English. So, how do you get better at it? By practising it again and again. Let's say that your task is as follows:\nDescribe a favourite holiday destination that you like.\nYou should say:\nWhen you first went there.\nHow you get there.\nWhat you do when you're there.\nAnd explain why this place is so special for you.\nSo, you can see the format of this section. The practice procedure is as before. Check out other question types and soon you're be able to develop your own. Then practice them with someone or by yourself. Soon, talking for 2 minutes without stopping won't be a problem. Remember you don't have to talk fast or without breaks. They want you to talk normally. Talk at a normal speed, pause to take breaths and take time to consult your notes to give yourself ideas about what to talk about next.\nThe follow up question to end Section 2 is not so important that it needs to be practiced as it only requires a few words as an answer. An example question from the examiner for the subject above could be:\n\"Do you think I would enjoy a holiday in this place too?\"\nThe candidate would just be expected to say something like:\n\"Oh yes, I think so.\"\nOr:\n\"Maybe not. It might be too hot for you.\"\nYou can see that nothing very long is required.\nAt this point I'd like to explain about the 1 minute preparation time and the notes that you can write during it. First of all, use your preparation time and make notes. Before you begin your monologue, you will have 1 minute to prepare for it. Some people think that they don't need the time at all and will start straight away. Very often these people will dry up early and be at a loss about how to continue. Use your time. Someone starting straight away does not get any advantage at all over someone who takes the full minute to prepare.\nSo, what should you write in your notes? First of all, don't try and write out your whole talk word for word. You don't have enough time. Looking at the question above (which is a typical layout for this section) you can see that there is a main question (Describe a favourite holiday destination that you like.) and then 3 mini-questions following (Say when you first went there, how you get there what you do when you're there and explain why this place is so special for you).\nThese questions are here to help you as they give you ideas to talk about and give your talk a bit of structure. However, it asks you to talk about these things so you should talk about them. In your notes quickly jot down one or two ideas for each of the questions, so that they will remind you about things to talk about when you look at your notes during your talk. Finally, if you have time, maybe make a note of something from your own experience connected to the talking theme. When you are talking about something from your own experience, it is easier to talk at length. For example, for the question above, you could be just finishing and still have 45 seconds left to talk. You could be saying why the place is so special to you. As you run out of ideas you could give an example out of your own experience. You could say:\n\"Actually why I like the place so much is shown from something that happened to me the last time I was there. I was in a restaurant having some food and...\"\nThe subject of your story doesn't matter as you are still on the subject of your talk. The main thing is that it's keeping you talking.\nSection 3\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSection 3 really carries on from where Section 2 left off. The examiner will ask you questions that are thematically linked to the subject that you talked about in Section 2. For example, for the question we looked at above about a holiday destination, the examiner might choose to ask you questions about tourism and the airline industry. The examiner will have a set of questions to ask you. How many he asks depends on how long you talk for in your answers. None of the questions will be of a technical nature or require any specialist knowledge as that would be unfair, but you will be expected to give your opinion on what is asked you.\nSo, let's look at some examples.\nTourism\nCan you predict any major changes that could happen in the Tourist Industry over the next 50 years?\nCan you compare the tourist industry in your country today with the tourist industry when your grandparents were young?Can you identify some of the factors that have led to the Industry success of the airline industry?\nAirline\nCan you suggest any ways in which air travel could be made safer?\nYou can see that the questions here are more analytical and require more thought than the questions in the previous sections.\nAs regards practice, the procedure is as in the previous sections. You need to get someone to do the questions with you, or do them alone and then develop your own questions and practice with them. ieltshelpnow.com Practice Tests also provide practice and often we provide much fuller examples. Our tests are also at least half the price! The choice is yours.\nAnyway, work hard and good luck with the IELTS Academic Speaking Test. I hope that this free tutorial has helped you.\n"}, {"score": 1173.1216, "uuid": "6127de6c-7d92-5cac-a734-1f2acc87f85e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0402wb-19-16607", "target_hostname": "www.achieverspoint.com", "target_uri": "http://www.achieverspoint.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=115&p=197&sid=57e495a8396f81967f384fd5a5832ec6", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 80, "title": "AchieversPoint.com \u2022 View topic - <em>THE</em> <em>IELTS</em> ACADEMIC SPEAKING TEST TUTORIAL", "snippet": "Remember you don&#x27;t have to talk fast <em>or</em> without breaks.

In this short time you have to convince the examiner who will be speaking with you of your level of English.\nThe IELTS Academic Speaking Test is the same for both the Academic and General Training modules. The test is conducted with 1 examiner and 1 candidate. The Speaking test is recorded. The Speaking Test is divided into 3 sections:\nSection 1 Section 1 begins with some general introductory questions. This is followed by some questions on personal information similar to the type of questions one would ask when meeting someone for the first time. Finally the examiner asks a series of questions of 2 topics of general interest. (4 - 5 minutes)\nSection 2 Section 2 is a monologue (1 person speaking) by the candidate. The examiner will give the candidate a card with a subject and a few guiding questions on it. The student must talk for 1 to 2 minutes on this subject. The examiner decides on the exact length. The student has an optional 1 minute in order to prepare for his talk and is provided with some paper and a pencil in order to make some brief notes. After the candidate's talk the examiner will ask 1 or 2 brief questions in order to finish off the section. (3 - 4 minutes)\nSection 3 Here the examiner will ask some more questions generally related to the subject spoken about in section 2. These questions will be more demanding and require some critical analysis on the part of the candidate. (4 - 5 minutes)\nQuestion Types\nThe types of questions that come in the IELTS Academic Speaking Test are very general in nature and are designed so that anyone around the world, regardless of what background or culture they come from, should be able to answer them. The questions will not be overly personal and will avoid contentious subjects such as politics, *** or religion.\nAll the questions will be open questions rather than closed questions. An open question asks the candidate to give an extended answer, and so have the opportunity to show how good his English is. A closed question is one that can be answered by a single word or a couple of words. So, you will not get a question like:\nDo you like living in your town?\nA student could just answer yes. Any answers like this will just be followed by the question why? so you have to extend your answer (what you should have done after the \"yes\" anyway). Anyway, the question is more likely to be:\nWhy do you like living in your town?\nHere the candidate has to give an explanation and therefore the examiner hears plenty of English which will help him or her evaluate you.\nMarking - IELTS Academic Speaking Test Marks, Bands and Results\nIn the IELTS Academic Speaking Test you will be marked in 4 areas. These 4 areas are: Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy and Pronunciation. For the first 3, you get a mark out of 9. For Pronunciation you get a 2, 4, 6 or 8. Finally an average is taken to give you your final band for the Speaking. Let's look at these areas in more detail.\nFluency and Coherence: The examiner grades your fluency, which is how easy, smooth and flowing your speaking is. To get a good grade here, any gaps in your speaking should be associated with searching for the right idea rather than hesitancy with finding the right word or structure. For the coherence part, the examiner looks at how easy you are to understand. Does your flow of ideas run smoothly, logically and with consistency? Do you communicate well?\nLexical Resource: This mark grades the range of words that you use in your speaking test and whether you use the words in the right way, at the right time and in the right place.\nGrammatical Range and Resource: This mark grades your range of grammatical structures, your accuracy at producing them and whether you use the right structure at the right time and in the right place. This is the area that worries the candidates the most as it is the dreaded grammar. Remember it is only 1 part out of 4.\nPronunciation: This mark grades you on how clearly you speak English.\nThe Three Sections of the IELTS Academic Listening Test\nHere we will look at the three sections in more detail.

I want to address two questions that I received quite some time ago, one from Albert in Taiwan and one from Milan who studies Cantonese in Hong Kong.\nFirst of all let's realize that the vast majority of language teachers in the world are not native speakers, and are not a model of the spoken language, nor even, necessarily, of the written language that their students are studying. Furthermore, in many situations, students in schools are denied the opportunity to learn a language because there is no qualified teacher available, i.e. someone with at least some knowledge of this other language.\nLingQ, as well as other resources on the Internet, can greatly enhance the power of a teacher, regardless of whether the teacher is a native speaker or not.\nLingQ provides a wide choice of content with audio and text.\nLingQ offers a structured approach to vocabulary acquisition.\nLingQ integrates listening, reading, vocabulary review, speaking and writing.\nLingQ connects learners to a community of learners and native speakers.\nA classroom can be an effective place to focus a LingQ program for a variety of reasons.\nThe teacher can explain LingQ, how to get started and how to take advantage of all of its features. Most online learners do not use all of LingQs power.\nThe teacher can assign content to learners from the LingQ library, or ask them to import content that is more relevant to their curriculum.\nWith LingQ, the teacher can have individual learners or groups of learners working on different content (even different languages), that suit their interests and abilities.\nIssues related to the language, or the use of LingQ, can be discussed in class.\nStudents can be encouraged to study on their own, in class as well as away from the class.\nThe teachers can more easily work with individual learners, and follow their activity and progress.\nIndividuals or groups of learners can share Vocabulary lists, discuss content items, or discuss how they use the system.\nClass discussions can be summarized and posted as content to be Imported and studied.\nWriting assignments can be corrected and easily integrated into each learners input activities.\nSince there is a wide variety of listening material in the LingQ Library, even a non-native teacher can be effective in encouraging and stimulating learners, and giving assignments. The fluency of the teacher is less of an issue.\nIf the teacher is native, or a very fluent speaker of the language being taught, that opens up additional opportunities for free discussio\u00a0 in the class, or even to create new content for use in LingQ.\nI addition, there are specific ways in which LingQ is particularly useful in preparing for TOEFL, TOEIC and other similar standard tests, as I have discussed earlier.\nSee below\nI am working to develop a course for people taking these standard English tests. I am interested in hearing ideas on what to put into the course. Here are some of my ideas so far.\n1) To me the key to success in these tests is a strong three-legged foundation.\nThe ability to read quickly and understand\nThe ability to listen and understand\nA large vocabulary of words and phrases\n2) If a person has a sound foundation then he/she can work on output.\nWriting an answer to a question within a limited time period\nAnswering an oral question within a limited time period\nFor 1) what we do at LingQ is ideal. We have content on a wide variety of subjects, and our learners can practice reading, listening and accumulate a wide vocabulary.\nWe can take it one step further.\nThere are key lists of words available on the Internet\nThe Academic Word List\n"}, {"score": 1179.3625, "uuid": "7470cbd6-5854-54a4-b587-753c2ff71cdf", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0700tw-42-15377", "target_hostname": "www.genietalks.com", "target_uri": "http://www.genietalks.com/blog/problems-registering-toefl-from-lagos/", "page_rank": 1.5221491e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "Problems Registering <em>Toefl</em> from Lagos | Genie Talks", "snippet": "<em>I</em> think <em>the</em> ETS <em>should</em> look at that Africa International Service email they left on their webpage \u2013 it seems as though something is wrong with it <em>or</em> that it <em>should</em> have been earugulu@testsupport.org <em>or</em> something else. <em>The</em> way things are now my organization is at its wits end.", "explanation": null, "document": "Problems Registering Toefl from Lagos\nProblem registering TOEFL exam in Lagos\nThere is a problem with the registration of our students from this part of the world for the TOEFL exams and I\u2019ll like to discus it with you. It mostly has to do with the Chinua Achebean\none-finger-bring-oil-stain-others scenario. It makes one very sad that the reason why we get sidelined by the rest of the world is that there are some among us who actually do certain unscrupulous things.\nFor the benefit of those who may not understand why I\u2019m this unhappy, perhaps should take a look at some of the contributions I\u2019ve made on this forum concerning the educational station in Nigeria. What is going on is that there are people who are so fed up with the way it is that they would rather go to school elsewhere. By that elsewhere I mean that they have to go abroad and by that kind of abroad I mean to countries like the US, UK, Canada , Egypt, Ghana and sometimes to Mauritania. For you to go to school \u2018abroad\u2019 you have to have enough money and pass certain standardized tests like the TOEFL , SAT, GRE, GMAT, depending on what level of academic pursuit you are interested in. But all of this is not a problem: for decades and as far as I can remember our students have taken these exams, done very well and have gone to school abroad.\nBut suddenly, we fear that our students no longer can register for these exams, particularly the TOEFL computer based exam from Lagos, Nigeria. Go to the TOEFL webpage and Nigeria is blacklisted as one country where you cannot register this exam. If you have to register for the Computer based test the ETS will only accept International money orders, authorization vouchers from ETS, UNESCO coupons and international money order. Now if that doesn\u2019t embarrass you, I don\u2019t know what else to say. If you have not found out why Nigerians have been barred from registering online with credit cards for this exam, please know that some Nigerians mostly in Lagos shot us all in the leg when they began to use fake credit cards to register online.\nVery recently, the Nigerian agency contracted by the ETS in Lagos to superintend the registration of these exams itself misbehaved. The body, Touch\u00e9 Limited, collected lots of monies from nearly all the candidates\nwithin and without the South West, South-South and South-Eastern parts of this country but didn\u2019t remit the funds to the ETS as it should have done. Consequently, all of those who registered for the TOEFL exam late last year missed their dates and the exam. This was why Touch\u00e9 lost its deal with the ETS to register the SATers, TOEFLers, and GMATers to another educational outfit in Port Harcourt. Its name is African International Services.\nYet again, I don\u2019t see any reason why the ETSC should not try to put its house in order by contracting the registration of TOEFL to Africa Independent Services in faraway Port Harcourt. However what we find a little unsettling is the fact that for every little inquiry or the other you have to make concerning the registration for the TOEFL , it must be made in Port Harcourt. This is because Africa International Services has only one phone 048 487 165 that\u2019s eternally telling you the subscriber cannot be reached. Well then, we try to get in touch via email to find out what their service charges are apart from the fee for the TOEFL put at $140.00 but that email ( e arugulu@testsupport.org) has never gone through, at least for the number of times we\u2019ve tried from our end here in Lagos. We have no intention of holding brief for Touch\u00e9 but we want to cast our minds back and recollect that whenever we wanted to get in touch with them from any part of the country, it was easy. I guess this was because they had more than five phone lines, several brochures and a hotline that you could reach at any time of the day and sometimes at night. I think the ETS should look at that Africa International Service email they left on their webpage \u2013 it seems as though something is wrong with it or that it should have been earugulu@testsupport.org or something else.\nThe way things are now my organization is at its wits end. My students have to register for the March TOEFL tests but that means we must travel to Port Harcourt with a lot of money in anticipation of service charges, hotel bills, and transport within the town of Port Harcourt. We know this is not just our problem but one that every other organization, agency, parent and individuals interested in the TOEFL is having here in Lagos. My suggestion to the College Board is that they must democratize and allow other agencies like the USIS or the British Council and some embassies handle sensitive matters like these for them.\nIf our educational journey in Nigeria has somewhat ended in a cul-de-sac, I don\u2019t think it is fair to continue to slow down those who have decided to travel out on account of insignificant matters of logistics.\nThank you very much for your\ntime.\n"}, {"score": 1176.9114, "uuid": "6527def3-209c-58a5-921d-9b517e22de75", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1015wb-56-06357", "target_hostname": "www.jeevasacademy.com", "target_uri": "http://www.jeevasacademy.com/study-in-usa.html", "page_rank": 1.3886887e-09, "spam_rank": 97, "title": "<em>TOEFL</em> Preparation| GRE Coaching | <em>IELTS</em> Training Institute| GMAT l SAT", "snippet": ". * Obtain test registration forms to <em>take</em> <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> and SAT <em>I</em> and SAT II, if necessary.", "explanation": null, "document": ""}, {"score": 1175.837, "uuid": "e98f4fbd-37ec-5614-a381-f92c7212a1d1", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0200wb-01-25721", "target_hostname": "www.globaleducationcounsel.org", "target_uri": "http://www.globaleducationcounsel.org/privacy-policy.htm", "page_rank": 1.4029622e-09, "spam_rank": 78, "title": "Coaching For Gmat, Coaching For Gre, Coaching For <em>Ielts</em>, Coaching For <em>Toefl</em>", "snippet": "Users <em>should</em> be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information on <em>the</em> bulletin boards <em>or</em> in <em>the</em> chat areas, that information and any substantive information disclosed in <em>the</em> communication can be collected and used by third parties.", "explanation": null, "document": "Privacy Policy\nWe respect the privacy and security of our customers and users of our website.

But do not try to kill time yourself. Allow no more than a minute for panicking, sweating and jittering, then stop. Has it put down a single word for you? I guess no.\nIf at the end of your panicking session the only sentence that comes to your mind is \u0093What am I going to do?\u0094 look at your watch. Notice down the time. Set 10 minutes for completing what I have already described in my first post. I strongly advise you against exceeding the 10-minute limit for this part. No use trying to cram down a further lot of information if you have no time to develop it. What is done is done. Take the next step \u0096 paragraphs.\nAnother 30 minutes should be wisely distributed. Time you will spend on each paragraph depends on your ability to produce consistent chunks of text approximately 50 \u0096 70 words in length. The words left to build up a 250 word essay might be divided between the introduction and conclusion. In my case it takes about 7-8 minutes per paragraph.\nSeveral minutes (6 to 9) to the deadline might be devoted to writing a short conclusion and proofreading\nWell, that\u0092s how it works.\nActually, I didn\u0092t try to work against the clock since I had been writing this essay on separate occasions. But I have done it for educational purposes and it has proved itself viable under time pressure.\n----------------------------------------\nTask\n----------------------------------------\nEnormous effort is put into researching and marketing 'the perfect potato crisp' while research into stress at work, for example, is ignored.

To begin with, improving workplace is an integral part of effective personnel policy. It helps a company become the employer of choice for skilled workers. Furthermore, neglecting to monitor the wellness of staff leads to extra expenses since more workers would use the insurance plan. Finally, businesses seeking efficiency should gather information on the latest advances in work space ergonomics. Strong competition forces employers to upgrade staff work areas to boost the performance of staff.\nI also feel that concentrating solely on the product is ineffective. For one thing, marketing, even most aggressive, would not make the product any better. \u0093The perfect potato crisp\u0094 results from the work of well-trained staff. For another, companies overlooking workers\u0092 needs in favour of merchandise are unstable. Staff retention problems restrain the company\u0092s potential to come regularly on the marker with new offers. At last, neglecting staff damages the reputation of a manufacturer. Customers might refuse buying a product, if they know it is made through hard exploitation of workers.\nTo summarize, employers should accept working conditions as being very important to successful company development. Disregarding researching and improving working conditions undermines enormous effort put into promotion of the product.\nThat\u0092s it for my tutorial. You should be aware that I am neither a teacher nor a native speaker of English.\nI have just laid out the strategy originated from my experience and textbooks on IELTS .

This section is 50 minutes long and consists of two parts: Integrated Writing and Independent Writing. Each of these sections requires the test taker to submit an essay on a topic. Integrated Writing requires a response to material both heard and read. In Integrated Writing, the test taker must write an essay supporting an opinion.\nIf you are taking the TOEFL iBT (internet based) , you will take the test on a standard English-language keyboard. Be sure you are familiar with this computer keyboard.\nAlthough if the test is computer based, test takers may take written notes throughout the entire test.\nWriting task 1: Integrated writing:\nYou will have 20 minutes to complete an essay on an academic topic. It is recommended that this essay be 150-225 words in length.\nThe academic topic for the essay is presented to the test taker from two different viewpoints. The first viewpoint is presented in writing (about 230-300 words). You will have 3 minutes to read this text. Next the test taker will view a 2 minute lecture (about 230-300 words) discussing the topic from a different viewpoint.\nAfter reading the text and viewing the lecture, the test taker will write a summary of the ways the information heard relates to the information read. The suggested length of the essay is 150-225 words. There is no penalty for a longer essay, but be sure everything written is relevant.\nTest takers\u2019 typed responses to the writing tasks are sent for Online Scoring. Between 2 and 4 certified human raters will evaluate your essay and give it a score.\nNote-taking is permitted during the exam, so take notes during both the reading and the lecture. You can use these notes later to organize your essay. Highlight key points in both passages. It is especially important to take notes during the lecture because you will not be able to refer back to this while you are writing.\nThe reading passage will disappear from the screen during the lecture. However, after the lecture, it will reappear on the screen.\nOrganization is key. Before you begin writing take some time to organize your notes. You can also refer to the reading passage while you are writing.\nBe sure you are accurate when citing information from the reading or lecture.\nRemember, you want to write about how the information heard relates to the information read.\nThis section is meant to measure your ability to understand information and write in an academic setting. It is meant to test how well you can incorporate different English language skills to communicate ideas.\nThis essay is scored on the quality of the writing as well as how accurate and complete the details are.\nWriting task 2: Independent writing:\nYou will have 30 minutes to complete an essay on an independent writing task. It is recommended that this essay be 300-350 words in length. Do not write less than 300 words.\nIn this section the test taker must express an opinion and support that opinion. In contrast to the topic in Writing Task 1, this essay will be based on your own knowledge and experience. In general you will be given a statement and asked if you agree or disagree with it. You will need to provide specific reasons to support your answer.\nBe sure that you identify the task clearly. You could be asked to state a preference or if you agree or disagree with a statement. In either case, be sure you understand what you are being asked to do.\nTake time before you begin writing to make notes on the main ideas of your essay. Identify one main idea and a few points to support it.\nYour essay will be scored on the overall quality of the writing. Raters are looking for a well-organized essay that uses appropriate grammar and vocabulary.\nHow to Prepare for the Exam\nAs with all TOEFL test preparation, the student should prepare for the Writing exam by practicing as much as possible. Practice is the most productive way to prepare for the exam. This means the ESL student will address topics similar to those on the exam and actually write the essays. Completing the actual writing will help you become more proficient. You will want to have mastered your strategy for each task before arriving at the exam.\nTake the time to look at Writing Task Samples for both tasks, and practice completing them.\nClick here for a link to sample test questions for all sections of the exam.\nGeneral Tips for both Writing Tasks:\nFor each task, take a few minutes to write down some notes and plan before doing the writing. Write down the overall points of the essay and the corresponding supporting points. Then make a note on the conclusion of the essay.\nRaters are looking for well-organized, accurate essays. Your essay should have one main idea with several points with details.\nBefore you begin, plan how to organize your essay. In general, the essay should follow the following recipe:\nOpening paragraph: Statement of the main idea for the essay, followed by sentences briefly stating the major points that support the main idea. Are you for or against something?\nBody paragraphs: One paragraph for each of the major points stated in the opening paragraph. This repeats the major points for your opinion, followed by supporting details for each point. Why do you have the opinion you do?\nConcluding paragraph summarizing your details and restating your opinion, being careful to AVOID REPEATING statements you made earlier; change the wording.\nIt is very important you provide supporting details for your opinions or choices. Do not just create a simple list.\nUse a variety of grammar and vocabulary for effective expression.\nUse correct grammar, spelling and punctuation.\nDo not use contractions.\nResources for Test Preparation\nThere are many resources available online for preparing yourself to take the TOEFL test. I encourage you to use a variety of resources. In addition, working with an experienced TOEFL teacher can help you receive advice on how to improve your writing skills.\nIf you are looking for more help preparing for the TOEFL exam, I do offer private tutoring for TOEFL preparation. I am a qualified ESL tutor and have successfully coached many English learners. I would also be happy to give you some personal tips on how to prepare for success on this exam.\n"}, {"score": 1153.983, "uuid": "0ea29b80-b1cb-5454-b6e3-be769f9a90b9", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0916wb-36-00953", "target_hostname": "jasonrenshaw.typepad.com", "target_uri": "http://jasonrenshaw.typepad.com/jason_renshaws_web_log/toefl-speaking/", "page_rank": 1.7978716e-09, "spam_rank": 72, "title": "English Raven: <em>TOEFL</em> speaking", "snippet": "has been with preparing students for formal English tests - especially <em>TOEFL</em>, <em>IELTS</em> and TOEIC.", "explanation": null, "document": "A freemium rainbow model for online language education...\nAn increasing number of teachers and developers have been asking me how I 'manage' to teach English online. I have in the past presented various posts related to my approach to online language teaching (for example, Taking your teaching online - what to teach and how to find your students and Introducing my new (kind of) coursebook series... ), and recently on Gavin Dudeney's blog I presented some thoughts on how an online\u00a0freemium model for expert teachers might take shape.\nAlso, on a recent post about three\u00a0kinds of language teacher , I lamented the fact that so many teachers who make it to expert/educator level are inevitably forced out of the classroom or even out of the field altogether. I honestly believe that online teaching presents a new and much more rewarding avenue for those expert teachers, if they can work hard on developing the tech skills required to go it alone and avoid all the 'middle men'\u00a0between learners and teachers who take massive chunks of revenue on the one hand, and control and - to some extent - manipulate access and opportunities on the other.\nFor my part, as someone who has been lucky enough to find a route around the schools and the publishers, I'm pretty keen to share this knowledge and encourage as many great teachers as possible to have a crack at achieving\u00a0freedom, excellence and actual income. Considering the fact that I've also reduced the cost of language education for my online students by the same degree I've actually increased my own personal earnings and satisfaction, I think this is an important win-win scenario worth sharing and developing as widely as possibly. A win-win scenario for the only two participants in this game I really care about: teachers and learners.\nSo, here it is, folks - my fremium rainbow model for online language education. Please note that I said \"a\", not \"the\". It is a model, and hopefully one of many that will emerge and work for teachers and learners online.\nI've presented\u00a0the model in this way because it sort of\u00a0demonstrates a couple of things about the 'layering' involved in a good effective fremium approach, but also the fact that the main mode most teachers automatically assume or aim for in online language teaching (getting on skype and teaching live classes 1-1) is actually - in my experience - the least realistic and sustainable mode for going about it.\nSo, let me attempt to take you through the layers of this rainbow, starting from the bottom and outer (A) and working our way up and inwards to (E).\nA. Free/Exchange\nYes, this is all the free stuff I offer, but to just think of it as \"free\" I think is an unhelpful simplification. It's more of a sort of bartering system in a lot of ways - an exchange that involves dialogue but also\u00a0assistance from both sides of the equation.\nI regularly post video tutorials on YouTube and\u00a0a section of my main website has regularly updated screencasts. I have a free forum (5000 members and counting!) with whole practice tests available, linked to simple to use recording and writing facilities for visitors to practice their speaking and writing skills.\nBut I also visit and contribute to a variety of online forums where\u00a0students go to discuss English or English tests. I maintain a Facebook page where more than a thousand students have gathered to see my resources and recommendations, but also to chat about their experiences or occasional questions they may have.\nAll of these efforts feature links back to my regular pay-for products on a website, but, more importantly (as I discovered quite by accident, actually) they feature my name and - well, me. Basically, this online social media presence has generated a bit of a \"brand\" - and I'm still somewhat surprised that the top search query leading to visits to my main site and pay-for services is actually Jason Renshaw.\nI have literally thousands of students contact me now saying that these materials and tutorials and interactive snippets of advice have helped them improve drastically and even pass really important tests. Realistically, the vast majority of such students never needed all that much additional help to start with, and weren't really in the category who might be characterised as needing or wanting to \"pay\" for some basic help. Strange as it might sound, I actually find it pleasing that I'm not talking independent students who don't need a lot of in-depth or personalised help into paying me for something.\nNow, of course all of these online students are getting this help for free - but by \"free\" I am strictly referring to the concept of money. Looking a little deeper, what becomes apparent is that there is a sort of exchange of goods and services happening here - a \"barter\", if you will.\nWhat I get out of the \"free\" arrangement is an in-depth awareness of the needs and inclinations of online students. I also get \"currency\" in the form of recommendations and links, and the sort of traffic that earns my main sites valuable PageRank and hence invaluable search engine listings. I also earn credibility, by being a real person online who (evidently) knows what he's talking about, can teach things clearly, and really does help students improve. And the somewhat behind the scenes network of personal recommendations and testimonials, while often hard to measure, appears to be incredibly powerful.\nSo the \"free/exchange\" layer reaches very far and basically incorporates a \"give and take\" win-win arrangement. Personally I think it is really important to understand and explore it from that sort of angle (rather than just assuming it's all about giveaways).\nB. Pay/Content access\nBeneath the free/exchange layer, we have my first (and mildest) \"pay for\" level. Basically, this involves giving subscribers access to the entire bank of practice materials and recorded tutorials I've produced, which is much vaster than that offered freely and publicly, but also presented in a much more organised and professional format. The material is constantly being added to or edited to improve it.\nThis caters to two basic sorts of online students: (1) those who have seen all the free/exchange stuff and find it a good indication of what they could get with a basic pay-for subscription, and (2) those who have tried all the free stuff but have come to a decision they need more detail and more information.\nThe subscription fee here is very low. Basically, for the students who used to go out and pay $70+ for a TOEFL preparation book (not all of which they actually needed) can get even more content, more practice tasks, more tutorials (in a variety of formats: text, audio and video) through my online product for between $15 and $30 per month.\nThis, again, is mainly for independent students who can take the content, decide what to draw and learn from it, and incorporate it into their own study plan and learning approach. Based on subscription figures, this is a sector within the online learning population that is increasing rapidly.\nThere is still some regular interaction with these students, usually through the public/free facilities already mentioned above for (A). Hence, it creates a very productive loop between and across the \"free\" and most basic \"pay for\" services. But generally speaking, these subscriptions are for good, comprehensive and well-organised content - not for live interactive teaching.\nC. Pay/Content access + online practice + checking\nOur next layer (the green one, between the \"lighter\" and \"heavier\" colours in our freemium rainbow) offers all the content and material already featured in (B) above, but adds to it the opportunity to record or write a number of responses to the practice tasks, and have these checked by me once per week. This is in the form of quick scores connected to a clear set of scoring rubrics.\nThis is for the students who have tried doing things pretty much all on their own, but figure they need some simple feedback and indications as to their progress. There are less of these subscribers than the \"content access\" ones, but it does appear to attract the people who genuinely need this sort of help. There is also the very real (and I think usually underestimated) appeal of being able to share performances with other students from around the world and learn from each other's examples.\nObviously, as a teacher the amount of time I need to dedicate to this is small per student, but potentially vast across a large number of subscribers. The recording and writing is managed through a simple but asynchronous system that allows me to schedule all of this checking for certain days of the week, maximising my time and efficiency.\nFees are - of course - higher than for the simple content access subscription, but still enormously cheap compared to 1-1 teaching either online or in face to face learning settings. Technology has allowed me to gather and respond to these recordings and submissions in ways that cheat time and distance. Essentially, for what a one hour live 1-1 session would normally cost these learners, they can access and apply 20 times more practice - according to their own time and preferences - across a period of a month.\nAnd in this case, the content and pre-recorded tutorials are now thrown in for free.\nD. Pay/Content access + online practice + personal feedback\nThis is the first of what I usually think of as \"optional extra\" or \"premium\" services. Basically, learners who want it add it on as an extra - at any time - to what they have already subscribed for in (B) or (C) above. They can now choose specific tasks, submit them to me, and get in-depth personalised feedback and suggestions from me. They pay a set (small) fee for each task, but it is limited in scope. Obviously, if they want several tasks checked and given the 'royal treatment' from the teacher, they are going to have to be willing to pay for the time this involves.\nThis service is also asynchronous, but has a quick turnaround time (24-48 hours).\nOnly a small proportion of subscribers decide to buy this kind of service. While price will inevitably be an issue for some, it does appear to me that most of my users figure out that they are already getting everything they need with the subscription layers further out. This targeted and personal service helps students who just can't manage, who really need the extra help, while guaranteeing that I - as a professional at what I know and do - get paid a reasonable fee for the time and attention I am giving to a single student.\nE. Pay/Content access + online practice + personal tutoring through live 1-1 lessons\nThis is the innermost layer in my freemium rainbow. It is the absolute royal treatment, for students who are either (A) fussy and demand 1-1 attention in real time from a teacher, and/or (B) have tried the previous layers and just need some live attention to help hone it all and find out as an individual what they really need to focus on.\nThe proportion of subscribers for this is very small. This reflects - at least to some degree - that many online language learners out there are not willing or able to pay a teacher $35 for an hour's 1-1 class according to a schedule that suits the learner. But it also reflects the fact that, if the outer layers have been effective and have helped students develop sufficiently more or less on their own, most of them don't really need to have a teacher hold their hand through a personal lesson. Such students are also not forking out a premium from the outset to find out that there is a lot of learning and application they can be doing for themselves, on their own.\nAnother positive side effect of only offering this premium service to people who have already subscribed for the access or basic practice layers is that teachers and learners almost never arrive in the live online lesson 'cold' - so to speak. As a teacher, I've already developed some awareness of their performance and learning needs through the basic practice applications. We can start the lesson with a clear roadmap of what it might be better to start focussing on right from the outset.\nOh, and\u00a0let me tell you, managing to keep the number of live 1-1 classes to a minimum is very important for the online teacher out there who still wants to have a life and be able to pay the rent!\nSo there it is, the English Raven Fremium Rainbow model. It's certainly working well for me. It could (perhaps with some adaptions) work really well for you, too.\nAnd the really cool thing?\nThis is just the beginning...\n:-)\n"}], [{"score": 1152.0493, "uuid": "157c6df5-0bfb-5ee3-b442-d47b1644e8f5", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1012wb-09-10920", "target_hostname": "cavedoni.com", "target_uri": "http://cavedoni.com/reading/2008/07/ielts-8.html?showComment=1215797880000", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 83, "title": "Dispatches from Reading: <em>IELTS</em> 8", "snippet": "That was not considered enough though, they really wanted me to provide evidence so <em>I</em> had to <em>take</em> either <em>the</em> <em>TOEFL</em> <em>or</em> <em>IELTS</em> test. <em>I</em> was told by Emanuela (currently attending <em>the</em> MATD) that <em>the</em> <em>IELTS</em> was slightly preferred, so <em>I</em> enrolled for that.", "explanation": null, "document": "at 16:04\nIELTS 8\nAccording to this IELTS form (which is so bad I felt compelled to scribble down some notes on what I think is wrong with it ), I passed the IELTS academic test with a score of 8.

From my perspective, career preparation and life experience are the two main reasons. Academic knowledge and skills development contribute to people's future success. Furthermore, an independent life as a student is a memorable experience.\nAbove all, career preparation is the major goal of almost every student. The fact is that specialized knowledge is essential for people' future jobs. Supposing a person has desire to word in information technology field, he should go to college to acquire specific knowledge on computer, internet, or gadget because passion only is not enough. Moreover, skills improvement is crucially important to job promotion. It is common that students have the opportunity to discuss and work in group so they are likely to ameliorate their teamwork skill. They are often required to demonstrate their ideas before the whole class as well. As a result, students can develop the presenting ability. Without doubt, at college, people are certain to prepare well for their intended jobs.\nIn addition, a life as a student is possibly one of the most memorable experiences to many people. For someone, studying at college means an independent life in another city starts, through which they know how to take care of themselves and meliorate living skills. This makes them a great deal more mature. Furthermore, being a student is interesting. People have more chances to make new friends from various places when they attend college. People have more chances to do what they eager to do when they attend college. It is doubtless that attending college is wonderful.\nIn conclusion, people go to college for two primary reasons, including career preparation and life experience. Knowledge accumulation and skills improvement offer people more opportunities to get a good job while becoming a student with an independent life brings people unforgettable experiences. I think attending college plays an important part in the life of many people\nHoang Van Tho\n"}, {"score": 1139.7283, "uuid": "b02d77f0-8835-512a-b5a6-0b29fb892d60", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1311wb-55-20960", "target_hostname": "www.essayforum.com", "target_uri": "http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/true-function-university-essay-25755/", "page_rank": 1.1781262e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "True Function of A University <em>IELTS</em>-ESSAY", "snippet": "<em>I</em> agree with john ,this structure alway appear at <em>toefl</em> write~ my teacher alway cut my long sentences into several short <em>i</em> hope it can help you ,though <em>I</em> only got 6 last time.. to <em>take</em> a degree that&#x27;s more widely accepted, to gain knowledge and insight into an industry, <em>or</em> simply to deepen their research", "explanation": null, "document": "Posts: 1\nJan\u00a02,\u00a02011,\u00a011:06pm #1\nhi all, im new to the forum and below is my attempt to the second writing task in test 4 in cambridge 7. my test date will be this upcoming saturday so any help is greatly appreciated. could anyone give me some feedback as to the essay structure and so forth? also it will be good if anyone could let me know what sort of marks im looking at for my essay in terms of ielts band score. cheers sweetgoofy\nthe topic is:\nsome people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.\nwhat, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?\nand heres my essay copied n pasted:\nUniversities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.\nA university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.\nOn the other hand, universities and be regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.\nIn conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.\nthx again for your help=P\nsweetgoofy\n"}, {"score": 1137.9684, "uuid": "5a9addf1-1cf7-5479-88e9-275e48e8dd5b", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1800tw-20-14728", "target_hostname": "www.essayforum.com", "target_uri": "http://www.essayforum.com/writing-feedback-3/topic-past-study-only-young-nowadays-changed-39091/", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 70, "title": "<em>IELTS</em> Topic: In <em>the</em> past, study only for <em>the</em> young, nowadays is changed", "snippet": "in <em>the</em> past. agree <em>or</em> not?", "explanation": null, "document": "Posts: 73\nApr\u00a019,\u00a02012,\u00a011:31pm #1\nIn the past people thought that education was only for young people. Now it is believed that education is for a person's whole life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?\nIn recent years, there has been a growing tendency that individuals tend to conduct post-qualification studies continuously. Therefore, many appear to believe that education is no longer the young's privilege. Personally speaking, this is true in today's society.\nAdmittedly, in the past, some given circumstances make people rarely carry out future learnings after the graduation. One possible circumstance is that there is relatively slower growth in both knowledge and technology fields half century ago. In this case, the academic skills which the younger job seekers have acquired from text is sufficiently and satisfactorily for them to achieve the general practices in the workplace. Secondly, in the past, the labor force was crucial for families who have suffered the economic hardship in many poverty regions. As a result, minors have to bear the household burdens such as making money for their families to acquire food, shelter and medicine soon after they have completed their studies at school.\nHowever, in the modern society, conducting a series further studies after university is always a necessity. Firstly, it enhances juniors' survival ability in today's competitive labour market. This is because the new information and knowledge are frequently updated and released nowadays. In order to obtain a sense of security of their career perspectives, the academic knowledge bases should be checked and renewed regularly by an ongoing study. Moreover, undertaking a series of post-qualification learning and training develops the employees' confidence in their area of expertise.

You can listen by clicking here .\nTOEFL or Test of English as a Foreign Language\nETS is a company which develops tests. This is big business as millions of people around the world take these tests. ETS describes itself as having set the standard for English testing since 1964 when it created TOEFL which ETS claims to be accurate, reliable and fair. Universities have, in fact, found TOEFL to be very unreliable and inaccurate. As a result TOEFL has now come up with a new version to try to get closer to their stated goal of being accurate, reliable and fair.\nTraditionally TOEFL and TOEIC and other similar tests have relied on multiple choice, fill in the blank and similar gimmicky ways of testing people\u2019s language skills, because such tests are easy to mark. Unfortunately these methods create problems as test takers focus on the technique of doing these tests rather than on the language skills themselves.\nThe new TOEFL tests keeps some of these gimmicky features but puts more importance on what they call integrated skills, the ability to read and listen and then express oneself in writing or speaking, in other words old fashioned written and oral expression. (So who needs TOEFL then?)\nIn the new TOEFL, questions are either on a general (\u201cfamiliar\u201d) subject or on an academic subject. Test takers typically have to read or listen and then answer questions, either of the multiple choice/fill in the blank type or in the form of oral or written expression. The oral or written expression can be an answer to a specific question or a summary of some content that the test taker has been asked to read or listen to.\nIn the test of writing, the test taker has 30 minutes to write an independent text of a minimum of 300 words. I would imagine that there is no advantage in writing any more than the minimum, but rather it is best to be clear, accurate and well-organized in a short and effective answer. In the case of a summary or response to reading and listening, the test taker has 20 minutes to write 150-225 words.\nFor the speaking or oral response section, the test taker has 15 seconds to prepare an answer and then must speak for 45 seconds. In the case of a read/listen/respond type of question the test taker has 45 seconds to read 100 words, then listens to a short lecture and then has 30 seconds to prepare a response of 60 seconds in length.\nThe oral and written expression by the test taker is marked based on whether it is clear, accurate and well-organized. Obviously to mark this kind of question is more time consuming and more subjective than computer based correction of multiple choice type questions. It is also more meaningful, more accurate and more reliable.\nIn my view the new TOEFL test with its belated greater emphasis on actually speaking and writing will be better than the previous test. However, the test is still unfair. Why should an economics student be asked to answer questions on biology or vice versa? One of our principles at The Linguist is meaningful content. If learners choose content of interest to them, they will not only understand it better, they will improve their language skills better. If they write or speak on subjects that are familiar or interesting they will do a much better job. Test takers should really only be tested on their ability to express themselves about things that matter to them. The TOEFL test remains artificial, like so much of what happens in language classes.\nIdeally one day this general kind of universal test will be replaced by a customized measurement of the language competence of each individual, and in a variety of languages. This is what we are preparing in the new version of The Linguist. An ongoing record of a learner\u2019s language activity, vocabulary range, samples of written and oral expression (done the same way as in the new TOEFL test) can be accumulated on each learner\u2019s personal portfolio. Each learner will be able to edit his or her own portfolio and then allow a potential employer, educational institution or other organization to view it. This way each person can be evaluated based on what he or she is able to do in a language and that can be compared to the requirements of a job or school. Nowadays when so many native English speakers have trouble expressing themselves in their own language, such a portfolio could include one\u2019s native language as well as other languages.\nIn the meantime, given the fact that it is impossible to know what kind of \u201cfamiliar\u201d subject or academic subject will be covered in the new TOEFL, the best way to prepare remains massive input. Massive input through reading and listening to a lot of content, combined with a systematic way of acquiring words and phrases is always the best way to build up language competence. This language competence needs to be built up gradually and then tested regularly in writing and speaking with corrective feedback from a tutor.\nGood students will supplement this with broad based activities in English including reading, watching films, meeting with English speaking friends etc. However, at the core of all of these activities there should be an integrated learning environment and community of learners and tutors to encourage, stimulate, provide feedback and measure progress.\u00a0 These are the elements that we seek to provide at The Linguist.\n"}, {"score": 1109.3959, "uuid": "ca9e232b-8493-5c10-bf1f-31e1091f2170", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-1205wb-26-05783", "target_hostname": "www.jamboreeindia.com", "target_uri": "http://www.jamboreeindia.com/feedback.asp?foo=bar&page=6", "page_rank": 1.2021005e-09, "spam_rank": 85, "title": "GRE\u00ae| GMAT\u0099| SAT\u00ae|<em>TOEFL</em>\u00ae and <em>IELTS</em> Preparation| Study Outside India| Study", "snippet": "It was almost like second home and <em>I</em> <em>should</em> say jamboree is one of <em>the</em> finest instituitions <em>I</em> have been part of. <em>I</em> had access to <em>the</em> finest faculty and <em>the</em> latest study material.

Thank you so much.............\nKESHAV MALHOTRA\nGMATScore:\u00a0760\nI took my GMAT exam last month and score 760(51/40). Even after putting in months of strenuous preparation, I cannot take credit for the score completely. And therefore, acknowledge the contribution of the people at Jamboree in giving my efforts a shape and direction. Firstly, I would like to sincerely thanks maths faculty for his constant support and guidance. The Discussion Sessions were a boon. I could not have managed a 51 in Quant without this. I would also like to thank verbal faculty for the invaluable advice she gave to me time and again. I needed to better my verbal skills for the GMAT from the very beginning, and counseling from verbal faculty helped me in achieving my target. Finally, at Jamboree, one has access to its humungous literature and preparatory resources. Coupled with this are support and guidance of the CAT faculty. Preparing for the GMAT can get no simpler that this. Plus the library at Jamboree NFC is a very good option for those who wish to study unperturbed during the day. In sum, for anyone who wishes to achieve a 700+ on the GMAT, Jamboree should be on top of the To-Do list.\nJYOTHI PRAKASH\nGMATScore:\u00a0770\nBut for Jamboree, I would probably not have turned in such a good performance. To be frank, the jamboree experience has been an eye opener (Before joining Jamboree, I was aiming for a score of 700-720.). The course material and topics covered during the classroom sessions were extremely helpful.( Not only were the sessions so interesting and informative, but also there was a distinct personal touch to the whole experience)\nRAFAT JAHAN SIDDIQUE\nGMATScore:\u00a0710\n\" Jamboree to me has been more than a coaching institute, for the 3 months of my rigorous prepration, Jamboree actually became like my family. One of the reason why I truly feel that Jamboree is best in the industry is the unique faculty. Their friendly appproach of teaching and their enthusiasm is what makes one feel at ease and strike a bond with them right from the first class.On one hand we have verbal faculty, who not only solves your verbal problems at any time of the day but also comes up with the best solutions to your problems in general, be it studies, work or anything for that matter, on the other hand is maths faculty whose \"Line of Thought\" inspired me so much that for the first time I dared to think beyond formulas and solve each question in math with Logic. And cant forget CAT faculty, who after a bad score was always there to tell me that .... it's okay next test will be fine ... this one is tough :-). Needless to say that it is the experience that Jamboree has in churning great scores in GMAT/GRE that makes them best in the industry, their content, their guidelines, their faculty and their values - sets them apart in the industry. I truly owe my success to Jamboree and would recommend it to any one who is thinking for pursuing their education the GMAT way.\nNITIN VERMA\nGMATScore:\u00a0690\nI started preparing for GMAT when I joined Jamboree Gurgaon. I took classes for Verbal and I was really impressed with the organisation of the course and the manner in which it was conducted. The faculty was always there to help me out. The computer lab provided the real GMAT testing centre environment. The guidance which I received from everyone and the friendly atmosphere at the center helped a great deal during my preparation..\nASHISH MANCHANDA\nGMATScore:\u00a0700\n\"Jamboree played an important part in my preparation for GMAT. The verbal classes helped me quite a lot in various facets of the verbal test. The quant classes helped me in identifying my mistakes and eradicating them. The additional practice material is good and contains representative GMAT questions. \"\nKAPIL TEWARI\nGMATScore:\u00a0700\nIn my case I was out of touch with studies for 6 years, Jamboree classes brought me into rythm again and gave a peer group to study with....\nKUNJAL PATEL\nGMATScore:\u00a0710\nJamboree has a highly enthusiastic faculty and a very supportive staff. The institute gave me a much personalised coaching and helped me achieve a good score. The institute covers the subjects in depth and makes sure that the students achieve what they are there for. I would very genuinely recommend the institute to anyone who has set high targets for himself in life.\nMOHIT MALHOTRA\nGMATScore:\u00a0710\nI have spent quite some time in jamboree for my preparation.

I have had the the best preparation ever..JAMBOREE ROCKS!!!\nGAUTAM GARG\nGMATScore:\u00a0710\nThe Test Series was quite helpful and helped me prepare better for the GMAT. Couple of reasons why I liked test series: By scheduling classes/ doubt sessions on weekends, it gave time for me to study during the week and then get inputs on weekends. The teachers were quite knowledgeable, helpful and more then willing to extend support when required. The amount of practice tests available helped me provide exact environment and prepared me mentally for the exam.

It is a standardized English proficiency test for speakers of English as a Second Language. The TOEFL test is used by North American universities and colleges to determine a candidate\u2019s English proficiency level. For full details and up-to-date information on TOEFL, please visit:\u00c2 http://www.ets.org/toefl\nWho should take the TOEFL Test?\nAlmost all universities and colleges in North America use the TOEFL test to determine if foreign students are eligible to study at their institution. Many businesses and government agencies also use the test as proof of English ability. TOEFL has, therefore, become one of the most recognized standardized English tests in the world. Anyone whose current or future education plan includes studying in an English speaking university or college should write the TOEFL test.\nCan I prepare for the TOEFL Test at your school?\nYes.\u00c2\u00a0The TOEFL preparation course is offered full-time all year round and part-time on select dates.\u00c2\u00a0For complete details, please visit us at:\u00c2 http://www.sol-group.net/languagecourses/toefl.php\nHow much time will I need to prepare for the test?\nThe need for a high score on the TOEFL test is universal. Undergraduate programs require an iBT score from 80-100 and graduate courses require a minimum iBT score from 90-100 or higher. These high scores can seem difficult to attain, however, one of the best ways to improve your score is to set aside a certain amount of study time. TOEFL is NOT a test that you can write without preparation.\nThe average length of study for a TOEFL course is 2 months. Many students take a preparation course for two months and then work on their own for the last month before the test. Candidates who combine class time with self-study obtain significantly higher scores.\nCan I write the TOEFL test at your school?\nNo.\u00c2\u00a0International House Toronto is not a recognized TOEFL test centre.\u00c2\u00a0For information on test dates and prices, please visit: http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/TOEFL/tclists/IBT_a.html .\nWhat is the deadline for registering for the TOEFL Preparation Course?\nStudents can register at any time.\u00c2\u00a0 It is recommended that registration take place a minimum of one week in advance of the start date, in order to ensure that a space is reserved for you.\nWhere can I get the course outline and syllabus?\nAll students will receive both a course outline and syllabus on their first day of class.\nWill materials be provided for me?\nYes.\u00c2\u00a0Your Registration fee includes the use of the course book (in class only), all course handouts and mock exams.\nCan I purchase the course book?\nYes. Gently used course books are available for sale to students at a discounted rate or at the regular retail rate for new books.\nIs there a minimum level requirement to enrol for the Preparation Course?\nYes.\u00c2\u00a0We highly recommend that students score a minimum level 5 on our online test.\u00c2\u00a0To take the online test, please visit us at:\u00c2 http://www.sol-group.net/test/ .\nCan I still enrol in the Preparation Course if I do not meet the minimum level requirement?\nYes.\u00c2\u00a0However, please note that our minimum start level recommendation is 5.\u00c2\u00a0Students starting at a lower level may not achieve their desired score on the exam.\u00c2\u00a0 We encourage you to register for our general English language programs, prior to enrolling in the TOEFL preparation class, until the recommended level is achieved.\nWill I receive a certificate?\nYes.\u00c2\u00a0Once you have completed the preparation course, you will be awarded the Sol Schools International House certificate.\u00c2\u00a0For information on the TOEFL exam scores reporting, please visit:\u00c2 http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/scores/\n*Prices are subject to change without prior notice.\nFran\u00e7ais Deutsch \u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e \u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4 T\u00fcrk\u00e7e\nInternational House Sol Group, Head Office: 469 Jarvis Street, Toronto, Ontario, M4Y 2G8, Canada\n"}, {"score": 1095.8962, "uuid": "1ae5eb9f-9fff-5a3f-a8fe-c48f292bee2e", "index": "cw12", "trec_id": "clueweb12-0402wb-10-12480", "target_hostname": "www.achieverspoint.com", "target_uri": "http://www.achieverspoint.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=113&sid=57e495a8396f81967f384fd5a5832ec6", "page_rank": 1.1700305e-09, "spam_rank": 91, "title": "AchieversPoint.com \u2022 View topic - General Tips for <em>IELTS</em>", "snippet": "Then read <em>the</em> online resources <em>I</em> have suggested.

These strategies are concerned with how you approach the language, how you use the language, and how certain tests are usually constructed. Below you will find some of the most important of these specific skills.\nDo not translate from your mother tongue!!!\nProbably the most common mistake. Remember that your abilities in your first language are much more advanced than your English - even if you are Proficiency level. The fine points learned from growing up in a given language are very different from those in English. Keep to what you know in English and don't translate. Your results will immediately improve.\nDon't block when listening\nIf you don't understand a spoken dialogue on a listening section of an exam, do not worry about it. Blocking is rather common because when you don't understand something spoken your mind tends to get involved in an inner dialogue; What did he say? I didn't understand that word! etc. This inner dialogue causes you to concentrate on what is going on your mind, and you miss out on what is happening in the conversation. Be very careful. It is important to train yourself to stay relaxed in this situation (easer said than done!). Most tests repeat the listening at least twice and the information itself is often repeated in a number of different ways. Trust the creators of the test to give you ample opportunity to answer correctly.\nLimit yourself to what you know\nStudents will often get stuck when trying to find one particular word that they can't remember. If you can't remember the word, use a similar word or another word altogether. Remember the test is about the ability to use English - not about telling the truth!\nLook for time signifiers when having to conjugate\nThe most important thing to identify first in any sentence is the time word or phrase - this tells us when something happens and the conjugation will be based on this fact. This is very important because it helps you limit possibilities. It is much easier to conjugate if you know the tense should be in the past because of a time expression than if you look at a verb and think about all the different possibilities! This is another commonly overlooked strategy that people don't use when they feel under pressure taking an English test.\nThrow out the ridiculous answers in a multiple choice question\nMany tests (TOEFL, CAE, First Certificate, Proficiency) often include one or two completely ridiculous possibilities in any multiple choice question. Find these first and get rid if them. This will usually leave you with a choice between two. Your odds will have already increased to 50%!\nUse the rest of the test as an information and vocabulary resource\nI stated this on the first page, but I would like to repeat this point. By looking at other exercises focusing on different points, you will often find the answer or information needed that can help you make a decision about a different exercise.\nDon't try to be too funny or clever\nOften students try to be funny or clever to relieve the tension. Humor is a very subtle thing and something that might seem funny to you in your own language might sound very strange in English. While a certain amount of humor is fine, trying to be too funny can distract you - and other students if you are taking an oral examination in pairs!\nSpecific Strategies for Specific Exercises\n"}]]}
